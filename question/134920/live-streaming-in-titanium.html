			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am developing an application that will stream video captured from the device camera.<br>This will be a live streaming application.</p>
<p>Did any of you already developed this kind of application in Titanium ???</p>
<p>I have some experience in Flash&#x2F;Flex&#x2F;Adobe AIR but as far as Apple do not allow Flash<br>in mobile browsers, specifically safari, I was wondering if a WebView in a Titanium<br>application could embed actionscript so that I could work with RTMP or RTMFP.</p>
<p>Do you think this can work ???</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

							<p>I have developed an application that goes the other way, stream live video to the application, but most of that legwork lies on the server.</p>
<p>Based on the API reference I am not sure if this is possible with Titanium.<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;latest&#x2F;Titanium.Media-module</p>
<p>Doing something through a webview would not be the approach I would take. </p>
<p>Chances are you are going to have to input the video, stream the data in to a tcp socket to a server and rebroadcast or store at that point.</p>
<p>Once Titanium has the ability to do this I plan on implementing this.</p>
