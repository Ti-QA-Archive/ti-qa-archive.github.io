			<h1>iPad simulator opening app as iPhone app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all</p>
<p>This is probably pretty basic stuff, but what setting makes the iPad simulator treat your app as an iPhone app?</p>
<p>My app is for the iPad but when I launch it in the iPad simulator it shows up as an iPhone app (meaning it doesn&#39;t fill the screen but is displayed with iPhone resolution and scaled down)</p>

							<p>Hi Martin</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the &quot;Project Explorer&quot; - should be on the left side of the Studio window.</li>
<li>Expand your project with the grey arrow.</li>
<li>Look for the file <strong>tiapp.xml</strong></li>
<li>Double click it</li>
<li>On this new screen find <strong>deployment type</strong> (bottom left)</li>
<li>Change the iPhone tick to iPad tick (or have both if you want a universal app.</li>
<li>Save using the toolbar or file menu</li>
<li>Close the tab it appeared in.</li>
<li>[I would do this step but might not be needed] Project Menu &gt; Clean (this option is your friend)</li>
<li>Re-run in the simulator.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you created the app you will have been asked which platforms you were targeting, or you may have missed that if if you skipped the last steps.  But easily changed.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your answerr Obviously I should have noted that I have checked iPad on and iPhone off in tiapp.xml, but it doesn&#39;t seem to work. I can&#39;t clean my solution for some reason (the option is grayed out) - but I have tried deleting the entire build folder and rebuilding, but the iPad simulator still interprets the app as an iPhone app. The project is an Android project that I&#39;m trying to port for iOS, so it&#39;s a &quot;freshly&quot; imported project.</p>

										<p><p>There is nothing wrong with &quot;tiapi.xml&quot; file, I have just swapped it out in a test app of my own and it works.</p>
<p>A couple of other things to try.</p>
<p><strong>One</strong></p>
<p>You said you were not able to &quot;clean&quot; as the option was &quot;greyed out&quot;.  To make sure this is not a visual quirk, please try the following;</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the project in the left side bar, ideally the app name</li>
<li>Use the menu Project &gt; Clean, then click either</li>
<li>&quot;clean all projects&quot;<br>or</li>
<li>&quot;clean projects selected below&quot; - and then choose the specific project</li>
<li>Click OK</li>
</ul>
<p>If you cannot see any one of these steps - tell me which.</p>
<p><strong>two</strong></p>
<p>In the simulator</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to the home screen of the simulator</li>
<li>Find you the screen your app is on</li>
<li>Press and hold the left mouse button over the icon</li>
<li>Click the delete option as you would have done on an actual phone</li>
<li>Try re-compiling</li>
</ul>
<p>Do one or better both of these. Then let me know what happens.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Malcolm</p>
<p>Thanks for all your help, it&#39;s appreciated. </p>
<p>First of all, it seems all my problems are related to little bit of &quot;copy-paste trigger happiness&quot;, where project files, settings files, manifest files etc are copied from one project to another. Apparently that&#39;s not the intended way of dealing with projects in Titanium.</p>
<p>So we created a new project, copied only the resources to that project and verified that it worked as intended - then we started looking in files (with hidden files shown) and compared the two.</p>
<p>The clean problem was solved by editing buildspecs in the .project file. But the folowing clean did not solve the target problem, it was still opening the iPhone wersion in the iPad simulator.</p>
<p>We located the problem in the manifest file, where the target was set to mobile. </p>
<p>I don&#39;t understand why these files that &quot;tie everything together&quot; don&#39;t get updated on the cleaning operation or in the target case when you save the tiapp.xml file? But I guess that would be related to the app guid references that may get screwed up when copying certain files from one project to another?</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

										<p><p>Excellent you have it solved.</p>
<p>Mark your question as answered so others can benefit in the future what what you learnt - as we only ever have to solve this sort of problem when we have 5 minutes to launch the app :)</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m having the same problem and it&#39;s driving me nuts! I only have the iPad deployment target selected, I&#39;ve removed the iphone orientations from tiapp.xml and the following happens when I run the simulator:<br>a) First of all the simulator is not an iPad shell (it is a plain window with scrollbars)<br>b) The splash screen is displayed properly and in fullscreen, as you would expect with a native iPad app<br>c) The main window, after the splash screen is rendered as a small iphone view, with the 1x&#x2F;2x button to the bottom right.<br>How weird is that???</p>

							<p>I&#39;having same problem. It is caused by SDK versión with last Titanium Studio 3.0.1. If I compile with SDK 3.0 run on simulator OK in Ipad. With SDK 2.1.3.  run always in IPhone.<br>But I can&#39;t use SDK 3.0 because certificates with accents are interpreted wrong. See post: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;145791&#x2F;install-to-ios-device-problem-please-specify-a-certificate">Install to iOS device problem, Please specify a Certificate</a></p>
