			<h1>File size after compilation / distribution</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,<br>I&#39;ve just compiled a simple Android app for distributing (so I could test it on my device).<br>My program didn&#39;t contain much (no resource file either) and I noticed that the file size received is 1.7MB.<br>I had some who developed something for me for Android that contained a lot more code and did a lot more then the simple program I wrote, and he did it with &quot;native&quot; code (using java + eclipse), and his file size was 170kb.</p>
<p>I was wondering why the file size is so big in comparison? my guess is because it includes all the Titanium SDK.<br>Second, is there a way to make it smaller?<br>And, does it causes any limits on performance?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

							<p>This is normal and your guess is right (AFAIK, not all sdk is included, but only the APIs your app needs). I think there is no way to do it smaller.</p>
<p>About performance limitation, file size is not a performance limitation by itself. Titanium is not a platform for real time signal processing and things like but, appart of this, the performance limitations you can find woking with Titanium are very specific (and probably will disappear with next hardware generations).</p>

							<p>Thanks for the reply.<br>What do you mean by &quot;real time signal processing and things like&quot;?<br>can you give examples to the kind of applications that it wouldn&#39;t be suited for (so I can better know if my app is in such category)?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Note that you can find native features that are not implemented in Titanium. For example, iOs CoreMidi is not available on Titanium (by now), but the 99% apps from iTunes does not require this API. This is what I mean with &quot;specific limitations&quot;. And all these limitations could be implemented with native modules.</p>
