			<h1>[2.1.2.GA / iOS6] Cant deploy</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Studio version: 2.1.2.GA<br>Xcode version: 4.5</p>
<p>I submitted my app last week the day apple released iOS6. I had only tested on iOS5. Of course they rejected my app because it crashed on iOS6. The reason was the empty text on a label which I saw later was documented in 2.1.2.GA release notes.</p>
<p>Once I corrected that, I tried to install the app on my iPhone but I have a missing app error as documented in the release notes and that <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;142463&#x2F;212ga--ios6-cant-deploy-app-after-fixing-an-ios6-issue#answer-247634">post</a>. I inserted the min-ios-version tag in my tiapp.xml. When building I can see min version is 4.3 so my modification is taken into account. However I still have the issue. I cleaned several times, closed and reopened studio but still have the issue.</p>
<p>I also tried to install 2.1.3 as documented <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2012&#x2F;09&#x2F;titanium-sdk-2-1-3-rc-is-released-support-for-ios-6.html">there</a> but I got an error.</p>
<p>Am I missing something? Thank you for any help.</p>

							<div><p>Ok I noticed that the release notes are for 2.1.3.RC!!<br>So first I have to install it. However, as said above it fails. BUT I noticed on project properties that I had 2.1.3.GA installed. I tried to switch to it but the builder still uses 2.1.2.GA.</p>
<p>By the way, what is the difference between 2.1.3.RC and 2.1.3.GA?</p>
