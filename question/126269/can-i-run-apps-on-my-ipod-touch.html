										<p><p>I&#39;ve signed up with the ios developer program and installed xcode. I can run apps on my ipod through xcode. But when i try to run one of my appcelerator projects on my ipod a screen pops up saying:  Please add a provisioning profile. And i have already created one for xcode so i don&#39;t understand?</p>

							<p>Have you added your iPod to your provisioning profile on the apple developer site?</p>
<p>Have you connected your iPod to iTunes and dragged the downloaded provisioning file onto iTunes to add it to the device?</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ve managed to run apps now on my iPod touch. But there are still some minor issues. First i downloaded iTunes as you mentioned, i didn&#39;t know this was an essential part of the process(i have it on my other computer). Then i uploaded the provisioning file that i had already created for xcode to the titanium pop-up screen. But it keeps on asking me this everytime i want to run an app. The other option is to create a privioning profile online but i have that already. An other funny things is that during the installation process of the app it ask for permission with this message :codesign want to sign a key?</p>
