			<h1>Dashboard Allowed for iPhone?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m putting the finishing touches on my first app that&#39;ll be released on the iPhone first then Android. So I&#39;ve started comparing my app with Apple&#39;s guidelines on what they look for when reviewing an app. My app passes all points (from what I can tell), except one possibility, this one:</p>
<p><code>10.4 Apps that create alternate desktop&amp;#x2F;home screen environments or simulate multi-app widget experiences will be rejected</code></p>
<p>To make things nice and organized I used a dashboard setup to launch each feature of the app. Each feature is related to the same industry; so for example the News feature only has news related to the industry and the Calculator feature only has calculators related to the industry. So it&#39;s not like each feature is different from one another, but rather they all complement each other. In testing all testers loved how easy it was to switch between each feature, but because of the rule above I&#39;m worried that the app will be rejected.</p>
<p>Many apps on the App Store use Dashboard setups to launch their different features (ex. Applets, uAlberta, GameBox), but do those slip through the cracks or is using a dashboard setup acceptable in certain instances?</p>

							<p>If the dashboardView was not supported by Apple, Appcelerator would not have even implemented it into Titanium SDK.</p>
<p>So yes… It&#39;s allowed. By that law, I&#39;m guessing they meant subbing it in for the actual iOS dashboard or something like that. But yah, dashboards are allowed. Facebooks official app did it, so can you! :P</p>

							<p>I use it already for about 5 month, with no problems!</p>
<p>I only know that the icon wiggle-feature (edit mode) could be a problem cause it is copyrighted by apple and maybe one would need permission to use it… </p>

							<p>If anyone else runs into this question, Apple does allow the Dashboard. They approved my app and all updates.</p>

							<p>I was just rejected by apple for using the dashboard and here was there reasoning. So apparently you can&#39;t use rounded icons in the dashboard, trying to get clarification. They rejected it by just looking at one of teh screenshots I uploaded and didn&#39;t even bother testing the app.</p>
<p>8.3: Apps which appear confusingly similar to an existing Apple product or advertising theme will be rejected</p>
<p>We found that your app includes a feature, or features, that mimic an iOS interface or behavior, which is not in compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines.</p>
<p>Your app and&#x2F;or application description contains icons with rounded corners that look similar to iOS springboard icons. We&#39;ve included screenshots to help identify the feature&#x2F;s in question.</p>
<p>It would be appropriate to remove or revise these features to make them distinctly different from the iOS behaviors and interfaces to avoid causing user confusion. While the guideline specifies iPod interfaces, the spirit of the guideline includes all iOS interfaces and behaviors.</p>
