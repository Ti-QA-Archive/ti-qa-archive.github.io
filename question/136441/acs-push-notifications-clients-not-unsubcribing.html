			<h1>ACS Push Notifications Clients Not Unsubcribing</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>When my application&#x2F;user subscribes to a push channel I see it show up under the push notification clients but if the user logs out before unsubscribing from the channel the subscription remains.  The Application&#x2F;User can subscribe to the same channel again and receive notifications without any problems but the previous subscriptions do not go away. The only way to remove the subscription that I can see is to delete and re-add the user.  This would not be a big problem but it looks like the notifications are still trying to be delivered to all subscriptions or at least the usage indicates that they are which is how the cost for ACS is going to be calculated. </p>
<p>Is there anyway to check which channels a user is subscribed to and remove the multiple subscriptions to the same channel?</p>

							<p>I&#39;m not sure if I understand it, why calling unsubscribe not working for you? Is it because the user has already logged out? Currently there is no way to look up channels a user subscribes to but we will add this method soon</p>

										<p><p>I can unsubscribe when I&#39;m still logged in with no problem, but if I log out and close the application while I&#39;m still subscribed and then log in after reopening the application the unsubscribe says it is successful but still shows up in the subscribed client count.</p>

										<p><p>I have narrowed it down a bit. I see every time that my application starts, a new Device Token is retrieved instead of the previously issued token. Since the subscribe channel is tied to the token, I can&#39;t unsubscribe from a channel without the previous token.  The Cloud documentation says that once device token is successfully acquired, it will be stored on the device&#39;s local storage and it is safe to request device token multiple times if necessary.</p>

										<p><p>Did you use an emulator or an Android Pad without SIM card? For the device token generating, we will use IMEI to generate an unique token. But if there is no IMEI existed in device, we have to generate token differently.</p>
<p>But, after retrieving one token from server, we will save it in Android local storage. Unless you uninstall your app, or clean up user data, it will return the same token every time. Please check your situation and feedback to me.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m testing with the emulator and two Android Pads.  On the emulator I can run the App login and subscribe and close the App, when I reopen the App without a clean or uninstall it retreives a new Token every time. On my Android XOOM Tablet which only has WiFi, it behaves the exact same way. </p>
<p>With your new information, I just retested with my Android Pantech Tablet, which has WiFi and Cellular it is working correctly.  I closed and reopened the App several times and it is retaining the original token.  So that narrows it down a little more. </p>
<p> I have another open question ( <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;136442&#x2F;android-does-not-receive-push-notifications-until-wifi-is-disabled-and-re-enabled">Here</a>) in which I have to disable and re-enable the WiFi&#x2F;Network on the emulator and the XOOM in order to receive push notification.  I do not have either of these problems with the Pantech. </p>
<p>Is there anyway I can troubleshoot the token generation on non cellular devices?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
