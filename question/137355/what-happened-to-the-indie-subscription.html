			<h1>What happened to the Indie subscription?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello, does anyone knows what happened with the Indie subscription? It has apparently disappeared from the sales plans … Have I missed a communication on this?<br>I would like to use one of the modules available under Indie (Urban Airship), but I&#39;m worried it won&#39;t be supported on the new plans, or will be an additional charge …<br>Anyone has more info on these billing changes?<br>Thanks!</p>

							<p>Jean-Christophe,</p>
<p>The Indie subscription is no longer offered. As an Indie subscriber you have the following options:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Maintain Indie subscription: You keep the &quot;indie&quot; module entitlements and also get access to the free level of ACS and Analytics. If you takes no action and your info on file is accurate, the Indie subscription will automatically be renewed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cancel Indie Subscription: If you cancel the Indie subscription, you cannot purchase it again and you lose the Indie module entitlements. In your case, that means that you would have to purchase the urban airship module.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope that addresses your question. We are working on a post explaining the migration plan and the various options for existing subscribers. Please let me know if you have any further questions</p>

							<p>An indirect answer, but you might look at getting <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;listing?1016737691&amp;q=urban">UrbanAirship outside of a subscription</a> for a lower price</p>

							<p>This is not an official answer, as I too am an Indie user.  At the end of a webinar 5 weeks ago introducing 2.0, a question was asked about the lack of Indie in the new license plans.  The answer given was that current Indie subscribers would have the ability to renew under their current terms, but Indie would no longer be offered for new subscriptions.</p>
<p>Mine is coming up for renewal very soon, and I have emailed Sales to get a clarification but am still waiting on a response.</p>
<p>Hopefully someone from Appcelerator will jump in here and give an official answer…</p>

										<p><p>My indie came up for renewal on the 19th and it was processed okay, so seems like that info is still accurate. :)</p>

										<p><p>And I have heard back from Customer Service, saying my renewal will be processed on my anniversary date.  So existing Indie subscribers can keep their plan.  In fact, at least if your billing information is on file and accurate, I think that will be automatic unless you notify them to NOT renew.</p>

							<p>Does anyone has  pointer? I cannot find the information about my Indie account anymore after I&#39;ve logged in. This gives me an uncomfortable feeling since it is not the 1st time ..</p>
