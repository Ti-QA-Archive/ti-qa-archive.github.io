			<h1>YouTube API v3 - error hell</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I would like to let a list of current videos on my client&#39;s YouTube page. This should be simple, and indeed under the YouTube 2 API v2 was - now Google has taken over it&#39;s like jumping through an enormous number of hoops to do the simplest thing.</p>
<p>I have signed up as a &#39;Google Developer&#39; (oh my) - I have registered my iOS app&#39;s bundle ID - I have an API key. But any call using the Appcelerator HTTPClient just returns an HTTP error (no other info as to what kind of error). There&#39;s nothing wrong with the HTTPClient as any other GET request works just fine.</p>
<p>Now, surely it should be possible to make a call to what is a public facing page without API keys and authentication? All the code samples seem to assume the app will be accessing the device user&#39;s YouTube account, not a public TV station&#39;s YouTube page that anybody can see. And indeed Public API access is described by Google as: &#39;Use of this key does not require any user action or consent, does not grant access to any account information, and is not used for authorization.&#39;</p>
<p>An example of a call might be: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.googleapis.com&#x2F;youtube&#x2F;v3&#x2F;channels?part=snippet&amp;forUsername=[my client name here]&amp;key=[my API key here]</p>
<p>Interestingly if I enter the same URL into a browser I get an error message about there being a &#39;per-IP or per-Referer restriction configured on your API key and the request does not match these restrictions.&#39; Which I assume is that my API key is app specific and the browser of course doesn&#39;t match it. So I am left with trying this within the app and as we know from the above we land in error hell.</p>
<p>Can anybody give me some guidance please?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>MacOS X 10.10.2 Titanium SDK version 3.5.1.GA</p>

										<p><p>Hello Kosso - that works, but it&#39;s API v2 which is about to be deprecated. It&#39;s v3 I really need to get working so it&#39;s future proof.</p>

										<p><p>OK. Looks like it&#39;s not as straight forward as before (but still easy) and needs two requests. </p>
<p>See <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;22616491&#x2F;600628">this</a> answer. </p>
<p>So, to get a list of a user&#39;s uploads to Youtube, first find out the &#39;playlist id&#39; for the uploads:</p>
<p>eg: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.googleapis.com&#x2F;youtube&#x2F;v3&#x2F;channels?part=contentDetails&amp;forUsername=[THE_YOUTUBE_USERNAME]&amp;key=[YOU_API_KEY]</p>
<p>In the data returned, you&#39;ll see the value of <code>items.contentDetails.uploads</code> That&#39;s the playlist ID. </p>
<p>So, you can now get the list by using : </p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.googleapis.com&#x2F;youtube&#x2F;v3&#x2F;playlistItems?part=snippet&amp;playlistId=[THE_PLAYLIST_ID]&amp;key=[YOUR_KEY]</p>
<p>Hope this helps.<br>Cheers!<br>K</p>

										<p><p>btw: You mentioned your iOS app bundle ID. You don&#39;t need to use that sort of API key. On the Google Dev console you can just generate one for web use.</p>

										<p><p>According to here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.google.com&#x2F;youtube&#x2F;v3&#x2F;<br>To use the v3 YouTube API in an iOS app you have to register that app in the Google Developers Console, which I have. And doing so generates an API key. That&#39;s what I am using. But, as in my original question above, all I get from the Appcelerator HTTPClient is  &#39;HTTP error&#39;.</p>
<p>Since my last test I have got the YouTube API request I require working in their &#39;APIs Explorer&#39;, so I know the URL is good and that sticking my API on the end should now work in my app - but it doesn&#39;t. I&#39;ve also tested the HTTPClient with another &#39;https&#39; address just in case it&#39;s something to do with that - and that test did not produce an error, so I can&#39;t see any reason why a YouTube GET request shouldn&#39;t work. Yet it still doesn&#39;t in the Simulator nor on a device.</p>

										<p><p>Further reading suggest (as Kosso says above) that this <em>may</em> work with a web key rather than an iOS one. So I generated a web key and but still not able to get any data coming through. Looking further at the error thrown by the Ti HTTPClient its a 403 Forbidden. So the question now is why I am I forbidden? Is it for instance to do with not being signed up to Google Cloud? Does one need to do that?</p>

										<p><p>OK - for those tracking this issue - there is apparently a known (but not by me!) issue with using an IOS bundle id when making up your YouTube API &#39;Credentials&#39; in the Developer Console and, despite these being a place to put in your bundle id, apparently if you do making a request from within an app won&#39;t work (it didn&#39;t)!!</p>
<p>I found this here http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;20832722&#x2F;youtube-api-v3-on-ios-app-my-api-key-does-not-work-but-somebody-elses-key-doe?rq=1</p>
<p>And that has cost me hours of work - so thanks Google!</p>
