			<h1>A working and easy way to post tweets.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all, I have to post tweet in my iOS application. I&#39;ve searched a lot for this and found many ways but either they are on the old authentication mechanism or unfortunately don&#39;t work for me. I&#39;ve tried the OauthAdapter and input all the required data but it always display message &quot;Tweet not published&quot; perhaps I don&#39;t know the exact steps to use it. Can somebody(who has done it himself) tell &quot;How can I do this and which way I should go?&quot; Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>Great !!! This is the first code which tweeted for me. Thats what I wanted but I am facing a little problem. Using this code tweet publishes when using the code&#39;s own consumer keys, as soon as I insert my own app&#39;s credentials (consumer key &amp; secret) it throws error Message : <strong>{error:&quot;Couldn&#39;t  authenticate with OAuth&quot;,&quot;request&quot;:&quot;V1VStatusesVupdate.json&quot;}</strong>. Can you tell why this is happening. I&#39;ll be really grateful. Thanks</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ve registered my app with twitter and have all the required consumer keys and access token and My app&#39;s access level is set to Read and Write but it still it throws the above mentioned error while tweet is successfully published with the code&#39;s default consumer key and consumer secret. Also can this code share photos in status message or not? Thanks</p>

										<p><p>this code is not written to share photos but I thought I saw some floating around the QA forums that does work. So are you saying the tweets work and the photos dont… or are you sayong that nothing works?</p>

										<p><p>I am saying that tweet is working but only with the code&#39;s default application credentials (consumer keys &amp; secrets), as soon as I put my own app&#39;s credentials (keys &#x2F; secrets), nothing works at all and the above error message is thrown every time (please read the second comment) . I even re-registered my app on twitter with different name but no use. Don&#39;t know what is the problem with it. It works through coder&#39;s app but not through my app.</p>
<p> For photos I was asking you that does this code posts photos as well or not so that should I try upon it or leave it if it doesn&#39;t post photos. I thought you might have used this code yourself so you would know about these problems.</p>

										<p><p>Here&#39;s my guess: It&#39;s not working because you&#39;re using the stored access token from the default credentials with your newly provided credentials. Wipe the app from the simulator or device, change the OAuth stuff to be your own, and try again. If that doesn&#39;t fix it, you probably need to double check you got the keys right, and have write access enabled,…and that my code is bug free. ;)</p>
<p>Also, possibly relevant, is a recent tweet I got on this. Maybe this is what you&#39;re seeing. Hack it, and let me know: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;jbermudez5&#x2F;status&#x2F;247023546998611969</p>
<p>I&#39;ll explain a bit more: each request you make is signed to 1) prove its you (with the oauth key), and 2) prove that the user granted you (with your oauth key) access to act on their behalf (with the access token). So you tested with my oauth keys first, and got an access token, which is stored so the user doesn&#39;t have to authenticate again. But when you change to use your oauth keys, Twitter sees that you are making an invalid request (the access token is specific to the oauth key), and you see the above error.</p>
