			<h2 id="the-real-time-internet-based-debugging-system-designed-for-titanium-appcelerator-http-x2f-x2f-www-cloudebug-com-">The real-time, internet-based debugging system designed for Titanium Appcelerator:   <strong>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cloudebug.com</strong></h2>
<p>As long as the device that is running your app is connected to the Internet - you can debug your code by using any browser, from anywhere, at any time!</p>
<p><strong>How the process works</strong> (it is as simple as 1-2-3, literally):</p>
<ol>
<li>Once you registered <strong>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cloudebug.com</strong>, you will be redirected to a page which will give you a short JavaScript code snippet which you will include in all .js files in your app that you want to debug.</li>
<li>Once the .js file is included - your app is ready for remote debugging!</li>
<li>The <strong>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cloudebug.com</strong> page called &quot;cloudebug console&quot; (after you register and login - you&#39;ll see the link to this page on the top) will, in real time, show you the output coming from your device (actually - all devices which run your app with the code snippet that you&#39;ve included in step 1).</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#39;s it!</p>
<p>We are developers, too. We know all too well that there is no substitution for running your application in real conditions, not in emulator, not connected to a computer in your office, but - in actual &quot;production&quot;, especially - in hands of your customers. </p>
<p>cloudebug.com gives you this unique opportunity and, as a result - an opportunity to improve quality of your work, to learn more, and to have happier customers!</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

							<p>it will definitely run on android, and on obj-c&#x2F;xcode apps, and on monotouch, and on phonegap, and in web apps. i just did not have a chance to debug sufficiently for these platforms, which i will do shortly.<br>basically, if a platform supports tcp sockets - cloudebug will run on it (and if it does not - it is not a platform, right?).<br>still have a day job, so - have to choose my battles :-))</p>
<p>i&#39;m putting a forum on the www.cloudebug.com, so we can share experiences&#x2F;concerns&#x2F;ideas. but while it&#39;s not there - let&#39;s communicate here.<br>good luck to all!</p>

										<p><p>Actually, titanium android SDK does not yet support TCP sockets, only the httpClient class.  Does that mean it is not a platform yet? :)</p>

										<p><p>cloudebug currently works with both - http and tcp protocols.</p>
<p>i&#39;m using tcp by default since it&#39;s much faster, and i did not want to use http connections on the device if i can avoid doing that.<br>cloudebug can switch to http with ease.</p>
<p>one more thing to do, though…<br>&quot;when&quot; - is the real question, not &quot;how&quot; or &quot;if&quot; :-))</p>

<p>Due to the unresolved issue with the Marketplace product downloading, dual-platform modules are not being installed properly if packaged in a single zip file.</p>
<p>If you&#39;d like to obtain Android version of the module:</p>
<p>– Download iOS version of Cloudebug from the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;1061">Titanium Marketplace</a> (this step is needed to register the module to your Appcelerator account, otherwise your app will get an &quot;Unregistered module&quot; exception. Sorry, but it&#39;s not our doing - talk to the Appcelerator people);</p>
<p>– email to <strong><em>support@cloudebug.com</em></strong> to tell us you&#39;d like to have the Android version. We will immediately reply you with the zip file.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
