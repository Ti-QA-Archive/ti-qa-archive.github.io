			<h1>Titanium.include not working on Android?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Our usual development structure includes a file at the top of app.js using Titanium.include that contains global variables &amp; functions that get used repeatedly throughout the app. This works fine for iOS development, when we try to do the same for Android, the emulator &amp; our test phone gives an error that the global variables are not defined. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve searched other threads here that talked about similar issues, but none of the solutions suggested (clean build, &#x2F; before the relative path, etc) seem to work.</p>
<p>We&#39;re using Studio build 3.0.1 and Google APIs Android 4.0</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I am going to go out on a limb here and guess you are using CommonJS <strong>require</strong> as well as the <strong>include</strong> function.</p>
<p>If this is the case I am also going to guess that you have been working on the iOS version before the Android one.</p>
<p>IF these guesses are correct;</p>
<p>You have been benefiting from a incorrect implementation in iOS and a correct one in Android.  What is happening is that iOS DOES allow global variables declared as you have been, whereas Android DOES NOT allow this access.</p>
<p>The Android implementation is correct and I suspect the iOS version will be &#39;changed&#39; in the future.</p>
<p>You should move the globals into a CommonJS file and reference is as you need it.</p>
<p>IF these guesses are wrong - at least I got to type on a keyboard for the past few minutes.</p>

										<p><p>Your guesses are correct. Require, of course works perfectly. We were simply trying to avoid making a global object like the Titanium one..</p>

										<p><p>variables or constants? &lt;- I&#39;m referring to the strict terminology here</p>
<p>If constants, declare them in config.js pull them into each file they are needed in </p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">var</span> config = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">require</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-string">'config);</span></span></span>
</code></pre><p> and use them.</p>
<p>If these are variables (they change during runtime)…thats a horse of a different color.</p>

							<p>iOS and Android are different beasts.  The jscore javascript engine used in iOS has a &#39;larger scope&#39; than does the rather strict V8 javascript engine on Android.</p>

										<p><p>I think the guide comes into play because it does two things.</p>
