			<p>Hi guys!</p>
<p>I got this error and I couldn&#39;t find any solutions in the web, so I give up searching and probably someone encountered this problem and can help me. Here is the screenshot</p>

							<p>Hi Steven,</p>
<p>Try to find out there is any special character is there in the file and is there any corrupted images is there in the project? </p>
<p>if you don&#39;t find any and still problem then try to build project in lower SDK or try to run newly created project.</p>
<p>this will help you to diagnosis your error.</p>

										<p><p>I forgot to write the detail and I couldn&#39;t edit the original question. Initially, the project was created in another machine with 1.7.5 SDK. Now, I want to import the project in a new machine and I have downloaded all the SDK from 1.7.5 to 1.8.1. I can run the project in 1.8.1 though, but many features will not work because a lot of them are deprecated already.</p>
<p>To your question, no, there is no special character since we (my team) avoid using special characters in naming the files. I don&#39;t think there is corrupted image as well, since it is working perfectly in another machine.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Steven,</p>
<p>can you try to create new project and run it into that machine which creates an error in build. will it build properly?</p>
<p>May be there is a problem in SDK. for that you should replace that SDK by new one.</p>

										<p><p>I can run other projects which are running 1.8.1, it&#39;s just this project which was created in another machine using 1.7.5 and when I imported it into my machine it&#39;s not working. So it&#39;s the SDK fault?</p>

							<p>Try changing the name element in your tiapp.xml file (you can only see it in xml view) to something else (even adding a space should be enought) and then clean and rebuild. That worked for me.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">&lt;<span class="hljs-property">name</span>&gt;AppName&lt;/<span class="hljs-property">name</span>&gt;
</code></pre><p>changes to:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">&lt;<span class="hljs-property">name</span>&gt;AppName &lt;/<span class="hljs-property">name</span>&gt;

							<p>It seems it was because there were slight difference of the 1.7.5 SDK between my machine and the other machine so I copied the 1.7.5 from the other machine to my machine and it&#39;s working now. Thanks for all the suggestions! =)</p>
