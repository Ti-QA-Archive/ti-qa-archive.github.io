			<h1>Installing apk file on device - INSTALL_PARSE_FAILED_NO_CERTIFICATES</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I tried to install my first apk file on a device today and it failed with the above message. So I ran the key, jarsign and zipalign checks and it passed them all. After reading about Java problems, I then manually signed and zipaligned through the studio console and republished the app. The same error is still there.<br>(I also uploaded the original apk file to Google Play yesterday. It&#39;s status is &#39;published&#39; and there are no warning messages but it isn&#39;t available on the beta testing url.)<br>Can anyone advise me on what to do next, please?<br>Titanium SDK version: 3.1.0, Samsung Galaxy S</p>

							<div><p>ps - the app appeared on Google Play today but when I tried to download, like so many others I&#39;ve read about on here, I got the message &#39;package file was not signed correctly&#39;. I&#39;ve followed all the advice I can find, really stuck now!</p>

							<p>I solved the problem like this:</p>
<p>####1. publishing the app through studio as normal </p>
<p>####2. jarsigning again with this code: jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore KEYSTORE_FILE_LOCATION app-unsigned.apk KEYSTORE_ALIAS</p>
<p>####3. zipaligning again.</p>
<p>My app now installs on my phone and is in the Play Store and downloads with no error. </p>
<p>To be honest, I need to look into this more because I dont know if I&#39;ve now signed my app twice, and if that will cause other problems. Google doesn&#39;t seem to mind. I&#39;m a bit concerned that despite being 5.3mb in the store, the app shows as over 12mb on my phone. I don&#39;t know if this is normal, or related to jarsigning twice or whether it&#39;s a separate issue (that&#39;s because I don&#39;t really know what I&#39;m doing with jarsigning!) </p>
<p>That said, I gather the problem is that the algorithm SHA256withRSA was used when my app was jarsigned through studio and Google doesn&#39;t like that. I am pretty sure that using SHA1withRSA (as in the code above) was what solved the problem for me. By the way, I have Java 1.6.0_25 installed, not Java 1.7, which is supposed to be the cause of the problem. </p>

										<p><p>Correction to point 2. Code should say:</p>
<p>####jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore KEYSTORE_FILE_LOCATION APK_FILE_LOCATION KEYSTORE_ALIAS</p>
<p>If you read the article, it suggests jarsigning the unsigned app from the build folder. I tried this but the app ended up too large, which is why I published it through studio first.</p>
<p>Sorry this is muddled, would help if we could edit posts!</p>

							<p>I also was banging my head against this problem when I was trying to build a distributable APK after upgrading to Titanium SDK 3.2. I successfully built an APK that would install on my Galaxy Nexus but not on my clients Samsung S2. </p>
<p>It turns out that I had some how created a keystore that was specifying the wrong type of key. I had created the keystore using Java 7 SDK keytool without specifing the correct signature algorithm as SHA1withRSA (in Java 6 that is the default).</p>
<p>In a distribution targeted build Titanium then signs your APK with what ever key type is reported by the keytool. Deleting my key and recreating it with the correct signature algorithm solved the problem and now the signing is performed correctly when running &quot;titanium build -p android -T dist-playstore&quot; or by running a distribution build in Titanium Studio. I hope this helps anyone encountering the same problem.</p>
<p>This issue helped me sort this out: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-16189</p>
