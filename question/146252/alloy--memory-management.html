			<h1>Alloy &amp; Memory Management</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>In the dark days of titanium I wrote some complex, multi-context apps that were very feature rich but suffered poor manageability and memory management. I ported those apps to the CommonJS format and had great improvements in manageability and some in memory management.</p>
<p>To further improve my memory management, I developed a system of creating shutdown() functions in each CommonJS module I want destroyed on close. </p>
<p>For example imagine a ParentWindow with a Table of Rows that creates a new Detail object and opens a complex detail window with Detail.ChildWindow.open(). The ChildWindow comprises of many other CommonJS objects, functions and Ti.UI Objects. When the ChildWindow is closed, the ParentWindow calls DetailWindow.shutdown(), that proceeds recursively null out all objects, functions etc. in the Detail object.</p>
<p>It works very well pretty much eliminating every memory leak in the app and ensuring really fast garbage collection. I&#39;ve gone from occasional crashes to zero crashes along with great performance.</p>
<p>Now, in the last week I&#39;ve been trying to get my head around Alloy and I can&#39;t figure out how to get such tight memory performance out of it.</p>
<p>How could I replicate the behaviour in my example above into an Alloy app?</p>
<p>How are other people handling the creation and destruction of windows, functions, event listeners, and all the associated fun?</p>
<p>Nick</p>

							<p>This is a fairly big topic, but it sounds like you have the hard part figured out already, which is effectively managing your own memory. We just need to translate to how you can do so in Alloy. What I would suggest is creating a <strong>shutdown()</strong> function in your controllers which would in turn start your cascading set of other shutdown() calls, if that makes sense. So the only thing you would call manually at that point is the controller&#39;s shutdown() function, which in turn would just launch your logic as it does now.</p>
<p>If that doesn&#39;t give you enough to go on, perhaps a small code sample of what you are trying to achieve in Alloy would help. </p>
<p>PS - &quot;Nick the Geek&quot;… that wouldn&#39;t happen to be a reference to &quot;Lock, Stock, and 2 Smoking Barrels&quot;?</p>

										<p><p>Hi Tony,</p>
<p>thanks for the prompt response. I that was my thought also, as it is exactly the way my current code behaves.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t actually tried in Alloy yet, as I am still in the &#39;discovery&#39; stage ;) I was just foreseeing issues in memory management because I am not sure how dynamic children are managed. I will try to crank out some model code over the weekend and put it up next week.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>Did you manage to write up a sample code for the function to clear out memory?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
