							<p>Dear Ronny,</p>
<p>The only question in your post is &#39;can somebody help me in this??&#39;. If you&#39;re going to expect any type of help from the hardworking people here, you&#39;ll need to do something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Clearly phrase your question, letting everyone know exactly what you&#39;re interested in.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Choose a more descriptive title that summarizes your question.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Speak in semi-understandable English. If you do not speak it natively, please try a translator, or mention it so that people understand.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When asking a question, don&#39;t just say &#39;I need somebody to code this part of my app&#39;. You need to say &#39;Ok, I&#39;ve gotten this far, but I&#39;m stuck on &lt;insert problem&gt;. So far, I&#39;ve tried to fix it by doing things like &lt;insert attempted solution&gt;, but that didn&#39;t work. So, is there any input that somebody has to offer to hopefully solve my problem&#39;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>
<p>Jacob</p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t want to discourage anybody from posting because of a language barrier. That being said, I think Ronny has been asked by several people already, including myself, that he would be better served by making an effort on his own. He has already been provided links to getting started videos and documentation. It&#39;s clear he doesn&#39;t want to learn Titanium Mobile or how to write apps on his own. He addresses the forum as &quot;team&quot;, as if we are all supposed to work together on each others projects. It is clear that he wants chunks of code that he can cobble together to make an app. He wants a cookbook, which I also provided a link to.</p>
<p>Ronny….you need to be resourceful. While the documentation and videos might not show you how to make the exact app you want, you have to be like everybody else. Learn how to write small chunks of functional code that works, and build on those successes. If you ever have any trouble getting your code to work, there are plenty here to help you. You MUST show an effort if you ever want any kind of help, ever.</p>
