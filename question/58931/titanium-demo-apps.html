			<h1>Titanium Demo Apps</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>The Titanium pitch on your website looks interesting, but the demo apps are a bit disappointing:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#39;ve had a look at Tweetanium and Sideline, but none of them seems to work (both tested on Windows 7 x64). Sideline crashes on startup. Tweetanium starts, but hangs once I enter my credentials. </li>
</ul>
<p>Are these limitations of the framework (maybe no x64 support), or bugs in the applications? Where can I find some working demos for desktop systems?</p>
<ul>
<li>I haven&#39;t had a look at the mobile apps yet (my iphone is still shipping and I have no Android yet), but I am wondering why most of the apps are only available for iphone. </li>
</ul>
<p>Why aren&#39;t all apps available for both Iphone and Android? I thought the point of using Appcelerator is to create an app that runs on multiple systems, so there should be no good reason not to cover Android?</p>

							<p>Neither did I. Nor is there much support down here. Why would I actually start getting the full member support, for one can not even run the simplest app. </p>

							<p>Those apps are a bit stale and haven&#39;t been in active development for a while (and weren&#39;t developed with 1.0.0, which is likely the cause for being unable to just run them through Developer, if people are having issues with that).  We definitely need more sample apps, but in the meantime I would point you toward <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_desktop&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;apps&#x2F;drillbit&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;tests&#x2F;">the unit tests for Titanium Desktop</a> - there are lots of good code samples there for basically all of our Desktop APIs.  There&#39;s also an in-progress <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;KitchenSinkDesktop">Desktop Kitchen Sink</a> which may be useful.</p>
<p>Also, with regard to mobile, many of the sample apps make use of platform-specific features or UI components that don&#39;t exist cross-platform.  There&#39;s nothing stopping them from shipping to both platforms, some developers just choose not to test for and target both platforms with their apps.</p>
<p>Titanium isn&#39;t meant to be &#39;write once, run everywhere&#39;.  It is cross-platform, but still gives you access to platform-specific UI, which is necessary to create an application that belongs on a given platform.  That&#39;s the balance we&#39;re trying to strike.</p>
