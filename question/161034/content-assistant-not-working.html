			<h1>Content assistant not working</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>The content assistant is not working. I&#39;m working on OSX and have tried the following:   </p>
<ol>
<li>Installing the following SDKs: 3.2.0, 3.2.1, 3.3.0.   </li>
<li>Tried reverting between those versions.   </li>
<li>Checked the Project Natures (mobile - primary, mobile module, are checked).   </li>
<li>Tried every option on the Project Build Path.   </li>
<li>Of course tried to build the project again and again.   </li>
<li>Check the content assistant preference both in the main preference and in the project properties.   </li>
</ol>
<p>I&#39;m about to give it up.</p>

							<div><p>I guess nobody is here. I have so much problems with the platform and it is the first time I post here after trying all possible solutions I could find and think of. I just wish there were some support for this platform without paying, otherwise how good is it?</p>
