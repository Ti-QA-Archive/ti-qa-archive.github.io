							<p>actually the application ID is very relevant…</p>
<p>If you get it wrong then your application won&#39;t run.</p>
<p>Can you specify which platform and studio you are using in future please as there are differences between, desktop, android, iOS etc.</p>
<p>For IOS you need to specify this to enable a provisioning certificate to be created. I normally use the following formulae I guess others do it differently.</p>
<p>com.{companyname}.{applicationname}</p>
<p>replace as appropriate.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>T.</p>

										<p><p>You still have not identified the platform(s).  In the case of iOS, Apple does require you to register as a developer.  This is true whether or not you plan to submit the application to the app store.  Even those you only want to install and run on your own private device will need a &quot;provisioning profile&quot; from Apple.  To get one you need to be a registered developer.</p>
<p>However, that is not true of a desktop application.</p>
<p>So like Trevor said, there are differences and it isn&#39;t possible to answer your question accurately without knowing more information.</p>
