							<p>You can submit with xcode?  I didnt know that, I always used it to build and then used the application loader..</p>
<p>I&#39;ve never had luck with the Titanium building for submit.  Instead, open the project in Xcode and build it that way and then upload.  </p>

							<p>Yes I am submitting with Xcode organizer .. but this time i had this error (i had built my app with xcode and noway i have always the same error)</p>
<p>titanium should not have this type of error witch mean that the building was not really successfull<br>anyway, i zipped my app file and send it with application loader and i hope that it will be accepted</p>
<p>thanks for your comment</p>
