			<h1>Tableview scroll stuttering and performance issues</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Titanium SDK - 1.7.2<br>Platform - iOS</p>
<p>We have a huge problem in tale view scroll performance in iPhone. The table view scrolling stutters frequently on scroll down and then sometimes are not responding. The rows are complex with lot of views and labels, images etc added to it. Unique id is given to the rows with different templates. Please see the sample code AT <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;2734106">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;2734106</a></p>
<p>While scrolling down we get close to 5 to 7 FPS. We also have a huge memory problem where the scrolling decreases the available memory. While we close the window we manually release the memory and is working ok. Since the scrolling is not releasing memory the app is crashing too often.</p>
<p>Please give advice</p>

							<p>How many records ?….</p>
<p>Looking at it, this could simply be that the device will not handle that much data easily, and it is struggling to run properly.</p>
<p>Rather that downloading all the records at once and trying to display them, maybe a paging system would work well. </p>
<p>Or as a lot of apps work as you scroll down it then loads the next set of data, and removes the earlier set.</p>
<p>(I cannot see anything obvious in the code).</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

										<p><p>Initially i load 10 records (10 rows with complex views and data) and the rest is added while scrolling or action of a button. Stuttering happens on the first scroll down and when you scroll up it goes smoothly. Memory are slowly getting eaten up everytime i add a new set of rows or scroll down. We have a table view to list the data with Image and labels. Profiling on xcode shows 25 labels, 25 images etc and scrolling down the same increases depending on the number of rows added. This is not released until i close the window and release it manually. The user may scroll close to 10000 records but by them the app would have crashed 5000 times.</p>
<p>Please ask if u need any extra information.</p>

										<p><p>So it is probably trying to scroll before everything is loaded… Back to my original, you will need to remove earlier stuff after you have scrolled down.. I still think it is just to much data at once… Obviously I stand to be corrected but maybe put in paging, where it loads the initial records, and using a loading screen, to make sure it has completed before scrolling, then load the next lot behind the scenes.</p>

										<p><p>We do have a &#39;Loading..&#39; message that stops users from scrolling until evreything is loaded. But when u scroll after everything is bound, still the scrolling is stuttering. This is very bad in the sample code that i pasted, but other area it is acceptable. </p>
<p>Not sure how i will remove the exisitng records as we are not allowed to do pagination. Showing 1 to 100 and 100 to 200 is not the style what we want to work with or the customer. Is there any way to release the men=mory used by the table or objects in a table view while scrolling. ie, remove the &#39;hidden&#39; objects in tableview when u scroll down and add it when u scroll up there by removing whichever is not visibe.</p>

							<p>the reality is that it is simply a bad UI design to have 10,000 records in a tableView on a mobile application.</p>
<p>you need to redesign your UI, you will not get this to work with the current version of appcelerator unless you write your own tableView module</p>

										<p><p>@Aaron I agree that it is impossible for a user to scroll to the 10000 record to see it. We have given workaround for users to jump to certain record numbers.</p>
<p>About the performance or memory problem, if when we work with a table row of 100 records too we have problems. We initially load 20 rows in table with 40 labels and 20 image views. On scroll we add the new rows (append row). When we checked in Xcode memory instrument we saw that the resources used by the labels or views are not getting released. If i scroll to the 100th record all the 200 labels and 100 image views are in memory and not getting released. When user closes this window we release it manually. But the problem here is users usually navigate from this window to another window and there on. All these memory objects are retained until user closes all the windows. We cant close the current window and take user to the next window as user need to know the state of the previous window.</p>
<p>Is there any workaround for memory heaping in this solution.</p>
