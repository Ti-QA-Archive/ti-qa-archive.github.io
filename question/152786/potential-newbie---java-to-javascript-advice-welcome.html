			<h1>Potential Newbie - Java to JavaScript Advice Welcome</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Background: Using Eclipse (Indigo) I have designed and made decent progress on an Android mobile app. The current design has two projects: 1) server app (the service piece to run on a centos-5-x86_64 OS) written in JAVA with a simple Restlet structure; and client app (also started in JAVA as Android project). In a nutshell, the client sends secure URI requests to the service and the service returns JSON items to the client. The client manipulates and displays information accordingly based on what is returned. The service piece is setup to install on a special dedicated Tomcat host with a MySQL database (both latest versions).</p>
<p>Desire: I want to take advantage of Appcelerator without losing most of the server-side investment and hopefully with the ability to auto-magically translate some client-side Java-based code to JavaScript (if required). I am assuming I can only use JavaScript based on what I have understood so far. It&#39;s hard to quickly summarize the question, but I hope the question below will be clear and that someone can give solid advice. Not looking for &quot;shot into the unknown&quot; types of answers. Really want to know feasible solutions (even if some changes, purchases, etc. required), based on real-world knowledge. I don&#39;t want to go too much farther than enhancing my JavaScript learning curve as, so far, it seems I will need to do at least that much.</p>
<p>Question: Has anyone had a similar start and successfully migrated from Java-based code to the JavaScript-based Appcelerator platform for the advantages of the Titatium life-cycle, tools, widgets, inherent cloud, cross-op&#x2F;device releases, etc., and have suggestions regarding migrating my service and client code over?</p>

							<p>After reviewing the tutorials and downloading some sample projects, I feel confident enough that I won&#39;t lose my server-side investment. I&#39;m convinced that Appcelerator  will allow me to move rapidly with the client-side using js from scratch, so here we go…! Thanks!</p>
