			<h1>XHR POST request with redirect issue</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m currently &quot;porting&quot; my project for iPhone from PhoneGap to Titanium (2.0.1) because I want to use some native UI features. So far I&#39;d just created new project, added my HTML from PhoneGap project, created WebView and loaded local HTML into it.<br>And here I have this issue that is quite annoying - in my app user have to log into service using login and password. They are sent to the server using POST request. If everything is OK, server sets cookie and redirects client to page with data. Since it&#39;s WebView stuff, I used jQuery there, and in PhoneGap it worked ok. In Titanium for some reason it does not works, it just doesn&#39;t get&#39;s the cookies.<br>I tried changing jQuery.post to custom function created with Ti.Network.HTTPClient, but the client is as well if set to follow redirect does not handles the request correctly and misses the cookies.<br>The only way I&#39;d found to work now is to create HTTPClient that does not follows redirects, save cookie and then manually follow redirect. But this is just totally stupid.<br>May be I missed something in the docs (or it&#39;s undocumented) and there&#39;s some flag that fixes cookie handling for WebView?<br>Thanks in advance.</p>
