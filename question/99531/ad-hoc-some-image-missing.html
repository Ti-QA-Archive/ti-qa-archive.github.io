			<h1>Ad-Hoc some image missing</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I was following some of the example from Q&amp;A and build the app via X-code, although it got one error, fortunately it still can distribute and run on the device using the Ad-Hoc. But there is a problem, some of the self define image is missing from the app (folder inside the titanium project &#39;root&#x2F;resources&#x2F;image&#39;).</p>
<p>Anyone know how to solve it?</p>
<p>Currently version Im using the Titanium 1.2.2, SDK 1.2.0 which only able to run on the iPhone 3.1.3 SDK.</p>

							<p>The Build.py script is located in the iPhone folder within the Titanium SDK folder (in your case 1.2.0), however two things come to mind:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You don&#39;t need to use Ad-Hoc, you can run the &quot;Install on device&quot; which creates a *.app file in the build folder that you can send to people via email to test the app (I&#39;m guessing that is what you want to do?)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Update your SDK to 1.5.1! All SDKs will run on iPhoneOS 3.1.3, just the new iOS features will not be available&#x2F;work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Only use the build.py script if you know what you are doing, you should be able to do everything with Titanium Developer.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<li><p>That what I want because the app need to send to people for testing, if it able to do it then it will be great ^^.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I did not know that, but I try before the SDK 1.2.0 but the simulator for 3.1.3 not initialize which very hard for me to test, this is why I stick with 1.2.0.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank for the info.</p>

							<p>You need to run the Titanium Build.py script (Preferably via Titanium Developer) on your project and don&#39;t use XCode to do builds.</p>
<p>By running this script will copy over all your resources as well as copy only the Objective-C classes need from the Titanium SDK.</p>

										<p><p>Where is the .py script located? I using XCode is because I read somewhere it is require to build via XCode if I need to use the Ad-Hoc.</p>
<p>I forget mention the version I using, the SDK 1.2.0 (I want to run on the iPhone 3.1.3)</p>
