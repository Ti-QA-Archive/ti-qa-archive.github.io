			<h1>RSS Example App force-quits almost immediately on Android Jelly Bean</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>While testing out the RSS example app (working on most devices I tried) I attempted to run it on my Galaxy Tab 10.1 currently running a recent build of Android 4.1.1 Jelly Bean. The app gets about 90% of the way through load, visually displaying the RSS feed on the left, then dies with a OS message stating &quot;Unfortunately, Sample.RSS has stopped&quot;.</p>
<p>My question becomes: <strong>Does anyone with an official Nexus 7 Jelly Bean tablet or other device have the ability to test the app and see if the problem persists?</strong></p>
<p>If so, either the RSS example app will have to be updated, or the underlying Titanium API for Android itself will have to be tweaked. It looks as though the problem might have something to do with the webview.</p>

							<div><p>I don&#39;t have a JB device in hand yet, but tie it to a system with DDMS on it, and get a section of the log from that around the time the crash occurred. Might need to paste it into a Gist for readability.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t need the entire session, just look for the crash, probably about 10-12 lines in bright red</p>

							<div><p>Oo.. DDMS is pretty sweet, never used it before. Here&#39;s a <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;WmbxY4tN">pastebin of the error</a> and a little before it. Now if only pastebin had code highlighting for the DDMS log format…</p>
