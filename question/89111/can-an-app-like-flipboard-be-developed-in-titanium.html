			<h1>Can an app like Flipboard be developed in Titanium?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m currently evaluating Titanium for an internal project for my company. They are looking for a magazine like application for displaying their internal content on their staff iPads. So basically something like Flipbook. Content will be streamed to the iPad app in a custom XML file and text, images and video will be displayed on the screen in various magazine like layouts. Can someone tell me if this is possible with Titanium and if so what methods&#x2F;classes would one use to do this (not necessarily the XML part, but being able to split the screen&#x2F;page up into various sections that contain a summary of text and then when tapped open up a larger window that shows more text&#x2F;images etc.).</p>
<p>Many thanks!</p>

							<p>One advice is not to use xml, try to get json files.  Xml it&#39;s parsed very slow.</p>

<p>I think I&#39;m going to go with a different approach and that is to render all my pages on the server and serve them up as just html. So here&#39;s some more details of my requirements. Just so you know I posted this on PhoneGap because I&#39;m currently evaluating both of these tools and I apologize for the length of the post but I really do need to know if this is possible before I start any coding, hope you understand :)</p>
<p>Here are my requirements, note I<br>refer to my content as a &quot;magazine&quot;, and there may be more than one<br>that can be accessed from the app:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>When app opens up user can tap on one or more thumbnails (which<br>will be the cover for the magazine - a simple jpg screenshot that is<br>cached from our server). Tapping will open up a webview that contains<br>all the html for the cover page of the magazine. If you&#39;ve seen<br>Flipboard app, this is similar to how they display &quot;channels&quot; on their<br>content page.</p>
</li>
<li><p>User will have ability to read previous issues of the magazine,<br>therefore the content needs to be cached locally. User will be a able<br>to pull up pop-up list and select previous issues from the list.</p>
</li>
<li><p>As above, when user opens app up for first time it will connect to<br>our server and pull down all the pages of the magazine, so this all<br>needs to be cached. Pages will need to be stored in a folder structure<br>that can be easily accessed ie app&#x2F;magazinename&#x2F;issuedate&#x2F;pages &#x2F;<br>images etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pages can be read by swiping left&#x2F;right, each swipe loads page x<br>(no page turn animation necessary). Perhaps some sort of caching will<br>be needed to speed up the response. I&#39;ve thought about whether all the<br>content can be stuffed in one html page and use javascript to show&#x2F;<br>hide each page but this might take too long to load or slow down any<br>type of animation. Pages will be simple DIVs re-sized into various<br>sections on the page. If I were doing this for web delivery, I would<br>just use a mouse click event on the DIV and expand the DIV using some<br>jquery code, but the animation needs to be smooth (like in Flipbook).</p>
</li>
<li><p>When a DIV is tapped on this will be expanded to fill the screen so<br>all the content can be read. There will be a button within this DIV<br>that when the user taps, opens a link to our website and displays our<br>website within a modal window that can be closed. There will need to<br>be some sort of alert if no internet connection is available.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When user taps on icon on status bar at bottom a small webview<br>window will slide up which will display a carousel of thumbnails<br>representing each page - definitely doable in jquery. User will be<br>able to swipe through images and tap on the image to take them<br>directly to that page.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Will potentially need search feature which will search through all<br>issues of the magazine and display thumbnails representing search<br>results (not required for release 1).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some pages will contain embedded video which will play within the<br>DIV, or be able to be viewed full screen.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>On our server we&#39;ll be generating the pages every month and there<br>could be as many as 100 pages per issue, each containing html, images,<br>links, embedded video etc.</p>
<p>Hope this helps. I&#39;m looking forward to see if all of this is possible<br>with Titanium.</p>
