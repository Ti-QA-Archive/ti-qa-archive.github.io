		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Has anyone else been having this problem? Ever since the update this morning, even after cleaning the project and restarting it, the &quot;Building workspace&quot; step of running the app is incredibly slow (i.e. several seconds per file, so 10-20 minutes to actually run a build. 2 other developers I&#39;m working with are experiencing this too, but I haven&#39;t seen other posts about this. Please comment if you see it too. :)</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>David</p>

							<div><p>They filed a bug for it and will fix it with the next Titanium release. Yes, even though it&#39;s a regression, they are waiting a full release cycle to put out a fix. The only work around is to run in Run-mode (so you can either have logging or breakpoints, but not both at the same time until they fix this :( )</p>
