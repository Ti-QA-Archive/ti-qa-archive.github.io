			<h1>Update apps from remote server</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I am getting really &amp;#)€&amp;)&amp; on all the extra work that Facebook is giving me….</p>
<p>They change their API just as they want. </p>
<p>Now i have a couple of apps that is broken just because suddenly you have to have an access_token to read albums from the Gallery….   </p>
<p>So what if i had all of those functions on a file on my server?</p>
<p>That way i could just update that file and everything would work right away instead of having to send an update to iTunes (That takes 12 days). </p>
<p>Would Apple go along with that?  Or will they scream on top of their lungs if i have files on a remote server?</p>
<p>I know it would make my apps slower but i still think its worth it.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m afraid this won&#39;t fly with Apple&#39;s standards. Since all application updates must go through the App Store.</p>
<p>When you think of it, it kind of makes sense. Otherwise, you could have an application that complies with all the rules for the app store and it would be published. After that, (without any knowledge from Apple) someone could update the app and engage in illicit behavior for example. Hence the reason behind this limitation.</p>
<p>Hope this clears this up for you.</p>

										<p><p>I think Richard only wants to outsource the Facebook-requests. Updating the App won&#39;t be possible as Cristian said.</p>
<p>But a solution for this could be an own API between your app and facebook. Then you just have to update the scripts on your server and all of your clients would work immediately.</p>

										<p><p>Even google has moved to frowning upon outside updates to app obtained through Play.</p>
<p>You could have an update system in place that feeds your app configuration changes.</p>
<p>We do that in a number of our apps.  App checks our servers, and if a new config file is available, it downloads it and uses it instead of the one it shipped with.</p>
<p>Text, images, etc.  Theoretically you could change the facebook access_token, or required permissions.</p>
<p>You will want to be wary of how&#x2F;what you change, as a man in the middle attack could change all your client apps in the wild.</p>

										<p><p>That would work yes. It it was <strong>your</strong> server providing the content, it a lot easier to change things around since you could have complete control of your server code.</p>

										<p><p>Aha…. That sounds about right! :) </p>
<p>So lets say that i would like to have a config file on my server how should it look and how do i call it? </p>
<p>It would certainly save a lot of time.  </p>
<p>Thanx!</p>

										<p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>you can always update content and stuff like sections with a json. That won&#39;t be breaking the rules. The only problem is to transfer actual code over the wire.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
