							<p>Why not download Titanium + iOS SDK + KitchenSink and build your own…<br>Thats the whole point of Titanium and why we are all on here…</p>
<p>If you want someone to build you a clone of an app then i suggest going to a freelance website (i.e scriptlance) and ask on there, but be prepared to pay £££&#39;s</p>
<p>If you build your own you will understand how it works and how to make it better, update it etc…</p>
<p>I very much doubt you will get what you want on here, especially not for free!</p>
