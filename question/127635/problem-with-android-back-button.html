			<h1>problem with android back button</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>hi, i have a problem when pressing back button on android device.. the problem is that, i have many windows aka many js file , window1, window2, window2.1,window2.2,window2.3<br>i also have tableview, which is clickable , where i use to link the window by using method createWindow  then open()</p>
<p>so my problem is, for example im at window 2.2, i want to go to window2.1 , i have to go back to window2 then click window2.1 , but the thing is, after i click back button, the table become unclickable</p>
<p>so this is what ive done so far to solve the clickable problem<br>i use android:back then inside it i use createWindow of the previous page which is window2 .. well it did work , but now it the second problem arise where when i want to close the application.. it didnt close the application instead it direct to previous page</p>
<p>ive tried so many method to do this, i use:-<br>1-exitOnClose:true </p>
<p>2-android:back &gt; window.close()   </p>
<p>3-android:back &gt; var activity = Titanium.Android.currentActivity;<br>         activity.finish();</p>
<p>all of these method above, did work (close the application) when i didnt put the method createWindow open() on the secondwindow of the mainwindow </p>
<p>can someone help me with this, thank you :)</p>

							<p>Not a straight forward answer.</p>
<p>Firstly if you have a lot of windows in the stack then you could potentially hit a memory issue.</p>
<p>The way I resolved your quit issue is on the quit, you open a new window which has</p>
<p>exitOnClose:    true,</p>
<p>and then close this. The android app will then exit.</p>
<p>Bit of frig but it does save the application closing unless you want it to.</p>
<p>T..</p>

										<p><p>Well you are opening a window within a window which is not good…</p>
<p>it closes the window in close.js but you still have the parent window open.<br>just add exit on close the the win close window remove the url line should do it.</p>

										<p><p>hi </p>
<p>I have a same issue once in my project where i need to open a window within a window without closing the last window and the back button cuasing the issue, </p>
<p>At that time i had resolved the error by handling the back click event. </p>
<p>add the event listener for the back press and handle on your own way what to do whether to close the window and go back the last window etc </p>
<p>All this take lots of logic and its not any hack it just the another way of implementation for the temporary solution. </p>
<p>you need to study about custom Event firing and custom event listening and lastly how to handle the back press event. </p>
<p>When you done with this you have to make the logic as below</p>
<p>Firstly make a global array which works as stack of windows, after that we need to handle of back logic when click back check which was the last open window close the current one and open that last one manually..</p>
<p>I know its bit lengthy but if you got a better solution do provide me too..</p>
