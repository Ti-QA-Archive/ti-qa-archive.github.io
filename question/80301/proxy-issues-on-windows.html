			<h1>Proxy issues on Windows</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>Have been evaluating Titanium for a while now and ready to build a prototype at&#x2F;for my work. We are running Windows XP and a SOCKS v5 proxy. I setup the environment variables as follow:</p>
<p>HTTP_PROXY=username:password@proxyhost:proxyport<br>HTTPS_PROXY=username:password@proxyhost:proxyport</p>
<p>Replacing the username, password, host and port to the right values, does not work at all. Launching the Titanium Developer tool, the internet sign comes up for 0.3 seconds and goes to gray.</p>
<p>This has been very frustrating and would really appreciate someone to help.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Olivier</p>

							<div><p>Oliver, would you provide the following info?</p>
<ul>
<li>what firewall do you use? (try to disable it temporarily to see if the issue improves)</li>
<li>what do you know about the socks server (what brand, version etc)?</li>
<li>are you able to ping <strong>and</strong> tracert, by ip address, the socks server (in order to determine whether IMCP is enabled)</li>
<li>are you able to ping the socks server by name (the name used in the env vars you have defined above)</li>
<li>what antivirus do you use?</li>

							<div><p>We are using McAfee. But I have just tried to disable the proxy and go through an open connection and it works. Therefore, there is a problem with the connectivity with the proxy.

							<p>Digging around a bit, I find that you can also set up a SOCKS_PROXY environment variable - maybe give that a shot with your setup?</p>

										<p><p>heh, alternatively, disregard my comment above, and follow Kevin&#39;s advice (I mistook the environment variables you have set with SOCKS_PROXY).</p>

							<p>Kevin,</p>
<p>Just tried it, does not work either. Would it be possible to trace the execution of the dashboard and see what is going on? If not, maybe you could send me a version that traces the connection issue?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Olivier</p>

										<p><p>You can launch Developer from the command line with the <code>--debug</code> flag - this will send debug output to a console window, and enable the Webkit Web Inspector when you right click on the Developer its self.</p>

<p>Is this Titanium Developer itself that cannot connect to the appcel cloud, or is it your virtual device&#x2F;emulator?</p>
<p>If it&#39;s the former, it is worth you providing here the answers to the questions I posted above.</p>

							<p>OK, I went a little further. The –debug option did show that the HTTP and HTTPS PROXY environment variables are being picked up. However, no error whatsoever in the log.</p>
<p>I confirm that this is not a SOCK server but purely HTTP and HTTP Proxy.</p>
<p>I then opened a cygwin shell session and issued a curl command passing the -x parameter with the same format defined in HTTP_PROXY and I was able to get a valid response back.</p>
<p>It seems therefore that there is an issue with the Titanium Developer console. We also had the same issues with our development partners in the UK (different company…)</p>

										<p><p>By the way, your post above is not an answer, it should be a comment response to one of the answers you have received from other people.</p>
<p>If you follow the correct format, it will make it so much easier for everyone to follow the conversation and, hence, much more likely that someone else will assist you with your problem.</p>

										<p><p>Also, why are you forcing people to log in the developer console? Would it make sense to be able to work in an offline mode? Is it possible? If so, that would satisfy my requirements to move forward.</p>
