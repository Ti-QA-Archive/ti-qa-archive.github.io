			<h1>Android: WebView&#39;s evalJS Crashes the Application</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Has anybody else had trouble with using <code>evalJS</code> on the Android emulator using Titanium 1.7.2?  When I use it, <code>evalJS</code> crashes the emulator every time.  It works perfectly and as expected under iOS.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve filed a bug, complete with a test case:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC-262</p>
<p>But I&#39;m having trouble getting anybody to look at it.  Is anybody else having problems with <code>evalJS</code> on Android?  If so please say so and &quot;watch&quot; the bug so it gets noticed!!  </p>
<p>In the bug I also list a similar bug that was apparently fixed, but the last comment on that bug is from somebody who seems to be seeing the same problem.</p>
<p>Thank you!!!</p>
<p>-Ryan</p>

							<p>You state that your &quot;having trouble getting anyone to look at it&quot; in regards to your ticket. I pulled up your ticket, and it looks like you filed it 3 days ago, is that correct? If so, the community JIRA tickets must first be tested by my team, before moving into the core project JIRA, this step can take up to a few days.</p>
<p>If you require a faster turn around time, we do have paid support with guaranteed response times.</p>
<p>All that said, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-4455">here</a> is a ticket that looks to be very close to yours that has already been submitted to the core team. Please let me know if this is the same issue, or just similar.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Matt,</p>
<p>My apologies, I didn&#39;t mean to imply anything negative about Appcelerator!  I certainly understand the logic of evaluating bugs submitted by the community before moving to the core JIRA.</p>
<p>Anyways, the ticket you list is similar, but not the same, least as I can tell.  Looks like there are some quirks with evalJS on Android.</p>
<p>Thank you and keep up the good work on Titanium!!</p>
<p>-Ryan</p>

										<p><p>No problem at all, just wanted to be transparent in the situation, as well as give you information as to how to expedite the process if needed.</p>
<p>Very well, should not be that much longer and we will test&#x2F;review fully your ticket, and get that ball rolling then :)</p>

										<p><p>@Matt @Ryan, please try both issues again with CI 1.8. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-4885">TIMOB-4885</a> was pushed a while back and may address both of those issues.</p>

							<p>@Matt @Don Assuming I installed the 1.8 CI SDK and configured it correctly, the same problem still exists using the test case included with the bug I created.</p>

										<p><p>@Ryan are you testing on an Android 2.3.X emulator? That&#39;s fundamentally broken with a Google bug and has been non-functional since Dec 2010 at least.</p>

										<p><p>what exactly does this mean? that we should not be using the 2.3.x emulator… then which one.</p>
<p>i normally test on device, but I was curious</p>

										<p><p>@Don: Yes, I&#39;m testing on the 2.3 emulator.  I can try using the 2.2 emulator on Monday and I&#39;ll let you know what happens.</p>
<p>@Aaron:  Good question, if 2.3 is horribly broken, will the 2.2 emulator suffice?  I&#39;m guessing &quot;yes&quot; but just wondering if there are any other hidden deficiencies with emulators of which I should be aware.</p>

										<p><p>@Don @Aaron: OK, so it seems to work on the 2.2 emulator.  Shame on Google for breaking the 2.3 emulator so much.  Sorry for wasting your time but trying a different emulator was one thing I didn&#39;t think of.</p>
