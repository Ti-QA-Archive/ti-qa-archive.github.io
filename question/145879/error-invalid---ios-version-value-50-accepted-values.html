							<div><p>I had the exact same problem with the difference that I am using Mac Lion instead of Snow Leopard.  This is not relevant to the problem.  The problem is when you update XCode you need to update the iOS configuration in Titanium Studio to point to the latest XCode installation.  The iPhone Simulator is defined within the XCode installation.  I re-configured the Titanium Studio 3.0 iOS SDK configuration by executing the following command on a Terminal window.  Then I restarted Titanium Studio 3.0 and it works by automatically selecting 5.1 as the iPhone simulator version.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I have been doing extensive tests with 3.0.0 GA and not come across this problem yet.  Can you check to make sure that XCODE is up to date and this is the only thing jumping out at me right now.</p>
<p>Also what OSX version are you running?</p>

										<p><p>Log into the apple developer account that you have, go to the iOS Dev Center, underneath the latest xcode is a link to the old versions.  Inside this long list simply type xcode 4.2 and it pops up for you to download.</p>

<p>BTW you do know people answering question here are doing in their own free time for no financial reward - just so they can help people like you who have a problem.</p>
<p>I do hope you were not the person who marked the answer to this question down - just because you are frustrated.</p>

										<p><p>So my offer to help, my explanation on how best to get that help, my pointing out that you had not created a new question and you were limiting your exposure to others who can help - this was rude?</p>
<p>You do realise that the person who asks the original question is the person who CHOOSES to mark the question as answered when THEY are happy - I have no control over that.</p>
<p>You chose to ask your question inside someone else&#39;s question AFTER they marked it answered - so your question will NOT be seen by ANYONE else who is looking to help unanswered questions.</p>
<p>As you are clearly frustrated I will once again put your attitude that and not a general believe that everyone else is here to serve you.</p>
<p>So if you want your question asked - ask it as an actual question - as otherwise you are only HURTING YOURSELF!</p>
