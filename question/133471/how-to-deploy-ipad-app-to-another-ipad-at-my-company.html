			<h1>How to deploy iPad app to another iPad at my company</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>So I got my Ti iPad app deployed to my personal iPad device. But now I need to deploy it to my client&#39;s ipad for testing and approval. How exactly do I do this? I don&#39;t think it has to go through the full-blown App Store. I read something about being able to deploy this on up to 100 devices on our dev account. That is more than enough. I know on apple developer site I can register my client&#39;s ipad&#39;s UDID.</p>
<p>But how do I actually push the app to his ipad? Or how does he download it?</p>

							<p>I certainly would give <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;testflightapp.com">TestFlight</a> a try!</p>

										<p><p>Mark, TestFlight seems awesome, but I&#39;m stuck on 1 thing. Everything&#39;s installed, my client installed testflight, and everything is done. But I can&#39;t find how to push the app to him. He cannot pull it. There was a vague reference on TF that I need to &quot;build the app with the tester&#39;s device registration included&quot; or something like that. Argg! This is obviously an important step with no info anywhere on how to do it. Help.</p>

										<p><p>These are basically the steps you should follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Let the customer register its device in TestFlight so you get its UDID;</li>
<li>Add the UDID to the list of devices in Apples provisioning portal;</li>
<li>Add the device to the provisioning certificate;</li>
<li>Download the certificate;</li>
<li>Build the app in Titanium Studio to a device, select the just downloaded certicate;</li>
<li>Upload the IPA you find in the build folder to TestFlight;</li>
<li>Add the client as a tester in TestFlight</li>
</ol>

							<p>Hi, you dont use a development profile you must create an Adhoc provisioning profile, download it, double-click it to install into XCode. Then in Ti Studio compile for &quot;App Store&quot; and select the downloaded Adhoc provisioning profile.  That is the one that is allowed to be used against 100 devices per year.</p>
<p>Send that output .ipa to the client - They must drag&#x2F;drop it into iTunes to install there, then synch to their device.</p>

							<p>Once you&#39;ve added the device to the developer profile and compiled the app for your device.  You then go into: &lt;app_root&gt;&#x2F;build&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;build&#x2F;Debug-iphoneos</p>
<p>There you will see your &lt;appname&gt;.ipa</p>
<p>Send that to your client.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Paul. That makes sense; the only thing I&#39;m wondering about now is what the client does with the ipa? Do they double-click it and iTunes knows what to do? Do they have to copy the file to the ipad somehow? What do I tell the client to do with the ipa?</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

										<p><p>Paul, I&#39;m curious about your comment that I can just add it via Xcode. That&#39;s on my local mac. How would doing that magically transport it to my client&#39;s device 20 miles away? Just trying to understand.</p>

										<p><p>Paul, if I add it via Xcode, how will my client get it 20 miles away? Isn&#39;t Xcode just a local thing on my Mac? Does it communicate up to apple server somehow?</p>
