			<p>Using Titanium, what is the best method to create the following:-</p>
<ol>
<li>Open any window, regardless of which window&#x2F;code&#x2F;tab-group opened the current window</li>
<li>Control audio tracks, regardless of which window&#x2F;code&#x2F;tab-group is currently opened (ie: Window #6 can start the audio, Window #2 can stop it)</li>
<li>When the audio stops, what&#39;s the best method of controlling an element on every window, like a &quot;Now Playing&quot; Button</li>
</ol>
<p>A year ago, I tried setting up the file structure in Titanium as I thought would be appropriate, but the iPhone application created multiple threads and often code could not control other components on a separate thread. So I pushed the whole application into a single file and it worked fine.</p>
<p>Now the application needs to grow and it really isn&#39;t friendly having all the code in a single file.</p>

							<p>If you use a commonjs structure, then you can reuse commonjs modules as components that can control items from your app from any window&#x2F;view&#x2F;etc. The idea is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your audio tracks are going to be launched and controlled from your main application window.</li>
<li>You&#39;re going to create a NowPlaying.js button module that will maintain control of your currently playing track</li>
<li>You can then require() that module in any window and basically reuse that component anywhere</li>
<li>When you interact with that button ie: stop,play,pause,etc, you&#39;ll send events back to the main app window using application event listeners that will allow you actually control the audio track. </li>
</ul>
<p>One thing that you&#39;ll have to keep in mind is that while you navigate windows, things in your Now Playing view may change. So as you focus on each window, you&#39;ll have to check the component on that page and make sure that its up to date and displaying the correct info for whats currently playing.</p>

										<p><p>Firstly, thanks for your quick response. Regarding your last paragraph, can the audio controller remove the &quot;Now Playing&quot; button when the audio track stops?</p>
<p>Hopefully this can be done without a loop constantly checking if an audio file is playing.</p>

										<p><p>Its really just going to depend on how you control your views&#x2F;windows. If you close your windows every time, then its easy, when the window reloads, the now playing button knows that nothing is playing and you don&#39;t have to draw anything to the screen. However, if you&#39;re showing&#x2F;hiding views on a single window, then you&#39;ll have to find a way to track them and loop over them. This really shouldn&#39;t be a problem as you should be using the former method anyway. Its going to save you a ton of headache. The only reason I brought up the other scenario is because in your question you said &quot;windows&#x2F;views&#x2F;etc&quot;, I was just covering all the bases.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks again Anthony, there are multiple windows in the application however the user can stay on a window for a long period of time, one screen in particular can have users there for an hour. It would be great to not use a loop to frequently check if audio tracks are still playing.</p>
<p>Instead, I would rather use the audio end event to hide the &quot;Now Playing&quot; buttons across all the views&#x2F;windows.</p>

										<p><p>Oh yea, that will be the way it should happen. Once the audio end event fires, you can talk back to both the current window and the now playing module and update them accordingly. Those should be the only 2 things you have to worry about. And both can be handled with a simple App level event.</p>
<p>The breakdown on this is to just make sure that you add App level events for the things that you need to listen for inside each module. This way, when those events get called, any module that is currently open will receive the event and update accordingly.</p>

										<p><p>Just to verify, I will need to setup a code structure similar to the following:</p>
<p>app.js</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'audio-controller.js'</span>);
</code></pre><p>audio-controller.js</p>

										<p><p>Almost, you&#39;re going to need that audio stopped listener in both your now playing button module as well as any module that displays the now playing button. In the now playing module, you&#39;re not going to be able to hide any visible views, but you will be able to update the now playing vars so that subsequent loads of the button know that there is nothing playing.<br>Then, in any windows that display the now playing button, you&#39;ll also want to listen for the audio-stopped event so you can actually remove the button from the window. So its pretty much everything that you have with just a minor tweak:</p>
<p>now-paying-button.js</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Ti.App.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'audio-stopped'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-comment">/* Update now playing info for this module, you can't hide the button here, because it exists in the view heirarchy of other modules */</span>
});
</code></pre><p>detail-window.js</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Ti.App.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'audio-stopped'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-comment">/* This is where you'll remove the now playing button from the view */</span>
});
</code></pre></p>
