			<h1>Calling a php script</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>This is for a desktop app.</p>
<p>So I have my my index.php which is my main page that has a button on it.  When I press the button I want to call a php script, update.php, that will query my database and fill a div on index.php with update.php output.  Which Ishould be in the form of an echo.  Problem is I can&#39;t get this to work and I&#39;m not quite sure how to do it.  </p>
<p>I am using jquery to do all my javascript, if that matters.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help.</p>

							<p>You should get this to work outside of Titanium first, there are examples on the JQuery site.</p>
<p>basically you want to tie the click handler of the button to something like</p>
<p>$(&quot;#my_div&quot;).load(my_url);</p>
<p>and your div will be updated.  You should be able to get this to work in a plain html file first, then load it into titanium.</p>

							<p>The trick to using PHP is to understand that Titanium basically blends your PHP code and your JavaScript together when it builds the executable, but you have to include your PHP in the proper manner.</p>
<p>This page really says it all:<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;doc&#x2F;desktop&#x2F;php</p>
<p>Any PHP code that is wrapped in &lt;?php ?&gt; tags will be <em>preprocessed</em>, which means it only runs once when the program starts. It sounds like you want to execute your PHP code on-demand, in which case your PHP code should be wrapped in &lt;script type=&quot;text&#x2F;php&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;script&gt; tags. Whatever functions you declare in there can be called directly from JavaScript&#x2F;jQuery, just as though you&#39;d written them in JS.</p>
<p>It&#39;s kind of a mind-bender, really, but you&#39;ll slowly start to realize that your JS now has access to things like MySQL, and you PHP has direct access to the DOM…</p>

										<p><p>Pointer, this little comment here has changed my life :-)<br>I have been trying to approach Ti development as a client&#x2F;server environment - but it&#39;s not. You don&#39;t need to post anything, you just make your updates using the DOM id&#39;s and sending the values to a database. All the updates you need to do can be wrapped up either php or javascript classes. This has been a Eureka moment!</p>
