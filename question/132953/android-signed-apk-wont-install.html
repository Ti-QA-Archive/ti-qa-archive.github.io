			<h1>Android signed .apk won&#39;t install</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>So I jumped through all the hoops (I think) to create a certificate using keytool. Next I used Titanium Studio to package it up. Gave it the keystore location, password, etc. All seemed well. Before putting it in Android Market Place I wanted to test it, so I emaild it to my gmail account and attached the signed .apk file. Got a nice install option right in my gmail on the phone but when I click it I get teh following error:</p>
<p>There is a problem parsing the package</p>
<p>That is all, nothing else. Any suggestions???</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

										<p><p>Third,</p>
<p>Be sure your API level tag is correct.  If your minimum sdk was lets say 2.3 and your device is 2.2, the market would filter this out for you.</p>

										<p><p>Fourth,<br>You can use the key tools to verify the signature.</p>
<p><code>jarsigner -verify myapk.apk</code></p>

<p>Market can&#39;t be an issue as I am emailing it to myself and trying to install from gmail as an attachment.</p>
<p>Anything else?</p>

<p>Copy the apk to the device&#39;s SD card another way and use a file browser to open it.  It is possible that the transfer of the APK came across as text not a binary file.</p>

										<p><p>re market and minsdk:</p>
<p>You can try to force an app that was built to an SDK higher than a device manually.  It will fail with the parse error. I doubt this is the problem as you have had the dev signed app running.</p>

							<p>Got it to work, but not sure it is a viable solution. If I copy the file to my phone&#39;s SD storage it will show up under &quot;downloads&quot; in apps&#x2F;launcher. If I try to install from there same parse error. I tried emailing the attachment do a non-gmail account and the .apk file won&#39;t show up correctly it shows up as a winmail.dat file, not sure if that is ISP driven or what.</p>
<p>What does work is copying the file to SD storage and using a 3rd party file browser (Astro), tapping and selecting install option.</p>
<p>Seems like it should work as documented. On Appcelerator wiki they offer up three solutions for deployment. 1) Market 2) Url from web site 3) attachment to gmail account.</p>
<p>I like the attachment in gmail as it gives user easy to click install option. Still the user must accept apps not from the Market, but I thought this would be an easy way to test with a small group of users prior to deployment to Market.</p>
<p>Never having deployed app to Market I want to know it will work first before I turn my client loose on it. Can anyone tell me if it is easy&#x2F;quick to take an app out of the market if I deploy it and it does not install quickly?</p>
<p>Thank for any and all help!</p>
