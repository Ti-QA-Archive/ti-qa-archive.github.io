			<h1>Best Practices for UI in TiBH 270 lab</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>SDK 3.1.2 GA.  This is a training question.  As I go through the TIBounty Hunter labs,  I&#39;m searching for &quot;Best Practices&quot; for UI development in Titanium.  I know that the use of a common.js and required () is stated as a best practice in tutorial.   In TiBH 270 lab, I found ~&#x2F;ui&#x2F;common&#x2F;AddWindow.js  is required by ~&#x2F;ui&#x2F;handheld&#x2F;ApplicationWindow.js.   Is this another form of the common.js and required () best practice?</p>

							<p>The pattern you refer to was our quick-n-dirty limited example of an architectural pattern – it was not meant as a best practice, only one way you could accomplish the task at hand.</p>
<p>Alloy is the preferred architectural pattern. When using Alloy, you would not organize files and require in UI components in the way shown in those older training labs. If you chose to not use Alloy, you must still create your own architectural pattern. You could use the form shown in those labs, though it might not meet the needs of a significantly complex application.</p>
<p>So, what do I mean by architectural pattern?</p>
<ul>
<li>Architectural pattern: defines your project&#39;s overall architecture, how your files are organized, how to you separate form &amp; function, how you centralize stylistic control, etc. Also called strategic patterns, these are defined before the project begins and are difficult to change once you&#39;ve started. Alloy is a strategic&#x2F;architectural pattern.</li>
<li>Tactical pattern: answers questions like: Do I implement this component as a singleton? Will I use the factory or module pattern for a component? Will I need this UI component once or repeatedly in my app? Tactical patterns are set on a case-by-case basis, vary throughout your app, and can typically be swapped mid-stream without major repercussions. CommonJS is a tactical pattern.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alloy imposes a common, documented architecture. Keep in mind that Alloy generates CommonJS code as its output. You can, and should, continue to use CommonJS techniques for your tactical coding decisions.</p>
<p>It bears repeating: if you chose to not use Alloy, you must still create your own architectural pattern. The pattern shown in the older labs is a limited example of such a pattern. It might not meet your needs. We do not have a &quot;best practice&quot; architectural pattern other than Alloy to recommend.</p>

										<p><p>Tim,</p>
<p>Many thanks for clearing this up for me.  I will study Alloy and use it in app development to gain a sure-footed Architectural pattern.</p>
