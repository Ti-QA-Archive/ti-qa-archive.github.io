<p>What&#39;s the deal?  So the person that is NOT the author can just close a question and mark themselves as the person that answered it?  Uncool.</p>
<p>[edit]</p>
<p>I left this community because of the censorship that took place here.  I popped back in to see what was up and I see this question had an answer marked as best but I didn&#39;t do it.  There is something immensely wrong with this company if they feel that they need to edit and censor people in the Q&#x2F;A area.  </p>
<p>I spent many hours helping people with questions and have submitted bug reports and code for others to use.  The reward I got for my time was people at Appcelerator deciding they wanted to close questions and mark them as answered for no reason whatsoever.  If this is the culture of the company it does not bode well for their future or the product. </p>
<p>Nothing I had previously said was controversial.  My first censored Q&#x2F;A was a link to a patched version of Titanium that I had built to get past issues that they were not addressing.  Apparently that struck a nerve and they closed it even though people were using what I had created and they had questions.  </p>
<p>The fact is I would not have made a custom build if they had put some priority into the bugs that are present.  I had posted several tickets last year and they had only been addressed in the past few weeks even though they caused repeatable crashes or demonstrated defects in portions of the API that I felt were important.   </p>
<p>I challenge someone from Appcelerator to explain censorship in Q&#x2F;A when there was no rudeness or controversial topics.  I&#39;m sure I won&#39;t get an answer and this will be edited or deleted.</p>

							<p>It did happen and Scott from Appcelerator is the one that did it.  He answered a question that <em>I</em> started and then marked it as closed.  I find it unacceptable and I want to know why he thinks that it was OK to do this.  </p>

							<p>No, that is not possible unless that person opens another account purely for that purpose.  In my view, that would be a bit sad.</p>
