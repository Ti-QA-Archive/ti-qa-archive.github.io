			<h1>Mulitple Phones/Users - 1 Database. Any ideas or best practices?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>This is a generic question, not a problem. I&#39;m working on a project where I&#39;d like to see multiple people using 1 database, being able to read &amp; write from it. I would like to use ACS, but it doesn&#39;t look like there is database support for it. </p>
<p>There may be simultaneous writing, which is why I&#39;m not just downloading and uploading the database anytime there needs to be data added. About all I could think of at this point is a php system in between the phone app and a web-based db and with that runs some scripts that update and&#x2F;or download data. </p>
<p>Anyone have any other thoughts or ideas? Thanks.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>It is VERY common in these circumstances to create an API to your own web server and host the data there.</p>
<p>Databases have many obvious advantages, including; multiple users, concurrent writes, fast retrieval of data, central location, security (provided you add some).</p>
<p>To create a simple API it need be nor more complicated than creating a PHP (in your case) and where required getting any parameters sent, processing the request and sending back data.  Data is usually in the form of; HTML, text, XML and JSON - with JSON being the currently preferred format for most (not all) communications with the server, particularly due to the built in support in many server scripting languages (PHP included) and the vastly simple way that you can work with it in JavaScript.</p>
<p>I would encourage some sort of security otherwise your private app APIs will become public and that may end up being a world of hurt you should not be dealing with.</p>
<p>You would connect to and from the server using <strong>httpClient</strong>.</p>
