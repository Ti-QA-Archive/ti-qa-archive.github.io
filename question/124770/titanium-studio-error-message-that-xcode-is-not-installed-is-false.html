							<p>xCode 3.2.5 is not the latest release version (4.1.x is).</p>
<p>xCode 3.2.5 is not the latest 3.x era release either (3.2.6 is).</p>
<p>With that said, there were known installer problems with even 4.1 that sometimes failed to set system variables and paths properly leading to the same problems you are experiencing with 3.2.5 (unreferenced sdk locations).</p>
<p>The solution there was to reinstall 4.1 (and then later on 4.1.x was released to address this and the itunes issue).  This would prevent a problem for you, as 3.2.5 will not install under Lion.  Can run if exists before the upgrade.</p>
