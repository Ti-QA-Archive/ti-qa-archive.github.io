			<p>Titanium Studio &amp; Android Studio</p>
<p>I got a new Laptop (Win 8.1 64 bit) and now funny things are going on. I have Androidstudio installed that comes with an own sdk folder when installed. This is the same as the downloadable sdk to work with eclipse (at least i think so… has same folders and all).</p>
<p>Android Studio works fine with the SDK, be it Emulators or real Devices. Then i also had to install Titanium to work on an older project. Sadly i cannot get Titanium to work with any sdk now. I entered the right path to the SDK in Titanium of course and on the frontpage it shows me that Android SDK is correctly configured. But whenever i run a project i dont have any Android based options, only Preview in Web. So then i looked back into the Preferences and here it shows suddenly that theres no Android SDK in the specified folder. Even there is one in of course…</p>
<p>I switch back on Frontpage and still theres a green dot and the Android-Confi and it shows all good.</p>
<p>Now when i play around with the paths in the Preferences window weired things happen… Sometimes i can choose a Emulator Device that is already in the AVD-Manager but it disappears after i leave the menu….</p>
<p>I tried many things already, also download the standalone SDK from google, its the same. Also when i hit the Setup Button i get the options to download all the sdks, with 2 of them greyed-out and all others unchecked. But i have nearly every API Version completley installed, also for example 2.3.3 that is unchecked here. If i check and want to configure it downloads, installs and then nothing happens… When going back into the menu the same is checked&#x2F;unchecked like before. But no error message when downloadeing.</p>
<p>What can it be?</p>
