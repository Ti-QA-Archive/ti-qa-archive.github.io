		<section>
			<p>Just curious (for planning purposes), do you plan on release bug fix service packs for the SDK or is 1.7 next?  I have a bug that is preventing me from releasing my app on 1.6 and want to get an idea of when the fix will be in a release.</p>
<p>FYI the bug in question is:<br>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32238-titanium-mobile&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;3220-android-new-activityproxy-being-created-for-light-weight-windows</p>

							<p>Are you aware of the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.appcelerator.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;continuous_builds.html">continuous builds</a>?</p>
<p>Usually a few times a day a new SDK is published.  You can get beta 1.7.x builds, or select a 1.6.1 or even 1.5.x or 1.4.x SDK level.  You may want to start with the most recent 1.6.x build as it should be more stable than a 1.7.x build.</p>

										<p><p>I was aware, but I guess I was curious if a more stable option existed (e.g. an official 1.6.1 release).  That said I&#39;m fine experimenting with a cont build.  How can I tell what build the fix I need is in?</p>

										<p><p>AFAIK, all the 1.6.x releases should still be considered stable but not the 1.7.x releases.  Perhaps I am wrong, but that is my assumption.  In terms of telling what build the fix is in, my best guess is to look at the timestamp of the lighthouse ticket where it is first mentioned it is fixed-in-qa.  Then either test builds created after that point in time, or follow the commit links at the bottom of a fixed-in-qa (or resolved) message to find the actual source changes.  You could then implement those in your own copy of the SDK, if you were more comfortable keeping your existing 1.6.x base as otherwise stable.  For the ticket you referenced, that seems to be <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_mobile&#x2F;commit&#x2F;62eb136eb4ef9e4e6f0e260a295da565480169f4">here</a>.</p>
