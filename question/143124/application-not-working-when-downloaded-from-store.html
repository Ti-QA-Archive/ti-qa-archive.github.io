							<div><p>Hello Mastanvali,</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll agree, that your question doesn&#39;t gives us much to work with. I strongly suggest you have a look at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;ask">the guidelines to follow</a> when asking a question.</p>
<ul>
<li>What exactly do you mean by: &quot;not working&quot;? This could mean many things. (application not starting, bug, problem during installation)</li>
<li>Are you absolutely sure your packaged application works well?</li>
<li>Have you tested it on different devices?</li>
</ul>
<p>You also mention that there may be a problem with 3G. Again, this is pretty <em>vague</em> to say the least. How would 3G affect your application? Does it make use of 3G in a specific way.</p>

							<div><p>Okay….</p>
<p>What does your login window <strong>do</strong> actually?</p>
<p>You will have to be more precise than that if you really want people here to understand your issue.</p>
