			<h1>GUI builder</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am asking about the best way to design GUI, as ForgedUI(looked OK) is closed for business(stopped) now and Visual-UI as i checked has many issues till now, I can use js code for GUI or use alloy.</p>
<p>It is very inefficient and annoying to write code for GUI, a GUI designer is a life saver</p>
<p>so please can someone tell me what is best way to design GUI for IOS  or how to automate (I have seen some post for this but not very clear)</p>
<p>for Android i did not see any article to help automate GUI creation</p>
<p>really this is causing appcelerator to be useless and I dont know how a developer can use it for real apps</p>
<p>help will be highly appreciated</p>

							<div><p>Definitely a GUI designer can make developing an app simpler, but Titanium isn&#39;t useless without one. In fact many award winning applications were written the normal way and that didn&#39;t decrease their value.</p>
<p>As you said some GUI builders were discontinued, and that MAY be because of the lack of adoption. Anyway Titanium is community driven, so if you think that it was not the case, you can try building a business around this by creating your GUI builder, or share it with the community so everyone can benefit.</p>
<p>I honestly thought about creating one but I wasn&#39;t motivated because that wasn&#39;t a major issue for me even for the big projects.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Firstly apologies to Dan and Nick as I felt this should be a separate answer - I support both of your positions but felt my own comments need their own answer.</p>
<p>I am disappointed by your suggestion that Appcelerator to be useless - it seems strange that your belief that an entire development solution can be rendered useless by something that does not exist and nobody else appears to be in a desperate for.</p>
<p>Whilst I do understand there is a section of the developer community that feel more comfortable using a visual editor when developing you rarely find a seasoned developer that ever uses that editor - normally they use their preferred text editor like; Sublime or Notepad++ depending on OS.</p>
<p>In reality the visual side of the app is such a small percentage of the final app code that it really adds nothing to the development process in any meaningful way (more on this later).  With a visual editor you can become very lazy as the hope is that the editor itself writes your code and you end up never learning how to code the important parts that links things together.</p>
<p>There are thousands upon thousands upon thousands of apps being developed by more than 540,000 developers (at the time of writing) in Titanium (and the Appcelerator enterprise version), some using Alloy (framework) and some not.  But almost none of these are using a visual IDE (there have been a few visual editors but non have taken off as far as I am aware).</p>
<p>Coding is an art, something you create and manipulate to manage your app - your app develops as you go and grows with each need to change things.  You do not create a table by dragging in on to the screen - you add data to the screen in a meaningful way that just happens to use a table.  This is how you design - by working out the user experience - the user journey, how and where you gain the data to display, how and where you ask for more.</p>
<p>You plan your app by sketching out potential screens, potentially using a wire-framing tool or service, you determine if what you think you need to use to show create your interface is what you should be using.  You define your app look and feel and ideally maintain that going through the process of building the app, so define colours, fonts, sizes and style - all that are reused often and well considered.</p>
<p>By saying Appcelerator (Titanium) is useless is without a visual IDE is insulting to all those who have produced there own apps for; themselves, their friends, their company, their clients.  Some who have no budget but spend their free time creating their app, to those with enterprise level budgets with teams of developers, designers, user experience and testers.</p>
<p>You mentioned above that Dan is an expert (#7) he is and a good one, you also have an answer from Nick who is also an expert (#6) and just as good - and now this one from me, I am an expert (#1) and I think I do good work - certainly my clients from small businesses to enterprise clients to military contracts and more agree.  You also have (at the time of writing) a large number of negative votes on the question by those who clearly disagree with your logic.</p>
<p>If you are new to Appcelerator Titanium then you should read the guides in the documentation, have a play with the examples - start with alloy - it is a really fast way to plan and develop your app and in many ways easier than an visual IDE without losing the same things I mentioned above.</p>
<p>So I would like to end this with - if you are unable to use Appcelerator Titanium without and IDE then I am sorry but you will not be able to use Titanium - you will be missed as we like everyone to give the solution a good and fair go.  It is a shame as you are going to be missing out on something great.</p>

							<p>Use Alloy to develop your Apps. Then you can take advantage of the Alloy xml markup language to put together your UI.  It&#39;s then no different to creating a web page (tags in Alloy markup and styled in .tss files)</p>

										<p><p>Hi Tamer,</p>
<p>I would take on board the comments that Dan made and I agree that WYSIWYG development tools are a poor replacement for pixel perfect alignment by hand-coding.</p>
<p>I would also suggest you look at altering your development work flow to include <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tishadow.yydigital.com&#x2F;">Ti Shadow</a>.  With this you can very rapidly deploy and redeploy your app to see the effect of UI changes as you make them.</p>
<p>At this point hand-coding your UI becomes the much preferred way of designing the UI</p>

							<p>I think that Tamer wasn&#39;t trying to offend Titanium but it&#39;s more a transliteration mistake.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips to help you write professional code and successful projects:</p>
<p>1- Ask for complete sketches before starting<br>   To make sure the client knows what he wants exactly. Ask for complete sketches and a document containing the scope and all features listed. This will create a mutual understanding of the tasks and save you a lot of time later determining if any task is inside or outside the scope.</p>
<p>2- Use Alloy<br>    Although some developers can write high quality classic Javascript I definitely advise using Alloy. This way anybody reading the code or continuing development won&#39;t have a hard time to get up and running.</p>
<p>3- Keep styling to the end<br>   start creating the skeleton xml and basic layout tss. You may use Jade to create the views faster http:&#x2F;&#x2F;naltatis.github.io&#x2F;jade-syntax-docs&#x2F;, and make it clear you&#39;re keeping styling to the end to avoid distractions. </p>
<p>4- Determine when you need a widget and when a controller is enough<br>    You&#39;ll need widgets for example for login or any view that you plan to reuse in multiple projects or versions of the same app. Break down the screens to views and subviews and create separate controllers for independent ones.</p>
<p>5- Ensure your code remains cross platform<br>    If you&#39;re writing a cross platform app make sure you handle appropriately platform specific code that may break the app on the other platforms. For the views use platform specific tags or folders http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Alloy_Concepts-section-34636240_AlloyConcepts-Platform-SpecificResources, and for the controllers use Alloy directives like OS_IOS to write code for a specific platform.<br>    Even if you&#39;re writing for one or two platforms keep in mind that support for other platforms is on the way and make sure your code takes this into consideration. This will save you a lot of effort later, to support Windows phones for example.</p>
<p>6- Organize your Javascript files<br>    Organize your code appropriately, for example don&#39;t put data access or API access code directly inside the controllers. Use commonJS modules for that, and arrange them to allow easy switching between different backend vendors and other data sources. This way if the client decided he wants to switch from his own managed backend to ACS the transition will be smooth.</p>
<p>7- Read Titanium logs<br>    When running the app on simulator, Titanium provides a wealth of feedback and advices in its logs. Make sure to read the output of the console at the same time you&#39;re testing the app and address any warnings.</p>
<p>8- Keep an eye on community tools<br>    Many active members of the community are sharing tools and tips to make other developers&#39; life easier. Try evaluating tools like TiShadow https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dbankier&#x2F;TiShadow, Ti-mocha https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tonylukasavage&#x2F;ti-mocha and RapidDev https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appersonlabs&#x2F;RapidDev</p>
<p>9- Follow developers&#39; blogs and twitter accounts<br>    Keep updated with the latest information, bookmark any link you find useful, read and understand code shared by the professionals instead of just copy pasting it.</p>
<p>I hope you find these tips useful</p>

							<p>Hi Dan Tamas, I see that you are an Appcelerator expert, Do you have an answer that can help me, I will apreciate that highly</p>
<p>how are you able to write more complex app for ipad with many control at each window in good amount of time if there is a good answer to this I will be extremely happy, as appcelerator has many many great features, if I can find a way for building GUI in reasonable way that will make my life much more easier</p>
<p>again any help will be a life saver for e rally</p>
<p>thank you</p>

										<p><p>While a GUI will &quot;help&quot; you make the UI really fast, you will lose time tweaking it or fix things if the ide goes nuts and create shitty code.<br>I personally  useTextMate which has an amazing autocomplete.</p>
<p>You could use a snippet manager, like CodeBox, where you could define your own snippets and simply insert them in the editor.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sorry to disappoint you but I personally think that a programmer doesn&#39;t need a GUI to write code. However, I ain&#39;t gonna say that &quot;real programmers do this and not that&quot;. My &quot;joke&quot; reaction was to your statement that Ti is useless without a GUI.</p>
<p>I understand you want to save time, but I can assure you there are lots of amazing apps written in Ti, and the time saving part comes from a routine you set for yourself, some tools maybe, etc.<br>Also Nick&#39;s advice is a very good one, it&#39;s fairly easy to develop with Alloy, especially form the UI point of view.</p>
<p>Makes sense ?</p>
