			<h1>after 1.6 RC upgrade, window show hide issue</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Is anyone else having this issue after upgrading to Titanium 1.6 RC mobile sdk.?</p>
<p>It plays up in the following way.<br>My code is pretty simple was showing and hiding a window, but since upgrading from 1.5.1 to 1.6 RC, when I call the window to show on the 3rd time, it doesn&#39;t show!<br>It works fine in the iphone emulator but this happens when testing on an iphone4 device.</p>
<p>My app structure similar to Tweetanium. With separate namespaces, and returning myWin after tt.ui.createMyWindow().</p>
<p>Summary code…</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// application window ---------------</span>
tt.ui.winBrowse = twg.ui.createBrowseWindow();
tt.ui.winSettings = twg.ui.createSettingsWindow();
tt.ui.winBrowse.open();
tt.ui.winSettings.open();    
tt.ui.winBrowse.show();

<span class="hljs-comment">// browse window ---------------</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// ...code...</span>
buttonSettings.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'touchstart'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span>{
<span class="hljs-comment">// ! the third time this is called, it doesn't work on the iphone but works fine on </span>
tt.ui.winSettings.show();
});

							<p>Could you use a view instead of a window? Unless you need the features of a window, a view should do just about everything you&#39;d likely need. I don&#39;t know if it would hide&#x2F;show any better. I haven&#39;t had troubles but ymmv.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Tim, I found the solution ended up being because the scrollView was crashing when needing to calculate the contentHeight auto from multiple children with auto heights. By putting those multiple children views within a single view then adding it to the scrollView this seems to have resolved the problem. Your comment was much appreciated!</p>

							<p>Hi, thanks for your reply. I swapped over to views instead of window but unfortunately it&#39;s still happening. On the third myView.show(). It doesn&#39;t show.</p>
<p>More info…<br>The code on that view is definately running.<br>I trace alerted it.<br>It even says that myView.visible == visible.<br>But I can&#39;t see it.</p>
<p>If anyone can think of anything else, please let me know. Many thanks for your consideration!</p>

							<p>I broke down different bits of the page that was breaking. </p>
<p>It looks like it&#39;s not the show hide issue for windows or views.</p>
<p>The problem has been isolated to a label that contains text.<br>I&#39;m assigning quite a lot of text to this label. It seems to be what is breaking it!</p>
<p>Is there a limit to the size the text that can be contained in labels?<br>Memory or character limit that would cause it to break on the hardware?</p>

										<p><p>Finally found the answer. Thank you Lord! The show&#x2F;hide issue was only a symptom of the deeper issue. So was the apparent memory&#x2F;character limit. </p>
<p>Turns out it was when the variable &#39;auto&#39; heights of the children within a scrollview, seemed to cause the parent scrollview not to show. By putting it all the auto height children within a normal view, then adding it to the scrollview, this resolved the problem.</p>
<p>Perhaps, it is because then the scrollview only needs to calculate the contentheight:&#39;auto&#39;, once from the single child rather than from the multiple children.<br>Hope this can help any others if you are getting weird issues with views&#x2F;windows suddenly not displaying because your scrollView is causing issues.</p>
<p>p.s. Just for extra safety - maybe redundant, I put a value for the children&#39;s height, then override it with auto later.</p>
