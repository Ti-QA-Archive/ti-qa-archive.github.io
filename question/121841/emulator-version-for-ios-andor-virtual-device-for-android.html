			<p>With Titanium Studio you can Run As &quot;iPhone&quot; or &quot;iPad&quot; or &quot;Android&quot; easily, however how do you select which version of the iPhone, iPad or Android you wish to target?</p>
<p>I know with Android Virtual Device Manager you can set up multiple Virtual devices, but it seems that Titanium always uses the profile called &quot;titanium_8_WXGA&quot;.  </p>
<p>With XCode you can select which version of the iPhone or iPad you wish to use.</p>
<p>How do you do this with Titaniun?</p>

							<p>Hi Matthew</p>
<p>As you can only run one Android emulator at a time, you must close the emulator and relaunch the app in order for the changes to take effect.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

										<p><p>Paul&#39;s answer from below is: &quot;When you click the Run button and choose Run Configurations, you can select the configuration (or amend or create new ones) you want to launch the emulator with, and then click the Run button.&quot;, which is the correct answer.</p>

							<p>Thanks for that answer, but that does not address the question.</p>
<p>Is there any way Titanium can select which profile to use when launching the Android emulator?</p>
<p>In the same way, is there any way Titanium can select which version of the iOS emulator to use when starting the emulator?</p>

										<p><p>Matthew, sorry, maybe I am simply misunderstanding what you are asking.</p>
<p>When you click the Run button and choose Run Configurations, you can select the configuration (or amend or create new ones) you want to launch the emulator with, and then click the Run button.</p>
<p>Is this what you want to know?</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, that is exactly what I wanted to know.  Excellent, thank you very much.  Greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>I&#39;m still having an Android issue though in that I get the emulator to load but can&#39;t see the app.  Any chance you could help?  Seems like you know a fair amount about appcelerator and I&#39;m just starting out.  Q&amp;A is here http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;121840&#x2F;android-snapshots-dont-work-and-app-wont-load</p>

										<p><p>OK, Matthew, I will be glad to help you in that thread. In the meantime, would you mind closing this question, so that others can find it more easily. Cheers</p>
