			<p>Hi, I have a folder on a website containing various type of files. The number of the files changes because I upload or delete files. Is there a way to get as array the list of the folder? Thanks.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Short answer - No.</p>
<p>Longer answer;</p>
<p>The directories of your website will almost certainly be non-listable by an external source.  A website CAN have a directory that provides a listing of the files but you have to change the folders permission to achieve this and often your web site will not provide access to this.  Plus if it was listable then the general public would also be able to list the same files if they managed to access that folder.</p>
<p>The normal solution here is to create a server side script using whatever language your website uses (PHP, ASP, ASP.net and so on) to iterate the file system and return a JSON array of the files and any other info related to each file you want.  A quick Google search for this sort of script will provide many choices.  Then your app calls that API to return the listing.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that your API should include some security so only your app can access the API. In case your are not sure an API is simply a script on yur web server that when called with zero or more parameters performs an action (like listing files or retrieving database records) and then returns those in a plain text file (NOT html) in a structure you can use easily - JSON being common, XML if you like pain or anything other format you can read on the app.</p>
