			<p>I created a new mobile project, saved it and it ran fine in the simulator. However, back in the Titanium console, when the project terminates, I get the following:</p>
<p>[ERROR] Error: Traceback (most recent call last):<br>File &quot;&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx&#x2F;1.5.1&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;builder.py&quot;, line 1112, in main<br>os.waitpid(sim.pid,0)<br>File &quot;&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx&#x2F;1.5.1&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;builder.py&quot;, line 1063, in handler<br>sys.exit(0)<br>SystemExit: 0</p>
<p>Should I be worried about this?</p>

							<div><p>Although it seems obvious, would you confirm your mobile platform, and 3rd-party and Titanium SDK versions you are using when you experience the problem? You should do this for every question you post to the Q&amp;A, and the most conenient place is in the question tags.

							<div><p>Paul…is the tracelog what&#39;s in the Titanium window?  If so, what I pasted up there (poorly I admit) was what it said.  This happens every time I launch the iPhone simulator, show the app, then click the STOP button to shut it down. FYI - Environment:  MAC OSX 10.6, 8GB memory, Titanium Developer 1.2.2, Apple iPhone SDK 4.02</p>

							<div><p>Additionally, if I click the &quot;Launch&quot; button, the iPhone Simulator opens and runs the app with no errors. If I then quit the iPhone Simulator itself (i.e. right click on it in the dock and choose &#39;Quit&#39;) everything is clean.  This sounds like a bug in the Developer.</p>

							<div><p>I forgot to answer Paul&#39;s question…there do not seem to be &quot;consequences&quot; to this bug, as everything does seem to shut down OK and relaunch the next time. While it&#39;s aesthetics, maybe there&#39;s more to it than I can see.</p>
