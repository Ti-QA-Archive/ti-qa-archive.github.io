			<p>Several questions have been asked here by others that I would like to see the answers to. I would ask my question here, but it&#39;s already been asked very succinctly by someone else. Would upgrading to a professional subscription get me the solution to my KitchenSink builds failing for the iPhone emulator? Do solutions for common problems somehow not make it to the non-pro board? If this is the case then I will definitely upgrade.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

							<p>@Kevin agree about voting but its broken.  I&#39;ve tried several times to vote on a question that&#39;s already at 1 and it never increments.  If you check out the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;votes">most votes</a> section you&#39;ll see they&#39;re all 1 so they&#39;ll never get up high enough to stand out.</p>

							<p>Hey Jeff,</p>
<p>This Q&amp;A section is community driven, and this week we&#39;ve been working on getting more questions answered and driving community involvement.  In terms of the Pro subscription, one of the benefits is that you get a direct hotline to the core dev team, so your questions will indeed get answered fast if you have a pro account.</p>
<p>Filtering answers to the pro questions back into the community is a good thought though- I will run that up the flagpole.</p>
<p>[edit]</p>
<p>Also, voting up questions is a good way to get them looked at by us.</p>
