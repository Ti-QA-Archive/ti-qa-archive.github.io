			<p>I am starting a new app and wanted to look into using the new Android ActionBar available to us in mobilesdk 3.0.  I looked and the native ActionBar is available in Android 3.0 (API level 11) and above.  </p>
<p>This got me thinking.  If I use this feature and require API 11 and above in my app would I be alienating a large portion of users?  I found this report from last month: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bgr.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;12&#x2F;04&#x2F;android-version-distribution-december-2012&#x2F;">linky</a></p>
<p>So it looks like I would be missing out on over 60% of all Android users.  I know I could check which OS version a user is using in my app and either use the new Android ActionBar or use my current custom ActionBar i use in all my previous apps.  Right now, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth handling both scenarios.</p>
<p>Just thought I&#39;d share…. Anyone have a differing opinion on not bothering to use this until more users can take advantage?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I have already gone down this decision tree that you are working through.</p>
<p>I have been waiting for this feature for some time and whilst grateful it is available was hoping there would be a fallback for previous version prior to 3.0 Android.</p>
<p>I am currently using a self created synthetic actionbar as I cannot afford to ignore the majority of users who seem stuck on 2.3.x Android.</p>
<p>So for some time to come - my apps will use my own version, done well it looks and acts (mostly) the same ;)</p>

										<p><p>I am using the one from the community app.  I plan on updating it with more features like the action bar spinner and the &#39;more&#39; button which drops down more items, but i haven&#39;t started on it yet. If you have anything like this done it would be much appreciated if you share!</p>

										<p><p>I am playing with mine at the moment - fit for purpose rather than fit for everything, should have it sorted in a couple of days I will pass it on when finished so you can see what you can do with it.  It will not support everything - just enough for the cross platform app I am working on at the moment.</p>

										<p><p>Awesome! I plan on starting my update to try and include some of the missing features this weekend…mainly I want to support the spinner and the &#39;more&#39; feature. I&#39;ll pass that along as well when I get everything worked out.</p>
