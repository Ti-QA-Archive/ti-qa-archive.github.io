			<h1>In-App Music Control</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;m developing an iPhone app designed to help people learn songs on guitar. I need various features of in-app music control to work for this. The idea is that the user can add a song from their music library to an in app list of songs they are trying to learn by means of the showMusicLibrary() command. When they select one of the songs they have added this way from the list, the song should start and repeat itself until stopped. So; I need the ability to save the id or url of the song selected from the showMusicLibrary() window and then play it back on demand. Also, I need the ability to get &amp; set the current playback time and also pause and play the song.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve spent a long time going through documentation and the KitchenSink files, and from what I can tell it should all work. I&#39;ve tried it both on the simulator and on a device, where the pausing of music does work but nothing else does.</p>
<p>Any help would be very much appreciated,<br>Thanks :)</p>

							<div><p>James - did you figure this out? I&#39;m looking for the same functionality. I found another post where the developer created a module in Objective-C to achieve this. MusicPlayer has all the methods and properties for in-app music control if only it were possible to create the Media item independent of the music picker.</p>
