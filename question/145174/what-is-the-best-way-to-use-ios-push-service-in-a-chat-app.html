			<h1>What is the best way to use iOS Push service in a chat app?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey guys, here is the thing, one of the projects I&#39;m working on it right now is a chat app with PUSH Notifications.</p>
<p>I know how to make an iOS Push notification work, so the first question is not exactly a technical one, but rather a logistic one.</p>
<p>I have a chat app that has several users across several channels, they receive the messages through a live socket connection(PubNub), how is the best way to implement PUSH to work with that in your guys opinions?</p>
<p>I can&#39;t detect who is online and who is on background, so I thought in three options.</p>
<p>1 - Always send a PUSH Notification after each message (which I think would make an expensive service even more expensive)</p>
<p>2 - Create an in-App status for Users for each channel(yes, it&#39;s a chat with several channels), those who enter background mode, will send a message &quot;telling&quot; of that, same when resumed.</p>
<p>3 - I&#39;m hoping you guys can give me an idea.</p>
<p>The other thing, is which is the best way to use PUSH? Currently I&#39;m doing an in-App HTTP POST to a PHP Script on my backend, which then connects to the APNS for the PUSH, it&#39;s working, but is that really the best option for such chat app that will certainly send a lot of PUSH messages?</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

							<div><p>Hi von Goethe. I&#39;m looking to do a similar implementation. Would you mind sharing how you decided to implement this? Did you go with ACS?</p>

							<p>No, its not the way to go. It doesn&#39;t scale and APNS does not provide reliable delivery (they say as much). Look into ACS as a way to provide this, there is exactly what you need right there.</p>
