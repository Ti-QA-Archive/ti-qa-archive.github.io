			<h1>CommonJS, MonkeyPatch &amp; Script Loading.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am perplexed about the optimal strategy of loading and structuring CommonJS files.<br>1) Is it advisable to use small CommonJS files for all my elements. Say I have a custom tableview row that I want to reuse. Should I write it as a separate file or just include the code where it&#39;s been used? I would like to keep everything seperate. Does this cause Script Loading performance issues? </p>
<p>2) With MonkeyPatch you only have to include the file once. Is it an issue then to put all the required files in the app.js? Or should we still load them as needed? </p>
<p>Thanks for your input.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your reply. I have watched the videos and still I am not clear with the combination that I am proposing. I didn&#39;t ever intend to include everything in one file. Quite the contrary I am asking how much I can split up the files without affecting performance.</p>

										<p><p>It is really relative … You may consider more of putting related functions in a file rather than a separate file for each function. As you load a file, it will load into memory all you would do is load a lot of smaller files which should takeup more processing than a few files with the code separated into them.</p>
<p>commonJS is just a different more robust way offloading files and making the functions available across the application. OK very simplistic view.</p>
<p>hope this helps.</p>
