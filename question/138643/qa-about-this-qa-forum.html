			<p>This question sounds like I&#39;m being a jerk… because I am. This has got to be one of the worst forums&#x2F;knowledge base&#x2F;whatevers that I have, attempted to, use. What makes it worse is that there is no link to find help on using this thing. Can I use booleans? Can I use parenthesis? How do I include tags? How do I exclude tags? How do I ensure that a word <em>has to be</em> in the result? How do I sort my results by votes? How do I sort the results by time? How do I sort results by the number of replies?</p>
<p>I can go on and on.</p>
<p>Please either:</p>
<p>1) Tell me I am stupid and then show me why.<br>2) Provide some help to make this Q&amp;A thing usable.<br>3) (My preferred choice) Scrap this crap and get something better.</p>
<p>Trying to learn Titanium is frustrating enough. Having convention defying API documentation and confusing &quot;help forums&quot; makes it not only more difficult, but even more frustrating.</p>
<p>I would love for people to reply with +1 or -1 to let the people in charge know if this is just one idiot complaining or if it is a consensus of the community.</p>

							<div><p>The search flat-out sucks.  All your search terms seem to be or-ed together, which prevents you from making very specific searches.  In 6 months, I haven&#39;t been able to make heads or tails of the sort order of the search results.  I&#39;d love to be able to sort by date so I can ignore everything prior to October 2011 (if you&#39;re developing with the current SDK, most of the posts prior to that date do not apply, and will generally lead you down the wrong path).</p>
<p>I usually search these forums with google instead.</p>

							<div><p>Jacob,</p>
<p>I hear you buddy. But that is a &quot;Community Issue&quot; and not really a technical&#x2F;infrastructure issue.</p>
<p>&quot;We&quot;, the community, can only &quot;fix&quot; that by encouraging the behavior of making sure we up vote good stuff. And, it begins with leading by example. I&#39;m sure you are, but others need to as well.</p>
<p>And, while we are bitching… Why can we up or down vote comments?</p>

							<div><p>Titanium ppl, please provide us some actual working tools for searching the Q&amp;A! </p>
<p>It is so annoying that you cannot search in the new posts only (filter out older posts) and therefore you have to go through all the useless 2 years ago posts which refer to ancient SDK versions.</p>
<p>Thank you Chaim for bringing this up.</p>

							<p>And another bitch. Here I am. Having posted my question and viewing it. There is no link for me to go back to the home page of the Q&amp;A. I have to go to the developers menu and choose Q&amp;A. Why can&#39;t I just click on the blue question mark quote icon in the upper-left like on every other forum&#x2F;website?</p>

							<p>I have been trying really hard today to use these Q&amp;A Forums efficiently. One of the other things that is annoying me is that, if I monitor the &quot;Most Recent&quot; list, I click on the top item and do not get brought to the new addition. I have to manually go through every single answer and every single comment and check the &quot;timestamp&quot; to see what has been added. Why am I not brought there automagically? Why isn&#39;t it highlighted in some way. How else do I find the thing that brought it to the top of the Most Recent list?</p>

							<p>it&#39;s like a half baked stackoverflow. wish AppC would just set up a proper q&amp;a via stackexchange.com, or just push people toward Titanium tag on stackoverflow.</p>
