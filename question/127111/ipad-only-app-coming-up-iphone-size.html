			<h1>iPad only app coming up iPhone size???</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve read the Q&amp;A topics but am at a loss. I have tried to run my iPad &quot;only&quot; app on my Simulator and my iPad 2 in both 3.2 &amp; 4.2 but they keep coming up iPhone size.</p>
<p>I have made the change to Targeted Device Family as &quot;iPad&quot; and I still get this error. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

							<p>How are you putting on your device? you run it on the device from Titanium Studio or are you using a jailbroken device? What does your run configuration says?</p>

										<p><p>i have never been able to run it on my device from Titanium Studio so I open up the project in xcode and run the simulator version and also load it on my device from xcode.</p>
<p>for my iPhone app, this process works great but this is my first &quot;iPad Only&quot; app and it&#39;s not working properly as it keeps opening up as an iPhone regardless of what setting i change.</p>
<p>run configuration? do you mean my manifest, if so, it says it&#39;s an &quot;iPad&quot; only. let me know where to find this run configuration you talk about and i can give you the answer.</p>

										<p><p>Run configurations in titanium are under preferences.</p>
<p>When you open you app code in xCode you need to specify the release &#x2F; run platform (either iPhone or iPad) - the default is iPhone. so if you don&#39;t change it to be specific for the iPad - iPad thinks it&#39;s an iPhone app and runs it as such.</p>

							<p>Hi Rick,</p>
<p>If you&#39;re trying to run through Xcode, I&#39;m told it can be challenging to manually get the universal build working for iOS.  Unfortunately, there&#39;s not a lot of advice I can offer (in Xcode) other than working within the existing Xcode docs and settings.  Are you able to run and deploy the universal application through Titanium Studio?  If you&#39;re converting an old app, have you tried generating a new project and copying in the previous files?</p>

										<p><p>In Ti Studio, my app is only &quot;true&quot; for the iPad since I&#39;ve already got an iPhone version of the app selling in the app store.</p>
<p>I did create a new appID for the iPad app. I will try to run the iPad app on my device this evening but it hasn&#39;t been successful before as my dropdown for device says &quot;IOS Device&quot; and not iPad Device as I&#39;ve seen before.</p>
<p>— is it recommended that I update my old iPhone app us work with iPad or should I continue to try and split them apart —</p>
