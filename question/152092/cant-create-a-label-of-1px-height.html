			<h1>Can&#39;t create a label of 1px height</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m trying to emulate a border of 1px between some views and I&#39;m using a label for that of 1px height with no contents and just a background color.</p>
<p>The label however looks much thicker, at least 2 pixels thick instead of just 1 pixel,as you can see on the following screenshot: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;d.pr&#x2F;i&#x2F;7z3E (the grey line on the left should be just 1 pixel, but is thicker)</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Joris simple solution is that if it is big for you make it 0.5 px and you would be good to go</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
