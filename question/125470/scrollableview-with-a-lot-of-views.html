			<h1>ScrollableView with a lot of views.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, im working on an app (ebook type reader) and Im using scrollable views for the pages. The issue Im having is when I load 300+ views, and try and scroll really far ahead (say from page 1 to 200) it flips, then the view is just white, none of my content (labels) gets loaded unless I flip forward then back.</p>
<p>Any idea how to fix this?</p>

							<p>It sounds like a memory &#x2F;processing issue. I think loading the whole lot in one go might be a bit much. Have you thouht about loading fewer pages and if you jump just loading the one jumped to and one either side, then keeping 3 in memory at a time.</p>
<p>apart from that, then you may need to post some code and also could you specify the dev tools and app os etc .</p>

										<p><p>Its on an iPad - i&#39;ve been testing on an iPad 2.</p>
<p>Using titanium, obviously.</p>
<p>I actually did think exactly what your thinking. I may do just that, was just curious of others input.</p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t think this is really a memory issue. I&#39;ve got an list about 75 of imageViews and all the scrolling works ok but when i open the view to open on 75-th image when it previously displayed the 1-st image i get to see only the background. References to all of the views are kept in memory. When i try to drag the view just by few px the image viow shows up. I&#39;ll try to resolve that issue by using a small timeout after scrolling - maybe that will fix the effects of this issue.</p>
