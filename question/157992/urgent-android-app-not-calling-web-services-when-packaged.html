							<p>if you use Ti Studio and use the &quot;box&quot; icon to package your app it should sign and zipalign it at the end by itself. So no need to do that afterwards again. Also try to connect your device to your computer and check the monitor app for debug messages to see whats not running</p>

										<p><p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>Thanks for looking in to this and providing fast response. </p>
<p>I have already checked my code on Android and iPhone. Both are working fine in my dev environment. But, problem occurs when I upload them on respective stores i.e. Apple Store and Google Play. My app on IOS is working fine. It is only giving problem when I create package of it. One more thing is that when I install the app from TI it shows size of 15.94 MB but when I download it and install from Google Play it shows 13.50 MB. I think that this is causing problem. But don&#39;t know the source of it. </p>
<p>Please let me know if you have faced such issues and resolved them. It would be the great help.</p>
<p>Anyways thanks for your help and support.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Manish</p>
