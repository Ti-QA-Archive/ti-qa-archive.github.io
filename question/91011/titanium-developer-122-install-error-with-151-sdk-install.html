			<h1>Titanium Developer 1.2.2 Install Error with 1.5.1 SDK install</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve been doing development with OSX Titanium Developer 1.2.2, Titanium SDK 1.4.2 and iOS SDK 4.0 and after the Titanium SDK 1.5.1 installed, I could no longer Run on Device. I now get a cryptic &#39;Install Error&#39; message. I didn&#39;t have this issue when 1.5.0 installed. I&#39;ve reboot and tried rebuilding with different SDK&#39;s and the &#39;Install Error&#39; continues with each. Deleting the Resources&#x2F;build&#x2F;iPhone&#x2F;build folder didn&#39;t help.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

							<p>Load up the generated project into XCode and try to build&#x2F;install from there. Make sure you have the XCode console window open. You should be able to find the reason for the issue either in the console window or by examining the build output by clicking on whatever errors appear in the lower right of XCode.</p>

										<p><p>I removed the project&#x2F;build&#x2F;iphone folder, did a Run on Device, received the &#39;Install Error&#39; in Titanium Developer, went into project&#x2F;build&#x2F;iphone, ran the project.xcodeproj file which brought up xcode, did a Build and the results in the lower right corner says &#39;Succeeded&#39;. Looks like it&#39;s working according to xcode. Additional thoughts appreciated :-)</p>
