			<p>I have the iPhone 3.2GM, it works.<br>I have android (2.1r5? v7 0.9.6, eclipse galileo… seems like a<br>gazillion pieces), it works.<br>two computers, osx 10.6.3</p>
<p>Titanium?  dl v 1.1, it says &quot;New Titanium Developer available (version 1.0)&quot; … what?  It will start up an iPhone simulator, but whatever exits immediately (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spy.org&#x2F;tmp&#x2F;titwtf2.png).  For android, it doesn&#39;t even always start up the emulator.  Well, sometimes it use to… then it stopped… now it doesn&#39;t again – it just sits there.  I just tried it again, now it&#39;s launching the emulator.</p>
<p>&quot;building&quot; for 2.1 google seems to bring up an android emulator, but nothing seems to get installed or launched.  for 2.1, there is a warning about titanium.maps.  for 1.6, same.  nothing seems to get installed or run.</p>
<p>for the iphone – building for 3.1 – lots and lots of js compiling warnings?  [WARN] JavaScript compiler reported &quot;Expected to see a statement and instead saw a block.&quot; at examples&#x2F;basic_animation.js:36 etc etc. 3.1 gives an iphone sim, and 3.2 gives an ipad sim.   for 3.2, same – nothing seems to run.  Finally, the simulator comes up and this message is displayed:  [INFO] Application has exited from Simulator.  There&#39;s a blank screen in the sim, hitting the home button doesn&#39;t make the springboard come up.</p>

							<p>Scott,</p>
<p>I think you should bear in mind that Titanium Mobile 1.1.2 was released for SDK 3.2 beta 5, if you&#39;ve upgraded to 3.2GM then you&#39;re ahead of the current Titanium Mobile SDK release.</p>
<p>cheers,<br>Chris.</p>

							<p>That is possible – I think the system (1.0? 1.1?) was working better with 3.2b5.  Sadly, I don&#39;t have<br>any non-GM to test on at the moment.  I didn&#39;t think a (minor?) upgrade from b5 to gm would have<br>such a large affect.  Plus, I&#39;m not sure that this would affect android.  With android, I&#39;ve tried re-installing 2.1r5 with all the doc sets, etc.  I think I have 1.5, 1.6 and 2.1 now.  I&#39;ve tested a few sample apps and they seem to compile&#x2F;launch&#x2F;install&#x2F;run fine.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll see if work has (another) spare mac… for a non GM install.</p>

							<p>Sure, I jumped the gun myself when 3.2 beta first came out (with Ti Mobile 0.8.3) and ran into a host of peculiar issues . I was only able to rectify things by uninstalling and reinstalling the earlier SDK.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a bit of a lottery as to what changes there might be between beta and production, you&#39;re right it should be minimal, but there&#39;s always the possibility some last minute, high priority changes were applied.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t help on the Android front I&#39;m afraid, still finding my feet there. Hopefully Titanium Mobile SDK 1.2 will be 3.2DM compatible - if you can hang-back &#39;til next week.</p>
<p>cheers,<br>Chris.</p>
