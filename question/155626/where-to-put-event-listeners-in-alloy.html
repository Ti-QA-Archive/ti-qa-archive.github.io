			<h1>Where to put event listeners in Alloy</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Just a general best practice question in Alloy:</p>
<p>I am looking through the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;alloy&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;samples&#x2F;todo">ToDo sample</a> and I notice that there a many event listeners that are inline amid the XML markup. I seem to have been trained on the web that listeners should be placed in the javascript, but I see &quot;on<em>__</em>&quot; events used <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;alloy&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;samples&#x2F;todo&#x2F;views&#x2F;add.xml">here</a> for example. Is this a recommended practice, or would it be preferable to add IDs to the buttons and listen for each of the elements&#39; events via <code>add.js</code> (and why or why not)?</p>

							<p>It really is a matter of personal preference. Whatever you do, be consistent or you&#39;ll end up looking for events or property settings all over the place.</p>
<p>Although you can set pretty much all properties in your views, I personally find they&#39;re easier to track if kept in the controllers and tss files</p>

										<p><p>I started moving the code where I set my listeners to the controller, for the reason that there seem to be differences between platforms ( such as when the change event fires for text fields seems to differ between iOS and Android ). In such cases I can better control the flow when I use the controller to set the event listener as opposed to the XML markup.</p>

										<p><p>Controlling differences between platforms is another benefit. I am curious… what differences are you experiencing on the textfield events. Can you post some code samples?</p>

										<p><p>When I set the change event on a text field in the markup and populate the text field in the controller, Android fires the change event whereas iOS doesn&#39;t. iOS seems to fire only after the rendering is done.</p>

										<p><p>Stefan, if you look at the generated code, the event listeners whether done in markup or JS, are always set after the UI component is created.</p>
<p>And as David originally stated, it&#39;s a matter of preference. I tend to use event listeners in markup in situation when I have no reason to give a UI component a unique ID, other than the fact that it needs an event listener.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Mark, you are right. However, in the case of the TextField I can consistently see a difference on iOS and Android given the following code, where Android fires onChange already when the field is initialized, while iOS does not. For that reason I listen to post layout where I set the change listener, instead of in the markup. Probably off topic for the OP - just to clarify above comments. E.g. index controller:  <code>$.field.value = 123; function onChange(e) { Ti.API.info( e.value ); } $.index.open();</code></p>
