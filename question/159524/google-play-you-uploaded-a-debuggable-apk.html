			<h1>Google Play: You uploaded a debuggable APK</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have uploaded several apps to the Google Play market previously, but all of a sudden when I try to publish a new app I keep getting the following error:</p>
<p>&quot;Upload failed<br>You uploaded a debuggable APK. For security reasons you need to disable debugging before it can be published in Google Play. Learn more about debuggable APKs.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m using the same keystore as I have been using, and am not doing anything different than before.  I&#39;ve tried updating the Android SDK hoping that might have been the issue but that didn&#39;t help.  I&#39;m stumped.  Does anyone know what I might be doing wrong or is there a setting to disable debugging that I might have accidentally turned on?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

										<p><p>This was exactly it.  For some reason this line was not an issue in the previous apps, but it was in the latest app.  I changed this line and was able to publish.  Thanks!</p>
