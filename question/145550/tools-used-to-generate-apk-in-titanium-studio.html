			<h1>Tools used to generate Apk in Titanium Studio</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I am trying to create an APK manually with the Titanium Source.. I searched and found that Titanium is using ANT tool to build the APK..So i gave &quot;ant&quot; command in terminal it created an APK but it misses some folders named org and ti.. Which are used in Intializing Webview at Runtime.. So Plz guide me how to compile the source manually..</p>
<p>Thanks in Advance</p>
<p>Regards,<br>Sudarshan</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>You have asked several questions recently (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;145450&#x2F;how-org-and-ti-folder-is-added-in-the-android-apk">one</a>, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;145449&#x2F;reverse-engineered-titanium-app-is-crashing">two</a>, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;145410&#x2F;how-android-app-apk-is-generated-using-titanium-api">three</a>) about how the inner workings of Titanium function.</p>
<p>Please explain why - as it looks as if you are trying to reverse engineer Titanium.  If that is the case I am not sure this is the right place for you as help here is focussed towards supporting those using Titanium as it is &quot;out of the box&quot;.</p>
<p>Titanium can create apps using the CLI, so if that is what you are after there guides for that; <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.1&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Titanium_Command-Line_Interface_Reference">SDK 2.1</a> &amp; <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Titanium_Command-Line_Interface_Reference">SDK 3.0</a>.</p>

										<p><p>No u r not getting my point.. My point is not reverse engineering , My point is about how that folders are included in the Titanium based Android app and not in the Native APK..</p>
<p>In question <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;145410&#x2F;how-android-app-apk-is-generated-using-titanium-api">three</a> he had given a Link which has ANT tools flow diagram, so only i am asking what iam missing while using those tools so which that folders are not generated..</p>
<p>There is no link in reverse engineering with this question…Plz guide</p>

										<p><p>Then my question would be why do you need to know which folders are or are not being included and how does that knowledge help you do anything you cannot do by simply compiling the app normally without this knowledge?</p>

										<p><p>I know why i need that folders… I am asking what extra work the titanium is doing other than ANT to include those folders.. Since with that same ant tool i couldnt generate org and ti folders</p>

										<p><p>I suggest you direct this question directly to Appcelerator as I still clearly do not get your point and seemingly others haven&#39;t from your previous questions.</p>
