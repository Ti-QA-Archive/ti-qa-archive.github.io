			<h1>Ti.Map prompt access to user location.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>It seems that just adding a simple mapView prompts the user for access to his or her location data. I don&#39;t wan&#39;t the users to think that I am using this data when I am not. Can anyone confirm that this is the normal&#x2F;intended behaviour of Ti.Map, or perhaps come up with a workaround. </p>
<p>Note: The userLocation property is set to false. </p>
<p>Thanks :)</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The <strong>userLocation</strong> property determines if the pulsing blue dot is shown on the map - it has nothing to do with the user giving permissions.</p>
<p>Because the map has the ability to locate a user by the press of a map icon as well as routing a user from their current location - the map sub-system (at OS level) requests permission for those things.</p>
<p>This is normal behaviour of the map.  Whilst I can imagine some getting confused by this it must (hopefully) be a small percentage as the map can;</p>
<ul>
<li>Centre to your current location </li>
<li>Provide a rout to or from your current location</li>
<li>Track the map to your location(so it moves with you)</li>
<li>When being routed it know where you are on the route</li>
</ul>
<p>These all require your location.</p>

										<p><p>As the the user not knowing what you do with any information stored - great question - tell them.</p>
<p>The app world and internet world are becoming increasingly aware that their information can be misused - so make a point of having a privacy policy in your app - make it important enough to be prominent and be honest in clear sentences.</p>
<p>As an example; if you retain someone&#39;s phone number because your app manages contacts (not saying it does) - then explain that.  If you app keeps phone numbers and it is a game - very little normally legitimate reason.  So trust your user to understand what and why and they will trust to handle things correctly.</p>
