<p>Appcelerator offers such services to their enterprise customers, and were you an enterprise customer, you would have an Appcelerator contact handling your account.</p>
<p>That being said, my firm charges $200 an hour for code reviews and I can be reached through DevMail.</p>

										<p><p>Code review is a specialist job requiring people who not only understand code but under many different coding styles and techniques.  The ability to determine if the code is correct, will cause a memory leak, is inefficient, too bulky, not defensive enough.</p>
<p>I recently completed such a job for a client where the objective was to review and improve one of five main sections of an app.  The &quot;improve&quot; is the main outcome as code reviews are usually performed due to concerns and actual issues.</p>
<p>This was a two week task, 8 hours a day - to review 1&#x2F;5 of the app.  Keep in mind these reviews require the need to be thorough.</p>
<p>So normally I do not like the Q&amp;A being used as a job request site - but you appear to be panicking.  So I recommend you consider Stephen&#39;s offer.  We do this for a similar rate just so you know.- so if it turns out Stephen cannot help you, I can be contacted in the same way as Stephen mention via the devmail - click our names here - to find.</p>

										<p><p>Sorry guys I took a different take on reading this.</p>
<p>So a few questions.</p>
<p>Is this code review because of.</p>
<p>1) Your new to the platform.<br>2) You have self studied Titanium<br>3) Your after pier review for validation of your understanding.<br>4) Your worried you have got it wrong.</p>
<p>In which case, this is the place to ask for help. But maybe not the way you have. If you had asked for a pier review then people would be all over this to help.</p>
<p>OR is this code review.</p>
<p>1) Your a commercial &#x2F; Enterprise business<br>2) You want somebody to do a full code review before release<br>3) You want guarantees or the review.</p>
<p>Then I am totally with Stephen and Malcolm, but think they are cheap. As Malcolm says this sort of code review is specialized and expensive.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>T.</p>
