			<h1>Capture (or crop) fixed size image using showCamera?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>My iPad app is working well and I am capturing photos but they are quite large. </p>
<p>I already know how to resize the image after capturing it. </p>
<p>What I need to do is capture an image at a specific fixed size of 1024w x 768h. </p>
<p>Can using an overlay be used to control the image size?</p>
<p>If not, is it possible to create a LANDSCAPE only overlay with a child view (1024W x 768H) that has a border then crop the area outside the child view after capturing the image!?</p>
<p>I tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>creating an overlay view</li>
<li>adding a child view (1024W x 768H) with a border</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the child-view-with-border goes beyond the camera viewfinder.</p>
<p> (which is odd because the photos are captured something like 2592x1936)</p>
<p>Thanks for any of your time, thoughts and suggestions on this!</p>
<p>iOS 7.1 &#x2F; 3.2.3GA</p>

<p>Malcolm answered your question, offering solutions to BOTH. Imagefactory to reduce size (mb) and a method to handle the resizing (pixels)</p>

							<div><p>Are you seriously asking why people like me offer up our time to people with questions?</p>
<ul>
<li>Neither I or others benefit in anyway financially or gain any influence with Appcelerator - if that was the suggestion.</li>
</ul>
<p>You ask question - we answer it.  You do not provide enough details to gain a suitable answer - provide more - if you think the person giving the answer has not understood your meaning - try to clarify.</p>
<p>The reason only a few offer answers is that more people do not offer answers.  There are almost 600k developers and less than 1% offer help here.  Is that their fault - NO, but it is MINE for trying to answer your question and the questions of others?</p>
<p>So your real problem is that someone answered your question based on your description - your annoyed it was by someone who has answered more questions than any other person.</p>
<p>So you are annoyed you are dealing with someone that might have a bit more experience than someone else?  Not a guaranteed answer but statistically MUCH MORE LIKELY THAT YOU WHO ASKED THE QUESTION.</p>
<p>Want a better answer ask a better question, provide follow up, provide an example, provide something for a question that has a very clear answer - that only changes when additional information is provided - which FINE - that is normal - BUT why be rude that the lack of follow up information did not provide an answer that required that information.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Malcolm, thank you for the time and effort you spent on this. I would agree with you that my question is more conceptual in nature. Your network and progress functionality is an elegant style that I use as well in a commonJS style modular approach.</em></p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;164054&#x2F;fire-app-event---local-object-addremove-listener">Fire App Event - Local object add&#x2F;remove listener</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Should I not have answered this one either? Or maybe the other question I answered for you?</p>
<p>You understand how this thing works I assume - you ask a question and then try not to insult the person trying to help you.  Simple, easy to remember.</p>

							<div><p>Malcolm - sorry if I hurt your feelings. &lt;insert hug here&gt;</p>
<p>If you have something meaningful to say, <strong>as you have in many cases</strong>, then kudos and thanks! </p>
<p>You already acknowledged that your answer was not as constructive as it could have been.<br>I only asked out of curiosity - why one tries to answer everything. </p>
<p>I did say in the second sentence, &quot;I already know how to resize the image&quot;, to which you replied &quot;Hi,To resize an image you can…&quot;</p>
<p>Stephen - go fly a kite..it was just a question…and it wasn&#39;t even for you..but I suppose your comments makes that 1,002 questions you participated in - this month. </p>
<p>So to be clear, some questions are okay and others are not.<br>You can judge the questions and I can&#39;t judge the answers.<br>…Got it.</p>
<p>Neither of you has the ability to say a) nothing,  b) it&#39;s good for my business, c) some other bs reason that you answer everything for points to be on the leader bored.</p>

							<div><p>Your condescension is a telling sign.</p>
<p>Not sure how you got &quot;You already acknowledged that your answer was not as constructive as it could have been.&quot; from &quot;Thank you for the suggestion my answer was not constructive.&quot;.</p>
<p>Yes you did say &quot;I already know how to resize the image after capturing it.&quot; but then you followed it with &quot;What I need to do is capture an image at a specific fixed size of 1024w x 768h.&quot;.  So you did know or you didn&#39;t know - very confusing and not once did the suggestion of BEFORE the image was taken ever get mentioned - had it of been the answer would simply have been &quot;No&quot; - as that was a different question with a different meaning.</p>
<p>You did choose however to insult the person offering assistance based on the information at hand.  You then repeated your statement without mentioning you wanted to convince the camera it has a different resolution.</p>
<p>You then get annoyed that Stephen Feather points out the error of your ways.  Just now you asked WHY did he offer an answer - which BTW actually turns out to be the correct one.  He answered the question because you ASKED a question.  </p>
<p>I am still not sure if you get the whole question and answer system.  You have complained that people who answer question regularly should no longer provide answers and you are surprised when people do answer questions as it has nothing to do with them - &#39;them&#39; being the answer providers that is.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that you have acted in this way - repeatedly and rudely.  I took the higher ground to start with - you insulted me, I questioned if I misunderstood the insult to mean something else - but still left a follow up in an attempt to gain further information about the question.  You then insulted again.</p>
<p>We will clearly not be crossing paths again, because as forgiving as I can be to the short fused, frustrated developers who occasionally let off steam here - they almost always say sorry.  You cannot blame them - they often need an answer to something so quickly they forget themselves.  You appear not to have regained your manners.</p>
<p>Finally, your last point;</p>
<ol>
<li>If those who answer do not answer - how does your question get resolved? </li>
<li>Good for my business - I do this for free in my own time, you do the math</li>
<li>If it was for the leader board - then Stephen and myself (as you appear to insult us both) could have stopped some time ago and never gained another point with reasonable fear of moving positions.  </li>
<li>This is the surprise - we do it to help others, those who actually want to be helped - those who are grateful for assistance - for those who learn a little extra from whomever offers the assistance.  We give back because we were given to from the Q&amp;A - it is a community that I have been part of for years.  Where the only thanks we seek is the occasional &quot;thank you&quot;.</li>
</ol>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>To resize an image you can use one of the many Titanium modules;Image Factory;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_modules">Titanium modules</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Download option on right and install like all other modules.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">newBlob = ImageFactory.imageAsCropped(blob, { <span class="hljs-string">width:</span><span class="hljs-number">100</span>, <span class="hljs-string">height:</span><span class="hljs-number">100</span>, <span class="hljs-string">x:</span><span class="hljs-number">50</span>, <span class="hljs-string">y:</span><span class="hljs-number">50</span> });
newBlob = ImageFactory.imageAsResized(blob, { <span class="hljs-string">width:</span><span class="hljs-number">140</span>, <span class="hljs-string">height:</span><span class="hljs-number">140</span>, <span class="hljs-string">quality:</span>ImageFactory.QUALITY_HIGH, <span class="hljs-string">hires:</span><span class="hljs-literal">true</span> });
</code></pre><p>Two example functions available.</p>

										<p><p>Are you actually asking if you can place an image over the top of the camera viewport that equals a fixed size that itself is proportionate to the expected image resolution - so that you can show the EXACT section of the image at scale for the user to hold up against the subject?</p>
