			<h1>5 Minute Build for Application Installer (Android)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Can&#39;t seem to find a solution here, running Lion and at one point early last week my builds were taking the usual time (less than a minute). All of the sudden my builds are taking over five minutes every time I run the application installer (I do not recall changing any configurations).</p>
<p>It seems to be compiling all code completely, I&#39;m not sure exactly what it&#39;s doing, but I assume there&#39;s something fundamentally wrong with my environment.</p>
<p>Initially used brew to install my android-sdk&#x2F;uninstalled those and installed through Titanium.</p>
<p>I&#39;m using Titianium Mobile SDK 1.76 (out of necessity) with a Samsung Galaxy. </p>
<p>Let me know if I need to post the whole stack trace while building (really long so I&#39;ll throw a few items on here)</p>

							<p>Mike,</p>
<p>First and the foremost, reinstalling Titanium or Android SDK will surely not help in this case especially for Android SDK as no matter you install it through Titanium or install independently and provide path in Titanium, its both the same. </p>
<p>What i feel is that due to previous compilation files it is taking more time to run your app in tablet as sometimes it takes more time doing cleanup though that does not gets shown in the log. I would suggest the following approach which i myself followed to get rid of the situation:</p>
<p>####1. In Titanium Studio go to Projects -&gt; Clean… select your project and press OK and then run your app</p>
<p>####2. Uninstall your app in tablet first and then run your app as sometimes android takes time shutting down the app and uninstalling it which directly increases the app execution time in titanium</p>
<p>####3. If 1 &amp; 2 does not work then universal rule …. Restart Your Machine</p>
<p>Also, as point to note, if in addition to running your app on tablet you want to run your app on emulator, do ensure to run emulator in advance before running your app in titanium and do not close emulator in successive runs as this saves a lot of time for app execution</p>

										<p><p>Still nothing. I actually did this once and it seemed like the next build was quicker, but everything is still slow after that. Also, clean is now disabled in the menu, so I&#39;m unsure why that is.</p>

										<p><p>Hmm…there seems to be some serious issue somewhere. By the way at what version of Titanium Studio are you working? and did you tried updating it to latest build: <strong>2.1.0.201206251749</strong> ?</p>

										<p><p>Yes I am using that version of Titanium, but using 1.7.6 of the mobile SDK. Like I said before, at one point everything was running at the expected speed. I am planning on wiping my machine with a clean slate because Mountain Lion was released, so hopefully I&#39;ll have different results after that.</p>
