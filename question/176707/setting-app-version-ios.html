			<h1>Setting app version (ios)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>using SDK 3.2.3.GA (but I believe it&#39;s valid for any &gt; 2.0.0) and build an iOS app, I would like to set my version number seen in app store to &quot;1.0&quot;.  From what I understand, it means that CFBundleShortVersionString must match the one define in iTunes Connect.</p>
<p>Now, what I found out is that the value of both CFBundleShortVersionString and CFBundleVersion are set to the value of &lt;version&#x2F;&gt; from tiapp.xml.  And, of course, this need to be a 3 digits numbers (if you give only two, the build process pads it with .0).<br>I have tried fiddling with Info.plist in my root dir etc but the value are overwritten in the build.</p>
<p>Anyone with a brilliant idea for this (admittedly unimportant) problem?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>PS. Yes, I have read <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;ios&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;general&#x2F;Reference&#x2F;InfoPlistKeyReference&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;CoreFoundationKeys.html#&#x2F;&#x2F;apple_ref&#x2F;doc&#x2F;uid&#x2F;20001431-111349">the doc</a> which says that it&#39;s a 3 digits number, but on the app store I see that apps like Twitter get away with a 2 digits number and I wondering why not me :)</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The latest release notes for Ti SDK 3.3 might help clear this up for you;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;release-notes&#x2F;?version=3.3.0.GA#cfbundleshortversion">CFBundleShortVersionString</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It states;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>To generate the CFBundleShortVersionString in the application&#39;s info.plist file for iOS packages, the version field in the tiapp.xml is truncated to three dot-separated numbers. For example, &#39;2.1&#39; remains as &#39;2.1&#39;, but &#39;2.1.0.1&#39; will be converted to &#39;2.1.0&#39;.</em></li>
<li><em>Prior to Release 3.3.0, the version number was always converted to three dot-separated numbers when creating a package. For example, if you specify &#39;2.1&#39; or &#39;2.1.0.1&#39;, the version number will be converted to &#39;2.1.0&#39; for the final package.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>So for clarity;</p>
<ul>
<li>You are using Ti SDK 3.2.3, as you rightly note this will take &quot;1.0&quot; and convert to &quot;1.0.1&quot;</li>
<li>When you move to Ti SDK 3.3 your &quot;1.0&quot; remains &quot;1.0&quot;, the only change going forwards is if you had chosen &quot;1.2.3.4&quot; this will be converted back to &quot;1.2.3&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>For information; I have older apps in the store that do have &quot;Major.Minor&quot;, ie; &quot;1.0&quot; and &quot;2.0&quot;.  So the current Ti SDK 3.2.3 way must have changed from back then. But the good news is it is coming back to what you want - not what you get :-)</p>

										<p><p>BTW some information that you can easily choose to ignore.  The is a good reason for using the 3 values system.  </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Major</strong></p>
<p>Big changes, usually massive changes - beyond a couple of features.  Often when an app is rewritten.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Minor</strong></p>
<p>New feature, new option, including new functionality due to host OS or your API .</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Build</strong></p>
<p>Quick fixes, bug fixes, extra little things, screen-shot changes (thanks AppStore for locking that out), compliance tweaks</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I get that 2.0 looks better than 2.0.8 (one of my current apps) but it tells me the exact build, which I have logged against the change log.  It allows reviews to take into account those changes&#x2F;fixes that they may have raised concerns about (or Android reviewers - who simply want to kill you because you changed the shade of red somewhere).</p>
<p>But as I say - nothing wrong with <strong>2.0</strong>.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks (again), Malcom.  </p>
<p>I haven&#39;t considered yet moving to 3.3.x so hadn&#39;t read the release note (and might have missed it anyway).  I think I will go with the 3 digits stuff (which is what I had before trying this). 2 digits looks indeed better and that was why I was considering it but it&#39;s not a real show stopper.</p>
<p>PS. I hope iOS reviewer will not be as picky :)</p>

										<p><p>You are very welcome</p>
<p>Example new release feature; <em>You promote access to a feature that you had not realised would be as popular, saves the user a good amount of time</em>. </p>
<ul>
<li>iOS reviewer; I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to the users and make even the little things better</li>
<li>Android reviewer; Why did you do this, iPhone users got this feature a day before Android users got it!!! Do you not know how many people use Androids …</li>
</ul>
<p>^^^ Based on a real situation and I left of the abusive ending.</p>
<p>iOS reviewers are lovely people.  If you release on both platforms - push the Android version a couple days before the iOS one - safety first :-)</p>
