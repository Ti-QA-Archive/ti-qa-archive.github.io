			<p>why can&#39;t I sort the dev&#39;s list by location? I need someone in Colorado, US and have to sort 99 pages of crap to find the few local listings then hope they are still in business or have a phone number for contact.<br>seems odd.</p>
<p>I need a simple app create but need someone local that I can talk to on the phone.</p>

							<p>While I agree that sorting the devlink list by any field would be helpful, it doesn&#39;t come up often where someone local is a requirement. One can only assume that you need someone local to talk to on the phone so you don&#39;t incur any long distance phone charges. My advice would be to cast a wider net. In the meantime, I will talk to the web guys and see what we can do about getting location added to the list of sortable fields.</p>

							<p>No LD is unlimited it&#39;s more a keep the money local and in-state. This is a major deal for local governments. Some people also like to meet in person or might need to do an in person demo for a corporation wanting an app. Just seemed odd I could sort by joined date but not location. Also is there a renew&#x2F;review process I ran into a lot of dead company websites, out of business and others. It would be nice if they had to update or check their data from time to time. </p>
<p>This is one of the best app dev lists I&#39;ve seen anywhere and it was extremely helpful to find app dev&#39;s in short dead-lines. Thank you so very much for this site and all the work you do.</p>
