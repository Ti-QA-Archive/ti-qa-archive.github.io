			<h1>Insufficient storage in emulator</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Ti. 3.0, Android 4.2, Win 7<br>I was trying to run my app in Android Emulator and Titanium Android emulator which I&#39;ve done before successfully. Today, neither worked. When I tried Android Emulator, the final lines in the console window were:<br>&quot;Failed Installing net.cyberwurks.mileagemeter: pkg: &#x2F;data&#x2F;local&#x2F;tmp&#x2F;app.apk<br>[INSTALL_FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE]&quot;</p>
<p>Running to Titanium Android Emulator lists serveral innocuous messages ending with :<br>&quot;Analytics Service Started<br>Stopping Analytics Service&quot;</p>
<p>The app loads okay on the device. Any ideas? Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>@doc jump; there is no way you have an apk that is only 9kb.  Either;</p>
<ul>
<li>you are not looking at the right file</li>
<li>your file is not a complete compile </li>
<li>you have managed to create the worlds best compression technique</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully the third but not likely.</p>
