			<h1>Desktop Audio Options</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have worked with Titanium Mobile for quite some time, and am very familiar with it. Moving to Desktop for a quick prototype, however, has been trying to say the least. </p>
<p>Currently I need the ability to load an audio track, and seek through the audio, or only play portions of it. I originally wanted to use the HTML5 Audio Object, but I can&#39;t get it to play. No errors, no problems, just no sound. Titanium.Media.createSound works, but gives you virtually no control over the sound file. I have read that HTML5 audio does not work on Windows, but this is going to be a Mac only app - unfortunately I can&#39;t seem to get anything to play on the Mac. </p>
<p>What are my options on Audio - is it really this limited?</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;d start by creating a tiny demo with just HTML 5 audio APIs to ensure it&#39;s working at all (it should).  If you can&#39;t get a tiny demo working, post the code you think should work here.</p>
<p>Probably don&#39;t want to bring in a library until you&#39;re satisfied that the underlying APIs are working for you.</p>

							<div><p>Jacob,<br>I&#39;d be interested to know if adding the type attribute for the HTML5 audio helps in your example:</p>
<p>ie: <code>audioElement.setAttribute(&amp;#39;type&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;audio&amp;#x2F;x-wav&amp;#39;);</code></p>

							<div><p>I had some success with HTML5 audio on a desktop Mac app, but a friend couldn&#39;t get it to work on his Windows PC.</p>
<p>Also, I just realised you&#39;re adding the src attribute to the audio tag.<br>You might try adding a child tag for &#39;source&#39; within the audio tga and setting the src and type attributes to that.</p>
<p>Then you should be able to use audioElement.play() , audioElement.pause() and audioElement.currentTime to do what you need to control it, as well as adding the &#39;playing&#39;, &#39;pause&#39;, &#39;durationchange&#39;, &#39;seeked&#39; and &#39;ended&#39;, etc events to it.</p>

							<div><p>An MP3 file isn&#39;t working in any of my simple examples (nor is a WAV file) - kind of looks like we might have an issue.  Here&#39;s my simple example: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;img.skitch.com&#x2F;20110805-bpbg7wm16g2akmx445p6gk7f98.jpg</p>
<p>I&#39;ve asked the desktop guys to take a look, we&#39;ll see what they say.</p>

							<div><p>Thanks Kevin. I also tried an mp3 file with no luck. I have also seen quite a few website that say WAV is supported on Safari, so I don&#39;t think that is the issue.</p>

							<p>Hey Kevin pinged me about this thread and to offer my advice, I work on our Desktop<br>platform. I figured out a workaround to get the audio tag to work.<br>It appears it is unable to locate media files inside the Resources folder.<br>For example: <code>&amp;lt;audio src=&amp;quot;test.mp3&amp;quot;&amp;gt;</code> should resolve to  test.mp3<br>in Resources&#x2F; for your application. My workaround was to use the<br>File object in our API to get a file:&#x2F;&#x2F; URL to the media file. I then<br>set the src attribute for the audio tag.</p>
<p>I created an example <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;joshthecoder&#x2F;titanium_apps&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;HTML5Audio">here</a>. I also opened a ticket for this bug <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIDESK-675">here</a>. Let me know if you find a better way or have questions!</p>
