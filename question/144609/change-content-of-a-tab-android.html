			<h1>Change content of a tab ANDROID</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a tabgroup with 3 tabs. However my app knows more than 3 pages, it knows 6 pages. 1 tab im using for settings, and in this settings page, i wish to &quot;open another window&quot; where certain settings are set. Well when i do &quot;createWindow&quot; and i open it, ill get the new window, but the whole tabgroup is hidden, this is not my meaning, because what i actually want is the following:</p>
<p>the selected tab is still the settings tab, BUT the information shown is not the default settings, but this other settings for which i had a new window designed. </p>
<p>So my question is, can i change the contents of a tabpage easily? </p>
<p>Ive tried lots of things, like Ti.App.settingsTab.setWindow(newWindow); (i assigned the settingsTab to Ti.App when i made it) but nothing worked.</p>
<p>The only other option i have left is to completely remove the whole UI ive been creating for the normal settings with a function (so a function for createDefaultSettingsUI() and a function for removeDefaultSettingsUI()). With this function the UI ive been creating will be all hidden or something, and after that i can use another function called createSpecificSettingsUI() to show the specific settings. I think this is quite an ugly way to solve this, cuz im just changing the content of 1 window where it actually should be 2 windows.</p>
<p>I was wondering if anyone has a solution for this, so i wont have to use the hacky timeconsuming ugly method.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

							<p>It may seem hacky now, but compared to some of the things you will have to do to finish your app, it will seem downright elegant later!  (I&#39;m only halfway joking – you will likely have to hack your way around 3 or 4 bugs and&#x2F;or undocumented feature non-parity issues to build any reasonably complex app).</p>
<p>The approach you describe is the right one.  A window will obscure the tabs, so you can&#39;t use a window.  Instead, build each &quot;window&quot; in a separate view.  Hide&#x2F;show the views as appropriate.</p>
<p>If the views are not too complex, you can build them all at creation time.  If they have lots of subviews or have things like tableviews with hundreds of rows, you should probably consider building them only as needed by the user.</p>

										<p><p>Am I missing something? Hylke seem like he wants to click a tab to display his settings window, then choose a particular setting and display a &#39;child&#39; window and continue to display the active tab. I do this exact scenario without switching out the main view…sorry Jason, switching view content is not &#39;terrible&#39; advice. In my case the UI and code for the Child settings window can be complex. Combining many settings windows into one giant settings UI with a lot of code could quickly become unruly. Everyone should be using a CommonJS style approach to writing code. </p>
<p>&#x2F;&#x2F;this code runs on my main settings window (winSetttingsMain)</p>
<p>&#x2F;&#x2F;the active tab is Settings tab at this point</p>
<p>var _winSettingState = require(&#39;&#x2F;ui&#x2F;settings&#x2F;setting_state&#39;)).SettingsStateWindow();</p>
<p>_winSettingState.title = &#39;My State&#39;;</p>
<p>winSettingsMain.containingTab.open(_winSettingState,{animated:true});</p>
<p>Now my child settings window ( _winSettingState ) is displayed, and the active tab is STILL the Settings tab.</p>

										<p><p>Two things:</p>
<p>1) Using these multiple views as &quot;windows&quot; does not preclude using CommonJS.  In fact, I think you&#39;d find that I am one of the biggest proponents of CommonJS design – not a week goes by that I&#39;m not &quot;scolding&quot; somebody for <strong>not</strong> using CommonJS.  :-)</p>
<p>You could put each subview in its own module.  That would be extremely clean.  Then all the main window has to do is manage which of these views is visible.  Not unruly at all.</p>
<p> 2) You&#39;re missing a subtle issue, which Hylke mentioned in his initial post:</p>
<p><em>when i do &quot;createWindow&quot; and i open it, ill get the new window, but the whole tabgroup is hidden</em></p>
<p>Maybe you&#39;re using iOS exclusively and you&#39;re not familiar with the behavior of the tabgroup on android.  On android, if you open a new window from a tabbed window, the tabs are covered up by the new window.  This is what hylke was trying to avoid, which of course, led me to the subview suggestion.</p>
