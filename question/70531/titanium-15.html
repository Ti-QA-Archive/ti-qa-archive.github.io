							<div><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be blogging next week about the approximate release date of 1.5, and the high-level features. </p>
<p>Bringing a lot of features to the Android platform and delivering quality across our mobile platforms are some key goals.</p>
<p>Note that for you Android developers we have just merged in a major refactor to master, which will create a better performing and complete platform; but for the moment has created some new regressions. But we will work through that quickly. The main master branch is generally what will become 1.5 going forward.</p>
<p>If you need to use a more stable branch on Android, use 1.4.2 for now. That is a snapshot before we merged in the Android refactor , and we even merge some critical fixes into it.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for a blog about what we expect to be a great R1.5! It has taken a bit longer then our usual release time-span, but we are trying to achieve a lot of great things in this release.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Ralf Pfeiffer</p>
<p>Dir, Platform Engineering</p>

							<p>When it&#39;s ready.</p>
<p>EDIT: They did say sometime in October but let&#39;s wait for a better QA this time. We want 1.5 to the best, right?</p>

							<p>You could grab one of the continuous builds from;</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;index.html</p>
<p>That&#39;ll have a bunch of bug fixes rolled into it. But like Swaroop say, we want 1.5 when it&#39;s ready, and in the mean time the builds above will fix lots of bugs.</p>

										<p><p>Your first guess is correct. 1.5 will come from the master branch, and 1_4_X is there to be the more stable one, as it&#39;s mostly 1.4 with crashers fixed, as to reduce regression issues. The continuous build is what QA does testing on.</p>
