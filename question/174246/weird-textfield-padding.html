			<h1>Weird Textfield padding</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have an app that has strange textfield padding on Android devices. I use Genymotion and test on multiple devices. The only device that seems to have this issue is my Samsung Galaxy S4. I have attached two screenshots, one from my <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.dropboxusercontent.com&#x2F;u&#x2F;95876063&#x2F;screenshots&#x2F;S1-Screenshot_2014-05-15-14-23-52.png">Galaxy S</a>. This is what it should look like. When I compile and install on my Galaxy S4, here is what the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.dropboxusercontent.com&#x2F;u&#x2F;95876063&#x2F;screenshots&#x2F;Screenshot_2014-05-14-15-43-08.png">same screen looks like</a></p>
<p>There are no conditionals in the tss that I am using between the two… </p>
<p>Has anyone seen this before? Not even sure where to start.</p>
<p>Ray</p>

							<p>You&#39;re not the first person I&#39;ve heard having troubles with strange layout issues on Galaxy S4 devices. It sounds like their theme files are setting more padding on the S4 than on their other devices. Your workaround would be to create your own custom Android theme, and specifically set styles on textfields to specify the padding you want to use. Custom themes are essentially merged, so if you don&#39;t specify other settings (colors, styles on components other than textfield, etc.) then users should get the stock Galaxy theme settings.</p>

										<p><p>So, in the end, I did some testing, creating a new project and … no problems. I then went through a bunch of my tss files to figure out what was causing the problem… In the end, I obviously changed something because it &#39;fixed&#39; itself… But couldn&#39;t tell you what I did. If it does happen again and I get the cause&#x2F;effect, I will post here. But at this point, can&#39;t tell you what broke&#x2F;fixed it.</p>
