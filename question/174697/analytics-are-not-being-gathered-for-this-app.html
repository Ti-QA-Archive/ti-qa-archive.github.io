							<div><p>When you don&#39;t get answer, this means that developers and the company don&#39;t really care us. I have added analytics events added 7 days back, but till now, don&#39;t find any report, always getting  &quot;Analytics are not being gathered for this app.&quot;  Tomorrow we have customer demo, no luck with this.  I am getting frustrated by appcelerator, would be great if they could charge us a licensing fee yearly and resolve the questions. Planning to move to HTML5, Cordova in near time.  </p>
<p>I feel like lost between  mountain and sea, either too high or too deep, that too in early startup stage. We do the information app, not a game, I don&#39;t know what Ti.Next and Windows support to bring for high performance game&#x2F;app, but wish the appcelerator team best for whatever you think &amp; do as great.  Looking forward to move to HTML5.</p>
