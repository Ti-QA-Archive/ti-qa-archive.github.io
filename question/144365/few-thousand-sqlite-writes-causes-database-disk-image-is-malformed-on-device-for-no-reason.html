			<h1>Few thousand Sqlite Write&#39;s causes: Database Disk Image is Malformed on device, for no reason..</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>During stress testing of my app I&#39;ve hit an issue. My app (for engineering) must work offline and is data intensive (30+ tables, 50+ views, 100,000+ rows of data easily per project).</p>
<p>As a test I am trying to synchronise 16000 sets of data from my webservices sent atomically as JSON to a device. Essentially the device calls delete() in case the record already existed, then inserts().</p>
<p>In the simulator, all 16,0000 deletes + inserts runs perfectly</p>
<p>On a device however (iPad2, iPad3 &amp; iPhone4s tested, running latest SDK, iOS5 and 6 tested) it gets through on average between 3000 - 5000 deletes then inserts and it throws an exception on the delete()</p>
<p>Database Disk Image is Malformed on device</p>
<p>That&#39;s it then, the DB is caput! No more deletes &#x2F; inserts are possible.. Reads are fine.. </p>
<ul>
<li>It&#39;s not the data, as it never happens on the same record twice (or anywhere near)</li>
<li>I have tried keeping the database open for the whole session (normaly how I do it)</li>
<li>Tried closing &#x2F; opening the db connection after every delete &#x2F; insert (slower but still breaks)</li>
<li>I&#39;ve tried after every few 100 inserts, closing the connection, returning from my web-service routine, setting a timeout for 4 seconds to give the GC a chance to run and then re-start syncing</li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing stops it happening..</p>
<p>What would cause this, on device only operation? Why can&#39;t I delete() &#x2F; insert() forever..</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ll give it a go.. This will potentially half the writes but strange that it causes the error on a device when  the simulator can happily chug through all 16,000!?</p>

										<p><p>I cant think of a reason, why its getting broken. Space should not be an issue, as you say you delete them before.</p>
<p>if the above suggestion does not help a few things you could do: </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">- try calling <span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">delete</span>() <span class="hljs-keyword">only</span>
- try <span class="hljs-keyword">calling</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">insert</span>() <span class="hljs-keyword">only</span>

- try adding paging <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> your webservice, that said <span class="hljs-keyword">insert</span> <span class="hljs-number">1000</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">records</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">less</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">at</span> once, <span class="hljs-keyword">do</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">not</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">store</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">store</span> all <span class="hljs-number">16</span><span class="hljs-keyword">k</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> an <span class="hljs-built_in">array</span> (RAM)</span>
</code></pre><p>If nothing helps, it must be something strange with your code (but what? :) ) as such an error occurs really rarely</p>

										<p><p>It&#39;s never happened on my Mac, but It occurs everytime at different places on a device. I catch when it happens and I can verify the payload.</p>
<p>I think it&#39;s the Flash memory on the iPad as discussed here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sqlite.org&#x2F;howtocorrupt.html</p>
<p>It&#39;s a single record insert every time.. only 1 record in the array etc.. the only way I could make the test simpler is to insert the same record over and over..</p>
<p>I do have to admit that I am inserting BLOBs in there, but the data is all legit, and works.. When you first download a project database, the server packages up a fully up to date SQLite db, I&#39;ve seen a clients database be 350mb, and everything runs fine (bit of slow down where data complicated views are required)</p>
<p>This test will make the database just under 70mb in size..</p>

							<p>Are you using DB transaction?</p>
<p>Also, why &quot;delete&quot; and then &quot;insert&quot;? Why not just &quot;update&quot;?</p>

										<p><p>hi Ivan, I&#39;m not using a transaction, as synchronisation can take place as a background process, the user can continue working during a sync.</p>
<p>Most of the time, but not always you are expecting new data, so it&#39;s inserting, the delete was to make sure it didn&#39;t already exist, I&#39;m going to try the suggestion above of REPLACE</p>
</p>

										<p><p>Hm, I don&#39;t understand how can you do that without transaction. What if something &quot;brakes&quot; in a middle of synchronisation? I think you may end up in inconstant DB state.</p>
<p>You should really use DB transaction with &quot;INSERT OR REPLACE&quot; if there are ids in data you&#39;re getting from web service.<br>It should perform really well: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sqlite.org&#x2F;faq.html#q19">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sqlite.org&#x2F;faq.html#q19</a></p>

										<p><p>It depends on the implementation, e.g. how your sync is performed. You can safely sync a DB without transactions, if something wents wrong, just do it next time again.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Ivan, the web-services are designed specifically to fail anywhere. The 16,000 don&#39;t come down in 1 go, they come down individually, i&#39;ve modelled it how I imagine something like Dropbox works. In a nutshell, the server tells the device all the record sets it&#39;s missing from it&#39;s last sync. Then the device asks the server for each one when it&#39;s ready. It&#39;s totally atomic so has failure built in, it&#39;s expected and handles it.</p>
<p>My issue is 16,000 delete then insert operations on a DB, malforms the database on a device but never on the simulator. The device will ALWAYS do it in my tests, but somewhere between 2,400 and 5000 of the way through.. </p>
<p>If you don&#39;t create a transaction Sqlite creates a mini one for you, thats why multiple inserts not in a transaction takes so long with the creation and deletion of the .journal file</p>
