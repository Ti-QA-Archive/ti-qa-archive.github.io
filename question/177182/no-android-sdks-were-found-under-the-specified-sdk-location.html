			<h1>No Android SDKs were found under the specified SDK location</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,<br>I&#39;m stuck on this problem [Android SDK Home] No Android SDKs were found under the specified SDK location. This is now happening both on my Windows 7 and my Mavericks, both OSs cannot find the Android SDK anymore.</p>
<p>Titanium says [Android SDK Home] No Android SDKs were found under the specified SDK location.</p>
<p>I have tried everything suggested here, on Stack Overflow and on YouTube. None of the friggin witchcrafts worked.</p>
<p>I did install, uninstall, delete files, delete directories, try 3.1.3, move the SDK directories, change environment vars, change permissions, let Titanium download SDK on its own (instead of using Android SDK Manager). Nothing!</p>
<p>Why does it have so complicated! I&#39;ve got the Android directory full of files and I just need to tell Titanium where to find them! I do not need and I do not want to do anything else!</p>
<p>I do not want to waste time on this, I&#39;ve got mobile applications to work on! :(</p>
<p>I&#39;m very very frustrated, I&#39;ve spent two days already.</p>
<p>Do I have to abandon Titanium? Because that&#39;s what&#39;s gonna happen!</p>

							<p>When you go into Titanium Studio, Preferences, then expand Studio&#x2F;Platforms and click Android, is the path to your Android SDK shown there? If not you can specify it there.</p>

										<p><p>Hello Ray,<br>the path to my SDK directory is correctly shown. </p>
<p>In fact here (Preferences &gt; Studio&#x2F;Platforms &gt; Android) is where <strong>[Android SDK Home] No Android SDKs were found under the specified SDK location</strong> is shown after I point Titanium to the Android SDK directory.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

							<p>Instead, try GenyMotion, it comes with default Android SDK.<br>It is much faster than Android SDK you are trying and saves a lot of time.<br>Try following:<br><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fokkezb.nl&#x2F;2013&#x2F;10&#x2F;29&#x2F;genymotion&#x2F;">STEPS</a></p>

										<p><p>Hello Pratod,<br>I do know Genymotion. The problem in my case is that Titanium does not like the path to the Android SDK. The SDK is needed to compile the APK which would later be launched on any AVD or Genymotion. So if Titanium can&#39;t find the directory it can&#39;t compile.</p>
<p>Is what you are suggesting something else?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

										<p><p>Try leaving all fields under (Preferences &gt; Studio&#x2F;Platforms &gt; Android) empty.</p>
<p>then try installing and configuring GenyMotion.</p>
<p>Open and Play the Device you installed in GenyMotion (eg. Nexus 4)</p>
<p>Right click on the project TiStudio and &quot;Run As&quot; -&gt; Here the device from GenyMotion should populate automatically.</p>
<p>Let me know if it works.<br>I emptied all fields under (Preferences &gt; Studio&#x2F;Platforms &gt; Android) and did above steps and was able to execute my app on GenyMotion emulator.</p>
<p>If this doesnt work, try setting full control permissions on the SDK folder and then set its path in Studio, might work, not sure.<br>let me know how it goes.</p>

							<p>Here&#39;s the solution on Windows 7!</p>
<p>From CMD run <code>npm install titanium -g</code></p>
<p>Then go to <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nodejs.org&#x2F;download&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nodejs.org&#x2F;download&#x2F;</a> and install latest Node.js Windows Installer.</p>
<p>Finally do not use 3.3.0 as build properties, choose 3.2.3 or 3.2.0.</p>

							<p>I have had the same problem for days. Looking for a solution, but instead found speculation, some good, some not so good. This appears to be a bug found and supposedly fixed in ~Feb &#39;14., but obviously not. It seems it was acknowledged again Aug &#39;14 that the bug exists. </p>
<p>Like many who have this problem, I&#39;m looking for a fix or ACTUAL workaround. I read the website with all the marketing hype and I&#39;ve got to wonder!</p>
