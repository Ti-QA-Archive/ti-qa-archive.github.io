			<p>Assuming I have a table with 20 rows and each row have 1 children view.</p>
<p>I then added postlayout event to each view and a have the following code on postlayou callback:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> view = Ti.UI.createView({id: <span class="hljs-string">'rowview'</span>});

<span class="hljs-comment">// view is added to Ti.UI.createTableViewRow</span>

view.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'postlayout'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{
   <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(e.source.id == <span class="hljs-string">'rowview'</span>) {
      Ti.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">"postlayout was called"</span>);
      <span class="hljs-comment">// do clean up here</span>
   }
});
</code></pre><p>On iOS, when window opens postlayout fires 20 times which means that rows are rendered immediately without doing anything.</p>
<p>On Android, postlayout triggered is the first 5-6 rows and as you scroll the table downward, postlayout for other are loaded. Is this how android suppose to work and how would you force android to render all rows of a table immediately when window opens without scrolling?</p>
<p>This is on 2.1.4.GA</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I wonder if you are confusing <strong>Lazy loading</strong> and <strong>cache rendering</strong>.  The <strong>tableView</strong> implementations are different between iOS and Android, their respective operating systems handle this processing internally.</p>
<p>iOS has always managed to keep more <strong>tableViewRows</strong> and more <strong>imageViews</strong> on those rows in memory.  Android keeps a tighter hold on the memory exposed to the <strong>tableView</strong>.</p>
<p>Both OS use the <strong>className</strong> property of rows to help manage the caching of rows that are outside the current <strong>tableView</strong> viewable portal.  So when new rows are about to move into the viewable portion a row that has left the viewable portion is then swapped out rather than recreating a fresh one.  This is an important memory management feature.</p>
<p>The <strong>imageView</strong> with a remote image URL does perform a true lazy load and again iOS manages more of these in memory than Android but they both automatically handle the process behind the scenes.</p>
<p>There is no way in Titanium to force rendering of all rows, this is due to the automatic handling.  </p>
<p>If you only have a few rows - you could use a parent <strong>view</strong> with the <strong>layout</strong> property set to <strong>vertical</strong> and then use normal views as child views.</p>

										<p><p>The reason iOS shows more is because it assigns more memory to the <strong>tableView</strong>.</p>
<p>Another reason is that iOS has always favoured immediate UI feedback over ALL other cpu processes, UI under iOS has the same importance of all other system events.</p>
<p>Android since its inception has always acted more like a desktop operating system where it provides all function an equal footing even if that means the UI is slower.  This was not an intentional lack of interest, simply a focus that was never made.  Changes are bing made in many sub-systems these days, but not across the board - that will likely be another 1 or two major versions away yet.</p>

										<p><p>Is there a way to somehow increase the rendered row by default on Android? If I&#39;m not mistaken the only rows that actually appears on screen are those that are rendered. If we can render like 10-20 hidden rows so scrolling is smoother.</p>
<p>We unfortunately have many rows approximately 50 which we need to load all at the same time. Also, In our case, adding className didn&#39;t improve the performance of table. So we converted parent rowview to image using .toImage() as discussed here:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;133577&#x2F;improve-table-view-performance</p>
<p>We tried the above implementation and it improved scrolling on Android. We tested it with fixed size just to see if it indeed work but since our row is not fixed, we needed postlayout to get the height of row.</p>

										<p><p>I think you may be right about cache rendering. Even iOS doesn&#39;t render hidden rows by default. I just tested on a separate app and behaviour looks the same on both iOS and Android. Not sure why on our app, it was behaving differently.</p>
<p>I think the bottom line of our problem is we cannot get list to scroll to the point that it is usable with about 25-50 rows. I cannot say that we have a very complex row. Row structure looks like this:</p>
<p>row &gt;<br>    view(vertical) &gt;<br>       label<br>       another label</p>
<p>We have className on row implemented but its not scrolling well on properly on Kindle Fire 2nd gen which is quite a powerful device. </p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for your time answering our questions and we&#39;ll probably try to re-create my problem on separate sample project and try to determine the difference.</p>

										<p><p>The short answer is no, as mentioned before it is handled behind the scenes.</p>
<p>I would personally never use <strong>toImage</strong> as it is a memory hog and is used to solve a problem that usually has a better, simpler and automatically calculating version.</p>
<p>Let me have your <strong>tableViewRow</strong> code and a brief description of what layout you are after that you are currently having to manually calculate and I will see if I can achieve it without any <strong>postLayout</strong> manual calculations.  Midnight in the UK so will be first thing in the morning.</p>

							<p>I might be referring to cache rendering. </p>
<p>No problem with slow down on postlayout firing. I didn&#39;t indicate the remove listener on code above but I&#39;m able to correctly remove them.</p>
<p>Anyway, I wonder why postlayout of all view which is inside a row on iOS gets triggered immediately based on test I made. While on android, postlayout gets triggered as you scroll the table down so its like rendering the row only when its about to display.</p>
<p>I will try to write a sample code for this so I can make myself clearer.</p>
<p>Thanks for the input by the way.</p>

										<p><p>Quick tip; please comment on the related answer or the actual question if there is no answer - rather than creating a whole new answer which is really a comment - it makes it harder in the future to work out threads if answers scores change or other answers are added.
