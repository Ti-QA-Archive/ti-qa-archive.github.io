			<h1>Titanium : is it a gag ?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello from Paris, France,</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to see how Titanium is working to try to create few thing at the beginning and what I see does not show me something very professional at the end… Or may be I&#39;m missing something…</p>
<p>First of all you&#39;re talking about the 1.6.1 : I have download using Titanium the update but I&#39;m still in 1.2.2 in titanium developper… no indication of 1.6.1…</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to set up Android and it is quite impossible : you have to enter several command lines etc… Am I on Mac or what … ?</p>
<p>Also there is an opensource projet for iPad, I download it but it is simply impossible to run it in the titanium developper…</p>
<p>I&#39;m really wondering if I&#39;m the only one to get all these troubles…</p>
<p>I&#39;d love to try to develop something but it really doesn&#39;t seems easy instead of what the site try to make me believe…</p>
<p>Alex</p>

							<div><p>It was a little tricky for me to get android running in it, but now it works fine. The android emulator is a pile though and runs terribly slow. Titanium itself is in its early stages and still has bugs, however, it has done wonders for me and the company I work for.</p>

							<div><p>hello Aaron do you feel better saying that also ? Did you read all the messages saying it&#39;s not working properly with android ???<br>Did you also read all the guides ?<br>I read several post saying that with android it is note working that your have to modify the path and then not and then yes because the adb has moved to platform-tools…</p>
<p>Hello I&#39;m using a mac, not linux or windows… So I expect that it might be simple and not needed to be an expert with the system (in some post you see &quot;try sudo with the admin account…&quot;…</p>
<p>What I&#39;m saying is that it is an application that is in version 1.2.2 not a beta program… so can we expect that it works fine like on the video ?</p>

							<p>Personally, I thought getting started was very difficult. And, even after getting started, the development of applications is very difficult as well. However, I am assuming that in order to accomplish developing iPhone and Android applications the overall time will be cut in half by using Titanium Developer because otherwise I would have to learn how to write and use the iPhone and Android SDKs.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t use the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Getting+Started+with+Titanium">wiki tutorial</a> Andrew mentioned. I googled for some of the installation issues I was having and found a <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;query7.com&#x2F;titanium-mobile-android-development-installation">tutorial</a> by Query7 to be helpful.</p>
<p>I essentially started by using other people&#39;s examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cssgallery.info&#x2F;custom-row-for-tableview-in-appcelerator-titanium&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cssgallery.info&#x2F;custom-row-for-tableview-in-appcelerator-titanium&#x2F;</a></li>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;query7.com&#x2F;titanium-mobile-android-development-first-application">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;query7.com&#x2F;titanium-mobile-android-development-first-application</a></li>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.tutsplus.com&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium-mobile-database-driven-tables-with-sqlite&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.tutsplus.com&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium-mobile-database-driven-tables-with-sqlite&#x2F;</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Oddly enough, I have actually found this Q&amp;A to be VERY helpful. Typically you will get a same-day response, if not within minutes. Be sure to view the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Contributing+to+Titanium#ContributingtoTitanium-ParticipatingintheQ%26A">Participating in the Q&amp;A guide</a> for tips on getting more accurate answers more quickly.</p>
<p>Hope any of this helps!</p>

							<p>We have been using Titanium on our Macs without a hitch over the last several weeks for all the platforms you mentioned.  What is the exact issue you are encountering?</p>

							<p>@Brian : when I try to install the android ressources I have a error message saying that the adb or android is not found in tools… Which is partialy false as android in tools but not adb that the android documentation says it moved to platform-tools…<br>It is hard for me to understand how it is hard to install such things that seems to be so simple in the video…</p>
<p>Also the program I&#39;m talking about for ipad is ABC&#39;s Writer… no way to have the button to simulate it….</p>
<p>I really appreaciate the effort that is done to simplify and try to unify the development for iphone and android but at the end I have the strange feeling that I&#39;ll spend more time to try to install the plateforme that to develop on it…</p>
