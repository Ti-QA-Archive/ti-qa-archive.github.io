							<div><p>I started seeing this problem yesterday as well.  The window that is shown looks like the Facebook.com mobile website and after authentication, it says &quot;The page you requested was not found&quot;.  If you close that window and then click the login with Facebook button again, it works properly.  It looks like something at Facebook changed because one of my iPhone apps in the app store now has this issue as well and it has not been modified since it was released around a month ago.  </p>
<p>I&#39;m hoping we can brainstorm work arounds…</p>

							<div><p>Thanks for your prompt reply.<br>It was working fine yesterday till 03:00PM IST, because i tested my app on that time, may be after that facebook has made some changes in their api and its giving error..  </p>
<p>Yes, i also observe that when you close the page not found error page and again clicks on Facebook login button, it treat user as logged in user and it works perfectly. So something is the issue of the page redirection which facebook doing internally and which is not in existent.</p>
<p>Also i observe that when you logout from &quot;Page not found&quot; error page then the login screen which appears now is different than the login screen which appears initially. Initial login screen has connect button and login screen which come after logout has Login button. This is the error of facebook and may be they will fix it soon. The new login page is redirecting user to the page which is not exist.</p>

							<div><p>It&#39;s working for me now, but I don&#39;t know whether it is because FB fixed it or because I added an app domain and &quot;Website with Facebook Login&quot; url to my app basic settings? Can someone else check and let us know?</p>

<li>I set up an App Page under the app Advanced setting a few hours ago.</li>
<li>Just now I added a dummy App Domain.</li>
<li>Added a dummy web site (that matched the domain) in the &quot;Website with Facebook Login&quot; url under basic app settings.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not sure any of that is related to it now working, but I read something about FB redirecting apps to an app page instead of a profile page.</p>

							<div><p>Tried the three steps Simon wrote, and my app is working without any problems again. I don&#39;t know if the changes had anything to do with the fix, as I was too lazy to check if it was working again before making the changes :p</p>

							<p>Interesting.  I modified my Facebook app&#39;s advanced settings and set the Authentication to native&#x2F;desktop and now the authentication in the app works again though the login screen is different.</p>
