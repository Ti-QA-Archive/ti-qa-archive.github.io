							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Do not worry it is related.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to understand is stickers are not a &quot;thing&quot;, there are not sticker markets that you can add to your app as some sort of library.</p>
<p>Viber sells &quot;stickers&quot; which are simply in-app-content that their audience think is worth spending some money on (opinions vary).  Where viber use stickers, other apps have coins, or extra lives or better car paintwork or different dresses.  Basically you have something that could enhance the user perspective of the app by allowing them to personalise the app.</p>
<p>Some of these purchases are to enable you to give something to someone else, so in this case a sticker could be purchased to add to your chat to send to a friend - they receive the sticker on their app as you bought it for them.</p>
<p>I am not going to go into if I think this sort of thing is a good idea or a bad one.  But there is a certain percentage of users who think these choices are very important and they &quot;eat them up&quot;.</p>
<p>So, yes you can have stickers - but you have to create the sticker and decide how it works in your app.  If you want to have 20 stickers available - you have to design 20 stickers.  If you want user to be able to but and then send them to others - you have to have your software understand that can happen.</p>
<p>What you want is in-app-purchasing (IaP) as the thing they are buying is used in the app and NOT a physical good outside of the app then IaP is the thing you need.  Android and iOS have different ways to handle this, but they work in the same basic way.  You set up the things that can be bought by users in the app entry in the stores and give them prices and ids.  In your app you call the service and get a list f those things available and offer them.  In the case of stickers these are likely to be a one of purchase (use it and lose it) if that is the case then no need to offer the option to retrieve previous purchases.  You then make your app understand what it does with the stickers and you are sorted.</p>
<p>Just to be clear stickers could mean anything you want, they could be change the app to a different colour or have a different alert sound.  Stickers are NOT something that exists as a facility you just add.</p>
