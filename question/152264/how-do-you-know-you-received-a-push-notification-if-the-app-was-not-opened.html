			<h1>how do you know you received a push notification if the app was not opened</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>When I receive a Push Notification on my iOS device, I see that little alert on the top of the screen. If I click it, the app opens, and the notification callback is called. But if I don&#39;t click it, and I open the app from the app icon as usual, how can I access what notifications were sent. Is this possible?</p>

										<p><p>Hi there are two methods how the push notification appear</p>
<p>1)If the app is open it would be in the callback function</p>
<p>2)Otherwise a second type of alert comes on the screen</p>
<p>So you could say that user always see a push notification</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
