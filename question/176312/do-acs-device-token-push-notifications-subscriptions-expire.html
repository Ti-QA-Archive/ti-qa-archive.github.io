			<h1>Do ACS Device Token Push Notifications subscriptions expire?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am developing an alloy Android app using Titanium Studio, build: 3.3.0.201407100905.  The app is using device token GCM push notifications with ACS.</p>
<p>Once a device has successfully subscribed to a notification channel, will the subscription automatically expire at some point in time, and need to be renewed?    Should the device re-subscribe every time the app is loaded, perhaps via a call in alloy.js, or is this unnecessary?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

							<p>Couple of ways to think about this. (we re-register regularly, but the question is &#39;when&#39;)</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Is the push tied to a specific user? Meaning, do you have user accounts in your app? If so, then you reregister and add user id, or some other var so you can send a push JUST to the device that user is on.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If your app is not user specific, then reregister on start.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While some services allow you to simply update a var associated with a user, this approach works across different push providers.</p>

										<p><p>we also delay our first push request until we have built a &#39;relationship&#39; with the user. Meaning, if this is the first time the app has run, and the user (anon or not) hasnt had a chance to play with the app, then they are less likely to agree to push notifications.  so delay registering, which on IOS will throw up a permissions dialog)</p>

										<p><p>Hi Stephen,</p>
<p>Thanks for the detailed answer, and explanation.  Since my notices are not user specific, I&#39;ll go with reregister at start up so as to ensure the device stays registered.</p>
