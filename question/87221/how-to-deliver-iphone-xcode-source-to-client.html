			<h1>How to deliver iPhone Xcode source to client</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>We are developing an app that must now be delivered as an xcodeproj to our client so they can sign, build for release, and upload to the App store under their name and provisioning files. Not being an Xcode developer at all (Ti only), can anyone tell me exactly which directories and files need to be zipped and sent to the client to do this?  I assume it is somewhere in the project&#39;s build&#x2F; tree, but cannot tell what the entire repository is for a Ti project.</p>
<p>Need help asap - thanks!</p>

							<p>Actually, it&#39;s not quite as simple as all that - but Jeff wrote a script to allow you to do this.  It&#39;s called transport.py and its under support&#x2F;iphone directory in source.  Here&#39;s a direct pointer to it.</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_mobile&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;support&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;transport.py</p>
<p>You run the script like:</p>
<p>.&#x2F;transport.py &lt;project_dir&gt;</p>
<p>where project_dir is the root directory of a project (same level as tiapp.xml).</p>
<p>This will package all the dependencies of Titanium inside the build&#x2F;iphone folder so that the project folder can be zipped and sent to another machine with no dependencies on Titanium Developer or the SDK.  They will need to run the build from Xcode at that point (which is what they want).  </p>
<p>To build for production&#x2F;package, they will need to make sure they switch to &quot;Device&quot; and &quot;Release&quot; in Xcode.</p>
<p>They will still need to zip the project folder (in other words, from the tiapp.xml down), since the scripts still need access to the JS files, images, etc when they run xcode.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, Kevin - that explains why I could not find any of my project JS code in the build area.  But if the above script puts the required files into the build&#x2F;iphone dir, and that is in the project dir, do I zip up the entire project dir, which include the tiapp.xml, Resources&#x2F;<em> (source JS files and images), </em>and* the entire build&#x2F; tree, after running the transport.py script?  And the client will find the Xcode project dir they need along with the source files from the Resources dir?  Or should I zip them separately?</p>

										<p><p>Aside from above questions:<br>1) Does running the script permanently alter the build&#x2F; dir structure, such that I need to remove or undo something after delivery?</p>
<p>2) What if I need to furnish an update to the source code - do I still need to zip up the entire thing? In either case, what would I need to send as the update - just the Resources&#x2F; dir?</p>
<p>Thanks - need to send this to anxious client today, and want to make sure they get what they need &amp; will know where to find everything.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, you will need to zip up the entire project (Resources, tiapp.xml, build directories and all).  For them to open the Xcode project, they will need to navigate to the build&#x2F;iphone folder in the zip you send them.</p>
<p>This shouldn&#39;t alter your project (in terms of how it builds and runs for you).  If you need to provide an update, you will again need to run the script and zip up the entire project for transport to them.</p>

<p>Zip everything in that directory.  Also, they&#39;re going to need to make sure that they use the same app id as what you&#39;re using.</p>
