							<div><p>Has the framework been added to the xcode project file too? </p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s exactly required, but it might be. </p>
<p>Also, remember to delete the build folder before rebuilding. </p>
<p>You should try running build in XCode too. That might give you a better debug&#x2F;error report for you see what&#39;s going wrong.</p>

							<p>Just answering my own question as I had resolved this.</p>
<p>This error was coming from 2 different issues. </p>
<p>1] The custom framework I was loading in the module was not actually making it to the application. I resolved this by using linker flags to a hard path of the framework</p>
<p>OTHER_LDFLAGS=$(inherited) -F&quot;${HOME}&#x2F;my&#x2F;framework&#x2F;path&quot; -framework MyFramework -ObjC -all_load -fobjc-arc</p>
<p>note that I have -all_load -fobjc-arc. This is to tell the module to build with ARC enabled (you also have to enable arc under build settings). Without this you need to use variable counting (retain, release, autorelease) which I am not overly familiar with.</p>
<p>2] One of my methods was to return a type of id but did not actually return anything. This would cause a linker error inside of Titanium Studio, but not in the actual Xcode project.</p>
<p>-(id)myMethod:(id)args {}</p>
<p>changed to</p>
<p>-(void)myMethod(id):args {}</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m rolling up my sleeves as well and writing a module for myself.  Ran into the same linking issue as well.  I thought I had all of the appropriate flags.  Really wishing there was a simple checkbox on the framework &quot;Link Statically&quot; :-) I ended up just pulling the binary and headers out the framework and pointing at them directly.</p>

										<p><p>Hi James Lockhart,</p>
<p>I am also facing the same issue. Could you please tell me what the path you meant about in the answer you gave. I mean which path I need to give in &quot;${HOME}&#x2F;my&#x2F;framework&#x2F;path&quot; here and which framework I need to include in &quot;MyFramework&quot;</p>

										<p><p>awesome, thank you very much,  I had the same problem trying to run on device my app, I was installed a module (ios-parse-titanium-module) that needs these flags, in my case had to add them in the file module.xconfig that were in the root of the module source code</p>

							<p>Awesome. So after opening the project in Xcode I was able to trace the error down to the framework not being linked properly. After some digging I now have it included in the Xcode project, the app runs inside of the Xcode project, but still the build fails in Titanium Studio with the same error.</p>
<p>deleting the build folder didn&#39;t help with the error unfortunately.</p>
