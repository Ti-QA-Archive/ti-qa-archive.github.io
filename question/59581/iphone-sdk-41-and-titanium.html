			<h1>iPhone sdk 4.1 and Titanium</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have only the iPhone 4.1 sdk installed on my Snow Leopard install, and importing the kitchen sink makes it hang when I try the emulator.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve read on here about deleting the iphone&#x2F;build directory, doesnt work.</p>
<p>I cant use the 1.4 version of Titanium, that hangs on looking for a custom font.</p>
<p>The earlier one (I dont have my machine here at the moment) seems like it compiles further, but then it starts saying files are missing, something along the lines of &#x2F;Classes&#x2F;SomethingSomething (again, I dont have it here at the moment).</p>
<p>Ideas?  Anyone going to respond?</p>

							<p>I&#39;m using osx 10.6.4 and I don&#39;t think it will make any difference.  What is the version of Titanium sdk?</p>
<p>I would try deleting all the folders&#x2F;files under build&#x2F;iPhone directory.  The custom font issue is also resolved by doing the above.</p>

										<p><p>The sdk is 1.4 (I believe that is what is prompted to downloaded after initially installing).  </p>
<p>If I leave it as the 1.4, then it hangs on the custom font (removing that directory didnt do anything), if I change it to the previous build, then it goes further, and tells me I have missing files.  I cloned the github source so everything should be there.</p>
<p>Also, it does this using the 3.2 (auto installed with Snow Leopard) and also the 4.1 ios sdk.</p>

							<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have upgraded iOS sdk to 4.1 and using Titanium sdk 1.4.0 without any issue.  Kitchen sink and other apps are working absolutely fine.  The only thing is I get weird debug messages on the console when I run the app. A ticket is already logged in appcelerator light house regarding this.  Except this,  everything else seems to work fine.  </p>
<p>Here is the console output:</p>
<p>Detected an attempt to call a symbol in system libraries that is not present on the iPhone:<br>mmap$UNIX2003 called from function _Z20TCMalloc_SystemAllocmPmm in image RevOnline.Ordering.<br>Detected an attempt to call a symbol in system libraries that is not present on the iPhone:<br>pthread_cond_init$UNIX2003 called from function _ZN3WTI17TCMalloc_PageHeap4initEv in image RevOnline.Ordering.<br>Detected an attempt to call a symbol in system libraries that is not present on the iPhone:<br>pthread_cond_wait$UNIX2003 called from function _ZN3WTI17TCMalloc_PageHeap15scavengerThreadEv in image RevOnline.Ordering.<br>Detected an attempt to call a symbol in system libraries that is not present on the iPhone:<br>mprotect$UNIX2003 called from function _ZN2TI3JIT35privateCompileCTIMachineTrampolinesEPN3WTI6RefPtrINS_14ExecutablePoolEEEPNS_12TiGlobalDataEPNS_21MacroAssemblerCodePtrES9_S9<em>S9</em> in image RevOnline.Ordering.<br>Detected an attempt to call a symbol in system libraries that is not present on the iPhone:<br>munmap$UNIX2003 called from function _ZN2TI14ExecutablePool13systemReleaseERKNS0_10AllocationE in image RevOnline.Ordering.</p>

										<p><p>Hmm, any suggestions as what I can be doing wrong?  I have Snow Leopard 10.6.3, iOS sdk 4.1 (installed yesterday), latest Titanium (it did the auto-update after I installed), and it flakes on me.</p>
<p>Is there any patching or anything I need to do to get this to work?</p>
