		<section>
			<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>since we are developing mobile applications I&#39;m interested in performance enhancements and lower the usage of bandwith of our app users. so I took a deeper look at what is going on in our application and what I experienced was &quot;this&quot;:</p>
<p>I have a image with a size of ~140kb. After the user selects it from his gallery (Titanium.Media.openPhotoGallery) it has a size of 330kb… My question is why? What am I doing wrong? We upload this file to our server. We&#39;ve build our own image compression module for titanium to compress the file before uploading but however - it won&#39;t become smaller than ~200 kb… so the result is: even with compression our image is bigger than the original and that doesn&#39;t satisfy me at all :)</p>
<p>any ideas?</p>
<p>regards,<br>flo</p>
