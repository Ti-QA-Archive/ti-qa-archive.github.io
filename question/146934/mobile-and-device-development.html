			<p>Hello, i just reinstalled Titanium and i ran into a problem.</p>
<p>When i try to create a Titanium module project it tells me i need to install JDT.<br>When i click the link it shows me an outdated tutorial on how to install. However i have installed this before. Now when i try to install it tells me it cannot install because it is already installed: error log: </p>
<p>Cannot complete the request.  See the error log for details.<br>&quot;C&#x2F;C++ GCC Cross Compiler Support&quot; will be ignored because it is already installed.<br>&quot;Remote System Explorer End-User Runtime&quot; will be ignored because it is already installed.<br>&quot;Remote System Explorer User Actions&quot; will be ignored because it is already installed.<br>&quot;Sequoyah VNC Viewer Runtime&quot; will be ignored because it is already installed.<br>&quot;Sequoyah Common Libraries&quot; will be ignored because it is already installed.<br>&quot;Mobile Tools for Java&quot; will be ignored because it is already installed.<br>&quot;eRCP Designer&quot; will be ignored because it is already installed.<br>&quot;C&#x2F;C++ Memory View Enhancements&quot; will be ignored because it is already installed.<br>&quot;Sequoyah Android Native Code Support&quot; will be ignored because it is already installed.<br>&quot;Mobile Tools for Java SDK&quot; will be ignored because it is already installed.<br>&quot;Sequoyah Android Localization Editor&quot; will be ignored because it is already installed.<br>&quot;Sequoyah Device Framework Runtime&quot; will be ignored because it is already installed.<br>&quot;C&#x2F;C++ Remote Launch&quot; will be ignored because it is already installed.<br>&quot;Sequoyah VNC Viewer Library&quot; will be ignored because it is already installed.<br>&quot;C&#x2F;C++ GDB Hardware Debugging&quot; will be ignored because it is already installed.<br>&quot;Sequoyah Localization Tools&quot; will be ignored because it is already installed.<br>&quot;Mobile Tools for Java Examples&quot; will be ignored because it is already installed.<br>&quot;Target Management Terminal&quot; will be ignored because it is already installed.<br>&quot;Sequoyah Protocol Runtime&quot; will be ignored because it is already installed.</p>

							<p>Hi Ralph, try to upgrade with Titanium 3.0 SDK and Studio, then <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Installing_the_Java_Development_Tools">follow this link here</a>.</p>
<p>This should resolve your problem. i recommend you use eclipse for module development as an better approach.</p>

										<p><p>Titanium Studio, build: 3.0.1.201212181159,  on Windows 8. </p>
<p>I downloaded the latest version from Titanium studio yesterday. Then i downloaded android SDK an installed everything. then i used <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Installing_the_Java_Development_Tools">Your link </a> Then i tried to create a project, but i screwed something up,</p>
<p> so i tried deleting the project. Wich did not work, i deleted my Titanium Workspace and Android SDK Directory. After that i installed everything in the exact same way as before however this time it told me the Mobile and Device development was already installed. However it told me to install it when i created a project.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Ralph and Ashish,</p>
<p>there is a ticket filed in Jira for that issue <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TISTUD-2908">TISTUD-2908 Studio: Installed JDT is not recognized in Windows 8</a></p>
<p>Status of the ticket is &quot;Cannot Reproduce&quot;, but in comments they are talking about an issue with <strong>Indigo vs helios repository</strong> .</p>
<p>Hope that helps,</p>

										<p><p>@Matthias, thanks for the info, @Ralph you can use eclipse for building and packaging your module and that&#39;s even better approach in my view for developing module.</p>

							<p>Thank you Ashish, but this is what i tried several times, got the newest Titanium Studio, and when i try to update using that tuturial you gave me, it gives me the error log. I tried a totally fresh installation, even downloading android sdk&#39;s again. But then when i try to download the Mobile and Device development from  <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Installing_the_Java_Development_Tools">this link</a>, it still gives me the error log.</p>
