							<p>I would try breaking it down and simplifying your entry code until you figure it out. It starts out by executing the code in your app.js so if it&#39;s erroring before it shows the first window then you know there is something wrong in app.js. If it shows the first window and then errors before it finishes rendering the controls then you know the issue is probably in the first window&#39;s code. You can also add in alert(&quot;reached point A!&quot;) lines into the code so you can see how far it executes and what it trips on. Once you find what is causing the issue then you can post it in a new thread if it&#39;s not obvious what&#39;s wrong.</p>

							<p>This happend to me a few times on Android, you have to rebuild your project step by step like Justin said.</p>
<p>There is something you used in your project that is not supported on you phone and&#x2F; or usually its a null reference, meaning you try to use an object that doesnt exicst.</p>
<p>can be a dead object as simple as a var, or arrays &#x2F; objects. With objects usually being the case.</p>

										<p><p>you can install on your mobile from windows? but not ubuntu? Please clarify this its not clear for me whenether you where able to install on phone or not. ( cus if not at all, thats a different problem )</p>
<p>i have no experience with ubuntu but there should be an other way of installing it onto your phone, prolly the install on phone doesnt work on ubuntu. Try googling a bit.</p>
<p>I know you can use command lines to install an app to your phone, maby you need to try that.</p>
