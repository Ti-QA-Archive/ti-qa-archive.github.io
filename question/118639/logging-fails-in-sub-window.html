			<h1>Logging Fails in Sub Window</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello, Logging works fine in app.js and included .js files, but logging called in windows created by a url aren&#39;t working for me. I could swear logging worked in the sub windows before. Am I doing something wrong or is this a bug? A simplified version of my code can be found here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;1805354 (Note most code was omitted and this paste includes the two files app.js and win.js in one file)</p>
<p>I have cleaned out my build file and saved changes in Titanium Developer as other similar threads recommended but I every time I only see the logging events from app.js.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help you can offer </p>

							<p>I figured it out, it was my oversight: basically I had no code that was requiring the window be &quot;run&quot;. I assumed the code of win.js would be run as soon as it was called, it appears it is run &quot;just in time&quot; when the window actually needs to be displayed.</p>
