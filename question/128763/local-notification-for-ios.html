							<p>Hi Stephen</p>
<p>There is different approach for IOS and Android. So for IOS you simply required to schedule the notification and the rest taken care by IOS.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">notifications = <span class="hljs-constant">Ti.App.</span>iOS.scheduleLocalNotification({
            <span class="hljs-symbol">alertBody:</span><span class="hljs-string">'This is notification'</span>,
            <span class="hljs-symbol">alertAction:</span><span class="hljs-string">"Continue"</span>,
            <span class="hljs-symbol">userInfo:</span>{<span class="hljs-string">"Id"</span><span class="hljs-symbol">:id</span>},
            <span class="hljs-symbol">date:</span>aTime.getTime(),
            <span class="hljs-regexp">//date</span><span class="hljs-symbol">:now</span>,
            <span class="hljs-symbol">repeat:</span><span class="hljs-string">"weekly"</span>
        });
</code></pre><p>you have to add the listener in your app if you wants to listen the notification.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// listen for a local notification event</span>
Ti.App.iOS.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'notification'</span>,<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span>
</span>{

    Ti.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">"local notification received: "</span>+ e.userInfo.Id);

});
</code></pre><p>Regards</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the reply Nikunj. I think I may have asked the question wrong.</p>
<p>My app currently doesn&#39;t run in the background. Meaning if I switch to a different app, the app must launch again, instead of being in the state where the user left it.</p>
<p>Is it required to your app run in the background enabled for local push notifications to work?</p>
<p>Here is my dilemma.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been using NON local push notifications where I send push notifications from my server to APPLES push notification service on a DAILY basis. I&#39;m finding that it takes my server 9 minutes to send about 3000 push notifications out. Going by that number, it doesn&#39;t really scale well. What would happen if I had 100 times that many users of my app. We would be looking at 900 minutes…way too long.</p>
<p>So, I decided I can just just sent up local push notifications with some pre-baked text that resides in the app. By design, my app is NOT currently configured to run in the background. </p>
<p>I would like to get local push notifications working, but need to know 2 things.</p>
<ol>
<li>Will it work if my app isn&#39;t enabled to run in the background.</li>
<li>Will users get local push notifications if my app IS enabled to run in the background BUT the app isn&#39;t currently running in the background. Maybe the user reset their iPhone. </li>
</ol>
<p>I want to make sure they receive their daily notifications.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Stephen</p>
<p>If local notification is implemented then it will not start by itself once the device is restart.. It can only be schedule when the  app start and that too if user uses that app and we have set the logic on app start</p>
<p>So the schedule notification only stop working once we restart the device but not on app focus lost or app is not running currently for IOS only.</p>
<p>in ios we do not require background service but android we do require it..</p>
<p>Regards</p>

										<p><p>It&#39;s not an answer, but I would love to see somebody from the Appcelerator team write a good tutorial on Notifications, background services, etc… for both IoS and Android.</p>
<p>It was the most difficult part of my recent app and had to resort to workarounds on the Android side of things.  It may just be me, but getting something to work significantly longer then the 4 seconds in Kitchen Sink was a real pain in the arse…</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the replies.</p>
<p>It looks like I will have to stick to normal push notifications as I must make sure the users get the notifications regardless of whether they are running the app or its closed (and not in the background).</p>
<p>I have to agree with documentation for this particular piece of the API. It was VERY difficult finding any kind of information on it and what was there was lacking.</p>
