			<h1>A zoomable and pannable view, like in Wordfeud</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi guys.</p>
<p>I&#39;m making a puzzle game, where it&#39;s possible to see the whole playfield. I&#39;d like to be able to zoom in a specific amount, on the playfield, and from here be able to pan around the zoomed playfield. This is to combat too small icons on devices with small screens. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve searched exhaustively and tried many, many different approaches to get this working, but I&#39;m running out of ideas. So if anyone has any input on how to achieve this in Titanium, I would appreciate it a lot!</p>
<p>The way it works in Wordfeud, is pretty smooth and flawless. You have a board with lots of square tiles, usually a bit too small to hit reliably on small screens. You can double-tap this board, and the view will be zoomed in to 2x scale, so the tiles are bigger, and you can pan around the board.</p>
<p>A few of the things I&#39;ve tried:</p>
<p>1) Tried to get panning working with a scrollView, however on Android, only one scroll direction can be used. Using a horizontal scrollview within another vertical scrollview, did not have the desired results.</p>
<p>2) For panning, also tried Webview. It works, you can pan&#x2F;scroll in both directions on Android. But it is of course slow, so I&#39;d like to avoid this solution.</p>
<p>3) Tried using 2dMatrix to scale and translate the view, to achieve both zoom of the &quot;playfield&quot; and panning - but the various objects (imageViews) I have in the playfield, lose the position of their click eventlisteners.. </p>
<p>4) Tried modifying zoomScale parameter on scrollView&#x2F;scrollableView, to achieve zooming, but this seems to do nothing - even if the required values are set on the scrollViews creation, as stated in other posts.</p>
