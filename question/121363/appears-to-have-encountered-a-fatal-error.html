			<p>When I upgraded titanium from the 3ts ago version to the latest, titanium started rejecting the launch. The error message I get is &quot;Titanium Developer appears to have encountered a fatal error and cannot continue. &quot; It also had an option &quot;SEND REPORT&quot; which I did a week ago. But still no luck. </p>
<p>What&#39;s your recommendations? Erase the entire titanium folder on the mac and get a fresh download?</p>

							<p>I&#39;m sorry for that spelling error! It was supposed to be 3mts  ( meaning 3 months ).</p>
<p>A little bit more insight to the problem. </p>
<p>I have different user accounts on the mac, admin, developer, kids etc. And Titanium used to run on all of them. 3 months ago, when I had the premium membership, I was using titanium under the &quot;developer&quot; account. The developer account has the same admin privilidges as the &quot;admin&quot; account. </p>
<p>After I hit that fatal error ( which started happening ith the latest download of titanium) , I wanted to try the one under &quot;admin&quot; account. This test is of course after my sending that original question.  </p>
<p>The admin version has worked. Then I tried the other accounts on the mac. and it turned out that every single failed, failed with the same fatal message. At this point, I don&#39;t see it as an error but as a licensing issue. It would be nice to get it working under my &quot;developer&quot; account but I&#39;m going to move on with the temporary solution I found. </p>
<p>Anyway, the bottom line is I was able to download the kitchensink and run it full fledged under 1.2.2 Titanium. The only error I encounter under the kitchensink app is when I click on the &quot;Display Contacts&quot;. I believe &quot;Display Contacts&quot; has an error in its javascript cause without an exemption, kitchensink exists out as soon as I click the &quot;display contacts&quot;.</p>
