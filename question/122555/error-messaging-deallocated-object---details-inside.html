			<p>Hello. Ok, following case:</p>
<p>I have a simple app.js which calls a custom obj-c module for iphone. This module loads an image from a file which i saved in the app.js … this image is processed by an algorithm in a c++ library then, and after that I save it back to a file .. So far, so good.. The whole plugin gets executed, I have a NSLog at the end of it and its still written, but after it goes back to the app.js my app crashes.</p>
<p>I debugged a bit and found out that the crash happens in the KrollContext.mm … down there is a small part where an </p>
<p>NSAutoreleasePool* pool_ = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];</p>
<p>is declarated and drained after some lines of code…</p>
<p>this happens in a while(stuff_in_queue) loop, so I think its the loop which watches if certain things have to be done or memory needs to be freed…</p>
<p>the problem is, that an object is autoreleased which is already deallocated</p>
<p>I had this strange problem in following situations too:</p>
<p>1.) I deleted the obj-c method where I execute the algorithm and did NOTHING -&gt;&gt; the error occured</p>
<p>2.) I deleted the obj-c method where I execute the algorithm and just did an NSLog -&gt;&gt; the error did NOT occur </p>
<p>I&#39;m confused :P </p>
<p>I don&#39;t know really how that process works and I don&#39;t want to spend THAT much time on that so I hope someone who knows a bit more details about the process going on here, could help me with my problem.</p>
<p>greetings</p>
