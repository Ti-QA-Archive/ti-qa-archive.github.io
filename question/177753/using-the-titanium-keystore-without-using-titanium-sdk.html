			<h1>Using the Titanium Keystore without using Titanium SDK</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am taking over an Android application that was originally signed with both a private keystore and the Titanium dev_keystore that ships with the SDK. The app was published to the Play Store being double-signed this way and the device will throw a signature error if the APK is not signed with both keys. </p>
<p>Does Titanium offer a free, perpetual license to use the keystore for signing of future applications which were originally developed with Titanium, but are later rewritten natively? </p>
<p>The alternative is to unpublish the old app and force new users to uninstall&#x2F;install a different app assuming they respond to an email campaign.</p>

							<div><p>You use jarsigner from the CLI to sign the apk again. It works, I&#39;ve tested it. I&#39;m pretty sure this is what Amazon does for their app store. </p>
<p>I can do an adb install -r to upgrade the market version with one I&#39;ve built and everything. </p>
<p>I&#39;m going to assume it isn&#39;t allowed and switch signing keys and package names unless I hear differently from Titanium before we ship.</p>

							<p>While this was an… odd process. Titanium is free&#x2F;open source  to use and modify as you see fit, they have stated this numerous times. I don&#39;t think this would be an exception. The included keystore is insecure as anyone can access it. But the double signing should eliminate that as a concern. There is no way Appcelerator could force a recall of the current included keystore even if they wanted to. Thousands of copies are already distributed. They can&#39;t just recall it.</p>
<p>I suppose you could always email them if you needed to be absolutely sure.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks. This is the answer I was looking for. This being a component of a FOSS IDE&#x2F;SDK didn&#39;t register. </p>
<p>At first it appeared to be a nefarious user lock-in by the tool itself, but after looking around it appears to be &quot;aggressive misunderstanding&quot; by the original developers.</p>

							<p>This question is confusing. Titanium has nothing to do with the keystore as titanium defers to the native tooling.</p>
<p>What you are really after is what is the password to the keystore that the app was signed with.</p>
<p>Titanium does provide a development keystore aliased tidev to which the password is tirocks.</p>
<p>Again, Titanium doesn&#39;t even factor in to your question.</p>

										<p><p>The development keystore that ships with the IDE was used to sign the app in addition to a key created by the previous developer team. I had already obtained the titanium keystore password from another forum post. I am able to successfully sign the app using both keys. The app must be signed by both keys or the device will reject it for a signature mismatch. </p>
<p>I know what I am doing. My question was &quot;Does Titanium offer a free, perpetual license to use the keystore for signing of future applications which were originally developed with Titanium, but are later rewritten natively?&quot;</p>

										<p><p>To clarify some more: I&#39;m aware they did it wrong and that double signing especially when one keystore ships to thousands of random people is a bad idea and only serves to lock you to the Titanium keystore forever.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure how or why they managed to do it really because it isn&#39;t easy to do. However, here I am with a released app in the Play Store and in order for Google Play and the Android OS to allow that package to be updated, I have to sign it with both keys.</p>
