			<p>Hello, </p>
<p>I&#39;ve been trying to debug my app. It <em>seems</em> to work just fine on the iPhone emulator. Then I tried to use it on my Android phone. The app just crashes. So I tried to run the debugger on my device. The app exits with error when I try to access a particular window but the question here is that in the debugger console I have this line: </p>
<p>[ERROR][msm8660.hwcomposer(  113)] invalid gralloc handle (at 0x122e4c8)</p>
<p>being output all the time even if I don&#39;t do anything.</p>
<p>Anybody can tell me what is happening here with this error being output all the time?</p>
<p>The app is built with alloy and titanium sdk 3</p>

I suggest you take a look at the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Using+Questions+and+Answers">Using Questions and Answers</a> article, specifically the Q&amp;A Question Checklist.  The missing information is critical to reproducing problems in a test environment and often indicates other factors that cause the undesirable outcome you are experiencing.</p>

							<div><p>I don&#39;t think you could be able to reproduce this. It looks like it&#39;s related to Android, maybe because of some error in the ROM on the phone I am using. (I&#39;ve read some posts on the XDA developers forum) I just can&#39;t find what msm8660.hwcomposer is. But this error is contaminating the logs because the same message is continuously printed in the console at a fast speed, making the debugging task annoying. I think the question is pretty straightforward and adding code would not help. At first I thought it was related to the app I was developing but as I said the error is displayed even when I don&#39;t do anything, it stops when the screen is turned off. I think I&#39;ll try to install another ROM on the phone. (the phone is an HTC Sensation running Android 4.0) maybe there is a way to filter the error too.</p>
