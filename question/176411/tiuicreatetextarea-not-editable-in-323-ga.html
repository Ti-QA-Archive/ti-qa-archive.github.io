			<h1>Ti.UI.CreateTextArea not editable in 3.2.3 GA</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m using Ti.UI.CreateTextArea with success in 3.1.3 GA (iOS SDK 5.02).  No problems with this functionality.  I can edit, pre-populate, and save without an issue.</p>
<p>In testing with 3.2.3 GA and OS SDK 5.11, I lose all functionality of the textareas.  They render, but are not editable and I can&#39;t enter text.  </p>
<p>Same code, different results.  Have not been able to find any bugs, or other issues with TextAreas in the 3.2.3 GA release.</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>A common issue in this sort of problem is an unexpected view covering the object you wish to interact with that has a transparent background.  This can change between SDKs if the layout does not tie things down specifically.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks.  I&#39;ll check the layout to ensure my textarea is not being overwritten by some other UI element.</p>

										<p><p>Issue resolved.</p>
<p>In 3.1.3 GA, the textfield was being added to a label.  For some reason it worked.</p>
<p>In the 3.2.3 GA environment, while it would render properly, the textfield was not editable when added to a label.  Makes sense.</p>
<p>This is code I inherited, by the way.</p>

										<p><p>You have stumbled upon an old issue that let the dev add kids to parents that were not good parents.</p>
<p>iOS would allow it (I think this has been normalised now - likely given what you found).</p>
<p>You can only add views to containers, so; window, view, scrollview are containers, but; labels, buttons, switches are not containers.</p>
<p>You can of course nest containers so view inside view inside view is perfectly fine.</p>
<p>So it was hidden&#x2F;covered ;-)</p>
