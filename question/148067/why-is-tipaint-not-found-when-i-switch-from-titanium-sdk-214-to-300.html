							<p>@Mark Actually most of these modules are built for titanium SDK 2.1.4.They have not been customized for the titanium 3.0 up-till now i have faced the same problem many times.Actually most of these modules were built when titanium was not available so you have to make compromise in one of them</p>

										<p><p>So what does that mean? I have to stay with 2.1.4 if I want to use ti.paint? Is Titanium a dead dev environment? What are the alternatives?</p>

										<p><p>It just seems most of the forums entries are years old like no one is using Titanium any more. Is there a better option for multi device development?</p>
