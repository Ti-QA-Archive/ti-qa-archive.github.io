			<h1>Platino Game Engine. Should I stop using TiQuickGame2D module after being acquired by Lanica?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Some weeks ago I started using this module to develop a Tiled Map based game (iOS and Android). But TiQuickGame2D has been recently acquired by <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lanica.co">Lanica</a>, as you can see in its <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.google.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;quicktigame2d">Google Code repository</a>, which now it&#39;s completely empty. They are building a Game Engine for Appcelerator called Platino, which I&#39;m sure it will be great, but now I don&#39;t know if I should continue using the module, wait for Platino or find another game engine module. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Does any one have an idea if Platino will be much differente from TiQuickGame2D? So it&#39;s still interesting for me to continue using it and change in a future to Platino?</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the case of choosing another game engine (iOS and Android), which one could I use? </p>
</li>
<li><p>Any idea when will Platino become reality?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<li>Im not exactly sure how close the old module will be to the new Platino, let me find out.</li>
<li>You probably won&#39;t find another engine like TiQuickGame. Maybe others are being used, but I don&#39;t know of any.</li>
<li>Platino will be demo&#39;d at Codestrong, probably with a beta not too far behind. Let me see if I can get one of the Lanica guys in here to answer the first part of your question.</li>

										<p><p>Thanks Anthony. </p>
<p>It would be great to have the documentation and examples of the module, they delete everything from the repository, even if I wanted to continue developing with this module, I have no documentation. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve already subscribe for the Beta, I hope it does not take much time to come.</p>

										<p><p>Ok, so I spoke to Carlos and he told me that they plan to have a beta out around Dec&#x2F;Jan time frame. He also said that they are going to be changing alot of stuff, but that the API was so well designed, that it may not stray too far from what it currently is.</p>
<p>In the end, the Platino engine will be much more and while some things from the current API may translate, you will still have to do some refactoring when it comes time to move from one engine to the other.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you Anthony. It&#39;s a very helpful and complete answer.</p>
<p>I think I will keep on working with the module, and once Platino is out, change to it. I&#39;m sure Platino will come with very good improvements and new features  :)  </p>
<p>Regards!</p>

										<p><p>Has the beta been released yet?  I really miss the module updates that Koti was making!  Plus, I would love to be able to use Box2D on Android (and hopefully faster particles)</p>
