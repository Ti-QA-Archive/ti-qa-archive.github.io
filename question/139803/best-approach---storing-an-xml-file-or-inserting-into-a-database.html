			<h1>Best approach - Storing an XML file or inserting into a database?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m working on part of an app which will fetch some data from a local js file for different sporting teams. But I would quite like this data to be dynamically updatable using xhr. But I&#39;m just wondering which approach would be best? Should I store xml files on my webserver and download the xml files, which I can then use to output the data. Or would it make more sense to parse the contents of the xml files straight away and store all the content in a database?</p>
<p>There isnt a lot of data, probably 50-100 files&#x2F;teams each with only around 3-4 values. The idea is that one of these values would also contain a link to an image&#x2F;icon for each, which would then also be downloaded and stored in the images folder.</p>
<p>Using XML to me seems like the better option to me, allowing me to just download any updated files without having to parse the data into a database, but I&#39;d love some thoughts on how you would think to do this?</p>

							<p>The way we are doing this is to use JSON files on a server rather than XML (JSON would tend to be a smaller file size). We have an update button (you could easily automate this) in the app which will look on the remote server for the files and download them to the local filesystem. We then use the local JSON files to load the data into the app. Hope this helps.</p>

										<p><p>I hadn&#39;t thought about actually storing the JSON in a file, thats a very interesting way of doing it. I may have to give it a go! Have you had any issues? or any reasons why you chose that over storing XML or anything else?</p>

										<p><p>We haven&#39;t had any problems with it so far.</p>
<p>The main reasons for using JSON over XML are, as stated above, that it is usually more lightweight, so smaller files to download which is usually pretty important in a mobile environment. Also, JSON is quicker to process as it is recognised by Javascript, so it should be quicker to actually process on the device.</p>
<p>If you already have XML files on the server it might be better to process them on the server and convert to JSON for downloading. The less processing you do on the device the better IMO.</p>

							<p>It depends on: In my projects I&#39;am parsing xml to json, strip JSON and store it stringified in DB</p>
