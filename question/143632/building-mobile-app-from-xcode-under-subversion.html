			<h1>Building mobile app from xcode under subversion</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi All</p>
<p>I am having trouble building my app in Xcode, when I put it under version control (using Versions on OSX). Everything works fine when launching the simulator from Titanium and all. But when I want to compile and sign my app using Xcode the problems begin (but only under SVN version control).</p>
<p>Xcode aborts the build process with the following message:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[<span class="hljs-built_in">ERROR</span>] <span class="hljs-keyword">While</span> reading /Users/ [some long <span class="hljs-keyword">local</span> path] /._startup.png pngcrush caught libpng <span class="hljs-built_in">error</span>
</code></pre><p>I don&#39;t have an image named &quot;._startup.png&quot;, I do however have one named &quot;startup.png&quot;. So that made me look in the .svn&#x2F;entries file located next to my image, and that has the string &quot;._startup.png&quot; in it.</p>
<p>It looks like on of the build scripts copies the Resources directory into Xcodes compilation and somehow gets the .svn files mixed up with actual image files?</p>
<p>My question is; How do I solve this?</p>

							<p>That is the problem with your image and can be solved by replacing the image file <strong>._startup.png</strong>. possible causes are improper image formatting or some conversion made over this image are not properly done.</p>

										<p><p>Actually the clean option is unavailiable (greyed out), I don&#39;t really know why, except the project was created using &quot;promote to project&quot; from a folder on the file system. That&#39;s another thing I just just get… But in response to your suggestion I tried clearing the build folder (deleting all files manually) and the performed a build, but it makes no difference to Xcode apparently.</p>

										<p><p>I just tried building and then exporting from SVN to a new folder, and then opening the .xcodeproj file from there, but it still fails with the same error. So apparently I have to export the versioned source code into an empty project to rebuild it there withon any SVN files in it? Really?</p>

										<p><p>SVN sub-versioning has nothing to do here, you just fresh checkout from SVN import it in titanium and remove your startup.png file add another file and try building again.</p>

										<p><p>I have tried replacing the image with one from another project that&#39;s working fine (but not under subversion). I also tried reencoding the image in photoshop. You may be right that&#39;s it&#39;s not related to subversion, but I am sure the image is fine.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Martin, image encoding may be correct but when we deploy on iOS device it compile the images and compress them as per their algorithm. so when it compresses then it is creating problem somewhere.</p>

										<p><p>I just tried reencoding my image to a jpg, and renaming it to &quot;startup<em>bg.jpg&quot;, modified my code and rebuilt and tested it in the simulator from Titanium Studio. The &quot;startup.png&quot; image is removed from my project, but when I open the xcodeproj file in Xcode and build the exact same error message occurs, which points to a compression error in &quot;</em>.startup.png&quot; .</p>

							<p>But there is no image named ._startup.png, The&quot;._startup.png&quot; is a string in a svn file, produced by Versions. My image is called &quot;startup.png&quot;, and I have tried replacing it.</p>

							<p>I &quot;solved&quot; the problem by deleting the png from the project, replacing it by a jpg. Then I committed that, cleaned out the project and made a test build, which worked. Then I added the png to the project again and committed that, cleaned the project and rebuilt. That seems to have worked, I don&#39;t really know what the problem with the mentioned SVN file might have been.</p>
