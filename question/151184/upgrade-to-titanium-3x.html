			<h1>Upgrade to Titanium 3.x</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all,  Our company has been using Titanium Studio to develop many iOS apps and Android apps using Titanium Studio 2.x (with SDK from 1.7.5 to 2.1.4).</p>
<p>Recently, Appcelerator has introduced 3.x Titanium Studio.  We found that after upgrading to 3.x, many of the old projects cannot be built.  We finally downgrade back to 2.x.</p>
<p>We know that there are many new features in 3.x and wish to use them. Is there any tools or ways to migrate from 2.x to 3.x?    Or should we just have 2 versions of Titanium Studio installed?</p>
<p>Thanks for all your reply in advance.<br>Ivan</p>

										<p><p>Most of the errors you are seeing are most likely due to changes in the SDK to accommodate new features, resolve old issues,  remove things no longer supported, plugging holes where some techniques that could be used should not have been for stability.</p>
