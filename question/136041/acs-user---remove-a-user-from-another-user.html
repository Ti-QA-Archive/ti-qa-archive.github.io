			<h1>Acs user - remove a user from another user</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Current the ACS documentation appears to require a user to be logged-in in order to remove the user from the app.  I want an administrative account that allows me to control my users including removing users access.  Is there any way to accomplish this.</p>
<p>It looks like most of the methods associated with a Users object are only performed on the current User.  Are there any operations that the owner of the app can perform to control the Users in the system.  In other words, I want to establish an Admin account that has full access over all objects in the app.  Is this at all possible.</p>

							<p>You could add a custom field in the user object called &quot;Banned&quot; with boolean data type.</p>
<p>When the app end user tries to log in then you could exclude him by not allowing him further access if the flag was true.</p>

										<p><p>I didn&#39;t think I could change values in a user object from another logged in account.  Can I do this by providing the userid to an update statement for the user object?  The documentation implies that the update statement only works against the current user.</p>

										<p><p>Great. Thanks a lot..  This was exactly what I was missing.  the Admin console addresses many of the issues that I was worried about building an app using the cloud.  Now if  I can only get it working in mobileweb.</p>

							<p>Since you cannot edit a end user from another user the &quot;banned&quot; does not work for me. (unless you can make calls as the app admin from your App. </p>
<p>My work around was to create a relationship table that relates the upper tier user with lower tier user (such as staff).  When the staff accepts an invitation they are tagged with and account ID and have access.  But the upper Tier user can edit the relations table and eliminate a staff member.   </p>
<p>There is an extra call involved to check if the staff still has access to the app, but it works until ACS gives us an option to make objects editable by other users. This is a major hurdle now if you are building an app that needs collaboration between different users that will interact with the same object. </p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
