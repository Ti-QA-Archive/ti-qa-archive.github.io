			<h1>Detect contacts who have installed a particular app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, I would like to know whether (and how) this is possible using Titanium.. If I can detect who all from my contacts have installed a particular application, similar to WhatsApp? That is through my contacts list I can check who all have WhatsApp on their mobile phones.</p>
<p>Application type: mobile, Titanium SDK: 3.0.0 GA, Platforms: iOS and Android</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Short answer - NO.</p>
<p>Whilst you may have a good reason for this, the bad people would have a field day with such open access to private information.  So I am thankful this is not available.  Apple would block your app for sure for something like this and even Google would now have to deal with this as it would be huge invasion of privacy.</p>
<p>BTW WhatsApp does not detect what apps you have and then shares that with others - it is a Real Time Messaging Service.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Malcolm, my question was a little vague. Firstly, I don&#39;t want to detect what all apps are installed on a user&#39;s mobile.  Currently I am developing an app, say &#39;XYZ &#39;which has many users. So when a user installs XYZ app, he should be able to see who all in his phone contacts have installed the this XYZ app too. </p>
<p>For example, when I install WhatsApp on my mobile, I get a small WhatsApp icon for the person who also uses WhatsApp.</p>
<p>Is this possible?<br>Thank you!</p>

										<p><p>Yes it is possible - but be cautious there have been recent high profile apps that have got this very wrong and paid a heavy pr penalty for it.</p>
<ul>
<li>You would need to gain the phone number of the user of THIS app</li>
<li>You need to access the contacts of the persons phone - which for iOS at least the user MUST give access to before you get access.</li>
<li>You would then pass those phone numbers to your server to process a cross reference list against which you match any currently known phone numbers</li>
<li>Those that match have the app</li>
</ul>
<p>Be aware this can and will be a real privacy nightmare and you will need to manage the rights of each nation the app is available in.  The UK and EU are particularly strict on such matters.</p>
<p>Make sure you app has a CLEAR privacy policy - stating EXACTLY what will be done with THEIR information and they have the right to not have their data touched.</p>
<p>If you do everything in the open you are more likely not to be sued in the future when an unfortunate data breach is made.  It happens, to big and small companies.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Malcolm, I wasn&#39;t really aware of such possible breaches. I will rather find out an alternative than get stuck in some legal lawsuit!<br>Thank you so much!</p>
