							<p>Hi Sam, one time i had problem with binary upload and turned out it&#39;s really the certificate issue. I built app using other developer account, and no matter what i did, it won&#39;t not pass the store. Of course, their error message is no better than Winblow BSD, it could be anything!!  </p>
<p>I was able to rebuild and submitted the app on that developer station and it passed on the first upload.  Later, i had his personal certificate exported and imported to my workstation and it&#39;s all good.</p>
<p>Hope that may relate to yours.  </p>
