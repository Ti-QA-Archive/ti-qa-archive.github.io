							<p>latest titanium studio using latest continuous master build (v1.8.0) of titanium mobile is even working with iOS5b2 here on osx lion 10.7 gm-build using Xcode 4.2 (needed for iOS5)</p>
<p>i had a crash on one of my apps i didn&#39;t update for one year now, so it could be because of bugs in the continuous builds. there is a xcode 4.1b7 for lion available from the mac developer-center at apples website, however i didn&#39;t test it, because of having installed iOS5 SDK</p>

							<p>10.7 is Lion right? Lion is not yet supported by Appcelerator because is not yet released. So it won&#39;t work.<br>You may try one of the latest builds but I don;t know if it will work.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for answering. I realize Lion isn&#39;t available for consumers, but it is available for developers. I <em>assume</em> that someone at Titanium is a registered developer. I also assume some people are trying to develop for Lion.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m sure they work on preparing the next version for Lion and when Lion will be up, they will make a release for Ti as well.<br>Maybe an Appcelerator guy will be able to give u a better answer, but this is what I know based on other posts&#x2F;tweets.</p>
