			<h1>Geolocation listeners (adding and removing) -- huge memory issues</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a serious memory issues in my app when I use geolocation (location and heading).</p>
<p>I organized my code that it has one window and add&#x2F;removes views in&#x2F;from it. One of that views needs both location and heading information. So I add</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(Ti.Geolocation.locationServicesEnabled) {
    Titanium.Geolocation.purpose = <span class="hljs-string">'Get Current Location'</span>;
    Titanium.Geolocation.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'location'</span>, locationCallback);
} <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
    alert(<span class="hljs-string">'Please enable location services'</span>);
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(Titanium.Geolocation.hasCompass) {
    Titanium.Geolocation.showCalibration = false;
    Titanium.Geolocation.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'heading'</span>, headingCallback);
} <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
    //notify user that he can<span class="hljs-string">'t run this app without compas and exit
}</span>
</code></pre><p>It is interactive app, and user needs to click on screen and get some data based on location and heading. That code is executed when I create that view that needs this info. </p>
<p>Before I change view to some another I remove this 2 listeners:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Titanium.Geolocation.removeEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'location'</span>, locationCallback);
Titanium.Geolocation.removeEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'heading'</span>, locationCallback);
</code></pre><p>I&#39;ve put <code>Ti.API.info()</code> at the beginning of each callback function to maker sure that listeners are removed and they are.</p>
<p>Now the problem comes when I again create that view that uses geolocation. On view creation I again add those 2 geolocation listeners and now my app is too slow. User inputs are handled after 10+ seconds etc.</p>
<p>I profiled my app with Instruments and when that &quot;geolocation view&quot; is active, memory is going crazy (<em>All Allocations gets bigger 3MB in 1 second). When I exit from that view to another that does&#39;t use geolocation, that </em>All Allocations counter comes back to normal. If I again go to &quot;geolocation view&quot; it starts to swallow memory again.</p>
<p>Strange thing is, when I first enter that &quot;geolocation view&quot; my finger touch are handled immediately, but as soon as I go to some another view and then come back to that view, it slows down.</p>
<p>What are yours suggestions on this one?</p>
<p>Tested on iPhone 4.<br>Titanium SDK 1.8.0.1.</p>

							<div><p>I suggest testing on 1.7.5 to determine whether this is a regression in 1.8.0.1.  If not, any chance you have an infinite loop?  What do your callback functions look like?</p>

							<div><p>Just tested it on 1.7.5 and the problem is still here. My callback functions update local variables (lat, lon, alt, x, y, z, heading) then call another <code>refreshData()</code> function. That one calls another js function that is inside web view (that web view is camera overlay). I call that function with <code>webView.evalJS(.....)</code>. I even put flags inside <code>refreshData()</code> so if I am currently inside, I just skip it. But it i snot helping.</p>

							<p>i believe this is not a framework issue but an application structure issue. can you provide additional information how your callback is structured.</p>
<p>Also it sounds like you are using multiple webviews? and you are firing events between the views?</p>
<p>The framework is not going to release the objects if it thinks something else is holding on to them… this is a common issue with callback that was discussed in a codestring presentation</p>

										<p><p>I hope that it is an application structure issue because I don&#39;t wanna go to Objective-C really.</p>
<p>I have only one WebView and I use it as camera overlay. That WebView is doing some painting based on geolocation info. I have a js function in that WebView&#39;s script. Every time my location or heading callbacks are triggered I call that WebView&#39;s function with new data using <code>webView.evalJS(lat,lon,...)</code></p>
<p>I also have a &#39;click&#39; listener on that WebView and here I call another js function in that WebView to calculate some stuff based on x and y of the click.</p>
<p>It is strange that on application start I open camera and everything works perfectly. Touch gestures are recognized and handled immediately but as soon as I go to another view and come back to camera with overlay things are slow. Or If I start application with another view and then navigate to camera with overlay, things are good and fast but as soon as I go to another view things just slows down. If I remove those geolocation listeners application is working smoothly. So I think the problem is in removing those geolocation listeners but based on their&#39;s callback <code>Ti.API.info()</code> I know that they are removed so I really don&#39;t see what else could cause such behavior. Do you have another ideas? And could you pass me the link to that presentation?</p>

										<p><p>I realized that HEADING listener is making problems. As I said I have local variables LAT, LON, ALT…. and in each callback (location and heading) I update those variables and call function <code>refreshData()</code> which does some things with those variables. If I remove from heading callback that statement which calls <code>refreshData()</code> then it is called only when location is changed and it works normally. Why is that so? I want to be able to call <code>refreshData()</code> after each one of them fired.</p>
