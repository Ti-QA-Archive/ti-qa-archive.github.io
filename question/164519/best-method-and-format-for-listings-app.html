			<h1>Best method and format for listings app</h1>

		<section>
			<p>I run a website which offers listings and reviews of theatre, etc. I&#39;m writing a mobile app version of this in Titanium, and would appreciate any advice the gurus on here can offer to save me having to trial and experiment too much.</p>
<p>Much of the content is going to be in a list view, and I don&#39;t want to stray to far from the native feel of the device it&#39;ll be running on. So the iOS6 app should look like iOS6, iOS7 like iOS7 and Android, well you get the idea. With this in mind, some questions spring to mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Will I need to sniff for these various platforms and provide different styling for each, or will Titanium give me the default OS UI if I&#39;m not doing any custom styling on them anyway?</li>
<li>For a leftimage, what&#39;s the optimum size I need to provide (and I assume I need to provide an @2x too at the same ratio)</li>
<li>There&#39;s a lot of listing data and thumbnail images, so I&#39;m wondering how best to get the data on the device and keep it updated. I can create a web service to squirt the data over in JSON, but should I package the app with any data preloaded? For images, I&#39;m wondering whether I should use an HTTP call back to the server (not my first preference), or squirt of the images so they&#39;re local? This would be the potentially big performance hit, since if there&#39;s two images for each show (list view thumbnail and detail page larger image - both with a @2x version), that feels like a lot of downloading before the user gets to the content. What&#39;s the best way to handle this?</li>
<li>If I&#39;m downloading new data to the device, is the Network.createHTTPClient method async? Or is there another &#x2F; better method?</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks in advance for any advice &#x2F; tips,</p>
<p>Pete</p>

							<p>Hello Pete, my 2 cents about data transfer and local persistence…</p>
<p>First of all I&#39;d really suggest you to take a close look at Alloy MVC, as it really helps to organize code, saving you from writing a lot of boilerplate.</p>
<p>Plus it would let you take advantage of custom sync adapters, like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;viezel&#x2F;napp.alloy.adapter.restsql">sqlrest</a>, to have a local db synced to a remote one through RESTful APIs , without the burden of coding each and all the needed httpRequests by hand, that -btw, yes- are async.</p>
<p>Alloy also offers data-binding with listViews, which could be quite useful for you needs. </p>
<p>About images, I usually implement a backend web admin, to allow resources management and file uploads, so the database just hold references to image urls, and the clients have to handle them by download and local caching. On iOS 7 I&#39;ve found the I dont need to take any action to cache them as the system itself is doing it under the hood. Not sure the same can be expected for iOS6, but I also remember being using a caching imageView module for that, also suitable for Android. </p>
<p>Hth. Regards and happy coding!</p>

							<p>Thanks Patrick,</p>
<p>Appreciate what you&#39;re saying about MVC, although that&#39;s one of the reasons I struggled with Objective-C. I even waded through the book Head First Design Patterns in an attempt to figure it out, but ultimately my (old) brain struggled with it. I understand the concept, but when learning by looking at sample code it&#39;s (for me at least) a real challenge. I have similar problems trying to figure out what other people&#39;s code in things like Joomla is up to since it follows the same MVC model. I know it&#39;s better practice to follow that model, I just think I&#39;m probably going to struggle with my first steps in Titanium and make the learning curve unnecessarily steep by throwing Alloy in straight away.</p>
<p>Local caching is intriguing though. If I keep the right-sized versions of the needed images on my server, will it also be able to handle the request for the @2x versions? That would at least mean I wasn&#39;t storing unnecessary images locally (and potentially slowing the update down considerably). A caching imageView module makes a lot of sense. I could potentially have 5,000 listings, but the user may only browse through a fraction of them, so pointless sending them all to the phone (in multiple resolutions) if they&#39;re not going to look at them. I guess I can at least have a default image which gets replaced by a downloaded one asynchronously? Is that a possibility?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Pete</p>

										<p><p>An opening note in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FokkeZB&#x2F;nl.fokkezb.cachedImageView">fokkezb.cachedImageView repository</a> says &quot;Titanium has built-in remote image caching for Android since 3.1 and for iOS since the early days&quot;, so good news for Android too!</p>
<p>Anyway you could be interested also in this <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Image_Best_Practices-section-30082525_ImageBestPractices">Image Best Practices</a>.</p>
<p>A possible implementation I see for iOS &#39;standard&#39; vs. @2x is having both versions available on server, but referenced in the db just with the &#39;standard&#39; name; then the client&#39;s code should check for the device running the app and consequently handle the image names to request, adding the @2x suffix when running on a retina display capable device. </p>
<p>Last notes on Alloy: no OOP knowledge is actually require to make use of alloy mvc (and rest assured no PHP is involved too! x-D)  just consider it as a clean and convenient way to lay out your code, at least to keep well separated the user interface layout, its styling, and the js code making things happens. So I suggested to give it a chance, the documentation guides are pretty good, the benefits greatly overcome the costs of understanding&#x2F;learning.. i.e. just think about future code maintenance .. but ok, I wont bother you with that anymore, I promise ;).</p>
<p>Regards,<br>P.</p>
