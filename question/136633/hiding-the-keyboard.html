			<h1>Hiding the Keyboard</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Yeah, I know, there are a ton of these questions around. I&#39;ve read them all. The thing is, <code>search.blur()</code> works great when it&#39;s included as part of the <code>return</code> event listener. Clears the keyboard, switches to the search window, and when I return no keyboard (yay). But…what about when I drop into the search bar <em>intending</em> to do a search, but then decide not to and want to click something else?</p>
<p>Is there a way to  get rid of the keyboard in some other way? Is there a standard&#x2F;best practice for when&#x2F;how to do this? Is it possible&#x2F;sufficient to just clear the key board on <code>window.click</code> or is there a more accepted solution?</p>
<p>Thanks for your input.</p>

							<p>Hi Rob,</p>
<p>You can hide keyboard from event like window click event or any other view event too.You can also set showCancel property of searchbar for more reference refere <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;1.8.0.1&#x2F;Titanium.UI.SearchBar-object">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;1.8.0.1&#x2F;Titanium.UI.SearchBar-object</a>.</p>

										<p><p>Hey, Nitin. Thanks for the response. My experience with the <code>showCancel</code> property has been that:</p>
<ol>
<li>It&#39;s hideously unattractive, and</li>
<li>It doesn&#39;t hide the keyboard</li>
</ol>
<p>It strikes me as very odd that the iPhone doesn&#39;t provide a way for the user to clear the keyboard at any time they want. It seems to rely on applications to take care of that. Am I missing something (Android user here and this is one of those things that Android does pretty well).</p>
<p>Sure, I could add <code>search.blur()</code> as an action in every single event that fires, but I guess I was hoping that there was a cleaner, more &quot;universal&quot; solution to making it go away when it had either served its purpose or the user had decided that it had no purpose for the moment.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>
