			<h1>Does the latest version of Titanium continue to have problems like memory leaks</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have recently started working on Titanium. I have also been trying to look other tools and choose the best tool to develop cross-platform apps. I landed up at this post,<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;savagelook.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;portfolio&#x2F;a-deeper-look-at-appcelerator-and-phonegap">A Deeper Look at Appcelerator and PhoneGap</a>, This post leaves a lot of choice to the user, but it was one of the comments that got me really concerned about Titanium. The one from &#39;miele&#39; at June 16, 2011 at 7:10 am (you&#39;ll need to scroll down). He faces several issues with memory leaks and the bugs on Ti. What is most disturbing is the memory leaks part, I want to know if the Ti team has already handled this? If not, do we have any work arounds for this?<br>(Disclosure: My question is purely based on someone else&#39;s opinion, please correct me wherever required)</p>

							<p>What he said about memory leaks is all true. Titanium continues to have serious issues with memory leaks. Unfortunately, there is no easy solution for these, and it doesn&#39;t look like they are getting fixed any time soon. Any substantially large application in Titanium is at risk of becoming unusable through these leaks. Overall, it all comes down to what you want your app to do. If it is small enough, then Titanium may be a good solution for you.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that an app developed in the device&#39;s native code will almost always perform better. The only real advantage to using Titanium is saving time. But even then you may have to backtrack and redo the app in native code if it becomes too complex.</p>
<p>Weigh your options carefully…</p>

							<p>I don&#39;t agree with what miele said in that comment.</p>
<p>Titanium let you code in a matter of hours things that in xcode would take you days. If you&#39;re looking for some advanced features you should use xcode.<br>What kind of app do you need to do? I&#39;m sure that with all of the pros and cons Titanium stands for cross-platform and fast-development.</p>
<p>The memory leak issues are addressed in pretty much every release.<br>For example, one of the things I noticed in the 1.7 alone, is that ScrollableViews have been optimized. In 1.6.2 after loading 4 or 5 images in a ScrollableView the app would&#39;ve crashed, now it doesn&#39;t give any problem.</p>

										<p><p>(I am sorry for the delayed reply)</p>
<p>Currently I am just doing some test apps, we might have something released soon. But, Titanium still looks risky to me. It seems to be a case of never being confident about the Titanium app&#39;s memory usage, isn&#39;t there a way to ensure that there would be no memory leaks? The applications reliability is at stake.</p>
