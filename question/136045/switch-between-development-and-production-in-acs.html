			<p>I have noticed that there are two different databases for each applications cloud; Development and Production. Is there a way to switch which one you app is accessing? I am speaking for Titanium Integrated cloud apps.  Thanks in advance.</p>

							<p>My experience is that by default, apps running on simulator or built directly to a device are going to point to the development ACS app, and ad hocs and production builds will use the production app.  This caught me a bit by surprise, as I had thought that an ad hoc build would still point to development.</p>
<p>To force your environment to use one ACS app or the other, just open tiapp.xml and copy the 3 acs keys from development to production, or vice versa.  Might also want to make a copy of the old keys to easily switch back :)</p>

										<p><p>So:<br>development key for: simulator, test devices<br>production key for: ad hoc, distribution<br>is that automatically switched when making a build or we need to add or remove something? It is quite important especially when submitting the app to app store. Need to be clarified.</p>

										<p><p>Could someone address this question. I am struggling with finding a right answer for this. When autenticating a ACS user to next get a device token, which user account (Dev or Production) should one use?</p>

										<p><p>Yes some explanation on the same would be great. It is confusing as to when exactly the production or the development phase is used.</p>

							<p>Same happened to me. When I specified the prod app id in my php code to send the push notifications then it just stopped working. Then I have to change the dev app id.</p>
