			<h1>Apparently Random Force Close Crashes on Android</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi there, we are facing severe issues with apparently random force close errors in Android. There&#39;s one App which is quite large, so we thought it could be a memory issue, but then on a different App which is really lightweight, 4 screens and one barcode scanner, the same appears as well.</p>
<p>We cannot reproduce the bugs accurately, they happen sometimes and sometimes they don&#39;t. </p>
<p>We&#39;ve gone through every single currently open bug in Jira, but none sounded like it&#39;s applicable &#x2F; related. We also went through every single post in the Forum as well, but without clear answer. </p>
<p>The closest we came to was this post http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;120771&#x2F;ddms-error-called-layout-cleanup</p>
<p>We&#39;re basically sometimes getting the LayoutCleanup error in the log, but it doesn&#39;t say where or which line of code or what is actually the problem.</p>
<p>Chances are we have done something wrong or didn&#39;t interpret the log output correctly, so my question is:</p>
<p>How can we effectively debug Force Close crashes on Android, and what &#39;tool&#39; gives us information where to home in on the issue? Sorry if this is a bit unstructured, if there was some sort of chatroom or so we could give more info.</p>

							<p>Typically viewing the logcat logs in ddms around a &#39;force close&#39; will give you a pretty descriptive stack trace describing your errors. You can usually start to track down your issues based on this Java stack trace. Often times the content will point to a class that maps to a Titanium API, making it more clear what is going on.</p>
