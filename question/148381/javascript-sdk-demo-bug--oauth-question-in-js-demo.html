			<h1>Javascript SDK Demo bug &amp; OAuth question in JS Demo</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I just got the Javascript SDK Demo up and running locally.<br>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cocoafish&#x2F;cocoafish-javascript-sdk-demo</p>
<p>I ran into a few problems. First, in trying to log in with OAuth via sdk.useThreeLegged(true); I was getting an error - &quot;Log-in on API server not allowed for this app.&quot;</p>
<p>I was using the OAuth Key and had User Authentication Scheme set to &quot;Authorization Server&quot;.</p>
<p>By switching back to my App Key and using the API Server and commenting out the sdk.useThreeLegged(true); I was able to log in successfully with a User I had created.</p>
<p>I&#39;d like to get this Demo working properly with OAuth. Am I missing something obvious in getting useThreeLegged to work properly in this demo?</p>
<p>Second, in the Places.html (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cocoafish&#x2F;cocoafish-javascript-sdk-demo&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;places.html) on line 18 it&#39;s referencing a local copy of cocoafish-1.2.js which does not exist in the js folder. No big deal, you can uncomment line 16 and pull the web version to get things working properly but it&#39;s always frustrating when you have to debug code demos to get them up and running.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The code you refer to is not actually for Titanium, it is a Javascript jQuery solution.  Are you using it in Titanium or in a web browser?</p>
<p>If you are using it in a Titanium App you may well be running into issues that are neither directly the fault of Titanium or the fault of the Cocoafish library.</p>
<p>You may be better served by using the module that <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;devlink&#x2F;profile&#x2F;828471&#x2F;aaron-saunders">Aaron Saunders</a> has created;</p>

										<p><p>You are going to need to explain how you are trying to use ACS as the storage without actually using Titanium and then using the Cocaofish in a web browser again not connected to Titanium.</p>

										<p><p>Pretty much exactly how the JS SDK Demo at the Github link in my original question is being used.</p>
<p>The easiest thing to do would be to download that Demo and try to get the OAuth Authentication working. That will hopefully replicate the problem I&#39;m experiencing with the &quot;Log-in on API server not allowed for this app.&quot; message.</p>

										<p><p>As I said, if you are using that code then I cannot see what it has to do with ACS as it does not reference if at all.  So if you are running it in a web browser away from the anything to do with Titanium then I am not sure what Titanium has to do with this attempt with Cocoafish.  Which is why I suggested using the link I provided above.</p>

										<p><p>Some context of where I got that GitHub link, hopefully this will clear things up a bit:<br> <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.appcelerator.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;javascript#sample">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.appcelerator.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;javascript#sample</a></p>
<p>The authentication is done against an ACS Users object.</p>

							<p>Hi Malcolm. I&#39;m using it in a web browser.</p>
<p>The context being I am just using the ACS product for data storage and not using Titanium for builds.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve got the API login working, but I&#39;m really interested in the OAuth solution. </p>
<p>It seems that the demo example either has a minor bug or my account settings aren&#39;t correct for allowing OAuth login.</p>

										<p><p>Quick tip; please comment on the related answer or the actual question if there is no answer - rather than creating a whole new answer which is really a comment - it makes it harder in the future to work out threads if any answers score change or other answers are added. (You are not being told off)</p>
