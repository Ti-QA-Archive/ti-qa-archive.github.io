			<h1>SQLite Performance: To close, or not to close ?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m still new to Titanium, but before I start working with more advanced queries, I&#39;d like to know how to factor the code. </p>
<p>I have a database with 200-300 records in one table, each record is supposed to be joined (on occasion) with one or all of the other 3 tables (which just contain location names and corresponding ID&#39;s, each record may have more than one location, for example a record may contain multiple cities that it is close to and have multiple tags associated with it).</p>
<p>On loading the application, I download and store the data in SQLite, now - do I keep the SQLite connection open all the time, or do I fetch the data, store it in some object that I will manipulate to get the results I want for each window ? </p>
<p>The application is completely data-driven. I don&#39;t have a single static page (currently, I&#39;ll have a settings tab later).</p>
<p>So - how does SQLite perform in general, and on mobile devices ? Which is the least expensive way to operate ?</p>

							<p>The general rule of thumb is to close your SQLite connection after every query. Storing the retrieved data in an object.</p>
<p>Memory woes an other issues can potentially infest your app otherwise.</p>

										<p><p>Best practice is to open and close the database for each function. That function could involve grabing one record or one hundred.</p>
<p>It&#39;s more about closing the database once you are done with that particular operation. In order to ensure the database does not remain open to cause issues with memory, or errors if you try to run another query against a table that is already locked, due to it being open.</p>

							<p>The basic problem is  some db.execute operations are failing with a &quot;table locked&quot; condition this is because your database is already opened before in past. And if your database is already opened before then you may face such type of problem and your app goes to crash …<br>So good habit is to always close database after retrieving or inserting records. There is no difference performance wise. Vote if you like solution.</p>

										<p><p>What about when inserting the first 200 records. They are inserted with a loop on an already open database, should I open the db every time I execute a command and close it right after, or close after the loop ?</p>

							<p>If you try to execute insert query simultaneously in loop  then you will not face any problem  and you need not have to close db….When you want to perform insertion and retrieval of record through frequently through  select query at that time you need to open and close database.</p>
