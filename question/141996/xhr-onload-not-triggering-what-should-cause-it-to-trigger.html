			<h1>XHR onload not triggering, what should cause it to trigger?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am using XHR POST to upload an image to my server, on the server side there is some PHP code that takes the image and saves it in a folder, then returns some HTML once its done.</p>
<p>The image is being uploaded ok but the XHR onload event is never triggered leaving the app thinking its still waiting for the image to finish uploading and it gets stuck.</p>
<p>Any ideas &#x2F; theories as to why (without posting all the code for both the app and the server side code as to what is the possible cause of the onload event not being triggered? What causes the onload to trigger and why might it be failing?</p>
<p>(All other form data is also posted correctly, it all appears to work perfectly…except onload is never triggered)</p>
<p>I even tried using the Snapost code from K.Whinnery and changed the form data being sent and the URL of the place it was posting to, that also sticks, so I don&#39;t think its my app code, its something the remote end is failing to do or something I have not programmed it to do but unless I know what, I am never going to be able to fix it.</p>

							<p>Might be the HTTP status code or returned data of the page you are posting to is causing the onload not to fire.</p>
<p>Try to log this.readyState in the onreadystatechange method and see if it returns Titanium.Network.HTTPClient.DONE (4). This would be equal to onload.</p>

							<p><code>onload</code> is triggered by the server sending the response.</p>
<p>If you&#39;ve already tried other URLs and data, it doesn&#39;t sound like there&#39;s a problem with your PHP code.  Maybe there&#39;s an issue with the way you&#39;re setting up your HTTPClient().</p>
<p>You need to define your <code>onload</code> callback before you open the connection.  A simple example:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    var xhr = Ti.Network.createHTTPClient();
    xhr.onload = function (e) {
      Ti.API.info (this.responseText);
    }
    xhr.open (<span class="hljs-string">"<span class="hljs-keyword">GET</span>"</span>, url);
        xhr.send ();
</code></pre><p>Maybe you could post a snippet of your network code.  Can you create a minimal example that replicates the problem (in a short app.js file)?</p>

										<p><p>You dont have to define it first, I have plenty of sections where it comes after the send.  Its just a function, doesnt really matter, does it?</p>

										<p><p>Yes, it&#39;s just a function.  But the HTTPClient works asynchronously.  If you define it after the <code>send()</code> call, there is some risk (no matter how small) that the response will come back before the line that sets your <code>onload</code> callback is executed.  If that happens, your onload callback will never get fired.  Why tempt fate?</p>
