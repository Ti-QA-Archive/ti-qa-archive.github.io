			<h1>zIndex property not working with Window objects?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been working on an app that will have a large number of content screens, and so am looking for a way to manage them efficiently.</p>
<p>I&#39;d like to have each content screen in a separate file, loaded in to a Window via the url property.  Then, display each as needed, removing the ones that are no longer in view.</p>
<p>However, I&#39;m noticing a couple things, and would really appreciate some help confirming that I&#39;m not missing anything.</p>
<p>First, it seems to me that the zIndex property is ignored when used with a window.  I&#39;ve tried setting the property in a number of ways (including using animate() to set it as recommended by another forum user), but the only thing that holds true is that the most recently opened window is on top.</p>
<p>Second, it seems that nesting windows doesn&#39;t work as I&#39;d expect either.  For example, if I open a window with a left:300 property, then open a window from that window with a left:0 property, I would expect it to still be 300 left as per it&#39;s parent, but… it shows up at 0, 300 pixels left of it&#39;s parent.  This is not how a View would behave.</p>
<p>So, long note I know. But if anyone could confirm that my assumptions are correct, or (hopefully!) prove me wrong with a way to use zIndex or nested windows.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s my example code: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;864415">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;864415</a></p>
<p>Thanks a ton everyone.</p>

							<p>What I&#39;ve found out about this is that zIndex has no effect on windows.  They will show according to the sequence in which they were opened, most recent on top.</p>

							<p>You can&#39;t stack windows by using the zIndex. What you can do is open the windows in the order you need them (last opened will be on top) and play with visible: true&#x2F;false</p>

										<p><p>Hi Roman, you just need to open your windows in the order of how you want them arranged.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> win1</span> = ...;
<span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> win2</span> = ...;
<span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> win3</span> = ...;
win1.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>();
win2.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>();
win3.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>();
</code></pre><p>The above would result in like win1 in the way back, win2 in the middle, and win3 would be on top.</p>
