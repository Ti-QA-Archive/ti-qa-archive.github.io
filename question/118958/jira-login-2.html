			<p>Answer to Paul Dowsets question: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;118924&#x2F;jira-login</p>
<p>No, I that doesn&#39;t work, if I enter my email there, I just get an message that the username doesn&#39;t exists. Entering my old username (mofle) works, and it says I will get an email with a link, but that never arrives.</p>
<p>(btw, why is a question closed when I mark an answer as accepted? This seems strange, since someone might have an better answer later or just some input.)</p>

										<p><p>Sindre, please don&#39;t answer your own posts, as you won&#39;t be able to close the thread when the issue has been resolved. Also, it makes the discussion difficult for others to follow.  Thanks</p>

<p>As you closed the last thread, I presumed you had worked-around the issue. I will, again, bring yours and Mario&#39;s problem to the attention of those responsible, and will then let you know how it can be resolved.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
