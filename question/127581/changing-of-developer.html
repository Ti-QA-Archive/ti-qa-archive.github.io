			<p>Hi,<br>I have following problem with ITC. </p>
<p>I&#39;am a freelancer and have developped  an iPhoneApp for a company. In the first version the name of developer is the company and I am a part of the team. The app is uploaded with the itc.account of the company.<br>I have an own certificat and an itunesconnect account.  </p>
<p>In the next version we want to change the name of developer (to me). Is there a posibility?</p>
<p>Best regards</p>

							<p>AFAIK, you should upload as a new app with a different App ID from your account. I think is not possible to change the account name.</p>
<p>But I don&#39;t know if Apple would publish it if is exactly the same app, you will probably have to, first, remove the actual app, upload yours and, maybe, contact them explaining the situation, but this is only a conjecture.</p>

										<p><p>Here the FAQ:<br>Frequently Asked Questions:<br>I sold my app to another developer and can no longer distribute on the App Store. Can I transfer the app to the new developer&#39;s iTunes Connect account?<br>At this time, apps cannot be transferred to another developer account. If you would like the app to be sold through another developer account, you will need to remove the app from sale in the current iTunes Connect account and upload the app under the new iTunes Connect account. </p>
<p>Uploading the app to a new iTunes Connect account will disable current customers from receiving automatic and free updates of your application. All customer reviews, rating and ranking information will also be reset.</p>
