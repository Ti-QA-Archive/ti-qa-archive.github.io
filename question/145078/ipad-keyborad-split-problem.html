							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Currently there is no event that will respond when the iPad keyboard splits, however that may change in the future though.</p>
<p>When the keyboard splits the toolbar falls to the bottom of the screen leaving the keyboard to move up and down freely - this is by design as taking away a toolbar because someone has split the keyboard would mean they cannot now use whatever options the toolbar provided.</p>
<p>There is one POSSIBLE way to detect it but I have not had time to check.  This would require creating your toolBar as an actual toolbar and adding that to the textField or textArea, then adding an event to that toolBar to listen for &#39;postlayout&#39;.  It is possible that this event <em>could</em> fire when the keyboard splits as there MAY be some re-drawing that could cause this event to fire.  Worth you checking it out.</p>
<p>But as I say no specific event.</p>

										<p><p>I have just tested my thought about <strong>postlayout</strong> but it is only fired once, rather than the hope it was fired each time the toolbar detaches from the keyboard when the keyboard splits.</p>

										<p><p>that&#39;s not good =&#x2F;<br>the problem is that sometimes on blur the toolbar still on screen stucked =&#x2F;<br>or sometimes on focus it does not show</p>

										<p><p>I have found that creating an actual toolBar and adding that as the toolbar to the textField tends to work out better than simply adding buttons to the property as as array elements.</p>
<p>Try something like this;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var toolbar = Ti.UI.iOS.createToolbar({
    items: [
        btnOne,
        flexSpace,
        btnTwo
    ]
});

textArea = Ti.UI.createTextArea({
    <span class="hljs-built_in">color</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'#000'</span>,
    font: {
        fontSize: <span class="hljs-number">16</span>
    },
    <span class="hljs-variable">height</span>: <span class="hljs-number">225</span>,
    hintText: <span class="hljs-string">'Enter content here'</span>,
    keyboardToolbar: toolbar,
    left: <span class="hljs-number">5</span>,
    right: <span class="hljs-number">5</span>,
    suppressReturn: <span class="hljs-keyword">false</span>,
    top: <span class="hljs-number">5</span>,
    <span class="hljs-variable">width</span>: Ti.UI.FILL
});
</code></pre><p>Using the toolbar this way means you can can use it on more than textfield &#x2F; textarea simply simply referencing it multiple times and swapping focus between them means the toolbar does not do that weird bounce thing.  Also I have not yet had a redraw or sticking issue.</p>
<p>Hopefully this answers it for you.</p>
