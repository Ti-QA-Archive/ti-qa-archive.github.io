			<h1>Airplay button ?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello, </p>
<p>I was looking at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;144330&#x2F;airplay-support-module">this post</a> and was wondering if a solution for create a iTunes-like Airplay button to put in an app existed ?</p>
<p>There&#39;s nothing about this on search results… Or maybe i&#39;m not searching with good keywords ?</p>

							<div><p>Way too little information given here.  What are you hoping to achieve;</p>
<ul>
<li>to simply play audio or video using AirPlay<br>or</li>
<li>create a &quot;second screen&quot; that is NOT simply a mirror.</li>
</ul>
<p>Someone else marked down this question because of such a general question, help yourself out and provide much more detail.  The people helping here are not mind readers (yet - there are plans).</p>

							<div><p>Sorry, I was just looking for a general answer about docs or explanations about how to use Airplay because the only thing i&#39;ve found about this is in the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;1.8.2&#x2F;Titanium.Media.VideoPlayer-object">VideoPlayer doc</a>.</p>
<p>I just want to put a button on my app for make the user able to listen an audio stream on his smartphone or with AirPlay, so i guess that is what you named a mirror.</p>
<p>This was just a question about where to find more informations, not really a problem, sorry about that.</p>

							<p>Not a problem.</p>
<p>The AirPlay features for video and Audio are built into their respective players.  So if you are using one and you have AirPlay support and it is working then the buttons should automatically appear.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are creating your own players then you will need to use a third-party module to achieve your goals.</li>
<li>If you want to use AirPlay as a &quot;second screen&quot; then you can but again with a third-party module.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;783?994728559#overview">TV Out Module</a> will solve the third-party needs.  I have used in a couple of apps and works reasonably well.  Requires the AirPlay mirroring option to be enabled by the user - but that is a requirement for all apps of any type to utilise it beyond the standard streaming.</p>
<p>I hope this gives you enough info.</p>
