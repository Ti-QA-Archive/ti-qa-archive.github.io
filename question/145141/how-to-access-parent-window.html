			<h1>how to access parent window</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am using latest SDKs (titanium, iOS).</p>
<p>In my app I am creating a TabGroup and adding ONLY one TAB and on this tab I am opening a window:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> myTabGroup = Titanium.UI.createTabGroup();

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> winMain = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
    articleID:<span class="hljs-string">"home"</span>,
    title:<span class="hljs-string">'myAPP'</span>,
    url:<span class="hljs-string">'/src/myMain/main.js'</span>,
    showAbout:<span class="hljs-keyword">true</span>,
    tabBarHidden:<span class="hljs-keyword">true</span>
})

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> myTab1 = Titanium.UI.createTab({
    icon:<span class="hljs-string">'KS_nav_ui.png'</span>,
    title:<span class="hljs-string">'Start'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-built_in">window</span>:winMain
});

myTabGroup.addTab(myTab1);
</code></pre><p>Now, on this window i am creating other windows (based on what the user choses) this way:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> w</span> = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
    articleID:id,
    url:<span class="hljs-string">"/src/myOther/"</span>+other,
    tabBarHidden:<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
})            

Titanium.API.currentTabGroup.getActiveTab().<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>(w,{animated:<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>});
</code></pre><p>The problem is, that being on my new window i want to get my &quot;parent&quot; window&#39;s title, store it in a temporary var and change the &quot;parent&quot; window&#39;s title, without having to pass it on when I am creating the window.</p>
<p>I tried Titanium.UI.currentWindow.backButtonTitle just for storing it in a var but since I did not set it (it is set automatically through creating a new window) it is undefined.</p>
<p>To be more clear in what would help, if there was a handler Titanium.UI.<strong>parent</strong>Window (I know there is not) I would solve my problem, so I am searching a workaround for this.</p>
<p>P.S. I tried closing the window, getting the title of the &quot;parent&quot; window in a var and reopening the window but when I alert it, it alerts the &quot;child&quot; window&#39;s title:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Titanium.UI.currentWindow.close();

<span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> tempTitle</span>=Titanium.UI.currentWindow.title;
<span class="hljs-comment">//create window named w</span>
Titanium.API.currentTabGroup.getActiveTab().<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>(w,{animated:<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>});
alert(tempTitle);
</code></pre>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>ONE technique would be to use properties.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"> Ti.App.Properties.setString('a caption you <span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">use</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">reference</span> this <span class="hljs-keyword">value</span><span class="hljs-string">', strTitle);
// then
var strTitle = Ti.App.Properties.getString('</span>a caption you <span class="hljs-keyword">use</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">reference</span> this <span class="hljs-keyword">value</span><span class="hljs-string">', strTitle);</span></span>
</code></pre><ul>
<li><p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.1&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.App.Properties-method-setString">setString</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.1&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.App.Properties-method-getString">getString</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This will allow you to keep the title without having to pass it around, if you have done web sites before think &#39;cookie&#39; as the closest example but it remains until you delete it, update it or the app is removed from the device.</p>
<p>Quick Tip:</p>
<p>This use of the <em>URL</em> property is now considered an out of date way of handling multiple windows due to the extra contexts created for each use of the URL method.  CommonJS and Alloy being the preferred solutions these days.  It will be worth your time investigating these as they will provide the ability to create cleaner, faster apps with more re-usable components and hopefully less errors.  They will however not solve crime, heal the sick or bring you untold wealth.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your quick reply Malcolm.</p>
<p>Your suggestions sounds good when it comes for one &quot;cookie&quot; but I want to access this for every subwindow and subwindow&#39;s subwindow and so on. Also, it takes the same time as passing the name on to the &quot;child&quot; window and accessing it like this: <code>win.passedTitle</code></p>
<p>My biggest question (since you also know of no handler in the API to handle parent windows) is WHY after I close the &quot;child&quot; window and I use:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> tempTitle</span>=Titanium.UI.currentWindow.title;
</code></pre><p>it still doesn&#39;t save the right value and it saves the &quot;parent&#39;s&quot; title??</p>

										<p><p>Add an extra property to your window create, something like; <strong>idx</strong> and set a number that you retrieve from a counter stored in properties.</p>
<p>Each time you create anew window increment the number.  Then store the title using the number as a look up.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var idx = Ti.App.<span class="hljs-keyword">Properties</span>.getInt(<span class="hljs-string">'titleindex'</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>);
Ti.App.<span class="hljs-keyword">Properties</span>.setString(<span class="hljs-string">'windowTitle'</span> + idx, strTitle);
</code></pre><p>This way you can save one title per window and then reference back the idx property from the window when using the getString.</p>
<p>Having said all that I am still trying to work out why you are trying to achieve this.</p>
<p>Could you please post back WHY you need this and there may be a better way of handling whatever it is you are really trying to achieve.  As so far I am not sure why you need to change the title of the previous window once you have moved to the new window.  Unless you think this is how the back button gets it title?</p>
<p>Please explain.</p>
<p>BTW I am suspicious about your questions (and many of your answers) receiving such a high percentage of +1 when statistically the number should be no where near the current reality.  I do hope someone is auto upping your questions.  I hope this is merely a very strange coincidence.</p>

										<p><p>QUOTE: &quot;Unless you think this is how the back button gets it title?&quot;</p>
<p>That is exactly what I figured out. It does take the title of the previous window and uses it as the back button title. (I am not even adding a back button).</p>
<p>So I am trying to make a refresh method, and to do this I am closing the window and creating it again using the same parameters. The problem is, that it takes the child window&#39;s title as a back button title although I  did all the things I told you before. (AND I don&#39;t want to send it through parameters).</p>
<p>As for your BTW paragraph, I don&#39;t actually get it. First of all, I can&#39;t add +1 to MY posts and NO, I haven&#39;t programmed a bot doing such thing if this is that you suppose.</p>

										<p><p>So your question relates to a REFRESH method and nothing to do with the window.</p>
<p>Unless your code is so mental there is rarely a need to recreate an entire window to refresh the contents.</p>
<p>What are you refreshing?  A tableView, scrollView, labels?</p>
<p>I will assume for the moment that you have some contents on the window and then a user (or timed event) requires that the contents be changed to updated values - is this close?</p>
<p>If so then add all of your views to the window but do not set any values.  Add a function called <strong>refresh</strong> (suggestion) and inside it place any code that updates the display after obtaining the new values from wherever you are getting them.</p>
<p>Then at the bottom of the window called that function.  If the user is in control of the refresh add a call to the refresh function on a button or whatever they use to interact, if it is on a timer or event call the refresh function there.</p>
<p>As I say there should be no need in almost all circumstances to have to reload everything, simply separate the presentation from the logic.  Becomes much easier using CommonJS and especially Alloy as these are designed to help separate your code into layers, including presentation, logic, data and more.</p>

										<p><p>Actually i need to refresh everything in this page, that is why I have to recreate it. I would switch to the Alloy way you are suggesting but then I would have to rewrite my whole code that took me almost a month to do, and actually there is no need to do it since everything I need to do works fine but this. If there is no other way to do it, I will send it as a parameter, but I would prefer to find a way to handle my parent window (there is a need in many other occasions on other applications to do something like this also so it is good to find a way to to it).</p>
<p>And my question IS specific. I wouldn&#39;t have to say anything about REFRESH if there was a way to do handle that parent window. So forget about refreshing. I just want to know if there is a way to get that title or no? (and as I can tell by now, NO seems to be the answer).</p>
<p>Thanks for your time though Malcolm.</p>

										<p><p>You misunderstood me, I am suggesting Alloy and CommonJS are the direction to move towards - I am NOT suggesting you re-write this app, that would be plainly stupid.</p>
<p>I was trying to help you work out a better way to resolve the problem rather than than recreating the window you are on - which is not good practice.</p>
<p>In short there is no simple way to obtain the title in the way you want.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the suggestions Malcolm. In fact, I am using MVC also, it&#39;s just that mine is a custom one. As far as I can see from a quick look, alloy does provide MVC as well.</p>
<p>The refresh function you suggested before, this is exactly what i am doing, but in my case i have to refresh <strong>everything</strong> so I recreate the window (since even the background, the fonts, the layout, everything.. needs refreshing). So even by using the way that came first to both of our minds (this refresh method) I cant set the back button (In your case it would work, because you do not recreate the window, you just refresh the data, but in my case it won&#39;t work, because I <strong>HAVE TO</strong> recreate the window).</p>
<p>So, I will have to pass the name as a parameter.</p>
