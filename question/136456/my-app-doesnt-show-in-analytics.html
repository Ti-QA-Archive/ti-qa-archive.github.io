			<h1>My App doesn&#39;t show in Analytics</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have created an app and released it to the App Store and Google Pay Store about 2 weeks ago. In the app I use analytics events but the app never shown up on My Apps page. I can see several &quot;HelloWorld&quot; apps on My Apps page that I&#39;ve created (and never released) but I can&#39;t see mine. In last version I released I activated Cloud Services but still nothing…</p>
<p>Is there anyway to fix this? Will creating a new project in Titanium and using the guid from it on my app work?!</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

							<p>So I&#39;ve created a new project in Titanium and used the generated GUID on my project. Now it shows and says &quot;117 analytics events were processed for this application since May 1, 2012&quot;</p>
<p>The only problem is that it still shows 0 users, 0 sessions and &quot;There were no events logged during between 4&#x2F;10 and 5&#x2F;9.&quot; Is this &quot;normal&quot;?</p>

										<p><p>Finally some events started showing. I think the issue was that my app was released using a nightly build instead of an official one. I&#39;ve been seeing updates since I released the latest one using an official build.</p>

										<p><p>Dario, keep in mind the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;plans-pricing">costs associated with Analytics</a> after June 1st. Each app gets 50,000 free analytics data points…</p>
