			<h1>Generating GUI using HTTPClient</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;m making an app which uses external layout, to generate some controls. So far i&#39;ve used the &quot;synchronous&quot; xhr (the while loop), and it worked great. However, now i&#39;m trying to do it the way it&#39;s meant to be, using asynchronous xhr to read the layout file and generate a new view containing all the controls.<br>Needles to say, i&#39;m stuck, because the function that is supposed to return filled view, is returning empty view instead.</p>
<p>I have this xhr object:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> HTTPClient = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(url, handlefunction)</span> </span>{

        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> xhr = Ti.Network.createHTTPClient();

        xhr.onload = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{

            <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (xhr.status == <span class="hljs-number">200</span>) {
                <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> response = <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.responseText;
                handlefunction(response);
            }

        };

        serverAddress = <span class="hljs-string">'10.0.2.2/test/'</span>;

        xhr.open(<span class="hljs-string">"GET"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"http://"</span> + serverAddress + url);
        xhr.send();

    }
</code></pre><p><code>handlefunction</code> generates controls from the <code>response</code>, adding them to the pre-created view.</p>
<p>Function in which i call the HTTPClient and which returns (or rather, should) the filled view is bellow:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.getGeneratedView = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">l</span>) </span>{

        HTTPClient(l, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">e</span>)</span>{
                    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> jsonString = <span class="hljs-built_in">JSON</span>.parse(e);
                    generateView(jsonString);

        });

        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> win;
    };
</code></pre><p>Calling the <code>getGeneratedView</code> from outside of the module, yields empty view.</p>
<p>So, any suggestions or should i go back to the synchronous xhr hack?</p>

							<p>You most definitely should <em>not</em> go to a while loop.  I don&#39;t want anybody reading this to even think that there is such a thing as synchronous network requests in Ti Mobile.  To be clear, there is no accepted &quot;hack&quot; to turn async responses into synchronous responses.  I&#39;m not sure where you found the example you worked from, but it was bad advice.  You don&#39;t want to chew up your processor and lock up the main thread of your app in a while loop.</p>
<p>At any rate, have you put a breakpoint in your callback function?  </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">        HTTPClient<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">l</span>, function<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">e</span>)</span>{
                    var jsonString = JSON.parse<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">e</span>)</span><span class="hljs-comment">;    // set breakpoint here</span>
                    generateView<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">jsonString</span>)</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

        })</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>Does the breakpoint get reached?  Have you inspected the value of <code>e</code>?  What does it hold?  These are all important steps in tracking down this problem (or any problem in Titanium, for that matter).</p>
<p>(minor point – calling your variable <code>e</code> is confusing to the reader.  De facto coding standards would reserve the use of <code>e</code> as a parameter for actual events.  You&#39;re passing the <code>responseText</code> property of the event to this function)</p>

										<p><p>Putting a breakpoint to that line does nothing. The instruction pointer skips that entire line (HTTPClient) and stops at a line bellow (<code>return win;</code>).</p>
<p>I&#39;m still at the &quot;put it there for the sake of it&quot; stage when it comes to naming conventions, so don&#39;t mind the &quot;e&quot; one :)</p>

										<p><p>The debugger is stopping there because <code>win</code> is not defined.  If the debugger stops anywhere besides your breakpoints, it&#39;s because there&#39;s an error on that line, and it&#39;s about to crash your app (or do something less obvious, but still just as undesirable).</p>

										<p><p>win is defined, i just didn&#39;t include it in the code above (didn&#39;t think it was important). That still doesn&#39;t explain the fact that the line at which breakpoint is set, is skipped.<br>The thing is, i need things executed in the order i put them in the code. So, i need win to be returned only AFTER http is done with it&#39;s thing.</p>
<p>My question is pretty simple, how can i make sure that UI thread is &quot;blocked&quot; while the xhr is doing it&#39;s job thus preventing return of empty view (win)?</p>

										<p><p>You&#39;re missing the point.  Network requests are asynchronous.  You can&#39;t block until it comes back.</p>
<p>Now I understand what you&#39;re trying to do (although in light of the fact that you are saying you&#39;re trying to move from your synchronous hack to a true async mechanism, I don&#39;t understand why you&#39;re still talking about synchronous requests).</p>
<p>You can&#39;t build a function like the one you&#39;re trying to build: <code>getGeneratedView()</code>.  In other words, you can&#39;t build a function that makes a network request, gets the response, builds something, and then returns it.  It just doesn&#39;t work that way.</p>
<p>You can still have your callback function build the user interface, but in terms of compute cycles, the <code>getGeneratedView()</code> function returns ages before your callback runs.</p>
<p>You need to refactor your code to accomodate the async nature of the request.</p>
<p>So imagine you were going to do this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> win = <span class="hljs-type">Ti</span>.<span class="hljs-type">UI</span>.createWindow(<span class="hljs-decorator">{...}</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> v = getGeneratedView();
win.add (v);
</code></pre><p>That&#39;s just not going to work.  Instead, have your callback add the view to the window:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.getGeneratedView = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">l</span>) </span>{

        HTTPClient(l, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">e</span>)</span>{
                    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> jsonString = <span class="hljs-built_in">JSON</span>.parse(e);
                    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> v = generateView(jsonString);
                    win.add (v);
        });
    };
</code></pre><p>Granted, I&#39;m just guessing what <code>generateView()</code> might do.</p>
<p>My advice to you is to accept this as a fact and start moving on.  If you try to fight the asynchronicity, you are going to cause yourself a lot of frustration, and ultimately, you&#39;ll still have to come to terms with it.  It <em>is</em> possible to structure your code to work in this way, even if it&#39;s not immediately apparent to you.  It will just take some time to get used to thinking this way.</p>

										<p><p>You&#39;re right, i&#39;m on the verge of nervous breakdown because, this is not the first time i halt the project work because of this bugger :D.<br>In any case, i&#39;ll try this tomorrow  and let you know if it works.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Jason (almost wrote json lol)<br>Sorry for not getting back to you, but in the meantime, i&#39;ve found another thread in which you gave pretty clear solution to the problem (thread is <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;141038&#x2F;basic-json-question-getting-data-out-of-the-onload#245362">here</a>) which works to some extent.<br>It does generate a view (which is great), however, the view, although has all controls visible, has 0 children.</p>
