			<h1>Preventing multiple events firing for click</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have an event handler on my window&#39;s tableview to transition to another window when clicked and close the previous window.  On IOS this seems to be fine..  On Android, it throws an error if the user clicks the option twice.  On a physical phone device the transition seems slow so the user might think they didn&#39;t hit the button, but actually kicked off 2 events.  It seems to kick off the event twice and the second event finds that the window it is trying to close is already null so an error occurs.  I wrapped the close command inside an if statement that checks the window isn&#39;t null to prevent this, but I&#39;m wondering if I just implemented this wrong.</p>
<p>Has anyone else run into this issue?  Has anyone come up with a solution to this?</p>
<p>I&#39;m thinking of having a flag for all my events that I don&#39;t want to firing simultaneously that will ignore additional button presses until the device can finish processing the previous one.</p>

							<p>I use this technique: </p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">eventListener</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(eventListener.__isExecuting) {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span>;
    }
    eventListener.__isExecuting = <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>;

    <span class="hljs-comment">// event listener code</span>

    eventListener.__isExecuting = <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>;
}
</code></pre><p>Since functions in JS are also objects, you can add properties to them.</p>

										<p><p>I did something kind of like this, but put my boolean property in every single clickable object. This is SO much simpler.</p>

										<p><p>I think that my main problem was that on Android, if I was opening a new Window, I had to set <code>isExecuting = false;</code> on the new window&#39;s open event. Otherwise, click events would start to queue up until the window finished loading &amp; opening, and then fire after the window opened.</p>

							<p>Add a full screen transparent view to cover the display and remove when the new window has opened. Or use a Debounce or Throttle javascript function to prevent the two clicks from being processed ?</p>
