			<h1>Simulating Titanium.include() during testing</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hi, I&#39;m using Jasmine as my js testing framework for mobile developement with Titanium mobile 1.5.1.  It&#39;s working fine (with a little bit of hand mocking of the Titanium classes), but I wondered if there&#39;s a way I can simulate Titanium.include() to pull in other .js files into the test. </p>
<p>Obviously these aren&#39;t full on unit tests if I&#39;m pulling in outside files, but there are occasions where it&#39;s expedient, nice, and the right thing to do.  I&#39;m wondering what I can use to essentially load a separate .js file similar to the way Titanium.include does it when I don&#39;t have access to the Titanium API.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<div><p>Hi Palmer (ex H Linden here!)</p>
<p>There isn&#39;t an include statement in Javascript, and I don&#39;t know if this will help you, but when using Rhino, you can use load(&#39;javascriptfile.js&#39;);  I&#39;ve been hitting my head against this wall recently too :&#x2F;</p>
<p>I&#39;d be interested to see some of your mocking work.  I haven&#39;t really got into Jasmine yet so any starting pointers would be cool.</p>
<p>Cheers<br>H</p>

							<div><p>Hey H!<br>SOOOO Awesome to have you respond.  Seems we have the same aims (not unexpected!).  </p>
<p>My mocking is really just handrolled objects with jasmine spys placed on them. It&#39;s close enough for government work.   Javascript seems to make it easy enough to do.</p>
<p>Yeah, unfortunately not using rhino to run the javascript as jasmine just creates a server for you and a pass&#x2F;fail webpage in your browser.  I probably should ask the guys at pivotal what they would recommend.  </p>
<p>I&#39;m still thinking it&#39;s awesome that two former Lindens are tackling a similar problem.  We probably ought to put our heads together to solve some of these things, eh?</p>

							<div><p>Sounds like a plan!<br>The more I get into Titanium, the more I want to write unit tests, the more I get frustrated :&#x2F;<br>I still haven&#39;t settled on any testing framework with Javascript, so was playing with Rhino recently.  And then I got into jsTestDriver, which I&#39;m liking, but still haven&#39;t got it working nicely with my Titanium code (yet)<br>We&#39;re connected on LinkedIn and Facebook, so ping me.<br>Cheers<br>H</p>

							<p>I asked the Pivotal Labs folks (makers of Jasmine) what they thought and they said they had considered the common.js lib to be a good means of adding some &quot;includey&quot; style functions, but Jasmine strives to keep dependencies down, and so they decided against including that library.</p>
<p>They mentioned if I was using the Jasmine Ruby gem (which I am), that I may have some luck by changing the order of the source files in my jasmine.yml file.  That gets me the javascript ordered loading I need to make my code more modular.</p>
<p>So, not quite the answer I was looking for, but it gets me there nonetheless. :)  MUCH LOVE to the guys at Pivotal.  Jasmine rocks, they are indeed ninjas, and really easy to talk to.</p>

							<p>I had a similar issue with <code>Ti.include()</code> as I was putting unit tests against my code. I use the Jasmine test framework too, the version distributed with <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;guilhermechapiewski&#x2F;titanium-jasmine">titanium-jasmine</a>.</p>
<p>Mocking out <code>Ti.include()</code> did not work. In fact, attempting to mock any calls to the Titanium API simply did not have any effect. I wanted to mock those calls to <code>Ti.include()</code> because there was procedural code executed that I needed to avoid. After restructuring my code to be completely object-oriented, this need went away. Now I have a long list of includes loaded first thing in <code>app.js</code>, the app starts with a procedural one-liner, and the rest of the code has fairly robust test coverage.</p>
<p>I should also mention that while refactoring my code to make it testable, I implemented a simple MVC pattern. This contributes hugely to the testability of the code (including testing views without rendering them to screen) without having to mock out Titanium API calls.</p>
<p>I know that this is not exactly the answer you asked for, but I wanted to share my experience.</p>
