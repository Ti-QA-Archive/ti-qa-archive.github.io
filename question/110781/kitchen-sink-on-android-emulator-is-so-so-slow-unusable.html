			<h1>Kitchen Sink on Android Emulator is so so Slow! Unusable.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>We just started evaluating Titanium 1.5.1 for doing iPhone and Android application development.  We are able to run the Kitchen Sink just fine on the iPhone simulator, but on the Android emulator the performance is horrible.</p>
<p>We keep getting pop-ups saying &quot;Sorry! Process system is not responding&quot; and it takes forever for some screens to show up.  Every now and then the emulator will just go black and then the Kitchen Sink dies and the Android desktop shows up.</p>
<p>Please advise…we cannot move forward with Titanium if we cannot do Android development.</p>
<p>Also just so you know I using the latest MacBook Pro i7, 256gig SSD, 8gig Ram.  So you cannot say it&#39;s my computer.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Brian</p>
<p>Update:  We have found that these issues go away when you use Android APIs 2.2 and higher.  Anything below 2.2 has all the issues we describe and more.</p>

							<p>The emulator is dead slow. Try to deploy to a device directly.</p>

										<p><p>But that means every developer on our team must have an Android device…doesn&#39;t scale well.  We have had no issues doing real native Android development using the emulator.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m running on the previous model MBPro w&#x2F;8GB, and cannot say I&#39;ve ever seen the &quot;not responding&quot; message for Kitchen Sink.  Pause between screens is 0.5-1 seconds.  Definitely not snappy (and 30-60 seconds to start up!), but usable.  It&#39;s actually faster to push and test on a device for Android.</p>
<p>FWIW, I&#39;ve seen many complaints on Android blogs about the emulator - dog slow and slow to start up.  Hasn&#39;t changed much since I started using it 8 months ago - what&#39;s up with Google and performance enhancements?</p>

										<p><p>I guess we can deal with how slow it is…but now we are constantly seeing the screen go black and then it goes to the desktop in locked mode.  It&#39;s like the emulator is restarting itself.  Weird.</p>
