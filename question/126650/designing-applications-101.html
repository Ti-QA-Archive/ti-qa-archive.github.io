			<p>I&#39;m trying to write a cross-platform app for Android and iPhone. I wonder what the best way is to set up my windows&#x2F;views is. Right now I&#39;m using modal windows but I&#39;m getting the feeling this isnt the right way to go about things.</p>
<p>Right now I have a couple of windows displaying a tableview (with different data depending on where you are) and then normal views for the last windows. The user pretty much follows a set path: click type, click product, enter information, confirm, return to beginning.</p>
<p>Should I be using something else than modal windows? I&#39;m very grateful for constructive input and links to relevant documentation&#x2F;tutorials.</p>

							<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I started with the same questions and if you look at the kitchensink it&#39;ll actually put you on the wrong track.</p>
<p>If you need to understand a point&#x2F;reference implementation of an API then the kitchensink is great (as it usually contains undocumented stuff).</p>
<p>If you use it as a framework it&#39;s very poor (each new .js is a new url and then runs in its own window&#x2F;Javascript context).</p>
<p>Tweetanium is a very good sample application but unfortunately it is a little bit &quot;middle ground&quot;. Yes, it runs on both Android and iPhone but it doesn&#39;t look native on either. So if you are doing a very custom UI then great, go for it, if not then you&#39;ll have some grief.</p>
<p>You should check out</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;codecanyon.net&#x2F;searches?term=titanium&amp;type=files</p>
<p>For some reference sample apps, spend 100$ or so on a few to get some code examples. Note, I&#39;ve not used any of these, after a year on Titanium I&#39;ve figured out the pain&#x2F;avoiding pain points..</p>
<p>Just remember that Titanium shouldn&#39;t be thought of as &quot;write once, run anywhere (mobile)&quot; but &quot;write once, adapt a few times, run anywhere&quot;.</p>
<p>Hopefully they come up with a design tool and some form of coded layout manager where you can pass down something like XIB&#x2F;NIB and the ObjC&#x2F;Java code will instantiate all the objects.. today it can be a little slow (especiallllllllly on Android). Their NDK V8 JS engine should help there but that&#39;s still sometime off.</p>
<p>In short, but some sample apps, the ones from Titanium aren&#39;t the best for building world class apps unfortunately. They should release&#x2F;buy &amp; release some better samples.</p>
<p>Code for iPhone first, its far quicker dev cycle, then adapt for Android.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>There are best practices for any given situation. You need to consider the complexity of your applications, the number of windows &#x2F; views in them, and the logical connection between them.</p>
<p>I think that for some cases it&#39;s good to open windows in different context because and for some not. Keep in mind that you don&#39;t want to load all your includes when the app starts which makes it slow, and when not working properly pollute the global scope.</p>
<p>Have a look at this thread and it&#39;s discussion: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;126492&#x2F;mass-includes---fixed">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;126492&#x2F;mass-includes—fixed</a></p>

										<p><p>@Shlomi - it is slow for large number of files. My app (private enterprise application) loads for 8 seconds and it has about 850 files&#x2F;components (that&#39;s not bad result for me for now, I hope in the future I&#39;ll make that even better) 8)</p>

										<p><p>Thanks a lot for the insights. I&#39;ll be checking out more code before continuing on my quest :)</p>
<p>I was very surprised to find out how different my application looked from the android one after I worked out the kinks to even get it running on the iOS simulator. Dont know about the advice to primarily code for iPhone however, I have a android device and my macbook is much slower than my workstation :&#x2F;. However It looks like iOS is much more picky about code quality (a bunch of random crashes from my crappy code that android happily run).</p>
