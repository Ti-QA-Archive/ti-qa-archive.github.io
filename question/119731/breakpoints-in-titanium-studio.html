			<h1>Breakpoints in Titanium Studio</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>When trying to debug an app consisting of several files, the debugger stops at breakpoints in app.js but ignores all other breakpoints i set in other files (referenced in app.js via include). Is there anything i have to do in order to debug several app files properly.  </p>

							<p>Struggling with the same scenario exclusively on Android, breakpoints simply arent triggering outside of app.js.</p>
<p>Was told it&#39;s an issue associated with 1.7.x - but having the same problems with the latest 1.8 build.</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated…</p>

							<p>Same problem as well. Titanium SDK: 1.8.2; Titanium Studio: 1.0.9 (recently updated from an older version manually). Should be there any cache cleared or some settings defaulted to original values to get it working back (as it was working before)? Do you need any other details that may help you to understand what&#39;s wrong and suggest a solution?</p>

							<p>I changed my app architecture to a tab-based one like in the kitchen sink examples - et voila. Debugging works (seems so at least). It is really unnerving that everything you try doing without using a TabGroup ends up not working sooner or later. Especially since I am not getting rid of that ugly grey top-bar on Android…</p>

										<p><p>to specify it even more: i originally had an architecture like the tweetanium app. to verify that i didn&#39;t do something wrong i downloaded tweetanium and tried to debug it. result: what i suspected! since tweetanium does not use a TabGroup but just opens the main application window breakpoints in files other than app.js are ignored. could anyone of the appcelerator&#x2F;titanium studio team at least confirm that they read this and are aware of this bug?!</p>

							<p>I&#39;m able to get it to work in 1.8.x. I&#39;m using the latest for 1.8 from Oct 3 2011 07:26 (rcf539b51). Try clearing the project and the content of the emulator&#x2F;simulator</p>

							<p>I am currently having the same issue.  None of my breakpoints are getting hit.  I am not sure what changed, it was working just fine and than it stopped.  I downloaded all of the updates, I&#39;ve tried disabling Fastdev, recreating the Android VM, but still not working.</p>

							<p>Having a similar problem with a 1.09 Studio build and 1.8.1 SDK - seems to have started when I set up to build modules.</p>
<p>I get this error message</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">A valid location could <span class="hljs-operator">not</span> be found <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">breakpoint</span>
</code></pre><p>I&#39;ve looked in JIRA for something like it, but I haven&#39;t found anything that matched a search for Breakpoint.</p>
