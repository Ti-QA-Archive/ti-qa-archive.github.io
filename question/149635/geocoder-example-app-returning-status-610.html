			<h1>Geocoder example app returning status 610</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, I want to use google to geocode against, as the example geocoder app does but it it&#39;s no longer working for me.</p>
<p>Instead it simply returns:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">json:  {
       Status =     {
           code = 610<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
           request = geocode<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
       }<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
}
</code></pre><p>From what I understand this means google expects a key. I&#39;m not sure what kind of key I would use since I&#39;m try to query using their url (as the geocoder app does) but it will won&#39;t be from a domain and won&#39;t be from a common ip address. I noticed they have IOS keys now but I think this is if you include their native code in your project.</p>
<p>Does the geocoder example work for others or is it broke for everyone now (assuming because Google changed something). It worked for me a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>More importantly how can I get around this issue?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I notice your original question did not include any code to show what you were actually trying.  This might be why your question got little attention.  People are not happy about guessing.</p>
<p>You are right about the URL, this is an example;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;maps.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;api&#x2F;geocode&#x2F;json?region=uk&amp;sensor=true&amp;address=London">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;maps.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;api&#x2F;geocode&#x2F;json?region=uk&amp;sensor=true&amp;address=London</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This will return back the full geo information and address details.  Note the extra optional parameter <strong>region</strong>, this allows you to target results to a particular territory if required - think how places match Melbourne for example.</p>
<p>The order of the parameters is not important, I prefer address at the end ONLY so I can quickly swap the value if testing in a web browser.</p>
<p>Now the important stuff;</p>
<ul>
<li>There are usage limits on the use of this API</li>
<li>There are restrictions on how you use this API</li>
</ul>
<p>You can ONLY use this API when resolving information to a map that Google supplies.  So you should consider the Google Maps module from the marketplace if this is going to be for iOS.</p>

										<p><p>Ahh, thanks for the hint. I just thought it was perhaps a bit of a corner case. I should have included the source from the example geocoder instead of just mentioned it.</p>
<p>Didn&#39;t know about some of those limitations. Thanks for the clarification.</p>

							<p>Ok, I&#39;ll answer my own questions. Near as I can tell the geocoder example is outdated and needs to use the new version.</p>
<p>To get it working use a url in this form &#39;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;maps.googleapis.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;api&#x2F;geocode&#x2F;json?address=[someplace]&amp;sensor=true</p>
<p>I had to use sensor=true for some reason (I will have to read up on it after). It might make sense putting sensor before address.</p>

										<p><p>Also, this is using a different API than the one geocoder uses. So it won&#39;t get that project working. But at least you can get your own project working from this..</p>
