			<p>I bought a license after seeing &quot;KitchenSink&quot; run in the emulator and on my Android phone. This week I got around to building a trivial app to get started. I found that I could only see my trivial app run if I shut down the emulator AND delete the Android virtual device, every time I want to see it run. My trivial app with no logic takes Five minutes and Eight seconds to show up in the emulator. I do see messages about the &quot;FastDev&quot; being processed, that seems wrong. I have Titanium Mobile SDK Version: 1.7.2 installed with up to date Android SDK running on Mac Mini OS 10.6.8.</p>
<p>I cannot do functional work when every change takes over 5 minutes to see. This is un-acceptable, not something I will pay for. I paid a profession fee, I expect Titanium to work on a professional basis.</p>

							<p>Not to be flippant, but if you are trying to work on a &quot;professional basis&quot;, then why are you using a Mac Mini?  The latest models have greatly improved the speeds and feeds – especially if paired with a SSD drive – but most generations of the Mac Mini are more &quot;hobbyist&quot; than &quot;professsional&quot;, IMHO.</p>
<p>I attribute the bulk of the (lack of) performance when dealing with Android to be the Android emulator.  It is painfully slow.  FastDev will not improve the initial load time – it is designed to reduce debug&#x2F;test&#x2F;cycle times.  So you need to find out why you apparently need to shut down the emulator and delete the AVD.  That is certainly not normal.</p>
<p>But aside from that, here are some other serious suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attach your phone via USB and test on the device.  The Android emulator is horrendously slow.  (In contrast to the iOS Simulator, which is actually faster than a real device.)</li>
<li>Consider a SSD drive – others have reported their android speeds have doubled.</li>
<li>Upgrade your Mac Mini memory if not at its maximum for your model</li>
</ul>
<p>And last but not least, in all seriousness, consider prototyping and doing the bulk of the logic debug cycles using iOS instead of Android.  Granted, you can&#39;t verify all the UI sizing and density support, or test those things which are Android only.  But most apps will have a significant portion of the app where the code&#x2F;test&#x2F;debug cycle is just working on logic testing, event listeners, etc.</p>
<p>The iOS simulator runs circles around the android emulator in that regard.  So crazy as it may sound on the surface, you may find you are more productive doing as much testing as possible under iOS instead of android.</p>
<p>You have a leg up on the Windows only based users in that regard.</p>
<p>YMMV.</p>
<p>Just my .02</p>

										<p><p>Another .02 about the mini:</p>
<p>Re: Mini - Even the 45 day old new year model only has an i5 at its base w&#x2F; 2gb of ram.</p>
<p>Re: Android - I spend more time adjusting code for the android platform or waiting for the emulator.  And thats in Titanium AND Eclipse&#x2F;Native.  I&#39;v had android&#39;s own tools timeout trying to find the emulator.</p>
<p>Re: Attitude - waltzing into a community supported forum where the folks DON&#39;T get paid to help you, shouting about how much you paid and what you expect, won&#39;t get you much help from the community in the future.  And you didn&#39;t pay for a professional experience, you paid for the indie (as noted by your little icon). A Professional subscription lets you ask the pros instead of all of us. Anty up another $2k and ask the big boys if you want to holler about money.</p>
<p>Re: Doug - he was being polite.  I bet he bent his shiny metal keyboard when he saw your rant. <em>grin</em></p>
<p>Now, with that all said.  Breathe.  If you are willing to be polite, we can see if a solution to your android issues can be resolved.</p>

										<p><p>My keyboard is still fine.  I was trying to provide what I hoped to be <em>constructive</em> criticism.  Since there is an Indie badge, I took it as a frustrated user instead of a troll.  I can feel his pain – the android emulator is notoriously slow.  That has nothing to do with Titanium; it is just the antithesis of productivity with native tooling too.</p>
<p>Even with only a Mac Mini, that gives him the advantage to consider doing some of the logic testing under iOS.  Windows based developers can&#39;t even do that.</p>
<p>In terms of Pro vs Indie, my vote would be to upgrade the hardware before the subscription.  But that is must me…</p>

							<p>On a related note, I picked up a good tip from Pedro Enrique.  He suggested to run the following from the command line to view Ti.API.info() responses in real-time while running an app on a USB-connected Android device: </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">adb -d logcat <span class="hljs-string">| grep TiAPI</span>
</code></pre><p>Very lightweight and simpler than DDMS.</p>
<p>HTH.</p>

							<p>The Android emulator sucks hard, that&#39;s just the way it is, slow to boot, slow to run. That said I agree with most of what Doug wrote, but would suggest now you have got that off your chest you start investigating why you need to recreate the virtual device for each iteration, that is just not normal. Ideally you would be able to keep the emulator running most of the time. </p>
<p>What errors are you getting if you don&#39;t recreate the virtual machine?</p>
<p>Also running on real hardware as Doug suggested is a much better bet.</p>

							<p>For comparison sake, and FWIW, I have a 2 year old MacBook Pro with a 2.53Ghz core2duo (hardly an i5) and a AMD six-core box running around 2.8GHz. They both take about the same amount of time (1 to 2 minutes&#39;ish) with the android emulator on the first shot. However, if he has a mac mini that is single core and in the 1.67GHZ range, that might be an issue.</p>
<p>I was given a suggestion on this forum not to long ago and that suggestion was a good one. I ended up buying a the used MacBook Pro mentioned above.</p>
