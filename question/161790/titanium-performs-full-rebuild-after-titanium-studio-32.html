			<h1>Titanium performs full rebuild after Titanium Studio 3.2</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>After I upgraded to 3.2, whenever I build a project with SDK v. 3.2.0.GA the underlying XCode project is built from the start. This is a real pain as I add external libraries on the binary and they get lost each time.</p>
<p>I am one step away to installing a previous version of Studio (but will have to fall back to ios 7 from 7.03 as well) for this thing.</p>

										<p><p>Yes,in the auto generated folder.What I used to do and was working was to open the XCode proj from the build folder, import the libs and then run from Studio: it was working ok.</p>

										<p><p>You could add modules&#x2F;frameworks to the root of the project (eg: &#x2F;Users&#x2F;[username]&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;TiWorkspace&#x2F;[ProjectFolder]&#x2F;Framework) or in the global module directory (&#x2F;Users&#x2F;[username]&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;modules&#x2F;[platform]) and then include them into your app - then rebuilds won&#39;t get wiped.</p>

										<p><p>Hmm, Sadly I&#39;ve never worked with .frameword libraries, I would try to figure out where are those taken from the titanium app, you can usually put anything in the assets directory and it will be added to the app (like fonts, images, etc&#39;).</p>
<p>Than I would create a custom plist if needed, to register those.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
