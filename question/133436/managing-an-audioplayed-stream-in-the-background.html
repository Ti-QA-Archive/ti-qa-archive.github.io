			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a question that I just need expert advise on:</p>
<p>Please do not give me any source code, or anything, just your advice is enough if you have had experience in this issue.</p>
<p>I launch an Audio stream from a given window.<br>Because I&#39;m using background streaming, I can change windows and the stream still works. (that&#39;s great).</p>
<p>But I cannot kill&#x2F;disable that stream. There is a problem when the variables move out of scope. I have tried to make the audioPlayer variable (var) a global variable- but this does not work. When the user returns to the window they were on to select a new MP3, it only handles the variables that are in scope for that actual session or window when its open.</p>
<p>How do you handle background audio?How do you control it?</p>
<p>If you have any experience in this issue, or similar problems, I would love to hear what methods you used or how you got around this issue.<br>THanks</p>
