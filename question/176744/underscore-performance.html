			<h1>underscore performance</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I was considering using underscore js in an app I&#39;m writing.</p>
<p>I was wondering about performance when running on the phone when using this external js library - from first requiring all the way to actually using.</p>
<p>did someone experience with it? do you feel a leg in performance when loading the library? how about when using it?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Have you actually tried it?</p>
<p>The underscore library does an amazing job and proving many extensions to common JavaScript objects.  If you only use this library for the <strong>each</strong> command then it is worth its weight in gold.</p>
<p>But back to the main points;</p>
<ul>
<li>Lag; no, the file is so small, much smaller than your own code - this is nothing in the grand scheme of things</li>
<li>Assuming you are storing the the library locally to the device - if you are not - then you MUST</li>
<li>Performance of functions; this is harder to answers as there are so many positions;<ul>
<li>If you are new the functions help you solve problems that might take much longer to learn</li>
<li>Each function is obviously tuned to provide the most efficient performance possible</li>
<li>HOWEVER the methods are generic solutions to general problems, so the speed is relative to that premise</li>
<li>There is NO substitute for understanding the core JavaScript objects and how to interact with them, not learning them is lazy</li>
<li>Lazy is however relative, using a sat-nav to get from a to b makes much more sense than using paper maps</li>
<li>However using the paper maps shows you about the journey much more than the sat-nav could and that journey may bring additional knowledge and understanding</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Back to should you use it<ul>
<li>Yes, I do</li>
<li>No, I don&#39;t</li>
<li>OK - that sounds stupid; know when to use it, as I said earlier it creates performance capable methods to extend base JS, however your specific requirement may have a more suitable non underscore way - keep in mind underscore is just a library of JS commands.</li>
<li>If you are performance tuning your app then consider both using and not using, but have the knowledge to not need it.</li>
<li>But have the smarts to know when to use it as well.  For example - you cannot reasonably performance tune a loop of 20 array items that builds another array used only once in your app.  Yes you CAN make it faster but I said reasonably - performance tune something that happens 1,000 times before you get back to this one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So yes I use it, many smart people do, many smart people don&#39;t, if you use it - remember you should have an understanding of what it is doing and do not rely on it rather than learning these techniques without a library.</p>
<p>So the best example I can give is this; I use and oven to cook my food, I use a washing machine to clean my clothes, I use motorised transport to get me from a to b when the journey is long.  If we lost electricity and fuel; I better know how to start a fire, kill some animals, find fresh water and get from a to b.  But the car is still better until that happens - I will just be prepared if that changes.</p>
