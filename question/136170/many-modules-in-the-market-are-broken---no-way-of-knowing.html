			<h1>Many modules in the market are broken - no way of knowing!</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Many modules were broken when Titanium changed its api at 1.8 adding a new check in the module manifest. There is no way of knowing which apis a module supports without downloading (mainly paying) and then finding out. This is clumsy and actually unaccpetable situation. Have other people faced this?</p>
<p>I currently unable to use cloudkit that I paid for. Cloudkit say they are unable to make the fix without something from Titanium..</p>
<p>I also can&#39;t use the Bugsense module I downloaded.</p>
<p>This is the typical message I get.</p>
<p>[code]The &#39;apiversion&#39; for &#39;com.droisys.bugsense&#39; in the module manifest is not a valid value[&#x2F;code]</p>
<p>One of the reasons I see Appcelerator as mainly to blame for this is that going from 1.7 to 1.8 should not have broken modules in the market. At the 2.0 I could have accepted it more but only if there was a clear  recognition of the issue and an upgrade path. </p>
<p>Is there anyone who can point out whats going on with this either from the staff end or community.</p>

<li>Bugsense clearly states it is for Titanium 1.8</li>
<li>Cloudkit is listed as Titanium 2.0 compatible.  If you have a problem with a module, take it up with the module developer. <em>kind of curious what cloud kit thanks it wants from Appcelerator though</em></li>
<li>The change in module design  came about because of the new V8 engine on android.  You can roll back to a previous SDK on android, use your old modules.  Progress means change.</li>
