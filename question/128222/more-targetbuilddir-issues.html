			<h1>MORE TARGET_BUILD_DIR issues</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;m getting the TARGET_BUILD_DIR issue.  I have been through all the suggestions in the other examples of people having this issue, and there are a lot of them. My issue in particular is related to case sensitivity of the &quot;&#x2F;Users&quot; part of the path. </p>
<p>I have struggled over the last few days to get a stable development environment setup, and yesterday i thought i had it.</p>
<p>I&#39;m on a Mac and this is what I am facing.</p>
<p>I completely removed both XCode and Titanium Studio.  Rebooted my machine.  Installed XCode. Rebooted.  Installed titanium studio.  Imported my project and <em>BAM</em> I could build again!  I could FINALLY have a decent day of development with Titanium Studio.</p>
<p>OK, so now fast forward to this morning, when i turned my machine on, loaded titanium, tried to run a build and LO AND BEHOLD, I&#39;m getting that error again.</p>
<p>Does anyone know an actual way of getting this fixed on a more permenant basis?  I don&#39;t want to have to be blasting away XCode and Titanium every morning, and re-installing it just so i can get some work done.  The frustration is unbelievable, but we are too far into our project to restart with another framework now.</p>
<p>Please note: don&#39;t link me to the answer provided under the title of &quot;Really is that the first impression&quot; none of the suggestions there worked for me.</p>
<p>I&#39;m using:</p>
<p>MacOSX 10.6.8<br>XCode 3.2.5<br>Titanium Studio, build: 1.0.6.201110251616</p>
