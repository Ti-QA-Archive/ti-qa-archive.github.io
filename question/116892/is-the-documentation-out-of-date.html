			<p>I&#39;m trying to learn how and when to use the <em>layout</em> attribute. Searching the API Reference guide, however, only finds it on one Titanium.UI class - table row.</p>
<p>However, in the Kitchen Sink, it&#39;s in use on other classes as well, e.g. Window.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been seeing other code in Kitchen Sink for which I find no api docs as well. (?)</p>

							<p>I wasn&#39;t even aware layout could be used on a tableviewrow.  I thought it was only valid on a window or view.  I suspect it would work the same on table row though – it is just another type of view anyway.</p>
<p>When you use layout:&#39;absolute&#39; (the default), all your top&#x2F;bottom position values are relative to the top or bottom of the size of the view&#x2F;window.  This lets you place objects side by side by repeating the same top&#x2F;bottom values on multiple objects.</p>
<p>When you use layout:&#39;vertical&#39;, then each object&#39;s top value is relative to the object above it.  So using top:0 on everything just stacks the objects with no additional padding between them, while top:5 would insert an extra 5 pixels of padding, etc.  Note that you cannot place controls side by side while using layout:&#39;vertical&#39;.</p>
<p>In order to place controls side by side in a vertical view, you must create another view which is layout:&#39;absolute&#39;, place the controls in it, and add that view into the vertical layout view.  Since view can be nested, that works out fine.</p>
<p>I saw some references to layout:&#39;horizontal&#39; support on the roadmap, but AFAIK it is not available yet.</p>
<p>Unlike most properties, the layout property MUST be specified when the view or window is created.  You CANNOT change the layout property later.  For example, Ti.UI.createView({layout:&#39;vertical&#39;}) is effective while myView.layout = &#39;vertical&#39; is not.</p>
<p>The subject question was if the docs are out of date.  In my experience, they have always been incomplete.  I have stumbled on many properties used in the kitchen sink which are not listed in the API docs for that object.  And sometimes Q&amp;A answers suggest a solution which is not in the docs either.</p>
<p>I&#39;m hoping that with the additional staffing in 2011, Appcelerator can devote some of it improving the documentation.  In the meantime, I suggest looking at the kitchen sink examples, and doing Q&amp;A searches related to any specific problem you are having.  You may well learn of an undocumented technique.</p>
<p>Frustrating perhaps, but considering what I am paying for this (i.e. nothing) it is very hard to complain.  Especially when I compare it against the time required for me to develop the projects in pure native means on multiple platforms.</p>
<p>I suppose that is why I try to be somewhat active here – it is my way of giving back and helping others who haven&#39;t yet made it over the same hurdles in the learning curve.</p>

										<p><p>btw: you can put things side by side in a vertical layout, using a negative top value to &#39;reset&#39; the &#39;topness&#39; ;)</p>

										<p><p>also: the horizontal layout works well. I use it for horizontal scrollViews ans also for creating scrollViews which look like the album picker. Very useful, since the imageViews automatically stack and wrap.</p>

										<p><p>Kosso – thanks!  I had never tried a negative top value; that will make layout:&#39;vertical&#39; much easier to take advantage of in some scenarios.  Horizontal layout support is new enough (cross platform) that I have not gone down that road yet.</p>

							<p>Thanks for the feedback. I&#39;m now thinking about starting a separate unofficial documentation project, using the Kitchen Sink as the API.</p>
<p>Essentially, parsing the Kitchen Sink code with ruby, and outputting the API and attributes used.</p>
