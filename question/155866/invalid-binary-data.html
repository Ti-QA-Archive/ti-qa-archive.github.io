			<p>Hi,<br>I want trying to submit my app to the app store by it&#39;s always rejected (Invalid Binary Data) and i am receiving this mail:</p>
<p>To process your delivery, the following issues must be corrected:</p>
<p>Invalid Launch Image - Your app contains a launch image with a size modifier that is only supported for apps built with the iOS 6.0 SDK or later.</p>
<p>Though you are not required to fix the following issues, we wanted to make you aware of them:</p>
<p>Missing Push Notification Entitlement - Your app appears to include API used to register with the Apple Push Notification service, but the app signature&#39;s entitlements do not include the &quot;aps-environment&quot; entitlement. If your app uses the Apple Push Notification service, make sure your App ID is enabled for Push Notification in the Provisioning Portal, and resubmit after signing your app with a Distribution provisioning profile that includes the &quot;aps-environment&quot; entitlement. See &quot;Provisioning and Development&quot; in the Local and Push Notification Programming Guide for more information. If your app does not use the Apple Push Notification service, no action is required. You may remove the API from future submissions to stop this warning. If you use a third-party framework, you may need to contact the developer for information on removing the API.</p>
<p>Once the required corrections have been made, go to the Version Details page and click &quot;Ready to Upload Binary.&quot; Continue through the submission process until the app status is &quot;Waiting for Upload.&quot; You can then deliver the corrected binary.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>This normally only occurs if you are trying to upload a binary using an older iOS SDK (not to be confused with Titanium SDK).  What it means is that one or more of your images contains filename suffixes that were simply not possible in an earlier version.</p>
<p>Check the version of the iOS SDK when you start the distribution process, it should be the first question.  The most likely value for this if you have the most recent publicly available xcode installation is 6.1.</p>
<p>If you have an earlier version than this it is likely the filename <strong>Default-568h@2x.png</strong> and it would be the <strong>-568@2x</strong> that is the thing causing the issue.</p>
<p><strong>However</strong>: you must use the latest version as all app submission now require iPhone 5 support (known as retina tall) so you MUST include this file with this file suffix.</p>
