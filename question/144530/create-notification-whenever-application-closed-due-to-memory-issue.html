			<h1>Create Notification whenever application closed due to memory issue.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I wondering if there is way to create notification whenever Application closed by Android due to memory issue. Basically my app has one running service which periodically update data to server but in certain case application stop by Android due to memory issue and service stop updating to server. I want to generate notification if my service or app is not running so user can click on notification and start application again.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance </p>
<p>Pritesh</p>

							<p>I&#39;;m afraid, thjat&#39;s not very realistic.<br>You said ti yourself, the application <strong>stopped working</strong>. From there, there is no way for it to execute anything else.</p>
<p>It&#39;s like in real life, once you&#39;re dead, you&#39;re dead…</p>

										<p><p>Christian, Thanks for realistic example :). I am new to Titanium and Android too. I just heard that AlarmManager which can be schedule for later time but I guess that also required service to be running, right?</p>

										<p><p>You are correct.<br>Even though you can schedule a notification for later, it would make little much sense if there is no code running behind it.</p>
<p>One thing strikes me though. If you application crashed due to memory issues, you should investigate and correct the problem instead of putting so much energy in a workaround.</p>

										<p><p>Actually stop by Android while running another application. Here is test case I was trying ..</p>
<p>I ran my application and started one background service.</p>
<p>I just move it to background by pressing home button.</p>
<p>Started running &quot;Bad Piggies&quot; (it needs too much memory ):) and after playing two to three levels Android stop my application. </p>
<p>So I guess there is no issue with my application but it stop by Android because it require more memory to run another application.</p>

										<p><p>Are you sure your application isn&#39;t just in the <strong>Paused</strong> state?</p>
<p>I assume you are familiar with this:<br><img src="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.androidjavadoc.com&#x2F;1.0_r1_src&#x2F;android&#x2F;app&#x2F;doc-files&#x2F;activity_lifecycle.png" alt=""></p>

										<p><p>I am familiar with this flow… In this case my Activity at  &quot;Process is Killed&quot; stage which require user manauly navigate to create it. Anyway I have decided to use GCM to notify user in case server do not receive any update for certain time limit.</p>
<p>Thanks for your all help and time.</p>
