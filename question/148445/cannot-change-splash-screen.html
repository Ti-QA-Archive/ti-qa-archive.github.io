							<p>There were some issues with the splash screen in 3.0.0.GA that we fixed in 3.0.2 when we added support for localized splash screens. 3.0.2 will be out <strong>very</strong> soon.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Have you actually tried running the app to see if the splash screen has changed?  Have you tried it on the device?</p>
<p>What you see in that folder is not an exact replication of what is installed on the device or in the simulator.  It is worth checking if your version is actually showing up first.</p>
<p>I have just performed a test by swapping one of the images and found that despite it correctly showing on the simulator the folder you point to does have the original image which is not my new one.</p>
