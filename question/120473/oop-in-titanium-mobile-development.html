			<p>I am coming from JAVA and just wondering is that really necessary to bring it into Titanium development?</p>
<p>Actually, there is no class definitions in javascript but we can make it similar to the real class in OO-based languages.</p>
<p>Not really clear about if it is necessary to do like that</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

							<p>YES!  It is absolutely essential in my opinion if you want your code to be efficient, modular, and maintainable. If you&#39;re just doing a simple one-off app then maybe not… but if you&#39;re doing anything complex or want to be able to build upon it for future apps then absolutely.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve written basically my own MVC (actually close to MVVM) framework</p>

							<p>I think that using JavaScript&#39;s prototypes is better (and faster!) than simulating classes. It requires different way of thinking, so it can be difficult for someone coming from class-based OOP languages.</p>
<p>If your project is medium or large size, you should organize your source code so that maintenance is easy to do. I like MVC approach in other programming languages, but also in JavaScript. Titanium JavaScript environment is different from browser&#39;s, but it can also benefit from MVC approach. For example, you can build UI components as &quot;View&quot; part of MVC, add events to that components, making them &quot;Controller&quot; part of MVC and use models (database, xml, …) as &quot;Model&quot; part of MVC. That way you have decomposed different parts of application and it&#39;s much easier to maintain application if it&#39;s organized that way.</p>
