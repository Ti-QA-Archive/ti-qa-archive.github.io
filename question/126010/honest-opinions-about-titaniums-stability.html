			<h1>Honest opinions about Titanium&#39;s stability.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m currently developing a major commercial mobile app in MacOSX Leopard, using Titanium 1.7.3, and it seems the more complex my app becomes the more I run in to crashes. I&#39;m wondering if I could get some honest opinions from other developers about your experience with the stability of Titanium.</p>
<p>When I first started the app crashes were pretty infrequent – maybe once every couple of days – and often I could solve the issue by clearing the build folder. Now that my app has many more screens and features I&#39;m running in to crashes several times a day. Sometimes I can fix the problem by clearing the build folder, but other times that doesn&#39;t make any difference. It seems that most of my crashes have to do with screens that have TableView, but most of my screens have TableViews, so it&#39;s hard to tell for sure. </p>
<p>Sometimes the app will crash when I try to place a label in a row, or in a view in a row, or if I decide to set a &quot;top&quot; attribute, and the only way to &quot;fix&quot; it is to figure out some other way to position the label so that it doesn&#39;t crash. Or to give a very recent example, I was just now doing some coding in a table view, and I changed the value of a constant and suddenly my app started crashing on startup. Oddly enough, when I added a &quot;Ti.UI.Info()&quot; statement in a for loop the crashing stopped. If I take it out, it crashes again. Very strange, and since there are no useful error messages (just the usual &quot;Application has exited from simulator&quot;) debugging is totally trial and error, and sometimes the solutions make no sense, but they just work.</p>
<p>So far I haven&#39;t found any show stoppers with the crashing, but I&#39;m starting to get a bit concerned that the application is becoming less and less stable. Has anyone else who has made a significant app with Titanium experienced this level of stability? Or has Titanium been generally stable for most devs?</p>

							<p>My company has now released 4 applications this year using appcelerator… We are about to release two more in the next month. We have applications on iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Building a mobile application is actually more complex then building an application for a website or desktop because usually managing memory appropriately is not as fatal as it is on a mobile device with limited memory.</p>
<p>You should be sure you are managing and cleaning up memory appropriately, I would strongly recommend reviewing the recent posting about memory management and soon there will be released a presentation from CODESTRONG which covers the topic.</p>

<p>I find my app only really crashes, if its left in memory for a while, while other apps have been used. Then opening it will make the UI unresponsive for a few seconds… then either; all good or, crash.</p>

										<p><p>I always think its because Ti just keeps grabbing and grabbing the memory until… not enough left to put all open windows in memory. To be honest, Ti memory management is really bad…automatic memory management sucks and no official methods to free it up yourself.</p>
<p>Guess there&#39;s a reason why Wunderlist moved to native code.</p>

										<p><p>@Aaron Can you please provide a link to the appcelerator API documentation that details memory management methods? </p>
<p>Yes there are several Appcelerator successes, and I plan on having success. All I&#39;m saying is there is a problem with memory management; automatic management is poor and there isn&#39;t enough official documentation for users to efficiently manage it manually.</p>

							<p>Just wanted to sort of answer my own question here. After a few more weeks of development I&#39;m concluded that Titanium itself is pretty stable. So far all of the crashes I&#39;ve experienced were due to bugs on my part. The main problem is that it&#39;s EXTREMELY difficult and frustrating to debug such issues. It&#39;s literally a trial and error experience where you make a guess, disable an element and see how stable the app is. Rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat. It&#39;s pretty frustrating, but the crashes can all be overcome with a little persistence. Or more like a lot of persistence.</p>

										<p><p>In case it&#39;s helpful to someone in the future, I wanted to point out that it seems that 99% of the &quot;random&quot; crashes I&#39;ve experienced were a result of accessing objects or properties that didn&#39;t actually exist. For example, I was trying to hide and unhide elements in a row that had actually be removed, or there was a typo in one of the properties when creating a Ti.UI.x object. Seems pretty obvious, but it&#39;s amazing how easy it is to make mistakes like that and then to not know why. Now here I am commenting on my own answer. :-P</p>

							<p>I just happened upon this while doing a search to find out why Titanium constantly says something like this into the Android log:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">GC_CONCURRENT freed <span class="hljs-number">1975</span>KB  <span class="hljs-number">37</span>% free (<span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">then</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">some</span> other crap <span class="hljs-keyword">about</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> free memory)
</code></pre><p>The 37% never changes, but this is almost like a leak in and of itself because it is eating the battery, though it appears to be an automatic &#39;garbage collector&#39;…Stable? No, obviously. </p>
<h3 id="so-my-answer-is-">SO MY ANSWER IS:</h3>
<p>The Android part of Titanium still needs some work, or they need to more clearly document how to properly release memory, and leave it up to the developer to manage memory, providing us with a leak detection system for Android. </p>
<p>iPhone stuff seems to work a whole lot better and it&#39;s easier to manage, but not due to Titanium&#39;s work on it. Rather, Apple is just better, so it&#39;s easier. Pull out Three20 for iPhone and enjoy Apple, instead of fighting with Titanium when in this case an abstraction layer is not needed.</p>
<p>Having said that, if you try developing Java applications for Android in Eclipse expecting it to be easier than Titanium, you would be sadly very wrong. The TI abstraction layer really makes things easier for Android.</p>
<p>And then there is the multi-platform argument, so all-in-all, not a bad solution here, and stability is mostly dependent on your ability to actually program code.</p>
<p>If I had it to do all over again, I would have saved time by just doing native development, because my app is INTENSELY complex. But then, I know Objective C and Java, having already done Android and OSX native apps. So that fact puts me in a small group, and for most, Titanium is a little easier.</p>
<p>The biggest misconception (and frankly this is misleading on the part of the TI group) is that you don&#39;t need to know how to use xCode&#x2F;Eclipse and you don&#39;t need to know Java and&#x2F;or Objective C to make apps using Titanium. You not only need to know about them, you need to be intimately familiar with them in order to really succeed. That ought to be said up front, and it&#39;s not.</p>

							<p>For what its worth from someone at Appcelerator… some major apps are in fact built and stable of the Titanium platform such as the NBC iPad app, and TripLingo. Many times it is more a matter of how the code is written, and how memory is managed on the JS side (and we are always working to make things run even better). </p>
<p>With all that in mind, maybe if you had particular issues, we could help with that if you post code examples.</p>
<p>If you feel the issue is more compound, if you post a larger section of code, maybe we could give some pointers.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the response. It&#39;s a bit tricky at this stage for me to post code bBecause my app has become fairly complex, and I can&#39;t post all the source for NDA reasons. So I may be a bit on my own unless I can re-create the issue in a separate, simpler project. I&#39;ll try to do that next time I run in to a crash.</p>

										<p><p>Depending on your code layout, yes. if your working with a code layout like tweetanium, then closing a window will clean the memory of UI elements. but while a window is open, setting vars to null when no longer needed, and things like that can help a lot.</p>
