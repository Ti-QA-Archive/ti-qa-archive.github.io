			<h1>How to setup up a way for developers to send app update notifications to the app.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I would like to set up a way in any app to get notified when it&#39;s opened if there are any updates available. </p>
<p>I have been pondering this question for sometime and here is what I have come up with so far. </p>
<p>1) When you open the app. Check an RSS feed that has the list of updates.<br>2) Store these locally to check against them in the future. This is to see if there is something new or not. </p>
<p>I am very unfamiliar with RSS technology, so I don&#39;t know how hard this would be to implement. It would also be nice to be able to read a Title or description of the feed so that it could be displayed in a table view. </p>
<p>Please let me know what you think and if you have any better or more detailed solution. </p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>You can do this very simply, with a little web-service, literally just a static page that returns a string of JSON.</p>
<p>For example, when someone opens the app, you check for connectivity, then make an xhr request to:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;yourApp.com&#x2F;latest-updates</p>
<p>returning a small JSON payload like:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">{<span class="hljs-symbol">'currentVersion'</span>:<span class="hljs-number">1.1</span>, <span class="hljs-symbol">'title'</span>:<span class="hljs-symbol">'There</span> is an update available', <span class="hljs-symbol">'msg'</span>:<span class="hljs-symbol">'New</span> functionality available from the <span class="hljs-type">AppStore'</span>}
</code></pre><p>You can consume this in your app very easily, create some templating code to build a tableView that sort of thing. RSS is essentially a web-service standard delivered in XML, which is a pain compared to JSON to parse inside of Appcelerator so why not use JSON.. When you call:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">version</span> = JSON.<span class="hljs-keyword">parse</span>(xhr.responseText);
alert(<span class="hljs-keyword">version</span>.msg); <span class="hljs-comment">// will alert there is a new version etc..</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">//etc..</span>
</code></pre><p>You have a proper object to work with, which makes your code more concrete &#x2F; less verbose..</p>

										<p><p>Mark thanks for your answer. I understand JSON but I know nothing about servers and websites. So i need that file on the server to just be a latest-updates.json and structure it as you mentioned? How do I secure it?</p>

										<p><p>Mark&#39;s solution is the quickest and least expensive to implement and simple to migrate down the road.  You can move to using a push notification ($$$)  to force the notification to the user, but send the same json data package to the app for information delivery that you have been using all along.</p>

										<p><p>If ignored, a <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;KitchenSink&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;ui&#x2F;common&#x2F;platform&#x2F;xml_rss.js">XML sample</a> might give a general idea about RSS technology.</p>
<p>Depending on what your app data structure is, you might want to choose the proper approach.</p>

										<p><p>Unless there&#39;s another file linking to it, then it&#39;s secure in the fact that google etc.. won&#39;t know it&#39;s there, so unless someone was to guess the url exactly, they aren&#39;t going to find it.</p>
<p>The question is does it any extra security than that? From your current requirement I can&#39;t see why you need extra security. If someone wanted to they could capture the URL and any (plain text) username &#x2F; password being sent to the server.</p>
<p>You could implement https:&#x2F;&#x2F; but there&#39;s no personal information so what&#39;s the need?</p>
