			<h1>Need advice on app design, Transitioning through lots of views and windows</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey guys, I&#39;m working on my second app and I&#39;m having a really hard time conceptualizing the design of this one.</p>
<p>It&#39;s really simple, I&#39;ve got about 50 messages that need their own view&#x2F;window? and to be able to swipe through to the next one, one message at a time. Forwards and backwards would be a plus, as well as the ability to start at message 30&#x2F;50.</p>
<p>The same functionality as &quot;Cool Facts&quot; in the app store. </p>
<p>I&#39;ll take any advice, pointers, etc. I&#39;ve been at a loss for days working on little &quot;tests&quot; to figure this out.</p>

							<p>I had a similar problem.</p>
<p>My first approach would be to create all windows up front (30 in my case), but that caused serious performance problems - Already at ten windows I would notice a performance degradation.</p>
<p>The solution was to have only two windows and update their contents instead. In my case all windows very a like, the only difference where a label, an image and a soundfile. So I stored the data in arrays and updated each window with the corresponding data. Works great!</p>
<p>Just keep a counter so you now where in the array you are and the direction you&#39;re taking.</p>

							<p>HI Ryan</p>
<p>Have you tried the kitchen Sink example scroll_views_scrollable.js?  this should do it nicely I would have thought.</p>
<p>Good luck</p>
