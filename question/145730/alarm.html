							<p>I believe that the LocalNotification is the only way you can guarantee that something will happen at a specific time.  On iOS, you can never guarantee that your app&#39;s code will be running at some arbitrary time in the future.  The user could background your app, the user could exit your app, the screen could time out, etc.  Even if you use a &quot;background service&quot;, you can only run for about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>So you have to use an OS-level mechanism to trigger some action at a future time.  The LocalNotification provides that mechanism.  Even if your app is completely shut down, the notification you scheduled will fire, and the user interface provides a means for the user to get right back into your application.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure why you would want to suppress the notification portion and only play a sound.  Maybe it&#39;s an aesthetic issue, or maybe you have a very unusual use case.</p>
<p>BTW – if you want to build your app for android, you&#39;ll have to take a very different approach.  I have a lot of discussion of this topic in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;smorgasbork.com&#x2F;component&#x2F;content&#x2F;article&#x2F;38-titanium-mobile&#x2F;139-building-a-ti-mobile-app-grilltime-part-3">this article</a>.</p>

							<p>Hi Dharmik, i think you can use the background services for this purpose, and when your app is in background mode then you can try what you want… but that is possible in background mode, not when app is killed?</p>

										<p><p>Keep in mind that your background service will only run for a maximum of about 10 minutes.  So if you need an alarm to go off in 4 hours, you cannot depend on this mechanism.</p>

										<p><p>thanks for pointing this here, but background services are stopped in 10 min,when you don&#39;t do anything with this.<br>to run Background Services for longer time, we have to do some processing in this in less than 10 min or so.</p>

										<p><p>I do not believe that running code will extend the 10 minutes.  From the Titanium docs:</p>
<p><strong>Background Service Limitations</strong></p>
<p>A background service is subject to limitations imposed by the operating system, such as</p>
<ul>
<li>The OS limits the total amount of time a background service can run for after the application is paused, typically to no more than 10 minutes.</li>
<li>The OS may terminate the background service at any point to reclaim resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bottom line is this: even if you are right and you can keep extending the 10-minute window by doing more processing, the second point says that &quot;the OS may terminate the background service at any point&quot;.  So if the app&#39;s objective is to fire an alarm at some specific time in the future, there is no guarantee that a background service will still be running at that point in time.</p>

										<p><p>yes i agree with this, that OS may terminate the background service at any point of time in case OS needs some resources. so there is no guaranty for alarm.</p>
<p>thats a rare case, but yes may happen and background services may gets killed.</p>
