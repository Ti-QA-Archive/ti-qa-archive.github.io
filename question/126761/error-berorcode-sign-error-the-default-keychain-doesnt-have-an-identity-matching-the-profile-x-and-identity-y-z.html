			<h1>[ERROR] [BEROR]Code Sign error: The default keychain doesn&#39;t have an identity matching the profile X and identity Y (Z)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello, I am currently trying to get my application to run on an iPhone device. It works in the simulator, and on my Android device. </p>
<p>Here is the error I am getting when I choose Run on iOS Device from Titanium Studio:</p>
<p>[ERROR] [BEROR]Code Sign error: The default keychain doesn&#39;t have an identity matching the profile &#39;XXX&#39; and identity &#39;iPhone Developer: YYY (ZZZ)&#39;<br>[ERROR]<br>[ERROR] Error: Traceback (most recent call last):</p>
<p>I have signed up as an iOS developer, and have created iPhone Developer and iPhone Distribution certificates. I downloaded the .mobileprovision file as well. </p>
<p>Using these files, I can successfully get a hello world app running Xcode.<br>I thought that if I got something running on the device from Xcode, then the certificates would be correct, and should work on Titanium as well. However, It just will not get past that error message posted above. Are there any Titanium configurations I need to look at?</p>
<p>My initial thought was that the login keychain might not be default, but going into Keychain access, Preferences, First Aid, there is a checkbox in &quot;set login keychain as default&quot;.</p>
<p>Any ideas on where I should look to find the problem?</p>
<p>System info from Xcode:<br>  Version:    4.1 (4B110)<br>  Location:    &#x2F;Developer<br>  Applications:<br>  Xcode:    4.1 (516)<br>  Instruments:    4.1 (4138)<br>  Dashcode:    3.0.2 (336)<br>  SDKs:<br>  Mac OS X:<br>  10.6:    (10J567)<br>  10.7:    (11A511a)<br>  iPhone OS:<br>  4.3:    (8H7)<br>  iPhone Simulator:<br>  4.3:    (8H7)</p>

							<p>I think I found the problem! In Titanium, I had selected my downloaded Distribution Provisioning Profile file instead of my Development Provisioning Profile. </p>
<p>After downloading the development provisioning profile and selecting it after clicking Run on iOS Device, I was able to finish compilation, and the app appeared in iTunes. Now to get the app over to my phone..</p>

							<p>I wanted to update these answers because I keep getting caught by this as well - if you&#39;re using a distribution profile such as AdHoc, you need to use the Package Build command or Distribute for Apple App Store. This will create the ipa archive and sign correctly. You can then share the ipa and drop into iTunes. If you&#39;re just using dev certs then use the regular Run&#x2F;Debug commands.</p>

							<p>I was having the exact same problem, so what I did was to open the project in XCode, and select the option to run on iOS Device.  That worked fine, so then I selected Product &gt; Build for &gt; Testing.  After not seeing anything in iTunes, I finally noticed that my app was installed on a secondary window, and seems to be running fine.  I still don&#39;t know what the problem is with Titanium, but this workaround seems to do it.  </p>
<p>HTH, Mark</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, Mark! Opening the .xcodeproj file in Xcode allowed me to run it on the device using Xcode. However, I would much prefer to just run it directly on the device from Titanium Studio. Is there any way to get it running without resorting to manually opening it in Xcode?</p>

										<p><p>I was also getting this error, which isn&#39;t entirely helpful… So I opened the generated .xcodeproj and tried running it from there. Another failure, but a more helpful error message: Xcode was confused about a duplicate certificate in another folder: &#x2F;Users&#x2F;starpause&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Adobe&#x2F;AIR&#x2F;ELS&#x2F;com.adobe.amp.4875E02D9FB21EE389F73B8D1702B320485DF8CE.1 which I believe was around from doing AIR for iOS development. After I got rid of that I was able to build in Titanium Studio.</p>
<p>Lesson: if you do have the generated .xcodeproj, try opening&#x2F;running it and you may get a more helpful error message than what you see in Titanium Studio.</p>
