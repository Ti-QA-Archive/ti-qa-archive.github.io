		<section>
			<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>In this <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;1447121">Gist</a> you&#39;ll find a basic structure for an iOS tab bar app. My app will have 2 tab groups, one for the login part and one for the rest of the app.</p>
<p>If you copy paste the code in a new app, with the right folder structure (&#x2F;modules, &#x2F;modules&#x2F;ui are the folders for core.js and UI stuff), and run it you&#39;ll notice that the tabBarHidden: true property of the Window is not working, also the window has no title, and the label inside the window&#39;s views isn&#39;t showing up. Does anybody have an idea why?</p>
<p>Also does anybody have an idea about what design pattern to follow?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

							<div><p>I found the problem. It&#39;s in TabGroup.js, line 11: it should be tabGroup.addTab(tab). It makes me crazy :) So, coming back to my question about design patterns, does anybody have a good idea how to best make use of two tab groups, one for login (tabBarHidden: true) and one for the rest of the app? Or is there a way of using only one tabGroup?</p>

							<p>Hum..</p>
<p>I am just getting to grips with commonJS but I am wondering why your app isn&#39;t working as well. </p>
<p>Good ? on the suggested design pattern hopefully somebody will answer that.</p>
<p>The difference I have between your app is I require the file into a variable. as opposed to just requiring it.</p>
<p>so var mainApp = require(&#39;core&#39;);</p>
<p>then I would access the function in core by mainApp.firstFunction(); etc</p>
<p>I am not having any issue like you are.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>T..</p>

										<p><p>Requiring the core module in the global scope wouldn&#39;t make it hard release from memory by the GC? I am also thinking of using parasithic inheritance. Can I require a module within several modules? My app uses web services and that&#39;s my datasource.</p>
