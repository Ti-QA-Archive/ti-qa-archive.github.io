<p>It&#39;s good practice to include the Google and Titanium SDK versions when posting a question, because it can make a big difference to the answers.</p>
<p>This issue is related to setting the title attribute of lightweight windows at creation, and ticket <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32238-titanium-mobile&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;2361">#2361</a> has been opened to address it.</p>
<p>Until it&#39;s fixed, you can either make the window heavyweight, by using a modal attribute like <code>navBarHidden:false</code> or create the window and set the property afterwards, such as:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> win1</span> = Ti.UI.createWindow({
    backgroundColor: <span class="hljs-string">"red"</span>,
    exitOnClose: <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
});
win1.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>();
win1.title = <span class="hljs-string">"This is the window title"</span>;
</code></pre><p>Hope this helps</p>

							<p>Hal &amp; Stefan,<br>It is not as simple as that.<br>Many items (such as the &#39;missing&#39; window title, or even worse, missing button events) cannot be solved out of &quot;kitchensink&quot;. The &#39;title&#39; is a property that is documented, but seems (Android) not to work in all occasions. How should a beginner know what a lightweight window is ? Who cares that a &#39;ticket&#39; has been opened ? How should a beginner even know what a &#39;ticket&#39; is ?  </p>
<p>Unless you want appcelerator titanium to be a tool of try and error these basic functions should simply - work. On all platforms. </p>
<p>regards<br>rudolf </p>

										<p><p>Well, I agree that it simply should work. However, during the 20 years I&#39;ve spent in the software industry, this is rarely the case. There will always be bugs, the point is to keep them minimal and identify them as soon as possible.<br>My answer regarding the KitchenSink is simply because me, as a rookie, always start to check if it works in the KitchenSink. But no, of course the KitchenSink won&#39;t solve everything, it is however a good place to start when looking for errors.</p>

										<p><p>If you don&#39;t have the ability to at least check what the concept of a support ticket or a lightweight window might involve for yourself, then IMO you&#39;re not going to get far in the world of development.</p>

										<p><p>Um, Rudolf (r_b), your statements are so off the mark, compared with the way I think,  that I don&#39;t know quite how to respond or where to begin.  :-&#x2F;</p>
<p>I love programming. I particularly love open source programming projects (frameworks, tools etc), which is why I have been involved with numerous of them over many years.</p>
<p>While the “open” in “open source” does not, in the literal sense, mean that it is open to everyone, the consequential nature of the “source” being “open” is that anyone can use the software if they choose. For good projects, this often leads to a much greater sense of community, and certainly greater than traditional proprietary software.</p>
<p>With open source, I love the way that anyone can get involved, as a user or a hacker and regardless of their experience, and there is often someone around to lend a hand or discuss an issue in case of difficulty. Thus, there is always the opportunity to learn, not least for me. In fact, in my view, the willingness to learn, overcome difficulties and share knowledge should be an absolute pre-requisite to a person&#39;s involvement in open source projects.</p>
<p>Programming is not equivalent to creating a Word or Excel document. It&#39;s not a simple gadget like a smartphone. It is not an Operating System, which has the primary objective of being as intuitive to the layman as possible. Software development is an advanced subject, and therefore the programmer will need to develop the skill and knowledge in his&#x2F;her chosen language and environment in order to master it. I speak with some experience that this process will usually take time, unless you are some kind of guru&#x2F;protégé (and I have met very few genuine ones of those in my time).</p>
<p>However, one of the ways that a person can hone their skills in the quickest time is by being involved in the community and helping others when they are able. It is my view that you only really know a subject when you can explain it, which is why I help so much in the Q&amp;A.</p>
<ul>
<li>How should a beginner know what a lightweight window is?</li>
<li>Who cares that a &#39;ticket&#39; has been opened?</li>
<li>How should a beginner even know what a &#39;ticket&#39; is?</li>
</ul>
<p>I would staunchly defend any person&#39;s right, and choice, to be involved in any open source programming project that I work with, whether they be a guru or a complete novice.  That said, I would urge anyone who asks questions like those above to consider carefully whether software development and involvement in open source projects is truly for them, because they seem to imply that <em>the fundamentals</em> are not understood.</p>
<p>…and, yes, searching tickets is, without doubt, one of the <strong>most important</strong> of these fundamentals.</p>
<p>If you are still committed, despite the fact that you are aware that there will undoubtedly be difficulties that you will need to negotiate, just like with any programming language, then I think that&#39;s fantastic!  One way that you can become a master of the environment is by adopting the methodologies explained in the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;contribute.html">Contribute to Titanium</a> guide. This will not only benefit yourself but also greatly help others.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

							<p>hi! You should declare a label and then add to your window for example:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var titleLabel = Titanium.UI.createLabel({
<span class="hljs-label">    color:</span><span class="hljs-string">'#000'</span>,
<span class="hljs-label">    height:</span><span class="hljs-number">18</span>,
<span class="hljs-label">    width:</span><span class="hljs-number">210</span>,
<span class="hljs-label">    top:</span><span class="hljs-number">10</span>,
<span class="hljs-label">    text:</span><span class="hljs-string">''</span>,
<span class="hljs-label">    textAlign:</span><span class="hljs-string">'center'</span>,
<span class="hljs-label">    font:</span>{<span class="hljs-string">fontFamily:</span><span class="hljs-string">'Trebuchet MS'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">fontSize:</span><span class="hljs-number">10</span>,<span class="hljs-string">fontWeight:</span><span class="hljs-string">'bold'</span>},
<span class="hljs-label">    shadowColor:</span><span class="hljs-string">'#eee'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">shadowOffset:</span>{<span class="hljs-string">x:</span><span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-string">y:</span><span class="hljs-number">1</span>}
});

<span class="hljs-comment">// associate label to title</span>
win1.setTitleControl(titleLabel)
</code></pre><p>hope it helps</p>

							<p>For me the following works perfect:</p>
<p>var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({<br>    backgroundColor:&#39;#738678&#39;,<br>    exitOnClose: true,<br>    navBarHidden: true<br>});<br>win.setTitle(&#39;New Title&#39;);<br>win.setNavBarHidden(false);</p>

							<p>Hi,<br>Yes it does for me. The answer to this and all &quot;basic&quot; questions will be &quot;take a look at Kitchensink&quot;. It might be a boring answer but the truth is, Kitchensink is the ultimate resource to get started.</p>
<p>Take a look http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;doc&#x2F;kitchensink</p>
