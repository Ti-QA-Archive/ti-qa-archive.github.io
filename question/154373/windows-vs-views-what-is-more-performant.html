			<h1>Windows vs Views, what is more performant?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Is more performant to create &quot;n&quot; windows or windows with &quot;n&quot; view that overlap?</p>
<p>For example, in a list of news that the tap opens the detail with the text of the news, you should create two separate windows or windows with a single view containing the list of news and another view that contains the details of the news?</p>

							<div><p>Hello,</p>
<p>If you can, try to create views, since they are lighter. If you can reuse stuff, is better. </p>
<p>My window management pattern:</p>
<p>Window 1: icons with actions<br>once you click on the icon<br>create new window (window2) on the flight, with functionality. Once the user is done with this window, either after back  button in android or close button in iOS, recursively destroy all contents of window2, and the window2. </p>
<p>Please check <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;mauropm&#x2F;5225308">this</a> code. </p>
<p>Best,</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>If you are creating an app that has a list of things in a table and then the user selects one of those things and a whole screen full of information appears, I would create a second window to handle the extra data and show it.</p>
<p>Basically a master &gt; detail approach.</p>
<p>You have not specified if you are target Android or iOS, but each has its own way of handling the user wanting to move backwards from one window to the previous one - this is normal with windows but not with views.</p>

										<p><p>Indeed. I&#39;d be a little POd on Android if you showed me a view, i hit the back button (normal behavior) and the window closed instead of just swapping the views.</p>

										<p><p>Agreed with Malcolm and Stephen. Performance is often the most important part of user experience, but it shouldn&#39;t be at the cost of intuitive design.</p>

							<p>I would always use a view where possible. Also, you cannot add a window to a view, so that&#39;s worth bearing in mind</p>
