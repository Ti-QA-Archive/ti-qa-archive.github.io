							<p>Hi</p>
<p>More importantly - why do you not want one?</p>
<p>It is designed to provide perceived progress on slower devices.  I suppose one way to make it look like there is no splash screen is to provide black images.</p>
<p>But again - what is the use case of not wanting one?</p>

										<p><p>yes you are right , but as i saw in previews posts if i want to modify the splash screen i have to change the images inside the application , is there any way that i can control the splash screen layout ? for example adding loading spinner or more images etc</p>

										<p><p>I also would avoid splash screens and I completely understand why developers want to remove it. And here is why:</p>
<p>From the Android Design Guidelines you&#39;ll get the advice not to use splash screens. I also remember <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=pEGWcMTxs3I">this talk</a> from the Android Design guys where they explicitly declaring splash-screens as an UX <strong>anti pattern</strong>.</p>
<p>Splash screens are actually iOS specific but also Apple advices in their <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;ios&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;userexperience&#x2F;conceptual&#x2F;MobileHIG&#x2F;StartingStopping.html#&#x2F;&#x2F;apple_ref&#x2F;doc&#x2F;uid&#x2F;TP40006556-CH52-SW1">iOS UI guidelines</a> <em>&quot;As much as possible, avoid displaying a splash screen or other startup experience. It’s best when users can begin using your app immediately.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The problem I see with splash screens is that developers use it to load too much stuff in the background. Why can&#39;t I just get into the app? It is not a problem if the app needs to load content and stuff but it should be able to show me the basic UI without a 5 seconds splash screen gap. This gives users the impression of a bad performance of your app.</p>
<p>So, in general, the answer to this question is that it is unfortunately not possible in Titanium to remove the splash-screen. On iOS it is part of the App, on Android it is imitated within the launch activity to initialize the &quot;titanium stuff&quot; and you can not change it (for now) or I should better say that I didn&#39;t accomplish it.</p>

										<p><p>@Manuel; I agree on both points - the problem is more complicated though;</p>
<ul>
<li>New users have no concept of how to create apps that load fast and then later load things as they need them.  This is not an insult against new users;<ul>
<li>simply they have yet to learn how to create an actual app</li>
<li>when they have learnt how to create an app - it is likely to be made up of many sections of code they have taken from various places to solve problems they have yet to fully grasp.</li>
<li>when they have worked out how everything they use works they then need to work out how to improve every part</li>
<li>when that is learnt they then need to learn how to structure an app so only those things that are truly required are called - everything is included only when absolutely needed (this is not solved by using CommonJS)</li>
<li>this means the fundamentals of creating an app that can start in such a short time that not having the starting point of a splash screen is next to impossible</li>
<li>until you have all that experience of course.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Android apps start more slowly<ul>
<li>NOT all the time - but generally</li>
<li>this is annoying</li>
<li>not all Android devices are fast high performance things that could load an app in less than 1-1.5 seconds even if all the above were done</li>
<li>I suspect this is partly due to the required JavaScript stub used to bridge the gap between Android and Titanium</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My answer was given to those who develop apps but have;</p>
<ul>
<li>not yet experienced everything they can in order to make their apps so perfect that they could start so fast</li>
<li>to those who should know better and do not focus on the speed - simply the functions</li>
<li>for developers that have to complete an app so fast - they own best hopes are cut short by the necessity of the schedule. </li>
</ul>
<p>To the remaining 1-3% of developers - they know what to do.</p>

										<p><p>The splash screen used by Titanium is a static image, whilst Android itself does support a structured splash screen - this is not yet available for Titanium.</p>
<p>For those who do not know - the structured splash screen (forgotten its correct name) allows the developer to create several sections and image images and text within each. Each section can be anchored to a fixed location or offset.  This is used to counter the device ratio and size complexities and shear number of variations.</p>
<p>However you can achieve similar results with path 9 splash screens.  I wrote a post about it a while ago;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tidev.io&#x2F;2014&#x2F;02&#x2F;12&#x2F;android-splash-screens-using-9-patch-images&#x2F;">Android Splash Screens – Using 9-Patch Images</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Splash screens do not provide any interaction ability - they show they they go.</p>
