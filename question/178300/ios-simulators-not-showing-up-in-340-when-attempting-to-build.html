			<h1>iOS Simulators not showing up in 3.4.0 when attempting to build</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I&#39;m tearing my hair out here tying to get Studio 3.4.0 to pick up my iOS 8 (or iOS 7) simulators.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve deleted and reinstalled both Studio and XCode 6.0.1 and the projects that were launching previously no longer let me open these apps in the simulator.</p>
<p>This is the console error I get.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-string">[ERROR]</span> :  Invalid <span class="hljs-string">"--device-id"</span> value <span class="hljs-string">"iPhone Retina (4 inch)"</span>
</code></pre><p>I&#39;ve tried loads of different devices, none of which work. Interestingly, the previous devices that were in the list that referenced iOS 8 are missing as well.</p>
<p>Anyone know what I can do to remedy this?</p>
<p>I am using OSX Yosemite GM2 if that makes a difference!</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
<p>Simon</p>

							<p>In Titanium 3.3.0 you could specify the name of a simulator using <code>--device-id</code>, but in Titanium SDK 3.4.0 iOS Simulators are selected using their UDID.</p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t until late in the development cycle did we realize this would break backwards compatibility. We figured people were using <code>--sim-type</code>, <code>--sim-version</code>, <code>--retina</code>, <code>--tall</code>, and <code>--sim-64bit</code> to select an iOS Simulator.</p>
<p>If you are using the latest 3.4.0 Studio + CLI + SDK, you should be fine. You will want to:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">ti</span> <span class="hljs-tag">sdk</span> <span class="hljs-tag">select</span> 3<span class="hljs-class">.4</span><span class="hljs-class">.0</span><span class="hljs-class">.GA</span>
</code></pre><p>If you are building a 3.3.0.GA iOS app from the CLI, it&#39;s probably best to pass in <code>--sdk 3.3.0.GA</code> to bypass 3.4.0.GA from forking the correct 3.3.0.GA build. This is exactly what Studio does which avoids forking. <code>--sdk ver</code> sets the SDK version used to parse the tiapp.xml and determine the real Titanium SDK version to build with. All you&#39;re doing is preemptively choosing the correct one.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve removed 3.3.0.GA already, where would I go to reinstall that?</p>
<p>I&#39;m not actually using the CLI for building, I only really dipped into that to try and troubleshoot these SDK issues.</p>

										<p><p>@Simon, reinstalling 3.3.0.GA is a piece of cake. Just run:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">ti</span> <span class="hljs-tag">sdk</span> <span class="hljs-tag">install</span> 3<span class="hljs-class">.3</span><span class="hljs-class">.0</span><span class="hljs-class">.GA</span>
</code></pre><p>We should take another look at this and see about patching handling legacy simulator names for <code>--device-id</code>. FWIW, we do have it on the radar to add a <code>--device</code> option where you can specify the name, but that&#39;s probably not happening anytime soon. :(</p>

										<p><p>Chris,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve done a clean install of Titanium Studio, re-installed SDK 3.3.0.GA and 3.4.0.GA and neither are letting me build in iOS8 simulators.</p>
<p>Is there anything else I can try?</p>
<p>My install on my iMac runs fine with no issues (it&#39;s even an older machine).</p>
<p>I&#39;m completely flummoxed now, and this is meant to be my main development machine, at the moment it is completely unusable :(</p>

										<p><p>@Simon, can you please run <code>ti info -t ios</code>, copy the output into a <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;</a> and link to it in a response? Perhaps there&#39;s a clue as to what could be wrong.</p>

										<p><p>@Chris, i found the problem myself!</p>
<p>It was due to XCode losing the connection to the Simulators somehow. I had to manually re-add them all and they magically came back and I could build iOS 8 apps again.</p>
<p>So, looks like a corrupt install or bad backup that caused the issue.</p>
<p>Sorry to send you on a wild goose chase!</p>
<p>Appreciate all your efforts in helping me diagnose this issue.</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve tried everything I can think of to get this working and still no joy.</p>
<p>Weirdly, my iMac works great, just my MacBook Air seems to have got confused somewhere along the line and I can&#39;t get it fixed at all.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot of an error I get in Terminal if I use the CLI tools to check the SDK.</p>
<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;SimonHume&#x2F;status&#x2F;520521997374488576">Screenshot on Twitter</a></p>
<p>Almost like it knows the SDK is there but it can&#39;t assign it.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried to reinstall Titanium Studio and all SDK&#39;s, but nothing seems have worked :(</p>

							<p>I had this same problem because I before used a beta version of Studio and resolved giving this terminal command: &quot;titanium sdk select stable&quot;.</p>
<p>Try it.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Simon,</p>
<p>Tried that, sadly it still doesn&#39;t show me the iOS 8 simulators in Studio.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t understand it, my iMac is running fine, just this pesky MacBook Air having issues.</p>

							<p>Ok, so a bit more digging and I finally found the problem.</p>
<p>My version of XCode had somehow completely removed all of its Simulators.</p>
<p>I manually added them back in, and I can now build for iOS 8 simulated devices again!</p>

							<p>Try running the command:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-title">ti</span> sdk
</code></pre><p>Now check whether any SDK has been selected or not. If no then run the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-title">ti</span> sdk <span class="hljs-built_in">select</span>
</code></pre><p>Then from the list of supported SDK, select the one which you need. Then restart Studio and give it a try.</p>
