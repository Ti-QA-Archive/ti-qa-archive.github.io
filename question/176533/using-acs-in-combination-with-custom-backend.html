			<h1>Using ACS in combination with custom backend</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi there. Just dipped my toes into titanium water, and loving it thus far! I realise that ACS has features that would allow developers to create their own backend for their app, but I  would like to know if it&#39;s possible to use ACS in conjunction with an already-developed backend?</p>
<p>We had initially developed our backend in ASP.NET MVC (with WebAPI 2) about 2 months back. There are some specific workflows that we had to implement, but for certain features such as Chat and Push Notifications we fell a bit short in rolling our own. My question is: can we leverage ACS in this regard, and also store chat sessions in our backend database?</p>
<p>I look forward to your replies. Thanks in advance!</p>

							<p>We have mixed and matched BaaS systems with client APIs before.  Have integrated ACS push with them specifically. Have also used ACS push with Parse data (don&#39;t ask, we aren&#39;t always in control of the client wishes)</p>
<p>As to chat, have never used it.</p>
