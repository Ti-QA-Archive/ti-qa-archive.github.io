			<h1>Ad Hoc Provisioning Profile on Apple</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I want to create an Add Hoc Provissioning Profile to distribute my app to my clients. But it asks me to specify all the devices. Can I give the app and the profile to someone even if i have not included their device in the profile ?</p>
<p>On the Apple&#39;s developer site says that selecting a device is optional.</p>

							<p>You must always specify the devices to include in an adhoc build.  This is to prevent you from just creating an App outside of App Store and distributing it yourself.  Note you can only distribute to up to 100 devices in one year</p>

										<p><p>thanks for the reply, but how can i add someone else&#39;s device in my profile. it&#39;s their device.</p>
<p>So this means that you should connect with your pc&#x2F;mac every device that should use your application. Add them to your developer profile and then create the add hoc profile ? :(</p>

										<p><p>no you dont… the application sends an e-mail to the user, IF the user opens the email on the device and follows the directions, it will send the device id to testflight for you</p>

							<p>@Eni,</p>
<p>Have them plug their device into iTunes, click once on the Serial Number (it changes to the device id), and have them copy and paste it.</p>
<p>Then go into the Apple provisioning section and add their device.  You&#39;l have to regenerate the profile I believe and then they can drag and drop the app or use TestFlight to install it.</p>

							<p>Send your users here for some instructions on how to get their device UDID.</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.innerfence.com&#x2F;howto&#x2F;find-iphone-unique-device-identifier-udid</p>
<p>Then you add that device at Apple here : </p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;manage&#x2F;provisioningprofiles&#x2F;index.action</p>
<p>After downloading, you will then need to install the new one and reselect the new certificate in Ti Developer &#x2F; Studio before rebuilding and sending your test the new applicationName.ipa file  (which has the provisioning built in)</p>
