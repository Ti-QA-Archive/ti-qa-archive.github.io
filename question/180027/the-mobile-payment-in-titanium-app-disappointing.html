			<h1>The mobile payment in Titanium app: disappointing?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Mobile payment is increasingly important. Stripe, Paymill, Braintree and others offer well adapted to mobile solutions, but unfortunately no modules for Titanium. We can of course use a webView, but it is much less convenient. For example, Stripe now offers Apple Pay for payment: the customer places his fingerprint on the button and the payment is instantly accepted.</p>
<p>it is disappointing that Titanium does not integrate module for mobile payment. It is important now.</p>

							<div><p>-1 for <em>&quot;it is disappointing that Titanium does not integrate module for mobile payment&quot;</em> - you are a developer - so develop.</p>
<p>The main topic was not bad, phrased as a question it would have been good.  Something like;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;Does anyone know of any modules available for; Stripe, Paymill or Braintree as I do not have the time to use their APIs myself at the moment.&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Adding extras like; </p>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;I am developing for {insert platform(s)} and using Ti SDK {insert version number} on my {insert desktop operating system name} which has {insert OS version} installed.&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Would have made it a great question.</p>
<p>We are here to help you, if you are not prepared to help yourself or decide that someone or something else is to blame before you have had any chance to determine any outcome - then help is rarely given.</p>

<p>Titanium has a very nice module development function that allows you to take the time you spent complaining and wrapping a 3rd party sdk to use in your app.</p>

										<p><p>To add to the perfectly written and well motivated answer here;</p>
<p>I have had stripe integration in my apps for 18 months.  I did not know this module actually existed.  I do not use a webView. I use the API that stripe provides developers to integrate stripe with third-party solutions.</p>
<p>The world of hoping that the core of Titanium has to have built in functionality or somebody (usually a socially driven third-party) has done that part of the job (often your job) for you.</p>
<p>As noted by Stephen; you can create your own modules to do whatever you want.  This is a <strong>major</strong> benefit of Titanium - you get to extend it when you need something not already available.</p>
<p>If you want TouchID - use the module that is already provided.</p>
<p>So by all means come back and ask if something is available - you gained that answer and good tips.  But do not blame Appcelerator because you chose not to do your work for yourself.  As I said I have a fully integrated stripe payment system in several of my apps, each connecting to the native API and none using the webView.  So there is and was nothing holding you back doing the same.</p>
<p>If the other services have equally well documented APIs such as stripe provides - then you are more than ready to add these services to your app.  If they do not you have three choices;</p>
<ul>
<li>Wait until the provider creates a module</li>
<li>Hope a third-party can gain sufficient access to provide a module</li>
<li>Use a different provider</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to moan that the free software you use does not give you everything you want when you want it; despite you having the tools necessary to provide it for yourself - then leave that rhetoric at home please.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Malcom,</p>
<p>I&#39;m looking into adding Stripe to my app. You refer to integrating stripe via the API, could you elaborate on what method you used as a starting point for my development.</p>

										<p><p>Hi</p>
<p>I just used the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;api?lang=curl#intro">Stripe.com curl API documentation</a> to create the required processes - obviously charging charges is the most important.  But as curl and the xhr (httpClient) object are almost identical logical syntaxes - it was a quick swap out.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Malcolm,</p>
<p>Resurrecting this thread as I wanted to ask you a question about getting card tokens?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve not had any success with it Here&#39;s my code that I think is a translation of the cURL command to httpclient</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;api&#x2F;curl#create_card_token</p>
<p>The cURL command works, the code below doesn&#39;t and Stripe don&#39;t provide any data to help work out why</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// Tokenise credit card</span>
exports.tokeniseCard = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(cardData, callback)</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> STRIPE_URL = <span class="hljs-string">"https://api.stripe.com/v1/tokens"</span>;
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> STRIPE_TOKEN = <span class="hljs-string">"sk_test_token:"</span>;
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> xhr = Ti.Network.createHTTPClient({
        onload : <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{
            <span class="hljs-keyword">callback</span>(<span class="hljs-literal">false</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>);
        },
        onerror : <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{
            <span class="hljs-keyword">callback</span>(<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>, e);
        }
    });

    xhr.username = STRIPE_TOKEN;
    xhr.withCredentials = <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>;

    xhr.open(<span class="hljs-string">"POST"</span>, STRIPE_URL);
    xhr.send(cardData);
};
</code></pre><p>Any feedback appreciated</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
