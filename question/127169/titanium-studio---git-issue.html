			<h1>Titanium Studio - Git Issue</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Not sure what happened, but I hope someone has a solution.  My problem is that a git process created by Titanium Studio either hangs or uses a high amount of resources.  The hang or resources usage can be re-produced by editing&#x2F;saving a file within the Studio.  When inspecting the git process spawned by the Studio, it seems to be recursively looking through random directories.  </p>
<p>Any thoughts ?  I&#39;ve turned of the git integration, but still see the process getting created on every save.</p>

							<div><p>I can&#39;t say exactly, but I did start noticing the issue after the 1.7.3.  I thought it was due to the fact I had too many projects in my workspace.  I ran a few tests with a new project and the problem still exists.  I&#39;ve since reset most of the settings(I thought I made a change I didn&#39;t remember), so I would get the default behavior, but I&#39;m still seeing the issue.  I assume it&#39;s something with the Studio and how it interacts with Git, but I am at a loss on how to fix it. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve done the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reset Settings</li>
<li>Turned off Automatically Build</li>
<li>Disabled Git</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>Thanks. Okay, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to have been a Studio update that changed it, since this build is from August. It&#39;s also almost impossible the SDK update caused it to happen. Anything else that might have changed on your system recently? How many projects do you have in your workspace?</p>

							<p>Thanks everyone for your time.  I&#39;ve fixed the issue, but would like to know if the functionality can be changed.  </p>
<p>Issue:<br>I have a large repository with untracked files.  The git process was processing the root most repository.  Sorry to waste everyones time, but appreciate the help.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Travis…great to hear. We did do some work with this kind of situation in coming updates (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;APSTUD-3517 seems similar to your situation). You will see that as part of Titanium Studio 1.0.7. We&#39;ll post links to the beta for that here soon: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;preview.appcelerator.com&#x2F;studio&#x2F;.</p>
