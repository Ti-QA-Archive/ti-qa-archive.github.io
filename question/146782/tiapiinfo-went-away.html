			<p>Somewhere there must be a setting or a way to suppress logging via Ti.API.info since it has stopped totally for me sometime today. It outputs to the console fine until it says: &quot;Application should be running.&quot; At that point, the app runs but no more messages in the console. I have twiddled every console and debug setting I can find to no avail. Stranger, alerts no longer open either so I am flying blind. </p>
<p>System:</p>
<p>MobileSDK &#x2F; Android emulator<br>Ubuntu 10.04<br>SDK 3.0.0GA<br>Currrent Android SDK&#39;s (tried 3 different versions)</p>
<p>This is a new app just started from one of the stock templates.</p>
<p>Non-functional code at top of app.js:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Ti.API.<span class="hljs-keyword">info</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Running Now'</span> );
alert(<span class="hljs-string">'Running Now'</span>);
</code></pre><p>This does not generate errors or any output either, making life difficult. Other code changes seem to work fine. How to get this back? </p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I noticed this the other day running on a Mac and running iOS and Android apps.</p>
<p>Back now though, nothing changed, I didn&#39;t un-install or re-install anything, I changed no settings - before or after.  I felt your pain.</p>
<p>I ended up (stupid as it sounds) adding a label to each window (last object so on top) I was testing and then updating it sparingly.</p>
<p>I tried Project &gt; Clean, did not appear to resolve it, but the following day and today - back to working again.</p>
<p>Weird - very weird, figured it was my setup, obviously not given you have the same.</p>
<p>Obviously my mac has been off and then back on since, it is set to re-start everything back as it was before shutdown - so my start-up routine was not involved as it essentially returned back to the previous state.</p>
<p>So this is not not so much an answer and more of, I feel your pain.  Try re-booting (if you have not already) and&#x2F;or hope that you get it back the same as I did the following day.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, I&#39;ve cleaned, tried different versions of every component, restarted Titanium, fastdev vs no fastdev, but no luck. I tried launching kitchensink and it seems to be the same. </p>
<p>Now, I got it fixed, and it wasn&#39;t cursing loudly or throwing things that worked. What I think did it, was going through run configurations, killing emulators, changing emulators, and then changing back.  That seems to have rectified things. Or maybe it was cursing loudly, who knows. </p>
<p>Thanks for the co-misery. I am never sure if I go 2 steps forward 1 step back, or 1 step forward 2 steps back ;-)</p>

										<p><p>It gets worse.  The on again&#x2F;off again is not just in TiStudio, but happens on device as well.</p>
<p>Cant debug GPS or Camera problems without logging.</p>
<p>Ti.API.error was working for a while though!</p>

										<p><p>I spoke too soon. The Ti.API.info() is indeed back to normal, but calling alert() now, shows up as info like:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[<span class="hljs-link_label">INFO</span>][<span class="hljs-link_reference">ALERT   (  631)</span>] (KrollRuntimeThread) [32,2849] Online: true
</code></pre><p>There is no ui based popup at all. Could this be a setting somewhere?</p>
