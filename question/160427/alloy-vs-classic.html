<p>I might have a different thought on this.</p>
<p>Alloy: This is an MVC framework for developing Titanium Applications. It gives you a fixed way of coding, enabling you to separate easily the View, Format, Data and Logic easily. </p>
<p>It forces you to work in a specific way in code structure as most MVC frameworks do. Now the real bonus of Alloy is it is not an extra layer like most MVC frameworks, it is precompiled, which as already said takes the code down to the commonJS (Classic) code before compiling it into an application. The way it does this, really gives you well performing code and a lot of best practices have been applied to ensure efficiency.</p>
<p>BUT:</p>
<p>As you build your application you will need to apply commonJS modules, you will also need to be able to understand and implement commonJS methodologies, especially when handling models.</p>
<p>If you are starting a new project, or are new to Titanium, then Alloy is probably the way to go, as it will help you greatly. Be aware though you will still have the learning curve of commonJS.</p>
<p>If you currently have a commonJS project, then you will need to decide if the time and effort involved in converting it to Alloy has any benefits going forward.</p>
<p>commonJS (Classic) is not going anywhere and without it Alloy would not work, it is the fundamental architecture of Titanium.</p>
<p>Your Choice:</p>
<p>At the end of the day it is down to your personal choice, and your requirements, Do NOT use Alloy for the sake of using Alloy, also Do NOT exclude using Alloy because it might be the latest fad. Alloy is stable and really good to use.</p>
<p>You need to apply good practice in evaluating, which is best for your purposes.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

							<p>Alloy is off course mvc and better approach but Alloy has little bit of long curve of learning so if you think that you could handle mvc code then definitely go for alloy</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>Alloy is much better than Classic to produce the interface and manage styles for the different platforms and device sizes and you can still write classic code within Alloy projects and include native modules. In addition you can build&#x2F;share widgets between projects saving even more time on development.</p>
<p>Alloy code is converted to classic code in the pre-compile phase but it is converted to code that Appcelerator consider the best way to write code for their platform. That said there is very little difference in &quot;compile&quot; time.</p>
<p>Just for information, I am converting all our projects to Alloy where time permits.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
