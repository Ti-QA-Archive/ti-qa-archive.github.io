			<h1>integrating ads iOS</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a couple questions as I am starting to integrate ads into an iOS app.</p>
<p>Here is my understanding of iAds and admob ads, please correct me if I am wrong. The ads aren&#39;t going to pull in much revenue. BUT they do offer an annoyance that could justify upgrading to a paid version of the app. The problem is, I can&#39;t seem to make them annoying. As I know so far, I can ad a 320x50 advertisement on the screen on any of my windows, but in order for the app to be usable, I need to design my UI around that view. Besides the simple act of seeing the ad, this isn&#39;t really going to annoy anyone. They dont need to minimize the ad to view their content or play with the app, they just need to ignore it!</p>
<p>Now, everything I see these days on the app store has these randomly popping up fullscreen ads that you HAVE to click out of in order to continue app use. This drives people to pay for the premium ad-less version. Do we have the ability to create these? Are they really random or are do they need to be associated with some &quot;action&quot; taking place?</p>
<p>Or, is it possible to have an ad that covers up the tab bar, and you need to click out of it to use the tab bar, and a little while later a new ad will pop up.</p>
<p>Is this a bad idea? I would love to hear some input on how people are using the ads in their app. What is in place of your ad when it DOESNT show, surely not just a white space! Do you find that it could be beneficial to annoy your free users so they are compelled to pay for an ad-less version? Are you making any money at all on these ads?</p>
<p>Feedback would be great, as always, thank you for it!</p>
