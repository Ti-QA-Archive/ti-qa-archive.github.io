			<h1>ListView Calculated Row Heigth on iOS</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>So I have a ListView which is dynamically added to on view initialization through JS code.  I have the templates in the view XML.</p>
<p>Everything works great on Android, the ListView&#39;s row heights are calculated automatically using a height property of Ti.UI.SIZE.  However, on iOS there is no such luck.  I have looked into the forums for other answers, but there doesn&#39;t seem to be an ideal solution.</p>
<p>I am wondering if anyone has come up with a solution for this?  I tried upgrading my Titanium SDK and Alloy to the latest beta versions to see if that would resolve the issues since they had the newest ListView spec.  All this accomplished was nuking my Titanium Studio to no longer work with Android and iOS.  I had to literally uninstall everything and reinstall to get working again.</p>
<p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

							<div><p>In the GA-version this a known bug. On iOS you cannot work with dynamic height of list items. On Android this is not a problem. Perhaps it is fixed in new version 3.2.*</p>

							<div><p>This is a shame.  Unfortunately, I cannot use a fixed row height on iOS because the data it pulls in is dynamically generated from the web. :(  I suppose I will try and come up with another solution while using listviews.</p>
