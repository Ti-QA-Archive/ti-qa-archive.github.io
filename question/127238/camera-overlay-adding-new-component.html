			<h1>Camera Overlay Adding new component</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am creating a camera view with an overlay.</p>
<p>SDK 1.7.3 Studio latest build for Android and IOS. on Mac Lion</p>
<p>OK so on Android it puts it in Portrait mode (can live with that for now).</p>
<p>On IOS, I get the display as I expect… except that it won&#39;t render components with % as their height and width. (Is this a bug or a feature).</p>
<p>The main issue is that I want to add a new component. A popup box which is just a view. I add it to the overlay after the camera has been displayed and after the initial overlay has been put on..</p>
<p>Adding this works on Android, but on IOS it goes through the code but does not display it, have been going through this for hours now, I have set zIndex incase it is behind but it just doesn&#39;t display.</p>
<p>I have modified the code to create the component before opening the camera view and it is there, but I need to be able to add the component to the overlay view.</p>
<p>Hope this explains it.</p>
<p>T..</p>

							<p>And so it appears after working with the guys at appcelerator that due to Apple restrictions when you create your overlay you have to have everything already on the overlay. You cannot add new components to the overlay.</p>
<p>Interestingly you can on Android.</p>
<p>My fix was to recode and use show and hide of the components, then destroy the overlay at hide camera.</p>
<p>Hope this helps someone else.</p>
