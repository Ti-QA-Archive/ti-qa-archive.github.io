			<p>Are there any plans to reintroduce a monthly subscription option or perhaps create a new lower priority response model at a more affordable rate ?</p>
<p>The product is great but the support cost is prohibitive, at the current rate i&#39;m sure it wont be long before some enterprising individuals set up an alternative support channel and start filtering off those of us willing to pay for some extra help, but not yet generating enough income from our development efforts to justify the expense of the annual pro subscription.</p>
<p>If you would like to see appcelerator make an option like this available and would subscribe to it, please leave a comment below so they can gauge the level of interest from the community.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

							<div><p>I would welcome such an option. I, too, love the product but can&#39;t justify the $2000&#x2F;year expense. It would also be great to have the option of buying the add-on modules individually.</p>

							<div><p>$2,000 a year to start using Appcelerator as a developer is just too expensive, when we have other expenses as a developer already.  Saying that, having no support whatsoever is daunting.  Something needs to be done to introduce a lower priority support service for Indie subscribers who are paying $50 a month</p>
