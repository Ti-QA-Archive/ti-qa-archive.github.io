							<p>Until about a month and a half ago I worked for Appc, and we stated many times that Ti.include was going to be removed… </p>
<p>Before that happens though you will get warnings in the console that the next major release will be removing the feature… frankly I think it&#39;s months away if even that soon but thats just my opinion, I have no solid info on a timeline.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you for that answer :)</p>
<p>I kinda disagree with that decision, could you outline what the rationale behind it is?</p>

										<p><p>basically its a matter of falling in line with other projects like CommonJS… also it makes for better memory management on the platform side</p>

										<p><p>Well, one could argue that you then have to include … ups … require third-party libs all the time and that maintenance would suffer in that respect. </p>
<p>One could tie such libs into a single global and pass that global with every require, but that goes against the point of commonJS. I don&#39;t think that commonJS was meant as a way to supply or implement an architechture. I think it was meant as a way to implement fully independent modules, and that this objective is going to be polluted because you really only have one choice if you want to split your code across several files (which you should always do).</p>
<p>You&#39;ll end up writing a lot of modules that are only fit for reuse within a very rigid context, and that&#39;s not the point of commonJS</p>
<p>If you&#39;d like, I&#39;d love to hear counterarguments to this?</p>

										<p><p>Wow!!  I knew that we were supposed to move to the CommonJS model, but I have a larger app that is 80% done and would be in big trouble if INCLUDE went away, at this point.  Granted, I could stop pulling updates but I don&#39;t want to do that …</p>

										<p><p>@Software Services Honestly once you fully &quot;get&quot; CommonJS it&#39;s easy… I have ported some VERY large projects to CommonJS in just a couple days.</p>
<p>It takes longer to do it &quot;right&quot; but in just a couple days you can port to CommonJS then refine it slowly</p>

										<p><p>I have to agree with Matt. commonJS is the way forward. Moving from an namespace include to commonJS is fairly straight forward. but to do 100% right does take some time.</p>

										<p><p>@Matt: sorry for the late response.</p>
<p>Well one of the things you do all the time is mixin&#39; objects. I like to use underscore.js for this. </p>
<p>Without Ti.Include, I&#39;ll have to make a lot of modules that aren&#39;t really modules, because there is no way they can work outside my app, and I have to rewrite underscore.js so that I can append it to a global object. This object will have to be an argument to all my require calls.</p>
<p>Either that, or I&#39;ll have to start each module (which isn&#39;t really a module) with a series of require statements, meaning I&#39;ll be requiring underscore.js (and date.js and .. and …) over and over again.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t understand the rationale behind this decision, but maybe there&#39;s something I simply fail to realise?</p>
