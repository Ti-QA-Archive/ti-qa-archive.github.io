<p>Have you successfully launched a default app, to confirm that your environment is configured correctly?</p>
<p>What platform are you targetting?</p>
<p>You will need to ensure that you are building it using the same Titanium SDK as you did originally, to be confident that your app will be supported. If some time has passed since you last worked on it, you may have to modify the project to ensure that it is correctly using the latest API.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

							<p>I&#39;m using Mac OSX lion. How can I check what SDK is installed in Studio. Also how can I debug the code to check if old API is not supporting new API?</p>

										<p><p>Yes, it sounds like your environment is not setup correctly. Would you go through the Desktop quick start at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Quick+Start">Quick Start</a>, and let me know if it helps.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

										<p><p>I assumed that you were developing for mobile originally, as you did not state it in your question. Make sure that Titanium Studio has all the available updates installed, including the SDKs.</p>
