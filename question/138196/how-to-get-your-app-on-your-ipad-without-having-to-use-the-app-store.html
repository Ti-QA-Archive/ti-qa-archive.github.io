			<h1>How to get your App on your iPad without Having to use the APP Store!</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Is there a way to get your APP on your iPad and distribute it without using the app store?</p>
<p>I submitted my app and got rejected, they said the the interface wasn&#39;t good enough and I was like, I have seen some shitty apps in the App store and they think mine is bad.</p>
<p>But you know I kinda expected it from them so I am not to bummed, but my client does need his app to give out to their students so if any one knows of any service that can do this please let me know asap!</p>
<p>You guys rock!</p>
<p>P.S. Does Apple think that every Developer has to be a Great Developer?</p>
<p>I know I am new to this but Big things have Small beginnings.</p>

							<p>Aside from using the App Store, there are 3 ways to install an app:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jail break device and you can install anything (so I&#39;m told; never done it)</li>
<li>Ad hoc distribution of up to 100 devices (UDID of each device must be provisioned with Apple)</li>
<li>Enterprise distribution profile</li>
</ul>
<p>Assuming you don&#39;t want to need each device to be jail broken, that leaves ad hoc development profiles and enterprise profiles.  Places like www.testflightapp.com greatly simplify doing ad hoc installs.  Just be aware that you cannot do over 100 devices this way.</p>
<p>Apple also has an Enterprise license for qualifying companies for the purpose of &quot;in-house&quot; distribution.  Originally the company needed to have over 500 employees (or maybe 250?) but they relaxed that restriction nearly two years ago.  The company needs to apply to Apple, pay a $299 annual fee, have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet listing for the company, and get the Enterprise application approved by Apple.  That took a client of mine a few weeks to get approval.  But now their apps can get installed over the air from downloading from the company web server, for their employees nationwide.  See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;programs&#x2F;ios&#x2F;enterprise&#x2F;">this</a> link.</p>
<p>Your client must be the one to apply and sign the legal forms required.</p>
