<p>Would you please state your target platform, whether your code is in the app.js file, and would you also provide a working script that demonstrates the issue?</p>
<p>Then I&#39;ll be happy to help  :)</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>i did a demo app to demonstrate the problem. The focus event works on iPHONE but not on ANDROID.  I have it zipped up, but I don&#39;t know where to send it. perhaps you have a place for it?</p>

<p>There may well be a bug with this, so I have updated an closed ticket with some simple code to demonstrate the issue.  If you and I haven&#39;t made some glaring error, and the bug is confirmed, I imagine that a new ticket will need to be raised. In the meantime watch  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32238-titanium-mobile&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;727">#727</a> to keep track of it. </p>
<p>Do you think you can work around the issue in some other way? If you need help, I will need to see some code to understand what you are trying to achieve.</p>
<p>Not the answer you probably want, but I hope it is useful to some degree.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t gone through <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;search&#x2F;window%20focus">this list</a> exhaustively, so if you spot a solution or workaround that I&#39;ve missed, then please let us know.</p>

										<p><p>The only ANDROID workaround I can think of at the moment is to add a timer event that refreshes the screen. I have not tried it out yet.  Option B would be some kind of picker like what the iPHONE has. But I dont see any pickers on the KS.</p>

							<p>I put together some demo code illustrating the problem that I am having on ANDROID.<br>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;675571</p>
<p>I am using the Ti.SDK 1.4.2   ANDROID SDK 2.2  iPhone:4.1</p>
