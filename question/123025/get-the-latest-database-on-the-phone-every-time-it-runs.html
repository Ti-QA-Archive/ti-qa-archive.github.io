		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>Anyone know why this happens&#x2F;how to stop it?  I have an app which uses a database, everytime the app runs I do the following:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">db</span> = null;
try
{
  <span class="hljs-keyword">db</span> = Titanium.Database.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>('mydb');
  <span class="hljs-keyword">db</span>.remove();
}
catch (<span class="hljs-keyword">e</span>) { }

<span class="hljs-keyword">db</span> = Titanium.Database.install('mydb.sqlite', 'mydb');
<span class="hljs-keyword">db</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">close</span>();
</code></pre><p>As far as I&#39;m aware this should make sure that the database installed on the phone is the latest everytime I run it.  This way I can make changes to the database, then run the app and see those changes… however…</p>
<p>When I do this, and run the app, I still see the old database records.  If I then stop the app and try it again (for a second time) I see the new data!?</p>
<p>Not sure how this works on an actual device, but in the simulator this is what happens.</p>
<p>Chain of events…</p>
<ol>
<li>Make changes to my database.</li>
<li>Run app.</li>
<li>Still see old data.</li>
<li>Stop app.</li>
<li>Run app.</li>
<li>Voila! New data!</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyone know how to get my app to use the latest database everytime?</p>

							<p>With all due respect to PD, this &quot;run a second time to get new database&quot; is a known bug&#x2F;feature that we&#39;ve observed on both iPhone simulator and devices for months.  If it is a bug, it is in Titanium code. You can find references to it in other Q&amp;A posts. </p>
<p>The only way around it that I&#39;ve seen documented is to CHANGE the name of the database every time you update it.  Otherwise, the first time you run, you get the last database and the second time you get the new database.</p>
<p>And the reason this is important and you can&#39;t just wave a JSON wand and make it go away is that when you do an Application Update through the App Store, you may want to update a Read Only database with new reference data.  Yes, it would be nice IF you could get your user to delete the old version of the application FIRST, but that don&#39;t happen in real life.  If you don&#39;t want this weirdness to happen to your users, you have to rename the database in the update so it absolutely, positively won&#39;t use the old database when it is run the first time.</p>
<p>I also thought I was going crazy at least half a dozen times while observing bizarre Titanium behavior that other people said doesn&#39;t happen - you just get have to get used to it.  They just say it doesn&#39;t happen because they haven&#39;t seen it happen which is not the same.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your comments, makes a change for someone to read my post and answer accurately :)</p>
<p>I&#39;d already come to the conclusion that I was right, and it <em>was</em> a Titanium bug. I&#39;ve been doing exactly what you&#39;ve recommended (i.e. renaming the database every time I release to the app store).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve pretty much given up on these forums, you either never get an answer, or you get people saying that the problem might be in in your code, when it quite clearly isn&#39;t.</p>

							<p>The likely culprit is that you are not forcing a full rebuild.  To save time, Titanium takes an &quot;incremental&quot; approach when relaunching in the simulator.  </p>
<p>If using Ti Studio, use menu Project &gt; Clean.  If using Ti Developer, go to the Edit tab and hit the Save button (if even you do not make changes).</p>
<p>When you force a clean, full build it must update the copy of the database which had been placed in the build&#39;s resources folder.</p>

										<p><p>If what you say is true, it makes no sense that it works the second time I run it.  Surely?</p>
<p>The second time I run it there would be no changes AT ALL to my code, so why does it refresh my database then?</p>

										<p><p>When you say you &quot;run the app&quot;, are you (re)launching it from within the simulator, using Ti Developer&#39;s Run Emulator, Ti Studio Run, or Ti Studio Debug?  On the second run, do you do it the same way?  Do you ever shut the simulator down?</p>
<p>If using Ti Studio, set a breakpoint on the db.remove() and make sure the code is stopping there on your first run.  It almost sounds like you are somehow just resuming an already running instance.</p>
<p>If the simulator, you could also do a menu Simulator &gt; Reset Content and Settings prior to launching your app.  This would force the simulator to flush out any data from a previous (or suspended) application run.</p>

<p>As I can see, you are reinstalling old database from sqlite file. I don&#39;t see the point in that.</p>

<p>Installing a new database prior to every database operation is likely to create a very bad user experience. Unless I have misunderstood your intentions, the only reason I can think of why this is necessary is to compensate for a weak application&#x2F;webservice design model.</p>
<p>If your data source changes very frequently, simply query the server with each operation. The recommended format for the webservice is JSON.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you wish to make the data available when the user is offline, then cache the results in the local database.</p>
<p>Is it possible for you to restructure your product in this way?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t install the database everytime I perform an operation, only when the app starts up.  After that I simply call Titanium.Data.open(…) and query the returned object.  And besides, the point is that even if I did install the database on every operation, it doesn&#39;t work, I only ever see the old database until I stop the app and start again.</p>
<p>This doesn&#39;t make sense according to the documentation. Calling .remove() on a database is apparently destructive and can&#39;t be undone, but it seems I can still acccess the information in that deleted database even after deleting it, until the app is stopped and restarted!</p>
