			<h1>Pausing Execution</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>&lt;pre&gt;<br>The question is kind of theoretical. My titanium application goes into catch block  when the web service is called. When i debugged the server code, i observed that the else condition gets executed in the javascript 4-5 steps before the XML gets        generated and returned at the server end. That means the client application doesn&#39;t wait   for the server application to complete its process and return the xml file   which will be used at client end. </p>
<p>So here&#39;s my question - Is there a way to stop the execution at client end for      sometime until the code at server end completes its execution and sends the xml fileto the client side which can then be utilized by the code at client end. I hope i&#39;ve explained the scenario if not then please let me know if you need more inputs.<br>What i&#39;ve thought is, if i can pause the execution at client end until the xml file is generated and returned back to the client from the server and then let the client end code execute further where it can utilize the xml file. That should solve the  problem.</p>
<p>Any other ways of tackling this problem is welcome. Thanks for taking your time to read this post. I really appreciate it.<br>&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;</p>

							<p>If you are using the HttpClient then the response from an http request is always asynchronous.  You can pass in a callback function that accepts the response data when the request is complete.</p>
