			<h1>NavigationWindow modal slide up animation missing</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I am obviously missing something.  I am trying to open a modal window (in a navigation window) from another navigation window and I am missing the slide up animation.  Slide down seems to be here, although rather fast.  I am sure it&#39;s supposed to work and I would like to see if anyone can tell the problem from the sample code below before I go and try to fake it.</p>
<p>Before the code, here is my environment:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">Mac</span> <span class="hljs-tag">OS</span> <span class="hljs-tag">X</span> 10<span class="hljs-class">.8</span><span class="hljs-class">.5</span>, <span class="hljs-tag">Node</span><span class="hljs-class">.js</span> <span class="hljs-tag">Version</span>  0<span class="hljs-class">.10</span><span class="hljs-class">.13</span>

<span class="hljs-tag">Titanium</span> <span class="hljs-tag">CLI</span> 3<span class="hljs-class">.2</span><span class="hljs-class">.3</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">SDK</span> 3<span class="hljs-class">.2</span><span class="hljs-class">.2</span><span class="hljs-class">.GA</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">iOS7</span><span class="hljs-class">.1</span> (<span class="hljs-tag">reproductible</span> <span class="hljs-tag">with</span> <span class="hljs-tag">iOS6</span><span class="hljs-class">.1</span>) <span class="hljs-tag">both</span> <span class="hljs-tag">in</span> <span class="hljs-tag">simulator</span> <span class="hljs-tag">and</span> <span class="hljs-tag">device</span>
</code></pre><p>Here is a quick and dirty sample to reproduce</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> win2 = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
    layout: <span class="hljs-string">'composite'</span>,
    backgroundColor: <span class="hljs-string">'red'</span>
});
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> win1 = Titanium.UI.iOS.createNavigationWindow({
   <span class="hljs-built_in">window</span>: win2
});

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> win3 = Ti.UI.createWindow({
    barImage: <span class="hljs-string">'/images_final/test-logo-nav-bar-ios7.png'</span>,
    backgroundColor: <span class="hljs-string">'blue'</span>
});
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> win4 = Ti.UI.iOS.createNavigationWindow({
   <span class="hljs-built_in">window</span>: win3,
   modal: <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
});

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> btn = Ti.UI.createButton({
    title: <span class="hljs-string">'click here'</span>
});

btn.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{ <span class="hljs-string">'use strict'</span>;
    win4.open({
        animated: <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>,
        modalTransitionStyle: Ti.UI.iPhone.MODAL_TRANSITION_STYLE_COVER_VERTICAL
    });
});

win2.add(btn);

win1.open();
</code></pre><p>Thanks in advance for any help or hint.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Your sample code works perfectly for me and it also works with a simplified open.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A blue window sliding from the bottom to the top of the device - covering the previous red window</strong></li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// your code</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">win4</span><span class="hljs-class">.open</span>({
    <span class="hljs-attribute">animated</span>: true,
    <span class="hljs-attribute">modalTransitionStyle</span>: Ti.UI.iPhone.MODAL_TRANSITION_STYLE_COVER_VERTICAL
});
</code></pre><ul>
<li><strong>A blue window sliding from the bottom to the top of the device - covering the previous red window</strong></li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// this code does the same job as yours</span>
win4.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>();
</code></pre><p> <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.UI.iPhone-property-MODAL_TRANSITION_STYLE_COVER_VERTICAL">MODAL_TRANSITION_STYLE_COVER_VERTICAL</a> is the default action</p>
<p>Your statement below and your code appear to tell two different stories;</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Statement</strong></p>
<p><em>I am trying to open a modal window (in a navigation window) from another navigation window and I am missing the slide up animation.</em></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Code</strong></p>
<p>Opens a navigation window and then by pressing a button another navigation window set to modal is opened over the first navigation window (the two are not connected)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I just want to make sure that you know your the modal navigation window is not a child of the first one.</p>
<p>Are you sure your supplied test code fails to display the modal window by sliding up from the bottom of the device to cover the previous window?</p>

										<p><p>in proper thread, now.</p>
<p>Malcom,</p>
<p>could it be that you tested in 3.2.3.GA ? I just did so instead of 3.2.2.GA and NOW I see the slide up effect.  I had a quick look at the jira but found no relevant issue.</p>
<p>Unless you tell me it ought to work on 3.2.2.GA, I will move to 3.2.3.GA if I can.</p>

										<p><p>It is correct.</p>
<p>The animation lasts for around a third of a second at most, it is designed to be quick - enough to tell the user something has occurred and that occurrence is not only different to the opening of a window inside of a Navigation Window - but also falls into the same family as things like keyboards and option dialogs being displayed.</p>

										<p><p>Strange that it does not work in 3.2.2.GA SDK but I suppose bugs happen.<br>It seems that textarea focus in modal is different from 3.2.2.GA too (my keyboard now disappears at modal window open) but I will deal with this.</p>
<p>thanks again</p>

<p>Unless anything mentioned in the link below causes you any issues moving to a minor version bump is usually safe.  Not always though - so always check the release notes found on the first page of the documentation;</p>

<p>big changes - potentially internal rewrites and potentially a bit of rewriting to adapt on the developers side</p>

<p>small changes, mostly extra features that are isolated from other changes</p>
</li>
<li><p>.3 = Minor</p>
<p>bug fixes and any timely changes to allow for external forces in dependant SDKs, build processes, submission tweaks to app store</p>

										<p><p>Ok, you will probably hate me but I have to explain. It indeed works, as you said, in all 3.2.x SDKs.</p>
<p>What happened is that a few days ago, I added the workaround proposed inTIMOB-16597, in order to allow background colors with alpha to show the window underneath. </p>
<p>That single line added to TiRootViewController.m does enable transparency but also breaks the animation.</p>
<p>I had completely forgotten that I did that before and I wasn&#39;t using transparency in my test program.</p>
<p>So now, I have the choice between animation and transparency.  Should you have a bright idea, I would be grateful.  At least now, I know for sure what happened.</p>
<p>Very sorry for the wild goose chase.</p>

										<p><p>Not a problem at all, I enjoy helping those who genuinely deserve it - you are one of those.</p>
<p>Plus we have all done something similar. </p>

							<p>Hi Malcolm,</p>
<p>you are right, my description was unclear: the code is really what I want.  And I was aware of the defaults, just tried them out of desperation :(  </p>
<p>What I see is a blue window (with a navbar as expected) covering the red one.  But the animation (if any) is so fast that I can&#39;t see it :(  Can you tell me how long the animation appears to take ? On my simulator it looks instantaneous.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you tell me the code is correct, I will go with that.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help</p>
