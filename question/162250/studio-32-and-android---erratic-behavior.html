			<h1>Studio 3.2 and Android - erratic behavior</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<ul>
<li>app: android mobile</li>
<li>sdk: 3.2.GA</li>
<li>os: osx mavericks</li>
<li>studio Titanium Studio, build: 3.2.0.201312191547</li>
<li>output: Samsung Galaxy Tab 3</li>
</ul>
<p>I am having maddeningly frustrating introduction to the newly-released Studio 3.2. I can&#39;t get any work done. I&#39;ve been fighting bugs or config problems for two days.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the latest problem. The adb server loses its mind on an erratic basis. Sometimes, I can run my app from my connected Android device with no issue. Other times, the installer will hang at 57% completion and never finish the install. If I cancel the install and switch to the ios simulator, then try android again, it may or may not work. I try cleaning the project, then running. This is what I get:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in">ERROR</span>] :  Invalid <span class="hljs-string">"--device-id"</span> value <span class="hljs-string">"3230d091ac837025"</span>
[<span class="hljs-built_in">ERROR</span>] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process <span class="hljs-keyword">exit</span> value was <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
</code></pre><p>Well, duh. It&#39;s invalid because it&#39;s the wrong device ID. My connected device ID begins with a &quot;5&quot;. Where it&#39;s pulling that ID from, I have no idea. </p>
<ol>
<li>I&#39;ve stopped and started the adb server numerous times. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn&#39;t.</li>
<li>I&#39;ve uninstalled&#x2F;re-installed Studio numerous times. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn&#39;t.</li>
<li>I can&#39;t recognize any pattern to even begin submitting a bug for this.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#39;m at a loss as to how to proceed and I&#39;m wasting valuable time that could be billable (but isn&#39;t). Can anyone provide me any kind of guidance on resolving this? Is it a bug? I would be very surprised if I&#39;m the only one experiencing this issue, but I couldn&#39;t find any other posts about it.</p>
<p>Your attention and time is greatly appreciated.</p>

							<div><p>Nicely explained issues :).</p>
<p>However this might be one of those that without more information or seeing the system, we might not be able to solve.</p>
<p>Having said that, could you firstly, check your CLI version and if your using Alloy your alloy version. Next uninstall the application from the device, (Do you have two icons for the application on the device?). Then clean the build and build.</p>
<p>IF the problem exists could you post to paste bin the build log, and your Tiapp.xml.</p>

							<div><p>I looked at the build log. It was created before I upgraded. I deleted it and restarted Studio. My device appeared in the run config list again. I could also successfully build, but my build log didn&#39;t get recreated. So, don&#39;t know if that was a good idea or not. CLI&#x2F;Studio versions: <code>Titanium Command-Line Interface, CLI version 3.2.0, Titanium SDK version 3.2.0.GA</code> . Here is the paste for my <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;private&#x2F;ju4reaebqkiyp2agega">tiapp.xml</a>. As I was writing this, I tried running on the android device again. Again, the installer hung at 57%. Apparently, my success was short-lived.</p>

							<div><p>On a related note, I can run a 64-bit iPhone simulator from CLI like this <code>ti build --platform ios -F iphone -T simulator -Y iphone --retina --sim-64bit --tall</code> but I get an error <code>iOS SDK version 7.0 not found.</code> if I try to launch it from Studio.</p>

							<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>Can you please delete your previous run configurations.<br>Also it is advisable to use latest 3.2.1 RC version of studio and SDK. Please check out the links<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;preview.appcelerator.com&#x2F;studio&#x2F;<br>and<br>Please use SDK: 3.2.1.v20140203174850 from http:&#x2F;&#x2F;builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;index.html#3_2_X</p>
<p>Hope this should help.</p>

										<p><p>If your working on production release, using the latest 3.2.1.RC version, which came out last night is not always optional. IT is as it says a release candidate…</p>
