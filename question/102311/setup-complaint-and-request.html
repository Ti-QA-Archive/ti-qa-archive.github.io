			<p>This is a minor complaint. I can appreciate the simplistic interface, but there is something to be said for application settings. Specifically, defining paths. I have multiple versions of python installed on my windows box (ranging from 2.5 -&gt; 3.1). In this situation I don&#39;t want to define the default python to use globally. I find it more advantageous to call the full path to the exact version I want to use. Different software using different versions and testing version compatibility. </p>
<p>This is windows only, I&#39;m not a mac user but I understand that the default there is apple specific and that most python developers install the python.org version from macports for most development with python. <em>nix&#x2F;</em>bsd are another saner story. Anyways, your setup using environment variable approach is rather limiting and wants to break my configuration, it also complicates the install procedure. </p>
<p>As for java and ruby, I have only the latest java installed and that does the paths for me. Ruby I don&#39;t use. So I&#39;m not sure how others handle this with those.</p>
<p>It should work this way. Check if the user defined a specific version of [python|java|ruby] within titanium, if that&#39;s blank or invalid, search the path variable, if it&#39;s found then use that version, otherwise ask the user to specify one. This is 100% more user friendly than what you have now.</p>
<p>Then having to be connected to your system and logged in to develop with this system is rather idiotic. Desktop software should not require a network connection to be active &amp; logged into some remote server to use the software, unless the user specifically wants it or the software is meant to interact with an outside resource.</p>
<p>In this case the only time I should <em>have</em> to be logged in, is when I want to deploy an app or update the install. Otherwise an active login is not needed. </p>
<p>After 10 minutes of playing around with it, these are the two major issues I have with this system.</p>
<p>So my request is to add a couple things and remove one.</p>
<p>Add an ability to define the python&#x2F;java&#x2F;ruby interpreters within the application itself and keep the application from using environment variables.</p>
<p>When clicking &quot;log out&quot;, don&#39;t kill the app, let me log out of your servers and continue to develop. Depending on 100% connectivity is short-sighted. There are times when I like to develop but may not have an inet connection. Say like at the park, where there is no wifi access. </p>
<p>I don&#39;t need twitter feeds, news updates, etc.. all of the time and I should have local copies of the documentation. So when clicking logout, let the app continue to run. The last request is local copies of the documentation to be included with the app and the app use those. If I want, I can visit the site for documentation. </p>
