			<h1>Does Titanium.Network.HTTPClient implement connection pool?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all,<br>A general question.<br>We are building a titanium app that connects to the cloud.<br>In some data sync. phases, the app will do high frequency api calls, in order to prevent things to go wrong, it is necessary to manage number of CONCURRENT active connections.</p>
<p>Does Ti.Network.createHTTPClient() manages this? If not, is there some library can be used with titanium?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The <strong>httpClient</strong> library runs asynchronously by default so it can be used to call more than one simultaneous network call.  YOU will be responsible to manage the calls and the returns.  So some sort of internal queuing array would help you manage this.</p>
<p>I assume you are smart enough to have taken into account the inherent lack of guarantee that a usable connection will exists and your queue should account for this.  Additionally the users own data plan and connection speed will potentially cause issues that you need to plan for.</p>
<p>iOS has a couple of different background download calls, one for small and fast needs and another for larger single downloads.</p>
<p>As to a library this is one I have seen, although I have not used it myself;</p>

										<p><p>On iOS there is a queue implemented that will only allow 4 concurrent requests, but it won&#39;t remove the duplicates (the same request to the same url), it will only put it in the queue.</p>
<p>However this will change in the next SDK iteration as they changed the underlaying library and this will change to 5 per domain (as far as I understand). They will still be only queued, not made unique.</p>
<p>On Android I&#39;m not sure there is any limit imposed, you might wanna dig into the sources to find out but I don&#39;t remember to see anything.</p>
<p>So as Malcolm said, the best way is to implement your own stuff.<br>I&#39;d go with a priority queue with unique requests and no more than 3 low priority concurrent requests. This way you&#39;ll be able to make high priority requests whenever you need them (think you are aching images -  low priority and sending a message to another user - high priority)</p>

							<p>i just want to add some tests i done recently. i tried implementing parallel file download&quot; with progress &#x2F; cancellation on android. on cancellation of a specific download, i called abort on correspondent &quot;httpclient&quot;, i noticed that all downloads will stop…oncomplete event is fired for all downloads in same app, this was tested with version 3.2 of SDK.</p>

										<p><p>I can only assume that your tests used the same httpClient instance to run each parallel call.  When you called abort on this instance - it killed all pending calls - as they were all ties to the same instance.  Did you try creating more than one instance?</p>

							<p>Thanks for all the answers. Since I know little on native, I&#39;ll implement my own pool.</p>
<p>The reply from Ziad is a bad sign, could you provide some code examples? This would be a problem also in my side.</p>

										<p><p>Firstly you are welcome, secondly do not forget to mark an answer.</p>
<p>Quick tip; next time - please do not create a new answer when your contribution is actually a comment - it confuses things in the future when trying to work out relevance, simply add a comment to the answer it is related to, or if the additional information is a follow up to the question or general information then add it as a comment to your own question at the top.  You are NOT being told off.</p>
