			<p>I&#39;m currently toying around with the Blackberry Beta2 SDK, and I noticed that it only supports 5.0. Are there any plans to support lower versions, because I still have clients on devices as old as 4.5. Sad I know, but this is a requirement. </p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Chris</p>

							<p>We currently only support Blackberry OS 5. We are planning on supporting Blackberry OS 6 but the minimum we&#39;re planning to support is OS 5.</p>

							<p>As a developer who also does native Blackberry development (but not yet used Ti Blackberry SDK), I can tell you that it would be highly unlikely for them to support 4.x devices.  In fact, I&#39;m glad to hear they support 5.0 – I have tried asking a few times in the past the minimum supported version and nobody ever replied.  I feared it would be 6.0 as a minimum.</p>
<p>In 5.0, RIM added lots of stuff to the OS such ass SQLite and direct file I&#x2F;O which would make implementing Ti on the Blackberry much easier.  Not to mention tons better multimedia support.</p>
<p>I have some Blackberry clients still running 4.2, but am in the process of mothballing all 4.x clients at my current application software versions and saying all new features will only be available to OS5 or higher clients.  I just got to the point where was not willing to live with the OS 4.x restrictions anymore.  Anybody on one of them should be past carrier contract expiration dates, any should be able to get a better phone super cheap if they want to stay with BB.</p>
<p>For app testing purposes, I just picked up an OS5 phone on ebay for $25 and an OS6 phone for under $80 – I just test with WiFi to avoid monthly charges.  But my point is if a person didn&#39;t want to renew a term commitment with a carrier, there are still really cheap ways of moving to OS5 or better.</p>

										<p><p>Ah, I wish it were so. However, my &quot;clients&quot; are all internal users in our company, thus simply telling them to upgrade won&#39;t work. It&#39;s a matter of going through the red tape to get them upgraded. </p>
<p>I think I have a solution though, thinking about doing a hybrid app with Phonegap and either the Titanium Mobile Web Alpha (if it works in BB browser, probably not), or encapsulating the Titanium calls in custom functions and writing workaround code for generating HTML instead of the native UI code. BB 5 and above version, and people &lt; BB 5 can deal with the lousy web looking app. Best route I can think of.</p>

										<p><p>Do you have any idea how many OS4.x users you have left?  And how many of them could just do an OS upgrade on their device to OS5?  There are several phones released at OS4.x which are in fact upgradable to OS5.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll still &quot;support&quot; my OS4.x clients, but will no longer enhance my OS4.x code base with new features.  If I need to apply a fix, I will modify and recompile the archived projects again.</p>
