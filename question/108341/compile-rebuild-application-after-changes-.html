			<h1>Compile,. Rebuild application after changes ! </h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello everyone,<br>Im a smart phone developer who is in charge of testing out mobile x-plataform frameworks to see if they are usable and mature enough. </p>
<p>First things first , I installed titanium developer, tried out the sample application and now created a new project. </p>
<p>Runs ok. But after making some changes using my favorite IDE , i save the files and how do i force it to compile and rebuild the application !? It keeps showing me the previous build ! </p>
<p>Second,Is there any usable way to debug!?<br>Regards<br>Bruno</p>

							<p>I neglected to address the debug question.  The answer depends on how you define &quot;usable way to debug&quot;.</p>
<p>But if you are only evaluating frameworks now, be aware that the IDE&#x2F;debug situation will have a dramatic change shortly – I believe next month.  That is because Appcelerator bought Aptana as discussed in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;01&#x2F;appcelerator-acquires-leading-ide-aptana.html">this</a> blog and <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;01&#x2F;appcelerator-acquires-aptana.html">this</a> webinar.</p>
<p>You should review one or both to take under advisement during your research.  In the meantime, you may find <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;104391&#x2F;speeding-up-development-process">this</a> has some helpful suggestions.</p>

<p>But that didnt work .</p>
<p>I deleted the content of my build&#x2F;android folder. Saved changes . Launch it again … It actually says &quot;forcing a full rebuild&quot; but still the previous and first version is launched … .</p>
<p>Besides , is that really plausible in an development environment !? </p>
<p>How can someone launch a product trying to help developers that just makes things more hard to use ? </p>
<p>No useful debugger, environment always in need of weird tweaks to install &amp; run it. </p>
<p>Oh , every time i would make changes i would have to wait forever to actually see those changes , since launching the emulator takes minutes !</p>
<p>Really disappointed about all this approach by appcelerator.</p>

<p>Building for android is a bear compared to iOS, but that is due to how the android emulator works, not so much because of appcelerator.  For android, do NOT stop the emulator each time.  It takes WAY too long to restart.  Leave it running and just launch the new version.  It should copy to the emulator and start much faster – though still slower than iOS.</p>
<p>Others have reported they find skipping the emulator and just directly launching on a device to be the fastest method for Android.  YMMV.</p>
<p>But the bottom line here is most of the time delay when using the android emulator is the emulator itself – not appcelerator.</p>
<p>Personally, I find it much more productive to do most development&#x2F;debug&#x2F;test cycles under iOS then as features work there, just do minimal testing&#x2F;tweaking under android.</p>
<p>And that is coming from someone who never had osx before.  I picked up an old used macbook pro because I had to be able to build for the iphone.  Then I discovered that even with the machine being much slower than my Win7 machine, my debug cycles were sooo much faster I now to all my appcelerator stuff from it.</p>
<p>But again, I think the issue is not appcelerator – it is the speed (or lack of speed) of the android emulator from Google.</p>
<p>YMMV</p>

<p>Are you changing the files in the correct directory? All your coding should be done in files within the project <code>Resources</code> directory. The files in the <code>build&amp;#x2F;iphone</code> and <code>build&amp;#x2F;android</code> directories should not be manually modified although, indeed, sometimes these files do need to be deleted.</p>
<p>Sorry if this sounds obvious, but I haven&#39;t heard anyone with your issue before, so I thought it was better to make certain.  :)</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>If this is not the issue, post the code that you are changing (before and after the changes). Use pastebin if there is a lot of code.</p>
