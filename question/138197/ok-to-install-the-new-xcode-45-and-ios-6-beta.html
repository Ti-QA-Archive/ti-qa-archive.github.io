			<h1>OK to install the new Xcode 4.5 and iOS 6 beta?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I was looking at installing the new Xcode 4.5 beta alongside the current version. And possibly putting iO 6 on my device.</p>
<p>I know there is risk involved with any beta - but in theory is it ok to do this? Or will I no longer be able to develop with Titanium, or run my current Titanium apps on my device?</p>
<p>Has anyone tried? Recommendations?</p>

							<p>Naturally, you&#39;ll get zero support. Also, you&#39;re not even really allowed to talk about these things at all.</p>
<p>So, my advice is don&#39;t touch anything that might affect your workflow in developing apps. </p>
<p>After my last experience with a beta and how that screwed up a few things, I&#39;m not touching this until it&#39;s out of beta.</p>

										<p><p>+1 for matt, and an response to Josh:</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been on the giving and receiving end of NDAs for nearly 20 years.  Read your developer&#39;s agreement with Apple (actually, any agreement) very carefully.</p>
<p>And remember, you have more than one agreement with Apple.</p>
<p>I can talk to the guys in our own shop about beta products.  I can talk to a contractor with whom I have an NDA agreement with about beta products.  But you and I?  We have no legal agreement between us.</p>
<p>For others, if you cannot afford downtime in your shop, don&#39;t put beta on your production machines.</p>

							<p>I dont think the NDA with Apple applies to discussing getting xcode working, just the features itself.</p>
<p>That said, Apple says you can&#39;t use the Xcode 4.5 to even submit to the store, so I wouldnt install it yet.  You CAN install the beta on your phone, but then you&#39;ll have to use something like Testflight to actually get it, since Xcode wont recognize the device without the SDK.</p>

										<p><p>your incorrect…</p>
<p>Xcode downloads from 4.3+ have the SDK files located under xcode.app&#x2F;Contents&#x2F;Developer&#x2F;Platforms&#x2F;iPhoneOS.platform&#x2F;DeviceSupport&#x2F;&lt;versions&gt;<br>and<br>xcode.app&#x2F;Contents&#x2F;Developer&#x2F;Platforms&#x2F;iphonesimulator.platform&#x2F;Developer&#x2F;SDKs&#x2F;&lt;versions&gt;</p>
<p>and you could copy from the new Xcode to the old one… not saying you can do it now because of the NDA… but saying its worth checking if you can still do this ;)</p>
<p>Note: I would not do this to add support to a 3.x.x version of xcode</p>

							<p>I do think that talking about getting the new Xcode to work falls outside of the NDA, so I&#39;m sharing my solution. I needed to install Xcode 4.5, because I also needed to test Mountain Lion.</p>
<p>What in the end solved my problem was renaming Xcode45- to Xcode and running</p>
<p><code>sudo xcode-select -switch &amp;#x2F;Applications&amp;#x2F;Xcode.app&amp;#x2F;Contents&amp;#x2F;Developer&amp;#x2F;</code></p>
<p>The last part may or may not be necessary.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m a fear monger I guess… I haven&#39;t updated my computer to mountain lion, but I did update one test device to iOS6. My apps run but they crash on any table views…. I am nervous that when iOS6 is released my apps will just simply not work. I have&#39;t read anywhere about when Ti is going to update their SDK to work with Apples.  </p>
<p>Should I be worried that iOS6 will break everything. I wouldn&#39;t think it should because Apple makes their updated to be backwards compatible with older apps.</p>

										<p><p>I do a lot of both native and Ti based development and there are no changes that should be causing that issue… im guessing that you just have a bad install of iOS&lt;redacted&gt; or of the app, or maybe even a bad copy of the Ti SDK… that said there may be other bugs, but talking about these things in any detail violates the NDA you and everyone else signed so we cant really do that.</p>
<p>That said, dont worry too much, just plan on the week before the release MAYBE needing to make some small changes… I do that for native and Ti based apps as you dont want to fix &quot;bugs&quot; on a app that turn out to be bugs in the beta of iOS and having to undo your &quot;fix&quot;</p>

										<p><p>I figure they are just bugs in the beta… I&#39;m just new to Ti (and smartphone development in general) and wasn&#39;t sure how smoothly the upgrade process has happened in the past. How long between when Apple releases their final SDK to when the os actually gets released(generally)? It&#39;s got to be at least a week or two because the approval process takes that long or more usually.</p>

										<p><p>All that being said… I&#39;ve seen conflicting reports about even installing Mountain Lion with Ti 2.1.0. I am not a big fan of &quot;workarounds.&quot; It would be nice if on the blog Ti said something about when we can expect a release for Mountain Lion because everyone seems to be having issues with it. Am I wrong? Should I wait on upgrading my dev machine?</p>

							<p>I installed xcode 4.5 before I read this and keep in mind I am a programming newbie but they don&#39;t seem to jive well together. In the past I had Xcode 4.1 and when i hit RUN on appcelerator it would fire up the iPhone simulator but now it gives me an error that reads &quot;dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath&#x2F;DevToolsFoundation.framework&#x2F;Versions&#x2F;A&#x2F;DevToolsFoundation<br>  Referenced from: &#x2F;Applications&#x2F;Xcode.app&#x2F;Contents&#x2F;Developer&#x2F;Platforms&#x2F;iPhoneSimulator.platform&#x2F;Developer&#x2F;Library&#x2F;PrivateFrameworks&#x2F;iPhoneSimulatorRemoteClient.framework&#x2F;Versions&#x2F;A&#x2F;iPhoneSimulatorRemoteClient<br>  Reason: image not found&quot;</p>
<p>I cannot seem to figure out what the problem is - all I know is that before I installed Xcode 4.5 everything worked well…..</p>
