			<h1>Tabs on detail view, but not on list view</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve started using Titanium Mobile just today, and figuring things out with the Kitchen Sink application. I&#39;m not sure what the difference between windows and views is, and I really miss a nice tutorial, but so far so good.</p>
<p>However, I am trying to create a list with tabbed detail views and this is not going so great. I&#39;ve made a simple mockup of what I am trying to do here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bolhoed.net&#x2F;media&#x2F;mockup.pdf. Basically I want to create a list, where each item has a detail page. That detail page is split into 3 different tabs, and on each tab you should be able to go back to the list.</p>
<p>The first problem I have is that it seems I have to use a tabGroup on the list page with one tab, even though I don&#39;t want to show tabs there. If I don&#39;t use a tabGroup, the menu with the back button doesn&#39;t show. I can set the tabBarHidden property on the main window, so at least that one tab doesn&#39;t show.</p>
<p>However, on the detail page I do want to show 3 tabs. I&#39;ve tried creating another tabGroup with 3 tabs, and this works beautifully. Well, apart from the fact that the link back to the list view doesn&#39;t show, since this is a new tabGroup with no connection to the previous one.</p>
<p>So, I am struggling with this tabs&#x2F;view&#x2F;windows mess. It seems such a simple thing to do, and I am sure I am missing something here. Any help is greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>Kevin</p>

							<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Tabs should really be used as your main&#x2F;root navigation to various windows in your app. (you can then add views to these windows - imageViews, tableViews, etc.) - You can also hide the tabs if you need to - and even just have one tab and hide that, if you like. </p>
<p>So, you have your list (a tableView) and you want a user to click an entry and see more details.  Do this by firing an event from the tableView row click to open a new &#39;window&#39; (this will&#x2F;can slide in automatically from the right) - at this point, you can choose to hide the navigation tab if you like</p>
<p>Then, on your new window with information, you could create a &#39;window toolbar&#39;, which you can make work just like a tab, to give you the different bits of info you need to show. </p>
<p>Once you try a few tihing out, suddenly it will all make sense and the lightbulb will go off above your head, creating a tsunami of new ideas! :)</p>
<p>Best of luck! Don&#39;t give up! ;)</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve also zipped my resources folder with the code I have so far. Everything works, except that from the detail page you can&#39;t you back to the list page. If someone can look at the code (it&#39;s very simple) that would be great.</p>

							<p>I have tried using a TabbedBar on the detail page, but it seems a bit harder to get to work, compared to just normal tabs: it&#39;s not really clear to me how to switch the contents on the page to a different view. A TabbedBar is not mapped to windows like a TabGroup is.</p>
