			<h1>Book for Android Development</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I personally learn much better with a book and have been looking at the various options available on Amazon. Some of them seem pretty good except they are specifically tailored towards iPhone development.</p>
<p>I noticed a lot of resources on this website including tutorials, but there is an extremely large gap between &quot;Getting Started&quot; and &quot;Intermediate&quot;. The code included in the KitchenSink and others is great, but it is not commented enough to truly make sense of whats going on (from a beginners perspective).</p>
<p>A tutorial on how to build something like this would be great: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;codecanyon.net&#x2F;item&#x2F;bizapp-for-titanium&#x2F;140753</p>
<p>So anyways, if I&#39;m going to be doing 100% Android development, will any books be worth picking up? Or will it just end with frustration when the book does not properly explain what does not work in Android?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>I blog about titanium development, and I am also working on a book which should be out in the fall, but I am always looking for new appcelerator topics that people will find interest in.</p>
<p>I started blogging because I too felt that for some people, the Kitchen Sink was too overwhelming so I just provide small focused examples</p>
