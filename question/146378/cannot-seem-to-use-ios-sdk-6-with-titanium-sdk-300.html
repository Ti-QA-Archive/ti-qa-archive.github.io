			<h1>Cannot seem to use iOS SDK 6 with Titanium SDK 3.0.0</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have updated my xcode, to 4.5.2. This supposedly provides iOS6, but titanium just doesn&#39;t seem to be picking it up. OSX version is 10.7.5. At a loss as to what to do. Any advice?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>You have not said where you cannot use iOS 6; does not appear on a menu, your simulator does not show up with 6.0 option?  Can you provide a little more detail please.</p>
<p>Just in case though it may be that as you upgraded and you are more likely to have an existing project - you may simply not have swapped over the choice.</p>
<p>In the test drop down (same one you use to run in the simulator), use the bottom menu choice to change settings (no idea of actual caption - not near a dev machine).</p>
<p>From here use or select the iOS choices and there will be a drop down for iOS version, this may (on yours) have two options, with the current one being 5.0 or similar.  Change to 6.</p>
<p>If this does not show then Titanium does not know you have the new Xcode and you may need to convince it.</p>
<p>See how the setting change goes and report back.</p>

										<p><p>Have you had Xcode in a location other than the default?</p>
<p>Try this in terminal;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">sudo xcode-select -<span class="hljs-keyword">switch</span> <span class="hljs-regexp">/Applications/</span>Xcode.app<span class="hljs-regexp">/Contents/</span>Developer<span class="hljs-regexp">/</span>
</code></pre><p>This &quot;should&quot; convince your mac where the Xcode install is - provided it is in the same location as this sudo path.</p>
<p>Re-start studio afterwards and try again.</p>
