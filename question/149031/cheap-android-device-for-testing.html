							<p>I&#39;m with Dan, cheap is a very flexible concept, even for low profile android devices. The cheapest gadget for testing low profiles I&#39;ve found are those chinese unbranded phones you can find in several online shops. But also any second hand device, with a couple of years, maybe running android 2.2 could be a good option if you just want to ensure that your app will run in that kind of devices.</p>
<p>But depends if you want a cheap device because you want test in cheap phones or it is just a matter of budget.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;d say you could invest few bucks in a slightly better device. I tried to be somewhere at the middle, not to have the lowest device on the market, bit also not to have the best one. This way I&#39;m covering somehow the whole market (of course I&#39;m talking about performance not fragmentation ).<br>Also you might want to be able to upgrade the OS, this in case you don&#39;t want to buy another one in the next 6 months.<br>A very cheap device will also make you loose lots of hair due the slowness and reduced amount of memory :)</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I am not sure how much it is where you are, but the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;devices&#x2F;details?id=nexus_4_8gb&amp;feature=device-featured#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDIwMiwibnVsbC13ZWJfaG9tZV81MDAwMDA1X25leHVzVUtfZGV2aWNlc19HQl9fNTAwMDAwNV9uZXh1c1VLXzFfcHJvbW9fMTM2MTQ3MzM3MTQzNCJd">Google Nexus 4</a> is £239 in the UK without contract - which is very cheap.  This is a top of the range device and a middle budget cost.</p>
<p>Sometimes hard to get hold of, but stock seems good right now and I am very happy with mine.</p>

							<p>I basically want something that is popular in the market, but nothing fancy like the galaxy s3. I have a samsungn player and its ok, but its stuck at 2.2, no GPS, so it&#39;s hard to dev for. I don&#39;t care if its a phone or just a player, as long it&#39;s better than what I have and I don&#39;t need a contract to get one.</p>
