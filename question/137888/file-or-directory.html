			<p>With Ti Mobile 2.0.2 on Android, there is a reliable way to find out if a Ti.Filesystem.File object is a file or a directory?</p>
<p>For me, right now every object is reporting as a file and all have the getDirectoryListing function. Directories and files are all looking the same!</p>

							<p>Since you specifically mention Android, you can use the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.0&#x2F;index.html#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Filesystem.File-method-isDirectory">isDirectory()</a> method after getting a File object reference to the file.  Be aware that method does not (yet?) exist for iOS builds.  In that case, AFAIK the best you can do is try getDirectoryListing() on the object to see what gets returned.  The caveat is I am not sure if an empty folder will return a string array of zero elements, or a null.  You&#39;d have to experiment.</p>

										<p><p>Hi.</p>
<p>The problem is that, at least on the Android emulator, both, file and directory objects are returning false to the isDirectory() and true to the isFile().</p>
<p>Both objects have the getDirectoryListing() method too, but I did not tryed to call the method on both objects to see if it has any differences in behave. Gonna try it. Thank you.</p>

							<p>it says in the docs that getDirectoryListing() is supposed to return a string[] (array). it does not; it returns &quot;object&quot;. also, a file and empty directory are both &quot;objects&quot; with 0 length.</p>
<p>furthermore, i&#39;m not seeing any real difference in properties for a file vs a directory, so checking for a property may not be feasible either…</p>

							<p>The day I updated to Titanium 2.1.0.GA the isFile and isDirectory started to work right.<br>I got so happy and started to use it all over my app. I did a lot of tests and it was alright.<br>I turned off my Linux and go to sleep. Some days later I turned it on to come back to my app and found that isFile is always true and isDirectory is always false.<br>Nothing changed! I&#39;m freaking out here… don&#39;t know how to know if a object is a file or a directory and Appcelerator, as always, keep ignoring us, developers.<br>WTF?</p>

										<p><p>OK!!! Just found that was my fault this time. </p>
<p>So I can confirm that starting with 2.1.0.GA isFile and isDirectory methods are reporting right. </p>
<p>FYI I still don&#39;t like how Appcelerator ignores the Q&amp;A.</p>
