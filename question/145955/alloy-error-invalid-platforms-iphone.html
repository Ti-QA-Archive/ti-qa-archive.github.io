			<h1>Alloy: [ERROR] Invalid platforms: iphone</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>This is my first excursion into starting a project with alloy. I am in early stages of mobile apps targeting android and iphone. Alloy does not seem to recognize iphone, ipad, or ios as platforms (android and mobileweb work fine) on Ubuntu 10.04. All components are current as of yesterday. Exact errors:</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;m not seeing anything relevant to Alloy in the log. It looks like you are just trying to create a project with the new CLI. The <code>titanium</code> command represents the new CLI and is separate from Alloy. Perhaps one of our CLI gurus can help further.</p>

							<div><p>Hi Hal, you are using Ubuntu and thus iOS platform is supported and not installed..</p>
<p>which i can say from your command in terminal,</p>
<p><strong>titanium create –name=myapp –id=com.dbsinteractive.myapp –platform=android,iphone</strong></p>
<p>instead of this you should use,</p>
<p><strong>titanium create –name=myapp –id=com.dbsinteractive.myapp –platform=android</strong></p>

							<div><p>@Ashish Doh, you&#39;re totally right! I totally overlooked that Hal was using Ubuntu. Titanium SDK 3.0 on Ubuntu only supports Android and Mobile Web.</p>
<p>Maybe we should allow you to create projects for iOS on Linux, but you just wouldn&#39;t be able to build the app.</p>
<p>Just an FYI, the only thing that adding iOS does at project creation is set the &lt;deployment-targets&gt; in the tiapp.xml and copy some iOS splash screens into the Resources directory.</p>

							<div><p>Thanks, I fully realize I can&#39;t build an iphone app on Linux. </p>
<p>But that doesn&#39;t really address the core issue – using Ti to create apps for multiple platforms. I don&#39;t want separate codebases that are largely the same and then try to keep them in sync by copying files around. That makes no sense to me. I want one codebase for both, and then platform specific stuff can be handled conditionally.  I don&#39;t need to actually build iphone on Linux, but I want the code shared iPhone &lt;–&gt; Android , and then I do most of the coding on Linux.</p>

							<p>That&#39;s just creating the project (I am following the docs at http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Alloy_Framework). Next step is to run &#39;alloy new&#39; which seems to work:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Alloy by Appcelerator. The MVC app framework <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> Titanium.

[INFO] Installed <span class="hljs-string">"ti.physicalSizeCategory"</span> module to tiapp<span class="hljs-class">.xml</span>
[INFO] Installed <span class="hljs-string">"ti.alloy"</span> plugin to tiapp<span class="hljs-class">.xml</span>
[INFO] Deployed ti<span class="hljs-class">.alloy</span> compiler plugin to plugins/ti.alloy/plugin<span class="hljs-class">.py</span>
[INFO] Deployed ti<span class="hljs-class">.alloy</span> hooks to plugins/ti.alloy/hooks
[INFO] Generated new project at: app
</code></pre><p>I have no platform specific folders though (not even &#x2F;android), and am not sure that&#39;s expected behavior or not.</p>
<p>I could probably manually create the iphone folder, if there is nothing special that goes in there for a new project created in this manor. I realize I can&#39;t build an iphone app on Linux, but I would very much like the code to all be part of one project for maintainability&#39;s sake. </p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m going to bet its the simple fact that ios is not available on your OS that prevents you from building an app for it. TiStudio does the same thing.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, at this point in the process, I am not really building anything, I am creating a stub&#x2F;new project (using the Ti documentation). If its an empty folder, its no big deal. But if its something else … well, then I am curious.</p>

										<p><p>I guess nvm, the &#39;alloy compile&#39; command creates the iphone folder. The other folders are created too. Now, stuck on the &#39;alloy run&#39; command, which just spits out:</p>
<p>~~<br>[DEBUG] Invalid platform type: iphone<br>~~</p>
<p>But, the alloy installed app runs from Ti Studio as is, so I guess its OK, and either I am confusing the cli or it is confusing me.</p>

</code></pre><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <code>alloy run</code> will be deprecated soon in favor of using the new <code>titanium</code> CLI command to run apps. <code>alloy run</code> is not full featured and was added as a simple convenience to those testing apps with Alloy. Now that TiStudio integration is underway and the new CLI can run Alloy apps, there&#39;s no need to have yet another way to run alloy apps that deviates from the standard CLI&#39;s path.</p>
