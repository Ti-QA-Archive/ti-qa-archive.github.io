							<p>I don&#39;t see the point of Ti Desktop to be honest. Ti Mobile fills a gap in a big way, but I can&#39;t see why you wouldn&#39;t use any one of a number of more mature alternatives on the desktop.</p>
<p>IMO Titanium would do better to start on Windows Phone 7 support and drop Desktop.</p>

										<p><p>It does have a point to continue, and why you&#39;ve created Titanium Desktop if you just let it die, if they didn&#39;t do this framework&#x2F;wrapper in the first-place some of us here should have stayed in Adobe Air or maybe something else. If only adobe air is open sourced and we can remove sandbox-security bullsh!t, i wont be here or anyone, I hope you got the point.</p>

										<p><p>Because you can create great apps that are cross platform without even trying to hard. It has the potential to be a amazing product if a little effort was put into it.</p>

										<p><p>Agreed Bryce. It has the potential to be an amazing desktop development platform, but the lack of updates from the devs are troubling. The 1.1 update milestone for desktop is over a year old and there&#39;s been no news as to any future releases soon. I really hope they at least let us know where desktop is at and if possible update the docs with a lot more examples for others new to it. Mobile seems to be getting loads of attention!</p>

							<p>I think Titanium for Desktop is dead as they are not at all focusing on desktop. Look at the number of upgrades for mobile vs desktop. So, I would not bet on Titanium for desktop apps. I was a convert from adobe air to titanium but I would again convert back to air. Atleast Adobe has a good documentation. Titanium&#39;s documentation is atrocious for desktop.</p>

							<p>If running in an isolated sandbox is not good enough then QT is the way to go and not Air. QT is not just C++. You can do a lot with JavaScript too. QT on a desktop would be better than Titanium Desktop anyways given all these WebKit problems TI has…</p>

							<p>Right now the key to JavaScript driven QT application is QtWebKit. Nokia is also developing QtWebRuntime on top of that to make it even easier to html&#x2F;css&#x2F;javascript based QT development.</p>
<p>Spotify ( http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spotify.com ) uses QtWebKit in their app GUI and it doesn&#39;t look too bad.</p>

							<p>@ALL, i found this: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;webkitdotnet.sourceforge.net&#x2F;index.php, this should be a start in creating your own application wrapper. And i am also waiting for QT&#39;s WRT and the QT 4.7…</p>

							<p>@Kyle Quest, yeah that&#39;s what I was thinking as well. They were saying there was going to be this BIG upgrade in the summer. But I just don&#39;t see that happening. It&#39;s a shame though, I was really hoping for Desktop to work out.</p>
<p>Gah, converting back I go.</p>
