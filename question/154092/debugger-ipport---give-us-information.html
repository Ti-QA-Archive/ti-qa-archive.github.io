			<h1>Debugger IP/port - GIVE US INFORMATION</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I spent hours trying everything I could while the documentation does not provide any real technical data.</p>
<p>I tried to run debugging my project on iPad however I couldn&#39;t realize how Titanium determines which IP shall application connect to. After many tests I assumed that it&#39;ll connect to the same IP address which is IP address of iPad&#39;s current WiFi gateway – correct me if I&#39;m wrong.</p>
<p>The port that application connects tries to connect to is <code>35353</code> however debugger in Titanium does not respond to that, I see with tcpdump that packets arrive but nothing happens? However when debugger is waiting I see that ports like 49400, 49350 are listening and they change every time debugger run.</p>
<p>I`m running Mac OS in VMware, iPad is connected via USB just to transfer app but debugging is done via WiFi as well as the same WiFi is used to share WAN connection which application requires in order to work, this is all quite complex and requires couple forwarding stuff but I won&#39;t bother you with it. What I&#39;m trying to point out is that I think it&#39;s enough &quot;guessing&quot; on how the debugger works. </p>
<p>Also in old QA I found that there was some port in Console displayed which does not display now for me.<br><code>[INFO] :   Debugging enabled via debug host: ::1372187275386:10.64.11.55</code></p>
<p>Also now I see some timestamp? This IP address is not used anymore (it was different network). Why does titanium still points it  out? I want to get rid of it and since hours I can&#39;t!! I can&#39;t find where is it stored!</p>
<p>Developers! I beg you, info!!</p>

							<div><p>Hello,</p>
<p>first, running macOSX on top of VMWare is not supported. So, your results may vary.</p>
<p>On the other hand, did you read <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Debugging_on_iOS_Devices">this</a>? </p>
<p>Best,</p>

							<div><p>Mauro, I beg you…</p>
<p>Why are you referring to least or perhaps completely non important part of what I said.<br>I asked about how or where does the Titanium get information about IP address(host) where debugging will be performed, what is the port and what is this 1372187275386 and why does the host remain the same even after the network has changed.</p>
<p>Yes I have read this and that is exactly what I said in first sentence </p>
<p><code>documentation does not provide any real technical data.</code>. </p>
<p>From your link &quot;Testing Network Connection&quot; part &quot;explains&quot; it in following sentence</p>
<p> <code>If you cannot see the page, you have a networking problem.</code></p>
<p>How does it help me? I can handle the network but I need to know what I am looking for. I asked about those 3 ports 35353 and 49* can you refer to those plus what I mentioned above?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
