			<h1>iPhone lags because of views. Tips and tricks?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve currently been working on a game where a ship has the ability to shoot enemies as they come down the screen. I spawn enemies that are views at a certain interval and track their position as they move down the screen. The same is true with the bullets the ship fires. Each bullet is a view and it tracks it&#39;s position as it moves up screen. Obviously when they collide the enemie and bullet views are removed from te window. The trouble I&#39;m having is that if there are a couple enemies on screen and I&#39;m shooting at them the app will lag. And if I let the enemies continue to spawn (they get removed if they make it all the way down the page) the spawn rate will start to get faster. It&#39;s set to spawn an enemy every so many seconds and since the enemies are moving slower I end up with about a million on screen after a minute and snail snow speeds.<br>Are there any tips or tricks to creating this kind of scenario? Perhaps not using views somehow? I&#39;m using a set interval on each enemy because you can&#39;t track the position of a view as it&#39;s animating so could that be what&#39;s bogging it down? Any insigt at all into how to speed this up would be greatly appreciated.</p>

							<p>Titanium views aren&#39;t exactly suited to this kind of use-case. You can&#39;t expect high-throughput graphics from a UI-centric framework written in non-native Javascript. You&#39;d be much better off using GL or native code.</p>
<p>That said, a few simple tips would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>cache the views&#x2F;images as much as possible.</li>
<li>minimize your calls to createView() by reusing objects. Allocations of any sort are slow. </li>
<li>Use as few timers and event callbacks as possible.</li>
</ul>

							<p>You should use Ti modules, like GL (as Jeremy said) or box 2D…</p>
<p>Another trick is to simplify objects… A view witha background is better than an imageview in a view…</p>
