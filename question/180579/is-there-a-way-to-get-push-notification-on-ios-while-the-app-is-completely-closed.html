			<p>Is there a way to get push notification on iOS while the app is completely closed (has stopped, not even in the background)?</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure there is a solution out there I&#39;ve seen it working but can&#39;t find any lead on how to make it work. My notification callback is not getting called unless the user hit the notification. and it can be easily missed.</p>
<p>The new background services introduced in iOS 7 is not helping when the app is not in the background.</p>
<p>Any solution? Anyone?</p>

							<p>If I understand what you&#39;re asking, you&#39;re asking whether you can build an app that receives the push notification callback <em>as soon as the notification arrives on the device</em>, correct?</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think it works that way.  The OS talks to the APNS server, gets any relevant push notifications, and displays them in the notifications view.  Your app doesn&#39;t get activated until the user taps the icon in the system notifications view.</p>
<p>Can you imagine how annoying it would be to the end user for various apps to be activated, possibly jumping to the foreground, every time a notification came in?</p>
