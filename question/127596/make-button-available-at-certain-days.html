			<h1>make button available at certain days</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all</p>
<p>Is it possible to make that happen? I&#39;d like to make a button available only on 2 days of the week at a certain hour, the rest of the time the button should be unavailable.</p>
<p>I want to check on internet the day and hour, not the divice to avoid the problem of miss configured the time on it.</p>
<p>So it be like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check on the net the day and hour</li>
<li>Compare with my conditions of time<br> 2,1 if true, make the button available<br> 2,2 if false, keep the button unavailable.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for help.</p>

							<p>Using time from the web may cause even more issues as you have no idea what timezone the user is in. Its not the same day and same hour for everyone in the world. Im going to go out on a limb and say that 99.9% of people will have the time correctly configured on their device because it is probably their primary method of timekeeping when on the move. On top of that, you will require that the user have a web connection to use the app. What happens when there is not connection to use to make the call to check the time?</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it is possible to do what you are attempting to do. And you explained it perfectly. Find a place to check the time ( I would strongly suggest using the current device time ) and if it falls inside the parameters that have set, then display the button, if not, then don&#39;t</p>

										<p><p>I ended up using the local device time. It&#39;s a bit out, of what I was originally looking for, but it&#39;s a lot easier that way. Thanks</p>

										<p><p>Please don&#39;t link to w3schools, they just have outdated crap.</p>

										<p><p>Hi. As far as I understand, the date object gets the current date of the device. So I&#39;m afraid, if the current time of the device is wrong, my app won&#39;t work as expected.</p>

										<p><p>And what if device can&#39;t connect to the internet … you app won&#39;t work? :P (just kidding)</p>
<p>You should ask yourself, who wants that his device shows wrong time. I think in huge amount of all users, time is pretty accurate.</p>

										<p><p>You can verify the time that is on the phone with a time on the web, but again, you are requiring a web connection. And you are assuming that people are going to go through an awful lot of trouble to make the button work in your app. If it is that big of a concern, use your own personal server time to verify that the button should be shown.</p>
