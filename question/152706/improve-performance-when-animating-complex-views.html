			<h1>Improve performance when animating complex views</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>i asked something similar a while ago but still have no satisfying solution.</p>
<p>The current state is: </p>
<p>I have, at least, two complex views (each has 10 Subviews, 1 ScrollableView, 50 Labels) and two animations (one for every view) running &quot;in parallel&quot; to get a custom transition between those views.</p>
<p>Both animations have a duration of 350ms. In simulator the time between starting the first animation and ending in the callback is around 360ms.<br>But on the iPhone 4 this time is between 600 and 1000ms. This leads to a very unresponsive ui feeling…</p>
<p>When performing the animations with empty views the duration gets near 400ms, which would be ok.</p>
<p>So i tried different things to speed up the animations, but couldn&#39;t find a real improvement.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I set both views to touchEnabled=false -&gt; no big improvement.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I put all the content of the views in a wrapper-view and called $.wrapper.hide() before starting the animation. Here i was hoping for a big speedup, because the content doesn&#39;t need to be updated while animating, but it seems this has very little effect and i&#39;m a little bit confused why.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Are there any tips how to speed things up? How do you handle such cases?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance, regards Joe.</p>
<p>PS: the app is alloy based and i&#39;m using the latest versions of the sdk and alloy.</p>

							<div><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I was thinking about this and playing with the idea: What do you want to do exactly? Having a pretty neat effect when switching between windows? What about you put a &quot;fake&quot; image in the windows, animate and then load the actual data? </p>
<p>Best,</p>

							<div><p>Hi,</p>
<p>yes, that&#39;s one thing i want to accomplish. </p>
<p>The idea with the image is good and i have already elaborated on this, but this only increases the performance when the image is the only thing which is animated.<br>When the hidden view is animated too, you will gain no performance, because the hidden view does also participate in layout operations.</p>
<p>IMHO it would help to speed up the animation of views when Titanium would expose the <strong>opaque</strong> and <strong>shouldRasterize</strong> properties for views and labels.<br>But as far as i know, this is not the case at the moment.</p>
<p>Best regards, Joe</p>
