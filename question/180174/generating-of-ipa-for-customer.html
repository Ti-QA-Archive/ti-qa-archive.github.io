			<h1>Generating of IPA for customer</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hi coders,</p>
<p>my problem: I want generate an IPA and have no customer account to itunes. I have only distribution provisioning file and private key. After pacakging in Titanium an archive appears in xcode organizer.</p>
<p>Now I have the possibility to export an IPA. But the system needs an account to do it.  </p>
<p>Is there an other way to build an IPA for customer?</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Rainer</p>

							<p>Hi Rainer :)</p>
<p>As for my understanding, an IPA is a signed package of the app. Re-signing an IPA is theoretically possible but could be very painful.</p>
<p>Exchanging the App as an xcode-archive seems to be the better solution. You can export it, they can import it and sign it with their own certificate (and send it straight to iTunes connect through Xcode).</p>
<p>I&#39;m afraid you won&#39;t be able to generate a distributable IPA. I&#39;ve had a similar issue. We told that other company, that they have 3 options:</p>
<ul>
<li>give us full access on their developer program (easiest for them)</li>
<li>take the xcode-archive and sign&#x2F;release the app (easiest for you)</li>
<li>take the source-code and build&#x2F;release the app (difficult for them &#x2F; bad for you as you give away your code)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m not aware if there are other or even better opportunities but I hope this helps.</p>

										<p><p>btw: I assumed that other company wants to release the App on iTunes. If they only need an adHoc IPA, then you can build it with the distribution provisioning profile.</p>

										<p><p><em>give us full access on their developer program (easiest for them)</em></p>
<p>it is a big company and noboody wants to give me full access.</p>
<p><em>take the xcode-archive and sign&#x2F;release the app (easiest for you)</em></p>
<p>to complicated for company</p>
<p><em>take the source-code and build&#x2F;release the app</em></p>
<p>I&#39;m afraid the other mac must install path to titanium sdk … ?</p>

										<p><p>Yes, I remember this struggle. Since then I always pay attention that the app handover is regulated in the specs. If they are not able to release the app but they don&#39;t want you to do it, then the app will not be released. Or they tell you how to do it! (yes, for #3 they &#39;d need to setup a titanium development environment)</p>

							<p>Hi Rainer,</p>
<p>i think you can test ipa which is generated by using distributed certificate but via using <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;testflight&#x2F;">Test Flight</a>. till now i never use this but test flight is a environment for testing app in production environment.. but there is also add UDID in account.. so you can send release to customer and tell them to follow the procedure of test flight.. or ask to customer about developer certificate because i can not directly test ipa which is generated using distributed certificate </p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>Our theme is not the beta testing. This we realize with an own web service. Inside the app a version tester goes to the web service reads the version and make a comparision. In case of difference the app opens a dialog and this dialog makes openURL to the web service. This works  very fine.</p>
<p>Now the app should go to itunes store. For security reasons the (big) company dont give me the itunes account, only the distribution provisioning file and a private key.  I&#39;m looking for a possibility to generate a file, that can the customer upload. </p>
<p>I see one way (but the company don&#39;t want it): sending of ZIP of xarchive. Customer imports to organizer and signes with the key.  Other way ?</p>
