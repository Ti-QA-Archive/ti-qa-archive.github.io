							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Have you completed all the steps including pushing the p12 exported certificate up to ACS?</p>
<p>Did you compile your app using the certificate and have placed it on your device - not on the simulator?</p>

										<p><p>Yes, everything ties in, so you;</p>
<ul>
<li>need a specific appid</li>
<li>that appid has the push notification ability added in the provisioning profile</li>
<li>that certificate is exported so you can pass it to Appcelerator (or other service)</li>
<li>that certificate is used to create the app for the device (not in the simulator or debug testing)</li>

										<p><p>Is there a common mistake on that process ?<br>I am not sure where this refers<br>&quot;Make sure to log in to Apple&#39;s developer site as Team Agent to access team provisioning profiles.&quot;</p>

										<p><p>You can create more than one user for your Apple Developer account, I never bothered.  So the main one is the right one to start with.</p>
<p>As long as you are able to create provisioning profiles you should have the correct account.</p>
