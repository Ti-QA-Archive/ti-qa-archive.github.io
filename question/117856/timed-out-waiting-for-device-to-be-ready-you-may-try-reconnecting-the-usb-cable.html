			<p>Hello-</p>
<p>I am trying to deploy my android application on to my samsung acclaim and keep getting the error &quot;Timed out waiting for device to be ready, you may try reconnecting the USB cable&quot;.  I have USB debugging set to on.  I also have Unknown sources set to on to allow installations from non-Market applications.  I still get this error.  Oddly enough, this error only occurs on and off.  I started out the night being able to install the app without any issues.  After about 2 hours, I started getting this error.  </p>
<p>When getting this error, I powered off my phone and turned it back on.  This did not help.  I tried restarting my pc, this did not help either.  When I look in windows explorer, I do not have a usb device for my phone.  Is there a setting in windows that I need to turn on?  Does anyone have any thoughts other than turn on USB debugging or Unknown Sources?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Josh</p>
