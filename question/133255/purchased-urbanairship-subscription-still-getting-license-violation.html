			<p>Purchased UrbanAirship Subscription.  Still getting License Violation.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried rebuilding a fresh project, I&#39;ve tried cleaning, deleting contents of build directory, etc.  </p>
<p>Tried building a brand new sample app just to test it.  Nothing is working.  Does any one know wth I have to do to get my license to be seen as valid?</p>

							<div><p>To further clarify, I am also logged in to the correct account in titanium, watching the console I can see that UrbanAirship is registering correctly as well, I&#39;ve tried every thing i&#39;ve found on the forums that may be the issue.  The only think I can think of is I am on the community edition but we did purchase the licenses for the module separately.  </p>
<p>Do we have to purchase an Indy account as well?  because that would be stupid.</p>
