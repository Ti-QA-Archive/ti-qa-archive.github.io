										<p><p>Alan, as always very useful suggestions. I had not installed the SDK in the folder c:\users…. but into c:\programdata (I was still working with version 1.1.0). Deployment is now also working.<br>I plan on creating a document with the problems I have encountered in these early days and their solutions to make it available to the community. What do you think about this idea?</p>

<p>That sounds like a great idea! We do need to update some of the docs, but anything to help folks is always better, IMO.</p>

							<p>I had this symptom, only with the Windows packaging.  It&#39;s because I used a version number of &quot;7&quot;.  When I change to &quot;7.0&quot; it works.</p>

										<p><p>There are other questions about this same problem. Some possibilities include problems when they change the default logo, problems with non-ASCII characters in the LICENSE.txt, and problems when they use a number like &quot;.8.1&quot; or &quot;7&quot; (instead of &quot;0.8.1&quot; or &quot;7.0&quot;).</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for this post Trent.. it helped me track down my issue. I was using a version of 2011.11.01.1200 and windows packaging was failing. I changed version back to 1.0 and windows packaging worked fine again. Kudos ;)</p>

<p>There is a jira ticket filed, possibly more than one, and I will be looking into it when I get some time. Right now I have some other more important issues I&#39;m looking at which take precedence. Here&#39;s one of the tickets:</p>

							<p>I had this problem today. Build: 1.0.6.201110251616. Maybe someone else has the same problem I did.</p>
<p>My license was originally written on my Mac for a different product. I copied the text and pasted it into my Titanium app on Windows, adjusted the wording, and tried to package but got the no attribute &#39;rfind&#39; error.</p>
<p>Turns out the license included the word &quot;user&#39;s&quot; in it. Well, that artsy Mac apostrophe is not a valid character on Windows, so the license file had a binary character in it. Changing the artsy apostrophe to a Windows single quote solved the problem.</p>

<p>Currently no extended ascii can be used. This will be addressed in the future when time permits, I had looked at adding locale support to the WIX installer, but was not successful and need to revisit it.</p>

										<p><p>I appreciate that Alan. Indeed I looked high and low for extended ascii characters first. That pesky Mac apostrophe was hard to spot. I assume I&#39;m not the only one that will have that particular problem if developing on both platforms.</p>

<p>Unfortunately you are not the only one to see that, but it is still not obvious all the time when reported. The win sdk is going to be going through an overhaul soon, as I&#39;m looking to swap out the webkit with chromium embedded, and at the time I will look at enabling that in WIX again.</p>
