			<p>Hi Titanium team, can we get a third pricing plan for Garage Developers like me, I&#39;m not a company but would buy a support package that suited my wallet more as I can&#39;t warrant paying 2,000 USD a year.</p>
<p>Maybe you could introduce inbetween Community and Professional… &quot;Garage Developer&quot; with the benefits of:</p>
<ul>
<li>SDK: <strong>Yes</strong></li>
<li>Early Product Access: <strong>No</strong></li>
<li>Community Forum: <strong>Yes</strong></li>
<li>Premium Support Portal: <strong>Yes</strong></li>
<li>Guarenteed Response: <strong>5 Business Days</strong></li>
<li>Analytics Portal: <strong>Yes</strong></li>
<li>Analytics Data: <strong>1 Month</strong></li>
<li>Critical Issue Resolution: <strong>No</strong></li>
<li>&quot;Building Native Apps&quot; Training: <strong>No</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Cost: $50 per month ($600 per year)</p>
<p>I&#39;d pay that.. Anyone else?</p>

							<p>I&#39;d like such an option as well, definitely. However: I&#39;m now going out and trying to get some gigs that will pay the pro support. From all I&#39;ve read, it should be worth it. </p>

							<p>2000 a year sounds not that bad. i was actually afraid its ten times that. </p>
<p>tough… i wish there would be something for more advanced users. i really dont care about premium support but about early product access and really dont understand why that would be a premium feature. as more test it, as sooner it gets ready, means more Ti users and therefore more customers for the premium service. even if its a &quot;closed beta&quot; let me apply for access to it.</p>
<p>@james, 5 day response time is silly.</p>
