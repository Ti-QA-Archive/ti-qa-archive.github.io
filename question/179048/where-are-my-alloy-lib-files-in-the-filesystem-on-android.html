			<h1>Where are my Alloy /lib files in the filesystem on Android?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve got a resuable library of code that I use in basically every app I make. One part of the code makes use of Ti.Filesystem functionality to retrieve exports objects from different js files and combine them in one multipurpose.</p>
<p>For a while I&#39;ve been working on these apps for iOS and mobileweb only, and now I&#39;m doing my first Titanium app for Android in a while. One big change is that I&#39;m now using Alloy. All of a sudden Ti.Filesystem cannot find these js files, even though I&#39;ve put them in the prescribed app&#x2F;lib subfolder, and require() can find them without any problems.</p>
<p>Finding the files in app&#x2F;lib with Ti.Filesystem.getFile() and [Object file].getDirectoryListing() works fine in mobileweb and iOS, but on Android the js files cannot be found in this way. They&#39;re not listed in the directory where they should be (which is the Resources directory).</p>
<p>Strangely, a few text files that I had hanging around in the same folders as the js files do show up when I use getFile() to point to a folder and them use .getDirectoryListing() on that file to get a list of what is there. </p>
<p>If I pick the resources directory, the files that sit there are a combination of sound and font files that I placed in app&#x2F;assets and text files that I had in app&#x2F;lib and its subfolders.</p>
<p>It seems like somewhere in the build process, Titanium moves the js files in some way, such that require() can find them but they are no longer in the resources directory.</p>
<p>So my question is: where are my js files located? I need to make a directory listing of all those files so that I can use require() on a selection of them.</p>
<p>For clarity, my folder structure looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">app
    <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">lib</span></span>
        style
        elements
            button.js
            slider.js
        data
        sometext.txt
        ui.js
</code></pre>

							<p>The contents of the lib folder are copied to the root of your Resources directory when you build the app. Thus, you&#39;d reference them as &quot;&#x2F;ui.js&quot; not &quot;&#x2F;lib&#x2F;ui.js&quot;.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Tim. I&#39;m sure the files are there in that directory. And I can require() them too. But when I use Filesystem&#39;s getFile() and getDirectoryListing(), they are not listed as being in that directory. Only the txt files (and sounds and fonts etc) are. </p>
<p>On Titanium&#39;s Android implementation, it appears that either there is no filesystem path to these js files, or they must have been moved somewhere else.</p>

										<p><p>JavaScript files are obfuscated during the build process and may very well not be accessible via Ti.Filesystem calls for security purposes (to limit opportunities for your code to be exposed unintentionally). Why would you need to access a JS file with Ti.Filesystem? Even if you could, you&#39;d have to eval() the contents to use it as JavaScript, which is sub-optimal at best. Beside, that&#39;s what require() is for (and it handles the obfuscation automatically).</p>

										<p><p>Hi Tim, when I eventually use these JS files it is with require(). So I don&#39;t actually need to <em>access</em> them and thank goodness I don&#39;t need to use eval(). </p>
<p>All I want is a list of all the files that sit in a particular folder (elements in my example) so that my UI.js can require() all those files one by one and include their exports as its own &quot;element creation&quot; methods.</p>
<p>Basically, my UI.js file is used like the Ti.UI object: as a namespace from which to create all sorts of elements. Whenever I add a new element module, I don&#39;t want to programatically tell UI.js to require() that module too.</p>
<p>Convention over code, so to say.</p>
<p>Does this exposé on my purpose lead you to imagine any new approaches? Or am I just doomed in the Android&#x2F;Alloy combo situation?</p>
