			<h1>Titanium Mobile SDK 6.6.6 and iOS 9 support</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I will only work with forward thinking companies that are truly on the bleeding edge of technology.  If your work isn&#39;t on Slashdot with hundreds of comments, I&#39;m not interested in working with you.</p>
<p>With that in mind, do you intend to release, soon, a version of your mobile sdk to support Apple&#39;s iOS 9? Will it support all of the iOS 9 functionality, even the specs Apple&#39;s own engineers have yet to think up?</p>
<p>Also, do you have a system in place where by I can receive snippets of code, created by highly qualified volunteer developers, that I can just drop into Titanium Studio and click run and I can release my app to the public?</p>
<p>And is it true that a DNA sample from my first born child is required by your license agreement in order to use your software? (I heard this both on Twitter and from a Titanium news site, so I assume its true and have already contacted my solicitor).</p>
<p>Thank you in advance, even though I assume you won&#39;t answer my tough questions (I heard that you do things like this from MySpace).</p>

							<p>After 3 years it&#39;s reality. Appcelerator IS a forward thinking company and now supports iOS 9. It&#39;s Apples fault, that there is not holographic FaceTime nor a laser keyboard.</p>
