			<h1>Remembering the iOS Simulator Device in Titanium Studio</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all-</p>
<p>Is there a way to remember the iOS Simulator device last tested against in Titanium Studio for a project?  Prior to the last version upgrade, and start of a new Alloy project, I was able to use XCode, start the iOS Simulator, choose an iPhone device type, and on the next run of the Titanium simulator for my project, it would consistently remember if I was running my iPhone 5 simulator versus an older, non Retina display.  This seems to no longer work, and I was wondering if there is a setting I am forgetting or missing to remember device simulators from test to test run?</p>
<p>Talk soon<br>Chris</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<ul>
<li>Open your tiapp.xml in studio </li>
<li>In the visual side of the editor on the bottom left – find configure (below iPad, iPhone ,Android etc)</li>
<li>Expand the Platforms option from the left</li>
<li>Choose iOS</li>
<li>Second drop down on the right Default Display</li>
<li>Choose the one you want.</li>
</ul>
<p>Agreed – buried and difficult to find first time.</p>

										<p><p>BTW whilst this makes it easier than the old way it is still not as easy as it could be - but this situation will be greatly improved in the next version - keep an eye out for it.</p>

										<p><p>thanks so much! I spent more than 5 hours to figure this out. I know I did it once but couldn&#39;t remember how I did it. Super buried down in the studio..would be great if this functionality can be more transparent in the next Studio release.</p>
