			<h1>Video timing / changing playback question</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi - I&#39;ve nearly completed an app for iPad which makes heavy use of video playback, playing a single file stored on the device.  The game has to start video (usually) when the user initiates it and play short sections of the video, which then &#39;loop&#39; - i.e., once the video reaches the end of the defined section, the program sets the currentPlaybackTime back to the start of the current section.  Key frames in the video allow instant jumps, which all works nice and smoothly.</p>
<p>However, currently the safest and most reliable way I&#39;ve found of keeping track of where the video is up to is by using a setInterval set to roughly 24fps (41.66) and to keep checking the currentPlaybackTime.  This works almost perfectly, which is really annoying because just when you think it&#39;s never going to go wrong you see a flash frame of the next part of the video - presumably when the script has failed to catch the end and restart the video quick enough.  I&#39;ve tinkered with the timing, for instance it actually resets the video position 350ms before currentPlaybackTime reaches the end, and I know I could tinker with the video and increase this buffer to above 350ms, but the problem is the randomness of this - if I trim off too much sometimes it cuts in very noticeably.</p>
<p>So does anyone know of a more native &#x2F; better way of checking when a video reaches a certain point and resetting it to another point?  It&#39;s almost something the native player should do, but I can&#39;t see any way of setting those parameters and in fact I might be wrong and there is no way of doing this natively.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading this long question!!</p>

							<p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>i am not sure if it helps, but there was a question about <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;148336&#x2F;setcurrentplaybacktime-not-accurate">setCurrentPlaybackTime Not Accurate?</a>.</p>
<p>That problem was solved by encoding with more keyframes.</p>
<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>Matthias</p>

							<p>Thanks Matthias for the reply - key frames are certainly vital for starting playback at a certain point - I&#39;ve edited the video to contain key frames for all the start points - but the problem is checking when the video is almost at a certain point and changing the time.  I&#39;m not sure setting a keyframe near the end of each section would help but it&#39;s something I&#39;ll try.  Ideally what I need is a native &#39;if video reaches time x, set it to time y&#39;, but unfortunately it doesn&#39;t exit!</p>
