			<h1>Text decided to not show up today on android</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>So I have been developing an app for android and iOS for quite a while. Today was supposed to be the submission day! I have been doing all my android testing on a Samsung Galaxy S4 with Android 4.4.2.</p>
<p>I have been using Ti SDK 3.2.1 during this whole process. I&#39;ve noticed there has been an update wanting to update titanium the past week or two but I have been ignoring it until I get this release out.</p>
<p>So today I am doing my final tests and my login screen now shows no text. I can type in the inputs and work all my buttons, just no text is visible.</p>
<p>The console is also throwing some new errors that just started showing today:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[WARN] :   linker: libstlport_shared.so <span class="hljs-keyword">has</span> text relocations. This <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> wasting memory <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> a security risk. Please fix.
[WARN] :   linker: libkroll-v8.so <span class="hljs-keyword">has</span> text relocations. This <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> wasting memory <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> a security risk. Please fix.
[WARN] :   linker: libtiverify.so <span class="hljs-keyword">has</span> text relocations. This <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> wasting memory <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> a security risk. Please fix.
[WARN] :   ApplicationPackageManager: getCSCPackageItemText()
[WARN] :   V8Object: Runtime disposed, cannot <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">property</span> <span class="hljs-string">'userAgent'</span>
[ERROR] :  ViewSystem: ViewRootImpl <span class="hljs-string">#2</span> Surface <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">not</span> valid.
</code></pre><p>Those weird &quot;linker&quot; errors. This just started showing today. So I try and remedy the problem by updating to that new Ti SDK 3.2.2. I get through that, update all the android SDKs, update the android NDK and still, same thing.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve cleaned the project, removed it entirely from the phone, rebooted the phone, my computer and so on.</p>
<p>I can however see the text on an older android device that I have. It is n samsung galaxy stellar and when I compile I do not get those errors.</p>
<p>Can anyone think of what is going on here and WHY it just started happeing today after no SDK updates?</p>

							<div><p>I found out the issue. It has never been a problem in the past but it just started to effect my app. In <code>tiapp.xml</code>, I had <code>useAnyDensity=false</code> which has never been a problem. Changing it to <code>true</code> fixed it, however, I had to fix a bunch of elements throughout the app that were using pixels. So rather than something like <code>width:50</code>, I had to change it to <code>width: &amp;#39;50dp&amp;#39;</code>. I think it ended up working for the better. I think DPs are better to use than pixels</p>
