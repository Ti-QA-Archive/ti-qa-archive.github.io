		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have an API call on our server that generates JSON data to be used to generate graphs. I have a website that uses this as well as my Titanium apps. </p>
<p>Here&#39;s what I send to the API from my app:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">// values <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">send</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> API
        var <span class="hljs-built_in">params</span> = 
        {  
            <span class="hljs-string">'action'</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'processed_gauge_data'</span>,
            <span class="hljs-string">'api_key'</span>: api_key,
            <span class="hljs-string">'user_id'</span>: user_id,
            <span class="hljs-string">'format'</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'json'</span>,
            <span class="hljs-string">'data_type'</span>:dataType,
            <span class="hljs-string">'gauge'</span>:gauges.join(),
            <span class="hljs-string">'start'</span>:<span class="hljs-built_in">start</span>,
            <span class="hljs-string">'end'</span>:<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">end</span>
        };</span>
</code></pre><p>This call works fine on the app when I pass under 16 gauge ids with a time frame of a few days. If I pass 17 gauge ids I get &quot;Internal Server Error&quot;. Passing 17 gauge ids on the web works just fine. I also added some message logging to see if the app&#39;s API call was making it all the way through and it is. Could it just be that the response is too large?  The API returns minute to minute data between the user specified time frame. If I select 9 gauges and a years worth of data I get the same error. </p>
<p>How can I account for this? Right now my app just says &quot;Error communicating with server&quot; so to a client it sounds like our server is down or their connection sucks. I would like to be able to let them know they are trying to pull too much data, but with our variety of gauges and &#39;data_type&#39; options it&#39;s impossible to know before sending the request.</p>

							<p>I would use something like Charles Web Proxy to look at the raw requests of both the web and the app. My guess is your request is malformed (compared to your web request).</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the response. Turns out my request was fine. The API call was exceeding the memory limit server side.</p>

							<p>As it turns out I was mistaken about it working correctly on the web. We are in the process of upgrading our graphs and I had been looking at the old graphs which returned the data differently.</p>
<p>The problem was actually that the API call was crashing on <code>json_encode($graph_data);</code>. It was crashing because the memory limit had been exceeded, so I increased the memory limit for the API call using <code>ini_set(&amp;#39;memory_limit&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;1024M&amp;#39;);</code> The potential for error is still there, but our users should never request that much data. I plan on adding some sort error handling for this in the future.</p>
<p>I also ended up setting a limit on the return size of the data for mobile devices to 7.5MB using <code>strlen($json_encode_result);</code> since allowing an unlimited size could result in the app&#39;s memory being exceeded and then crashing.  7.5MB is an arbitrary value that I found worked fine for my Galaxy S3 and Nexus 9. My minimum SDK is 14 so I don&#39;t have to worry about devices with less application memory.  I tried to use Titanium.Platform.availableMemory and send it through to the API , but the value I got didn&#39;t match what the app could handle.</p>
