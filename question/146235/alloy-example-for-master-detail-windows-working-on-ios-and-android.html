			<p>It would be great if you could give some advice on how to best implement a way to navigate from a master to a detail screen with the new Titanium Alloy XML view definition, in an elegant way which works both on Android as well as on iOS.<br>Thanks in advance.</p>

							<p>Ask and ye shall receive. Here&#39;s a master-detail test app in the Alloy github repo. It lays a basic master-detail structure that leverages some of the cooler Alloy techniques for leveraging platform-specific UI and behavior in the markup and controllers. </p>

										<p><p>When I run this in the iPhone simulator, it works fine, but when I try it using the iPad simulator, it just loads to a blank white screen.  Perhaps this is the same issue as Sreenath was having regarding the split window.</p>

										<p><p>The SplitWindow control only shows the master panel when in landscape orientation. When you aer on portrait it only displays the detail. Press CMD + (right arrow).</p>

							<p>First, I would use the master-detail template found in New Project wizard (version 3.0.1). That&#39;ll get you started. Then, if needed, use a listener on either the master &quot;close&quot; event or the detail &quot;open&quot; event, depending on your specific application.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

										<p><p>I have been looking all over for a solution. I see only two options with my version 3.0.1, a &quot;Default Alloy Project&quot; (A single Window project) and a &quot;Two Tabbed Alloy Application&quot;. Am I missing anything?</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s the problem with answering questions at the end of the day. I misspoke. I was looking at the Titanium Classic wizard and not the Alloy beta tab. I apologize for the confusion. For now, it appears that you&#39;ll need to create the master-detail app from scratch. What I would do is create a basic app from the provided template in Titanium Classic. Then, examine how the navigation works for that. That can be used as a guide for creating an Alloy-based version on master-detail. Hope that helps.</p>
