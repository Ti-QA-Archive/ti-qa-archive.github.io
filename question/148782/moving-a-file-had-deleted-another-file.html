			<p>I am using androzip 4.5.2 on my smartphone. I had a voice recording file &#39;aud0001&#39; 1mb. It&#39;s stored on my sdcard under folder my sounds. I created another voice recording file and it auto gives the same file &#39;aud0001&#39; but its a different size. What I just discovered, androzip automatically override the same file name even though the file has different size. I am disappointed that androzip does not have an pop-up box or warning before it overrides the file. Please advice if any possibility I can retrieve the old file that was replaced. Thanks in advance.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>If you are referring to the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;websiteburo&#x2F;androzip">androzip</a> then you are much more likely to get an answer from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;websiteburo">github.com&#x2F;websiteburo</a> than from here.</p>
<p>The library appears not to have been updated in 2 or mor years so it might also be worth looking for a newer library as a lot has changed with titanium in two years and the problem you are experiencing &#39;may&#39; be something a newer implemenation may resolve.</p>
