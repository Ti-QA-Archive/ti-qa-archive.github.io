			<h1>An app made only with HTML. Possible?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello, I&#39;m a junior web designer who works for a small web developing studio. One of our customers asked us an app for his website, a simple internal seach engine. Pretty useless, but we have to do it. The searh engine is already done, we just need an app for mobiles. A friend told me about Titanium, so here I am. My question is: can I publish an app that works only with a WebView, displaying a local html (+css +js) file which includes the search form and then show another WebView, remote, that just display the result of the request as the normal website does? I&#39;ve heard something about you can&#39;t publish apps that look like browsers, and this one is pretty a browser.. Any advice? Thank you!</p>

							<p>Hi Stefano </p>
<p>yes its absolutely alright to develop the app which only have web-views in it. Well i have seen many apps which load all of its UI from the web-view.</p>
<p> But when it comes to the app store for apple its very tough to answer. I am sure that they not going to approve a single page app… But you can add some extra features in the app in order to publish your main functionality in the app.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

							<p>AFAIK, you can do this with Appcelerator. </p>
<p>There is also another project named &quot;PhoneGap&quot; which just shows the webviews and<br>the apps made with it accepted everyday.</p>
