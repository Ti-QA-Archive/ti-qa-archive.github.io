			<h1>splash screen too large</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m struggling with a dumb problem I can&#39;t seem to fix. I&#39;ve created a custom splash screen image. But, it&#39;s showing too large in the emulator … probably 20% or so larger so that the edges all around are outside of the screen area.</p>
<p>The image is 320 x 480. I&#39;ve tried at both 96 &amp; 72 dpi. In fact, I started with the stock Default.png and edited it with Photoshop to create my custom image.</p>
<p>I used the same PSD file to also create a background image for the app itself. That image shows up correctly, at the right scale.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

							<div><p>I tried resizing the Default.png to 300x450 and the now-smaller image just gets stretched. So, it&#39;s still showing up too large but now is all pixelated. Arg!</p>

<p>If you are able to upload your image file somewhere and post the link here, I would be happy to try to get this working as you expect.</p>

										<p><p>At the moment, I don&#39;t recall what I did to work around this. Something about the top being cut off, rather than the image being stretched as I thought. It seems I had to leave a 20 px or so empty space at the top in order for the contents of the splash image to all be visible. I&#39;ll add another comment here if I remember the exact particulars.</p>
