							<p>you need to get a specific application id from Twitter to make tweetanium work with xAuth. Without the id all you can do is review the code </p>

							<p>I did not have any luck with Tweetanium. As an alternative you can use BirdHouse. Here is some info:</p>
<p><strong>Cross-Platform Support &amp; Up-to-Date:</strong> BirdHouse has been tested on Android with Linux and Mac as well as on iPhone, both using the latest Titanium Mobile SDK (1.6.2). It has been tested by others and is being maintained to fix any issues.</p>
<p><strong>Go <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jpurcell&#x2F;birdhouse">here for the code</a> and go <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jpurcell&#x2F;birdhouseapp">here for the test app</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About:</strong> The script can send tweets, retrieve tweets, authenticate, &quot;deauthenticate&quot;, and send custom API calls to Twitter. For sending tweets, a custom UI popup appears. It is designed to work similar to Titanium&#39;s Facebook module.</p>
<p>David Riccitelli&#39;s oauth-adapter doesn&#39;t work on Android, but some have forked it to work, such as Ketan Majmudar (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stereoket">go here for his code</a>), I have tried other OAuth scripts as well, but I have been more successful with BirdHouse.</p>

<p>Thanks for bringing this to everyone&#39;s attention. Now that you have posted it to 23 different threads, I think you have made your point ;)  No need to continue, unless a <em>new</em> question is raised and it is relevant to the user&#39;s situation.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding, and restraint.</p>

										<p><p>Paul, considering the pain we developers go through because of the lack of official twitter integration like there is Facebook integration, the unsupported libraries everywhere, this &#39;spam&#39; is acutally very relevant info. It took 5 weeks before this reached me for example. Joe: Good work, go nuts with the spamming!</p>

										<p><p>Not publicly at least, just the consumer key and consumer secret. But, it is safe to say Twitter has an app id for every app. Perhaps it shows in the app&#39;s config url: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.twitter.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;&lt;YOUR APP ID&gt;&#x2F;show.</p>
