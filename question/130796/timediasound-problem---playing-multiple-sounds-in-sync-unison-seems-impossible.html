			<h1>Ti.Media.Sound Problem - Playing multiple sounds in sync (unison) seems impossible</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>So Titanium.Media.Sound() has methods such as setTime, getTime, and play()…</p>
<p>I have an array of sounds (5 mp3&#39;s) which are 100kb a piece, and I am trying to play them in unison.  However this proves to be a fruitless endeavor.  I have attempted using the <code>preload: true</code> when creating the sound, doing the <code>sound[i].play()</code> and <code>sound[i].pause()</code> in a loop to force the sounds to preload, then using <code>sound[i].setTime(0)</code>, then attempting to loop through each of these sounds by simply calling <code>sound[i].play()</code> causes each sound to play, but at .01 (one hundredth) of a second offset.  </p>
<p>For instance, if I add a setTimeout that outputs <code>sound[i].getTime()</code> every second that the app is running I get: </p>
<p>Sound 0 plays, and is at 1.05 second, sound 1 is roughly at 1.04, sound 2 is at 1.03, sound 3 is at 1.02, sound 4 is at 1.01, etc.. </p>
<p>In fact, at 0 seconds when playing, the output of <code>sound[4].getTime()</code> is actually a negative number.  </p>
<p>Trying to use an event listener to listen for the complete event of the first sound and resetting the times to 0 does not help overcome the problem that gets progressively worse as all the sounds play, the loops themselves get progressively more out of sync.  </p>
<p>Is doing this in titanium too problematic?  Sound I not be using Media.Sound()?  </p>
<p>I&#39;m looking for any insight that could help address this, even if it is an external module.</p>

							<p>GOOD NEWS EVERYONE!  I have found something out that seems to be (tentatively) a great way to get this to &quot;work&quot;.  The problem is type type of audio file you use.  I referenced this article: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.raywenderlich.com&#x2F;204&#x2F;audio-101-for-iphone-developers-file-and-data-formats">here</a> which talks about the &quot;most optimized, fastest file format for iphone when space is not an issue&quot;…  Encode your audio files in Linear PCM and this seems to tighten everything up.  If I were to hazard a guess, the phone when calling &quot;play()&quot; on a .mp3() file needs to decompress the file before playing it.  Anyway, I&#39;m responding to this because I hope someone else benefits from it.  Cheers!</p>

							<p>Hello,</p>
<p>is this happening in iOS or Android? or both? Which SDK? In device or emulator?</p>
<p>Best,</p>

										<p><p>iOS, on the emulator the latency is only .01, on an iPod Touch it is .03 second delay.</p>

										<p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>is there any reason not to mix them in audacity or so? I think that with the processor you have in mobile, this won&#39;t play in sync.</p>

										<p><p>Unfortunately this causes the slight exponential issue.  The app is designed to toggle on one at a time 5 different sounds, I think (if my maths serve me right) is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 different files to have on the device.  </p>
<p>That&#39;s just for one &quot;tune&quot;, and if you were to have any more then that, then this causes a problem.  I was thinking of just coming up with just calculating the &quot;play&quot; delay and setting the times to be 0 + delay in sequence..</p>
