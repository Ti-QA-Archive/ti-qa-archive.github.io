			<h1>Example of Apple Mail App&#39;s Pull to Refresh</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Does anyone have a working implementation of the native Apple Mail app&#39;s pull to refresh? I know there are lots of examples of the &quot;old&quot; pull to refresh made famous by Tweetie but I&#39;m not interested in that. Specifically, help recreating the animation that stretches the circle image down into an inverted teardrop would be greatly appreciated. Has anyone done it yet?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The &quot;new&quot; way is built directly into iOS 6 and exposed as a property of of what we see as <strong>tableView</strong>.  This is currently not exposed in Titanium.</p>
<p>Assuming it will be, you will only be able to use it in iOS 6 - so you will either need to provide a fallback for iOS 4 &amp; 5 or you can only target iOS 6. Obviously this is not available for Android either.</p>
<p>You have three choices;</p>
<ul>
<li>create a custom module in Xcode and expose the specific feature including all events.</li>
<li>create the animation yourself - be aware it is more than a simple stretch as you point out is a teardrop from a circle</li>
<li>wait for Titanium to expose it - there is no timeline for this.</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>@Malcolm, do you know what this feature is called in iOS6? That is, the name of the API? I checked Jira and do not see an existing feature request for it. I can log it and hopefully Appcelerator will address it in a future release.</p>
<p>If any Appcelerator devs are watching this question and could chime in on any future plans to support this feature, it would be greatly appreciated.</p>

										<p><p>The name used in xcode is <strong>UIRefreshControl</strong>, commonly known as &quot;pull to refresh&quot; as you already know.  </p>
<p>Remember that it is iOS 6.x only so you will be restricting your audience if you do gain access to it.</p>
<p>However a recent statistic shows that iOS is now on 500 million devices and iOS 6 has been installed on 300 million of those - so 60% take up.  Which given the recency of the update is amazing and given the Android platform is still around 70% is still on 2.3.x even more impressive.</p>
<p>BTW how fast was this response :-)</p>
