			<p>I have implemented a app for iPhone using Titanium, it works great. Now when I tried to use the same code for android platform, I experienced so many problems with TI, when I finally figured out all the problems, I found the debug process is so slow. Every time i change code, TI needs to install it on Android simulator, this process takes soooo long, usually 5 minutes. So how can I use TI to debug my code? </p>
<p>I found another user to have the same problem also. No I did not kill the simulator when I debug. It is the installaton process takes long time. Maybe it is due to Android Simulator slowness. but I don&#39;t know the answer. This really affect my dev process. BTW, i am using a core 2 quad machine with 4G memory, so my machine is not the problem.</p>

							<p>this is a known issue, even with native android development I don&#39;t believe it is related to Titanium, honestly the best solution is more RAM, I have 12G and it is barely manageable</p>

<p>I develop for android all the time and, although admittedly the dev process is slow because you cannot make changes on-the-fly, it doesn&#39;t take as long as 5 minutes to reinstall the app and see the results.</p>
<p>My machine has 4GB memory installed, and barely 2GB is being used for the whole system, even with the android emulator running.  I doubt that memory is an issue for you.  What operating system are you using? You should look at its resource monitoring software to determine whether the memory, the processors or IO requests are the bottleneck. On Windows you would use <code>Task Manager</code> and on Linux you would run <code>top</code> from the shell. I&#39;m not sure what the equivalent is on OSX, but there certainly will be one.</p>
<p>Once the emulator is booted for the first time, at the most it should not take more than one and a half minutes to reinstall and run your app (on my Intel i7, it takes less than 1 minute). If you specify exactly how long this is taking on your machine, someone will advise further.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
