			<h1>3G and Mobile Network causing working issue on iPhone</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, </p>
<p>I have an issue with the App I am working. I made this app for Android and iOS. Everything works fine on Android, both on Wifi or Mobile Network. On iPhone when connected to a Wifi everything works as expected, but when switched on to a mobile network or 3G, I came across a weird error. I have a registration page which works fine other wise i.e. Registers properly and gives a proper response alert message indicating successfully registeration. But on 3G the same fails to work. On 3G the validations work fine and the code execution is fine up to the point of verification of data(which also happens with an xhr). But when I try to create an account using a 3G network it just fails. The Annoying Part is that it does not show any kind of error message to begin with. It just shows the loaders that I&#39;ve put which are shown and hidden as the code is executed. Has any one come across such an error? Or if any one has had any issues with a 3G or Mobile network on an iPhone you are welcome to share your issues and solutions. Any help or advice is appreciated.</p>

<li>Put some handler for the <strong>onerror</strong> event of the xhr that crashes to show you what&#39;s going on.<ul>
<li>Try to set a bigger timeout for the xhr.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Honestly without more details we only can imagine what it could be.</p>
