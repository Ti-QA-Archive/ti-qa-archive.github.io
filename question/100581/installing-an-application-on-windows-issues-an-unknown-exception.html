			<h1>Installing an application on Windows issues an unknown exception</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just installed Titanium developer 1.1.2 on OS X and used it to create a desktop application (made by html &amp; javascript).</p>
<p>I created the package using the installer type: network</p>
<p>Everything runs fine if I install the package on a OS X virtual machine (VirtualBox).</p>
<p>When I try to install the package on both Windows XP Pro (different pc) and Windows 7 (VirtualBox), the installer, at a certain point, shows an application error: &quot;The exception unknown software exception (0xc000000d) occurred in the application at location 0x10040e2b<br>Click OK to terminate the program&quot;.</p>
<p>When I click on the OK button, the installation finishes after a while.</p>
<p>I then tried to launch the application and the runtime is downloaded and (I guess) installed. As a matter of fact the application window is shown and it looks like the app is running. </p>
<p>However, when I try to use the app, I get some strange behaviors on the Windows systems while, on the virtual OS X box everything works properly.</p>
<p>Does any other user faced the same issue?</p>
<p>Is Appcelerator going to investigate and, possibly, fix it? If you need further info please let me know.</p>

							<p>Do you have any on-access antivirus running? If so, disable it temporarily to establish whether it is causing a problem with Titanium. If it is, experiment with different antivirus rules to exclude the parts of the filesystem that Titanium uses and re-enable scanning. Obviously, it would be great if you would share your workaround here so that others may benefit.</p>

							<p>For those who are still experiencing the same issue, please try to build the package with &#39;Bundled&#39; option rather than &#39;Network&#39; option.</p>
<p>In my case, the installer size increased to about 3 times bigger (for Windows), but it fixed the &#39;Unknown Software Exception&#39; error. Although it&#39;s not ideal to have large installers but it&#39;s better than having errors popping up.</p>

							<p>Still seeing this error, does anyone know if this is slated to be fixed at some point? Would rather not bundle every app but at least there&#39;s a workaround…</p>

										<p><p>Does that mean it officially won&#39;t be fixed? :(</p>
<p>It&#39;s not a fatal error, but it&#39;s still Bad from a user standpoint. Not every end user would attempt to run the app after seeing an error during installation. Works fine for testing personal apps or sharing with family since you can explain the issue, but currently the only option for &quot;real&quot; apps is the bigger bundle installation. I know App&#39;s attention is more on mobile but please consider fixing this. Thanks!</p>
