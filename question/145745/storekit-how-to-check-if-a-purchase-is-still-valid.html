		<section>
			<p>Our app will be free, but limited in content (from a feed). With an in-app purchase we want to give the user access to all content, for a period of 12 months, auto renewed.</p>
<p>How to check if a purchase is still valid? And what if a user has deleted&#x2F;cleaned&#x2F;reinstalled his device?</p>
<p>Whats the best approach?</p>

										<p><p>Ok, so I gave to store the id + timestamp to a remote database and check if at startup?</p>
<p>do I have to add it to app.js or can this be done in other application windows?</p>

										<p><p>Also, isn&#39;t it much faster if I create two seperator apps? A lite version and a full version, and refer to the full version in the lite so people can buy the full? :-)</p>

										<p><p>We have a couple of apps with subscriptions, and Apple says you run your own backend to keep track.</p>
<p>My business view of lite vs full and in-app ads:</p>
<p>I go down to the local mall.  There are a number of stores.  But the three we will talk about are Sears-Lite, Sears-Full and JcPenny.</p>
<p>I walk into JcPenny.  They have great reviews.  The lady at the front is real nice, greats me, helps me setup an account, then hands me the weekly flyer for Sears…. in-app ads, not a great continuity engine.</p>
<p>So i go next door to Sears-Lite (after all, the lady at JcPenny seems to think its a nice play, she gave me a flyer!) I look around, I like it. I try to buy something, sorry, you need to be in our Sears-Full store…</p>
<p>In both cases you, the developer, have erected a barrier that prevents us from a continued and long term relationship by insisting, in both cases, that the <strong>best business model is for me to abandon your app</strong>.</p>

										<p><p>Agree on your story, but there&#39;s a slight difference in our situation: we&#39;re only planning two apps: one free (lite) and one full version. No ads in the lite, only some sample content (but full features) so a user can experience&#x2F;tryout the app before paying for the full version. Nothing more, nothing less. Seems fair to me. In-app is the best option when it comes to upgrading, but if the work is so much more compared to creating two different apps it might be worth it.</p>
