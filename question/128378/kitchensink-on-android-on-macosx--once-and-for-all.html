		<section>
			<p>Hello, I&#39;m new to Titanium BUT not new to software development. I&#39;ve read just about EVERY post on how to get the KitchenSink app to COME UP on Android. With all due respect Appcelerator folks IF this app is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to code with Titanium THEN you&#39;re doing potential harm to prospective customers in not getting the story straight on making this work!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve spent a  significant amount of time trying to make sure I follow&#x2F;ed any and all directions re: KitchenSink and frankly I&#39;m done with hunting and pecking. I may just be done with Titanium in general. It doesn&#39;t matter how good your offering is IF a core example DOES NOT WORK with plain instructions. Period.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve not had this problem with Sencha, their &quot;kitchen sink&quot; demo works as advertised; I&#39;ve not had this problem with LiveCode, their &quot;kitchen sink&quot; demo works as advertised; I&#39;ve not had this problem with jQueryMobile, their &quot;kitchen sink&quot; demo works as advertised.</p>
<p>In a &quot;bake-off&quot; you&#39;re the lone problem child. Are you getting the picture?</p>
<p>Please provide me with a way to get this application up and running so that we may evaluate the Titanium platform on its many merits. Don&#39;t let the KitchenSink application be your Waterloo.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>Peter S.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry that you are experiencing so much trouble. Can you tell me, are you able to create and run a default project?  This will prove that your setup is correct.</p>
<p>To obtain and run the KitchenSink, use the &quot;Samples&quot; view of Titanium Studio. Right-click KitchenSink in the list, and choose &quot;Import sample as project&quot;.  I&#39;ve highlighted this option in the screenshot below.</p>
<p><img src="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;img10.imageshack.us&#x2F;img10&#x2F;1390&#x2F;screenshot436.png" alt="screenshot"></p>
<p>You should then be able to launch the application as normal.</p>
<p>If this does not resolve it, then please report back and I will assist you further.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

							<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>I have the same problem as Peter in that I cannot get the Kitchen Sink example to run. Regarding your answer, there is actually no projects in my Samples tab. I had to get the project from github.</p>
<p>It imported fine into studio but the &quot;Run&quot; tab above the project navigator window (the tab where you choose to run the droid or iphone emulator) is grey&#39;d out. I cannot for the life of me figure out how to run this applications. I tried changing the run configuration from Driod 4.x to Droid 2.2 (the configurations used in all the video demos). I select &quot;Build All&quot; from the &quot;Projects&quot; menu and that did not do anything either.</p>
<p>The HelloWorld demo however works fine for me. I am working on a Mac running OS X 10.6.8 with TiStudio build verion 1.0.7.201112152014.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Mike</p>
