			<h1>Trying to archive for Ad Hoc, but get`s error i xcode --developer-name &amp; --pp-uuid</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello, I want to try out an Ad Hoc distribution of my App, so I can try everything 100% before I submit the App to AppStore. (Mostly because of pushes).</p>
<p>Building in latest Titanium Studio 3.2 + Ti SDK 3.2 GA. When I try to build to my phone, or archive, I get this error in xcode:                </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[<span class="hljs-keyword">ERROR</span>] :  Invalid <span class="hljs-string">"--developer-name"</span> value <span class="hljs-string">"iPhone Distribution: Shaperace AB (6T94VS3J7E)"</span>

[<span class="hljs-keyword">ERROR</span>] :  Invalid <span class="hljs-string">"--pp-uuid"</span> value <span class="hljs-string">"7C696B2E-FFBF-4017-BD16-843350656939"</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">For</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">help</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">run</span>: titanium <span class="hljs-keyword">help</span> build

Command /bin/<span class="hljs-keyword">sh</span> failed with <span class="hljs-keyword">exit</span> code 1

<p>What I&#39;ve done is that I still has my &quot;developer profile&quot; attached to Debug and Developmenet, and the distribution is set to my Ad Hoc profile.</p>
<p>Am I thinking wrong?</p>

							<div><p>What do you mean by &quot;Recreating Run&#x2F;Debug settings&quot;?</p>
<p>I&#39;m seeing this exact issue as well and am unable to workaround it.  Tried multiple times creating a fresh new provisioning profile and using it, tried different provisioning profile settings in xcode.  </p>
<p>FWIW, I&#39;m able to deploy to device.  Also able to Archive and Distribute, but when I try to upload to TestFlight I get &quot;The keychain-access-group&quot; in the embedded.mobileprovision and your binary don&#39;t match.  I get this error when I try to change the Provisioning Profile settings inside xcode to use either my dev or distribution profiles.</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;m having the same problem, although only with the developer-name.  I&#39;ve tried redoing my development certificate and provisioning profile.  I made sure my device UDID was correct before doing both of those.  After that, I tried redoing my run configurations, but it won&#39;t let me select a certificate (I don&#39;t know if that matters).</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be working on fixing it real soon and the fix is scheduled to be available in Titanium SDK 3.3.0 whenever that ships. You&#39;ll be able to preview the fix in an upcoming RC build.</p>
<p>You may have some luck if you open the Xcode project, then go to the Build Phases and find the &quot;Pre-Compile&quot; script. Edit the call to &quot;ti build&quot; and add:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-literal">-</span><span class="hljs-literal">-</span><span class="hljs-comment">developer</span><span class="hljs-literal">-</span><span class="hljs-comment">name</span> <span class="hljs-comment">"Your</span> <span class="hljs-comment">developer</span> <span class="hljs-comment">name"</span> <span class="hljs-literal">-</span><span class="hljs-literal">-</span><span class="hljs-comment">pp</span><span class="hljs-literal">-</span><span class="hljs-comment">uuid</span> <span class="hljs-comment">"your</span> <span class="hljs-comment">pp</span> <span class="hljs-comment">uuid"</span>
</code></pre><p>To get the correct developer name and pp uuid, run <code>ti info -t ios</code> and find the exact values. You may also need to specify the <code>--distribution-name</code> too just in case you do an app store or ad-hoc build from Xcode.</p>
<p>No guarantees that this will work. The real fix is coming soon.</p>

The fix is still pending review, but I expect it to pass review and be merged today. After that a 3_3_X CI build will be produced and you can try that. Keep an eye out on the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;">Appc blog</a> for 3.3.0 news and expect a release candidate within the next couple weeks. Thank you for your patience.</p>

							<p>Hi,<br>I had the same problem after upgrading my handset os to 7.0.4 (from 7.0.3 which was working perfectly).<br>Here&#39;s what i did to get it working …</p>
<p>Went to Run Configurations<br>(clicked on) Selected the relevant Titanium iOS Device config<br>clicked on sdk version<br>did a refresh on certificates<br>did a refresh on Provisioning Profiles<br>clicked ok</p>
<p>back on the configuration of the Titanium iOS Device - made sure the provisioning profile matched the app name (the profile matching the app common name)</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

							<p>Hey guys, I&#39;m trying to reproduce this, but I&#39;m sorta struggling. I tested and couldn&#39;t reproduce.</p>
<p>@Brian Did you file a ticket? I couldn&#39;t find one.</p>
<p>I believe the reason the build is failing is because you are trying to build directly from Xcode from a project generated from a device build instead of an adhoc build. Rebuild your Titanium app for adhoc, then open the Xcode project and try again.</p>

										<p><p>There were a bunch of things changed in 3.2 with both the CLI and SDK. Argument validation is stricter and some changes were done to make building from Xcode better, though it seems there are some cases where there are still issues. I&#39;ll be investigating this more when I begin work on the &quot;export&quot; command. The &quot;export&quot; command will be similar to the &quot;build&quot; command, except it removes all dependencies on Titanium.</p>

							<p>I was just able to fix mine (I was having the same issues).  I re-did my certificate and double clicked to install it in Keychain after it was ready (I think I was skipping this step).  Then I created a new provisioning profile.  When it was ready, I double clicked it to make it ready for use.  Titanium was then able to recognize my certificate, new provisioning profile and device and I was able to build with no more error messages.</p>

							<p>Eamon Stafford: I still cant get it working. What do you mean by &quot;back on the configuration of the Titanium iOS Device - made sure the provisioning profile matched the app name (the profile matching the app common name)&quot;</p>
<p>AppName:<br>What do you mean the App common name ? Is that the Identifier App Id Name done in developer.apple.com instead of itunesconnect ? or is that the xcode project $PRODUCT_NAME  ? I hope you are not saying the bundle identifier (that looks like com.example.test) ?</p>
<p>Profile Name:<br>So the exact name of the profile name should match the above ?</p>

							<p>Wrestled with this for hours. A combination of two things worked for me:<br>1.) I was using developer certificates for a developer account that wasn&#39;t signed in as an account in Xcode (my clients account). I signed in to that account in xCode Preferences (Not sure if this made the difference or not, but it&#39;s something I did. May have been the next steps based on what&#39;s above.)<br>2.) Created brand new ID certificate and mobile provisions through the Apple Dev Member Center and installed them (after deleting the old ones). Double clicked on both the ID and provision to install into Keychain and Xcode. Went into xCode Prefs &gt; Accounts &gt; View Details… and refreshed everything to be sure it was all in there. Then went into Titanium &gt; Run Configuration &gt; Titanium iOS Device, refreshed the panel and selected the new ID and certificates. Run. Now go back into and select your new Developer Profile on the project Build Settings, but don&#39;t select a Provisioning Profile (leave it as &quot;None&quot;). </p>
<p>It should now build without the red flag. It&#39;s probably something coming from Titanium regarding the certificates or provisions. Hope this works for you</p>

										<p><p>Seriously, does no-one have a definitive answer for this? I&#39;ve had the issue for weeks now with the new xCode 6 and Titanium. Even bought a new Mac in the hope of fixing it. Same problem!!!</p>

							<p>Hello everyone, I have not yet solved the problem- but what happened for me was that Titanium Studio was able to build the app to the device- which was fine by me.</p>
<p>Now, Xcode 6.1.1 and Ti 3.5, it still doesnt work. Ive probably tried every step mentioned above. I have created new projects in Titanium and tried it too. I&#39;ve cleared my whole keychain on my mac, removed all keys and certificates both on the mac and in the developer center@apple.</p>
<p>So I have created new certificates, cleared xcode, reinstalled xcode, reinstalled Titanium CLI + Studio, downloaded new provision profiles and everything. I have ofcourse tried all combinations possible when code signing the app in xcode as well.</p>
<p>When I run &quot;ti info -t ios&quot; in my console, no errors detected or anything.</p>
<p>Someone with more clues what to do?</p>

										<p><p>I solved it (Not a solution to the main problem though) but I ended up reinstalling the computer 100%. Then it worked. So I guess I had something very wrong with my setup.. (It did work from the beginning).</p>
