			<p>I&#39;ve tried several times to get in touch with the makers of Titanium to resolve the various problems I have,</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The &quot;new project&quot; screen only allows the selection of Desktop projects.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The &quot;kitchen sink&quot; project does not work, it complains it is missing a defines.h in the logs.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>If I use an older version of &quot;kitchen sink&quot; the above error does not exist, however it takes FOREVER to launch iphone simulator, and then it never launches it; the same issue exists for the Android – except I have to launch the simulator manually for it to work.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The logs for iphone state:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">

<li><p>Appcelerator isn&#39;t interested in supporting you unless you pay money.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There are no video tutorials on how to install, I might be doing something wrong.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Titanium doesn&#39;t work and frankly, I do not have the time to be trawling through logs and do YOUR debugging work for you.   </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I installed Phonegap without any issues and it works fine, but Titanium requires me to constantly look through logs for bugs and then try to fix them myself. </p>

							<p>It&#39;s tough when you are new to a product, especially one like this one.  From what I know, accelerator is written in Python, translates Javascript and HTML into Java for Android AND Objective C for Iphone.  It also integrates and bridges your OS with SDKs from Apple and Google.</p>
<p>So, there is a lot to it, but trust me, if you stick with it, you can make real, valuable mobile apps without knowing much more than JavaScript.</p>
<p>The business model is Open Source, which means you can download and FREELY use any of the Python, Java and Objective C used in the setup.  That is the gift of open source. The open source model is one that creates a product of so much value that enough people will use it, and use it enough, that they will be willing to pay for support.</p>
<p>I have read very good things about the paid support from Appcelerator, and I&#39;m considering using it, but as with most opens source projects, free help from other users can be very helpful if you don&#39;t want to pay for support.  (That&#39;s what this forum is all about.)</p>
<p>Appcelerator does provide a LOT of free resources, much of which is the code shared in Kitchen Sink, but they also have a lot of information they provide directly.</p>
<p>Have you seen the new setup guide videos?  These are from the developer blog, linked in the upper right of the page:<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2010&#x2F;08&#x2F;introducing-new-getting-started-guides.html</p>
<p>I hope that helps, and I hope you&#39;ll keep trying to get things working, as I think you&#39;ll be happy if you do.</p>
