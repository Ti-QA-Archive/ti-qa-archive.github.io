		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am currentrly writing a football live score app and im struggling to figure out how Im going to implement notifications, I have used this guide before http:&#x2F;&#x2F;iosmuncher.blogspot.co.uk&#x2F;2012&#x2F;06&#x2F;implementing-apns-in-titanium-start-to.html and I can sucessfully send alerts to individual apps. </p>
<p>What I want to do is give the user the chance to recieve alerts only for certain games. so the user selects a game(s) in the app and only gets alerts when goals are scored in those games or its half or full time.<br>I could send all alerts to the app and then filter them at app level but that seems like the wrong technique to use, really I want to use a much more targetted approach and send alerts only for the games the user has selected to that phone</p>
<p>Anyone any ideas how I can implenment this please ?</p>
<p>Mike</p>

							<p>Actually, I haven&#39;t used APNS before but ACS (Appcelerator) Push Notifications but the idea should be the same.</p>
<p>The keypoint for accomplishing this is that you should assign a &quot;<strong>channel</strong>&quot; per game (that is just a unique alias of your choice) in which the user would subscribe and unsubscribe. So along with the payload you are sending now there must be a way to define which channel to use as a filter (a parameter similar to payload), so only users subscribed to this channel will receive the notification.</p>
<p>From server side you would give a unique id in each game so you would know in which channel to publish.</p>
<p>Every user subscribed to this channel would then receive the push notification you would send via your server side &quot;app&quot;.</p>

							<p>Don&#39;t pay fee for push services or any brokers per notification.</p>
<p>I just released a Titanium module to deal with Push Notifications for both iOS and Android with only one code, only one behavior and a clean and simple code.</p>
<p>Build your push notification server with any language and easily receive notifications in your iOS and Android mobile app using my Titanium module.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
