			<h1>Titanium 2.0 runs in simulator but cannot build for device</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Reposted as I accidentally locked the question preventing answers.</p>
<p>Upgraded from Titanium 1.8 and Xcode 4.2 to Titanium 2.0 and Xcode 4.3, so I could run on IOS 5.1 devices. Now it will only run on the Simulator. Have I missed something?</p>
<p>Seems to be an issue with the builder.py and run.py</p>
<p>execute_xcode(&quot;iphoneos%s&quot; % iphone_version,args,False) File &quot;&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx&#x2F;2.0.2.v20120516181650&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;builder.py&quot;, line 1224, in execute_xcode output = run.run(args,False,False,o) File &quot;&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx&#x2F;2.0.2.v20120516181650&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;run.py&quot;, line 41, in run sys.exit(rc) SystemExit: 65</p>

										<p><p>Thank you for your help. I am now running the latest nightly Titanium Build but still the same problem. Runs in the simulator but will not build to attached device or as an ipa file. I feel the problem is with Xcode does anyone have any ideas? Thanks</p>

										<p><p>Appreciate your continued help. I had been getting the SDK from this source but had not been taking it from the Master list. I have just tried the latest SDK 2.0 from the master list and still the same problem.</p>
<p>Works in the simulator but will not build to ipa file or directly to a device.</p>

<p>The issue I think is an incompatibility between Xcode 4.3 and Titanium which I understand from the the article you referred for me to was to be resolved by the release of SDK 2.0</p>
<p>If you have any more ideas that would be great - thanks</p>

										<p><p>Also followed this process to allow using Titanium 1.8 with Xcode 4.3 but still the same problem. Although Xcode 4.3 should now be supported by Titanium 2.0</p>
<ol>
<li>Live on the edge with Xcode 4.3<br>So as I stated,  isn’t officially supported by Titanium yet, but that doesn’t mean it’s not possible to use. In fact, I’m using it myself. That said, there are a few things you’ll have to do manually to be able to use it. A combination of community contributions and Xcode bug squashing will give you the opportunity to use the latest Xcode before it hits an official Titanium release.<br>How to use Xcode 4.3 with Titanium 1.8<br>Upgrade Mac OSX to 10.7.3 from “? -&gt; Software Update”<br>Download and install Xcode 4.3.1<br>Run Xcode 4.3.1 and install any necessary components if prompted. It is not required to delete prior Xcode versions, but you can if you want to.<br>Install Xcode 4.3.1 command line tools from “Xcode -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Downloads”<br>sudo xcode-select -switch &#x2F;Applications&#x2F;Xcode.app&#x2F;Contents&#x2F;Developer<br>Download and extract ios-sim-xcode4.3.tar.gz<br>Copy the new ios-sim executable to any Titanium SDK paths you are using. For example, if you are testing with Titanium 1.8.1 and 1.8.2, you would do the following:<br>cp &#x2F;path&#x2F;to&#x2F;ios-sim ~&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application\ Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx&#x2F;1.8.1&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;<br>cp &#x2F;path&#x2F;to&#x2F;ios-sim ~&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application\ Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx&#x2F;1.8.2&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;<br>Create a new project, or clean an existing one, and build for the iPhone&#x2F;iPad simulator and you’ll have your Titanium app running against Xcode 4.3 and iOS 5.1!</li>

							<p>Ok have a partial solution. Took a copy of my Titanium workspace folder. Reinstalled both Xcode and the latest version of Titanium. I then imported my project created in 1.8 and I am now able to run in the simulator and build to a device. However when I try to build for distribution it just hangs …</p>

							<p>I am now able to work successfully with Xcode Version 4.3.2 (4E2002) and Titanium 2.0.1GA2.</p>
<p>What worked for me was the following. Hopefully someone can come up with a more concise explanation, but this worked for me and I can get back to developing …</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Take a backup of your existing Titanium project directory.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fully uninstall Xcode and Titanium - make sure there are no files are directories remaining.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reinstall Xcode and the Titanium. </p>
</li>
<li><p>I imported the projects from the backed up directory into Titanium.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Can now build in Simulator, Device and as a distributable ipa file. I have not tested in Android.</p>
<p>I also looked more closely at the messages in the console and one of my projects worked fine in the simulator but would not build for device or file. The problem was with a png file. Once removed the project built correctly.</p>
<p>It could be some tolerances that were acceptable in previous versions are no longer ok.</p>
<p>Hope this is useful for others.</p>
