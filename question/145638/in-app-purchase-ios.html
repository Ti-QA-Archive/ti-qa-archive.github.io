			<p>Hi All,<br>         I am implementing InApp purchases in titanium using the TiStoreKit, everything is working fine. I have got a small doubt regarding the products purchasing. Is it possible for a user to purchase a product multiple times. My App requires that a user be able to purchase a single item multiple times for suppose<br>free version - user can use app for 2 times,<br>   for 1 $ -  increase permissible app visit by 3,<br>  for 2 $ - increase permissible app visit by 10,<br>  for 3 $ - increase permissible app visit by 20,<br>if a user first purchases the 1 $ product and increases the app visit count by 3, he should be able to do it again by purchasing it ,    rather than going for 2$ or 3$ products. This case is a sample and my app consists of a similar case</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>It depends on what type of product you are allowing them to purchase.</p>
<p>Consumables - these can be bought multiple times as the products they should be used for are for things like (but not limited to) coins, points, power ups or anything else that would help advance or assist the user within the app.</p>
<p>Non-consumables - these can only be purchased ONCE and are usually used to allow upgrades to access of the app, for example buy the ability to NOT see ads, this would only be purchased once.  Attempts to re-purchase would inform the purchasers they already have it and ask them if they want to restore it.  Your code then re-enables it.  The re-enable is for those who have changed device, they SHOULD NOT be expected to re-purchase that again just because they changed device or upgraded the OS.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that iOS rules require that free apps must be functional without an in-app-purchase [IaP], these IaPs can only enhance that functionality.  If you need people to pay in order to start using the app then you have to have a paid app and then IaPs are used to enhance the experience further.</p>
<p>So if you were writing a game, you would need to give several non-functionally restricted levels for free and additional levels could be bought afterwards.</p>

										<p><p>thanks for the answer, just a final question.. what needs to be changed in the app.js(from storekit module) to make the app work for live environment In App Purchase. I have used the entire code from app.js from store kit module, shared secret is set, Storekit.receiptVerificationSandbox is set to true.</p>

										<p><p>From memory everything is done now in the App Store submission process and valid certificates that do not use any wildcards - although you should have already set that part up.</p>
