		<section>
			<p>Hi,<br>We have our Enterprise Applications built using Microsoft .NET platform.</p>
<p>We intend to extend these applications which are currently running on a browser to aclient desktop where the user shall be able to work even offline mode and synchronise when connected and also on mobile&#x2F;tablets through a native client app to work evenon offline mode.</p>
<p>Does Applecerator be able to support the above business case since the enterprise application is on .NET platform.If so, how and what appcelerator tool i need to subscribe &#x2F; buy to realise the business case?</p>
<p>Thank you and grateful for your time.</p>

							<p>Honestly, I&#39;m not sure. I have never written a .NET app, so not sure what is involved with it.</p>
<p>If you could explain your needs we can determine if Titanium could help you. Just saying it&#39;s a .NET app doesn&#39;t help me much.</p>

							<p>I think I might be able to start on this. .net is an integrated framework which combines the backend database, code and front end within itself, using and MVC architecture.</p>
<p>To use titanium you would need to use it to create the front end either Web &#x2F; Desktop or mobile application, talking via http requests or sockets to the api interface of the backend.</p>
<p>Depending on how the .net application has been written depends on how you can directly interface into it. But simply if you can make a http request to the backend code, then titanium will provide a framework for you to develop a new front end.</p>
<p>But as Alan has asked a bit more detail of the exact requirements would enable a more direct answer to your specific needs.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>T.</p>

										<p><p>Bala,</p>
<p>As I said, I&#39;m not very familiar with .NET but database access can be done through PHP, Python, or Ruby. Titanium is a library available in javascript, so the APIs pretty much extend the functions available to you while you are in javascript.</p>
<p>There are some folks using an MVC framework with Titanium, you should be able to find an example by googling for it.</p>
