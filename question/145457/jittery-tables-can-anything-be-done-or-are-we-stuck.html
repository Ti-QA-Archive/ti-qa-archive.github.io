			<h1>Jittery Tables. Can anything be done or are we stuck?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi Folks. I have done all the usual recommendations on the forum and in the guides but still stuck with jittery table rows. So quite simply got only 20 table rows each with a view and a couple of labels with a simple light weight graphic but still get jittery scrolling on first flick through. Once you have scrolled through once its as smooth as anything until app is reloaded.</p>
<p>Is this just something we have to put up with in Titanium or has someone come up with the golden solution?</p>
<p>Would appreciate your thoughts or if anyone has got any undocumented tips. Tried all the usual classname and combining everything into a view then adding the view to the row but nothing really helps.</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Steven</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Please supply the information requested above if the following does not reveal the issue.</p>
<p>A common issue for &quot;jittery&quot; tables on iOS at least - has come down to rounded corner effect on a child of the custom <strong>tableViewRow</strong>.</p>
<p>Check for <strong>borderRadius</strong> on any view children on the <strong>tableViewRow</strong>, remove the property for testing purpose and see if there any improvements.  I have this on an iPad app I am working on right now, and removing the <strong>borderRadius</strong> property fixed the problem.</p>

							<p>If not already done, you can also try to set backgroundcolor for the rows and  the views inside, it seems to speed up the redraw.<br>If possible use fixed size (avoid Ti.UI.SIZE or FILL)</p>

										<p><p>I would have said; if you know the size use it otherwise use Ti.UI.FILL and Ti.UI.SIZE.  Careful and planned usage means there is no noticeable slow down in my experience and I have some complex and detailed layouts.</p>

							<p>Hi All. Thanks so much for your all your help. On the back of all your pointers I have had a good look at my code and noticed that my images were not quite the correct size(1 pixel too large). I took out the image from the table rows as a test and my rows were smooth. So I resized my images to 48px square (24 width, height) and added the image views back and it was pretty much 100%. </p>
<p>So rule of thumb here for others is make sure any images you use are correctly sized before using them in your rows. File size is also important. </p>
<p>The pointers by everyone here were good. Thank you.</p>
