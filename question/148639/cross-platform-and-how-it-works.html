		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>   I just read about Titanium SDK and find it nothing short of amazing that it can build for Apple + Android stores, Windows and html5. Can it really do all that? I read somewhere that for cross-platform you can use up to 60-90% of your code. So going from Mobile to Desktop I would have to re-write up to 40% code?</p>
<p>Can someone please explain how hard and how much more work is really involved in building for Html5 + Windows + Mobile? Thanks in advance and sorry for the newbie question.</p>

							<p>Robert yes you can implement native apps using titanium appcelecrator with 60-90% code re-usability.At some points  where the functionality differs for both android and IPhone we have to adjust that problem.Here are use full links for you</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;">Appcelerator docs</a></p>
<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;training.appcelerator.com&#x2F;">TCAD</a></p>
<p>And a quick google search would give you plenty of useful links related to titanium</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>Hello Robert.  </p>
<p>To answer your -very valid- question of &quot;how it works&quot;, first start thinking that all platforms are different; similar in many ways, but different.  Titanium provides the developer with a high-level SDK, which has function calls that map directly to the actual calls in the mobile OS.  This means that if iOS and Android have a native object called a button, Titanium will provide you with a way of &quot;using&quot; a button, but in the end, Titanium will tell the platform to use the native one.  Naturally there will be functions that either exist only in one platform, or will display differently; but that&#39;s the very nature of cross-platform.</p>
<p>Starting out is easy.  When you download Titanium Studio, make sure you download the &quot;Kitchen Sink&quot; project.  This sample app demonstrates most of the functionalities of the platform.  Then, make sure you check out Alloy, the MVC Framework for Titanium, which will allow you to build your UI using XML and TSS (like CSS), and CommonJS modules for your app logic, all with Backbone.js and Underscore.js built-in.</p>
<p>I have a few slide decks published at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;speakerdeck.com&#x2F;ricardoalcocer.">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;speakerdeck.com&#x2F;ricardoalcocer</a></p>
<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll love Titanium!  Have fun!</p>
<p>R</p>
