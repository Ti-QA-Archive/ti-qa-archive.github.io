			<h1>Titanium Studio asking to install Alloy and CLI each time it starts</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Each time I start Studio a dialog box appears telling me updates are available, and lists CLI and Alloy. After telling it to install, I enter my password and a few seconds later, in a box down in the bottom right corner, I&#39;m told CLI and Alloy installed successfully.</p>
<p>No Alloy templates appear in the New Project wizard and after reading and following advice in some online material, exited Studio and re-started it, but still no templates. I do however get the CLI and Alloy updates dialog box appearing again. Arghhh.</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#39;m on Mountain Lion 10.8.2.</li>
<li>Node has been installed.</li>
<li>I&#39;ve updated to Titanium Studio build: 3.0.0.201212131639.</li>
<li>I&#39;ve done a &quot;chmod 777 &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local&#x2F;bin&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>I can execute &quot;alloy&quot; from Terminal and get the help details displayed. Commands such as &quot;alloy info templates&quot; work just fine from Terminal, but for some reason, Studio seems unable to see Alloy.</p>
<p>Has anyone else experienced this problem and solved it? Any help would be appreciated.</p>

							<div><p>@Ray do you have NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX set in your environment? If so, you&#39;re likely running into the issue in https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TISTUD-2843.</p>

							<div><p>You&#39;re a star Michael, that was the problem. I had &quot;export NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX=$HOME&quot; in my .bash_profile file.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve comment the line out and after installing CLI and Alloy and then restarting Studio, I wasn&#39;t asked to install them again…. and…..  the Alloy templates are now showing in the New Project wizard.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll create a test project tomorrow and have a play. Thanks for your advice.</p>
