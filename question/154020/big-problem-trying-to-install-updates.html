			<h1>Big problem trying to install updates</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to set up Titanium for a coworker to use, but I keep getting stuck trying to install the updates.</p>
<p>I check for updates, then a window open that shows all the updates I need to install.  This is where the problem arises.  When I click &quot;Install&quot;, it opens up a box asking for my system user name and password.  The user names is pre filled, but instead of being the full user name (e.g.. John Smith) it&#39;s just the first name, with no capitalization (eg. john).  And to top it off, it&#39;s greyed out so you can&#39;t change it.  So no matter what password I put in, it&#39;s not accepting it because the user name isn&#39;t correct.</p>
<p>I read a few threads on installing updates through Terminal.  I did try those methods, but I&#39;m totally lost when it comes to Terminal, so I didn&#39;t get very far.</p>
<p>Has this happened to anyone else?  And is there a solution?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>But I actually got that part solved.  After a few incorrect password attempts, it takes you to terminal to input your password, which works.</p>
<p>The problem I&#39;m having now is when you switch the user from the admin to just a plain user.  When I try to open the project in  the simulator, I get an error message about not being able to find the command &quot;build&quot;.  It still works fine when the admin user opens a project in the simulator.</p>

							<p>What you need to enter in this Dialog window is not your complete name, but your technical user name linked to you Mac account. If you don&#39;t know your user name, there is a very simple command you can run to retrieve it. From the Terminal, simply type this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>whoami
</code></pre><p>This will return your username. (usually all lower cased)</p>
<p>As for your password, it&#39;s basically the password you use everyday to unlock your Mac. If your doesn&#39;t have that kind of mechanism in place (no prompt for password when you turn it on) then simply hitting the <strong>Return</strong> should do the trick.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
