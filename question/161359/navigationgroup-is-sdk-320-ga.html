			<h1>NavigationGroup is SDK 3.2.0 GA</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Why is that NavigationGroup is no longer supported on SDK 3.2.0 GA? I really like how NavigationGroup works because it can be added on views or windows. My app uses a lot of NavigationGroup and can&#39;t afford to rebuild it from scratch. Any idea how we can put back the NavigationGroup?</p>
<p>Thanks - Mark</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>NavigationGroup has been deprecated and <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.UI.iOS.NavigationWindow">NavigationWIndow</a> has replaced it.  This now uses the iOS7 swipe back navigation when on iOS7.</p>
<p>Keep in mind the structure of the window is now very different to how it worked before - there is no parent window required any more.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Malcolm, </p>
<p>Thanks for you explanation. Yes, I know. But even in iOS 7, Apple is still using Navigation Group. But why appcelerator is removing it? Can they just have it stay and let developer decide if whether they want to use NavigationGroup or NavigationWindow. Just my thought.</p>

										<p><p>I am not sure if you realise that NavigationGroup == NavigationWindow, to the end user they are exactly the same in look and feel.  The underlying code in Titanium changed to support the additional iOS7 features.  To you the only real difference is the lack of parent window requirement to house the NavigationWindow.</p>
<p>Having both a NavigationGroup and NavigationWindow would be an unnecessary duplication in the framework.</p>
<p>I know there are a few code changes you will need to do to remove the current NavigationGroups parent window (I had to do the same), but once it is done - it is well - done (sorry tailed off there).</p>
<p>One of the things we have to get used to (me as well) is our world is a constantly moving target, what we develop today may need feature tweaks in 6 months.  The whole Android 2.x to 4.x jump and before iOS7 and after it are good examples of that.</p>
<p>I say these things not to teach you how to suck eggs, but more of a reminder that we are the experts because we can evolve and evolve quickly so our own apps and our clients apps are always fresh.</p>
