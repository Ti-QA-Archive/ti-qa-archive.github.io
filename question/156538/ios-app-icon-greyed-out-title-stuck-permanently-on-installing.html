			<h1>iOS App Icon Greyed-Out, title stuck permanently on &#34;Installing...&#34;</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>App type: mobile<br>Ti SDK: 3.1.2 GA<br>Platform: iOS7 beta 6<br>Device: iPhone5<br>Host: OSX 10.8.4<br>Ti Studio: build: 3.1.2.201308091617</p>
<p>OK this is really maddening.</p>
<p>Installing on device gets through the compilation cycle (that is to say, app gets installed in iTunes) but once on the device, the app icon is grayed-out and app title says &quot;Waiting&quot;</p>
<p>When we click on the icon, app title changes to &quot;Installing…&quot; (still gray) and gets stuck there forever more.</p>
<p>Runs great in the simulator.</p>
<p>Have re-installed iOS7beta, have changed name and ID of application, have removed all instances of the app from iTunes and tried and tried with same results.</p>
<p>NOT: I am working on 2.0 of this application. There is a 1.0 version of this application in the app store. &quot;Updating&quot; the app to the 1.0 released version, fixes the broken app and proceeds to run great.</p>
<p>There are some notes in the Apple developer forum along these lines, but those are issues with apps in the app store, not a development and testing situation.</p>
<p>Help? Please.</p>

							<p>Hook up your device to Xcode, and look at the console output. It will tell you why it&#39;s not working. Most likely, you have a signing issue… used the wrong cert with the profile, device not included in the profile, etc…</p>

										<p><p>Thank you. Though this doesn&#39;t seem at all like a signing issue. Lord knows, I&#39;ve been through enough of those.</p>
<p>Help me out though…</p>
<p>What are you suggesting  between &quot;hook up to Xcode&quot; and &quot;look at the console output&quot;</p>
<p>Would you mind clarifying your answer a bit ,please? And you know this is a Titanium project, right?</p>

										<p><p>How the app is built isn&#39;t relevant. When something on the phone isn&#39;t working and you need more info, sometimes hooking the phone up to your computer with the USB cable, and using that phone&#39;s normal tools is the answer.</p>
<p>For iOS, that means launching Xcode, Window &gt; Organizer, selecting Devices, and select Console under your iPhone.</p>
<p>For Android, that means using adb or Android Device Monitor.</p>

							<p>I find that a project clean and rebuild can clear problems like this… It just did the trick for me.</p>

							<p>I had this &quot;run emulator button grayed out&quot; problem, and finally what I did was close the emulator, the AVD manager, aand killed the adb.exe process (I have a Windows machine).</p>
