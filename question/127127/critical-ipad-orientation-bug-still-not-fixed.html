			<h1>CRITICAL iPad orientation bug still not fixed</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi</p>
<p>I just have to get this out. I&#39;ve been waiting for months for the iPad orientation bug to be fixed. So when 1.7.3 was released I thought: &quot;Yes, finally!&quot; but I was quickly dissapointed.</p>
<p>I can see in Jira that it has been fixed in the master branch: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-2458</p>
<p>I just don&#39;t get why this isn&#39;t a priority to get out ASAP? I mean, this bug is so critical that I can&#39;t even submit my iPad app. Every user that opens my app in landscape (which is a lot) is forced to portrait mode.</p>
<p>What are my options to get this fixed without updating to the master branch, which isn&#39;t production ready?</p>
<p>You guys are doing an awesome job. You release mobile web SDKs, killer modules etc. etc. but something as essential yet simple as opening in the proper orientation doesn&#39;t work. I just don&#39;t understand the reasoning behind this.</p>

							<div><p>the same here. This bug avoided me to use 1.7.2 in an iPad project, but now I need to use 1.7.3 to ensure compatibility with iOS 5. What I don&#39;t understand, seeing the Jira ticket, is if it is or not a titanium bug or an apple specification. </p>
<p>1.7.1 works as expected and I have apps published in appstore with this behavior, I don&#39;t know why was changed after this version or how to workaround. Any idea?</p>

<p>Read the comments, I&#39;ve been warning about things like this for some time.</p>
<p>&lt;irony&gt;</p>
<p>Solution is to open thread like this:</p>

							<p>With latest 1.8.x, It&#39;s working on device running ios5, but failed on app first launch below ios5. I can&#39;t wait any longer so i forced orientation on device running anything lower than 5. Submitted app couple days ago, hope Apple don&#39;t mind rule is broken. </p>
<p>Noted<br>Ti.Gesture.orientation always return 0 on app first launch on sdk less than ios5</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">ios_version = Titanium.Platform.version;
//note, version could be 4.3.x<span class="hljs-instruction"> and </span>that's<span class="hljs-instruction"> not </span>float number, so it's better to<span class="hljs-instruction"> check </span>first char.
if(ios_version.charAt(0<span class="hljs-function">)</span>&lt;5.0<span class="hljs-function">)</span>{Ti.UI.orientation = Ti.UI.<span class="hljs-class">LANDSCAPE_LEFT;</span>}
</code></pre>

							<p>Hello -</p>
<p>I just tried to duplicate this in 1.7.3 as i had been having problems previously as well.</p>
<p>I was able to get this to work fine in 1.7.3 but I had to make a few adjustments. Try this and see if it works for you.</p>
<p>in tiapp.xml</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">orientations</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">device</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"ipad"</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">orientation</span>&gt;</span>Ti.UI.LANDSCAPE_LEFT<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">orientation</span>&gt;</span>
        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">orientation</span>&gt;</span>Ti.UI.LANDSCAPE_RIGHT<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">orientation</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">orientations</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>now within your code where you create the main window remove any references you may have to <code>orientationModes</code>.</p>
<p>making that one little change did the trick for me.</p>
<p>Good luck and post if this worked for you.</p>

										<p><p>Correction!!</p>
<p>My bad on this one - i had been in 1.7.3 but had recently downloaded a new nightly build (1.8 branch) and for some reason my tiapp.xml auto updated to the latest SDK.</p>
<p>1.7.3 does not work - however 1.8 branch build from 10&#x2F;19&#x2F;2011 has this fixed.</p>

										<p><p>John - agree with you about the master branch You need to be very careful when using that. Just noting that its &quot;coming&quot; in the 1.8 branch when its released.</p>

										<p><p>One workaround I have used that certainly isn&#39;t ideal - is to create blank images for the default portrait and landscapes and then &quot;fade in&quot; the splash screen.</p>
<p>This works well although there is a brief time when the screen goes black.</p>
