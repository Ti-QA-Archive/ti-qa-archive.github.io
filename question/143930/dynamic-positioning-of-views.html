			<h1>Dynamic positioning of views</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have an app with four tabs.  Each tab is loaded via data from web services.  If one of my users views tab 1, then changes the backend data, switches to tab 2, then back to tab 1, tab 1 should refresh with the changed data from the backend.</p>
<p>Part of the data in tab 1 is a list of phone numbers.  If the count in the list of phone numbers changes, I want to expand or retract that list as needed with views around the phone number list adjusting as necessary.</p>
<p>The way I have it implemented now is that tab 1 calls the web service upon a focus event.  The web service function then fires an event when it is done.  Tab 1 listens for the web service completion event and then populates tab 1 with the necessary views.</p>
<p>So I have several questions:</p>
<p>If I save handles to the original views, remove the views, and create new views upon each focus event, will the original views be released in memory?  Or will memory keep accumulating each time a user goes back to tab 1?</p>
<p>I tried creating all the necessary views first, but because the views are showing before the web service completion event is fired, changing the &#39;top&#39; and &#39;left&#39; properties of the views in the event listener have no effect.  Is there a way to keep a view from displaying until I have updated the positioning properties?  And, if a user comes back to tab 1, how can I adjust their positioning properties appropriately?</p>
<p>Thanx in advance for your help.</p>
