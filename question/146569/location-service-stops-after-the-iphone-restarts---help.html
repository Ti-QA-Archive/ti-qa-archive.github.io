			<p>Hi, I made a background running application for iphone using titanium location services and it is working fine. But the problem is if I turn off the iphone and turn it on again the location service is no more running. I need to open the application upon every restart of iphone to make the application to start run in background again.</p>

							<p>You will likely find that your background service doesn&#39;t just stop when the phone is restarted.  See this note in the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.1&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.App.iOS.BackgroundService">Ti.App.iOS.BackgroundService docs</a>:</p>
<p><em>Background Service Limitations</em></p>
<p><em>A background service is subject to limitations imposed by the operating system, such as</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>The OS limits the total amount of time a background service can run for after the application is paused, typically to no more than 10 minutes.</em></li>
<li><em>The OS may terminate the background service at any point to reclaim resources.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>You may be able to use LocalNotifications to run some code at a specific interval.  I have used LocalNotifications for something a little different; it did not involve location services.  At any rate, I have some lengthy discussion of this technique in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;smorgasbork.com&#x2F;component&#x2F;content&#x2F;article&#x2F;38-titanium-mobile&#x2F;139-building-a-ti-mobile-app-grilltime-part-3">part 3 of my GrillTime tutorial</a>.</p>

							<p>Hello Andres, </p>
<p>What you are trying to do is unfortunately not possible. The only way to run a background service on startup is through android (via a module). As you should know, apple does not allow anything to happen without user consent, this has always been their credo. Starting a background service or app always has to be done by the user, there is no way around this, this isn&#39;t a limit of Titanium, rather a limit that Apple puts on their devices and products. </p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Carter</p>
