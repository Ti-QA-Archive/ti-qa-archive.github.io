							<p>I ran through the same issue a long time back , quick fix …</p>
<p>1.connect your phone to the computer and create a sample android App using eclipse and try launching it on device , if you can see your device on the AVD selection then something else is causing the trouble ….</p>
<p>Actually mine din show up , the reason was due to the absence of USB driver.<br>I installed HTC Sync(mine was a HTC device) after which i was able to install on device..</p>

							<p>It won&#39;t say anything. You know only by the top right yellowish view that stops displaying &quot;Installing app on device…&quot;</p>
<p>Also on the device you don&#39;t see anything. When the Titanium Developer stops you should go to your applications and find it there.</p>

							<p>i never use the titanium app to install my apps. I just use adb to push the .apk over to my phone.  Not sure if this not recommended but i find it faster and more reliable. If you are not familiar with adb here&#39;s a quick overview (for windows).</p>
<p>1:) Open command prompt and navigate to your android\tools directory. Mine is located in c:\android\tools, i moved to this location for other reasons, yours will most likely be in your program files directory.</p>
<p>2:) Test your app so the emulator launches (this creates the latest .apk for your app in the &quot;build\android\bin&quot; folder. By default the app is just called app.apk</p>
<p>3:) in the command prompt type &quot;adb -d push &quot;PATH TO APP.APK FILE&quot; &#x2F;system&#x2F;app&#x2F;anyname.apk</p>
<p>An example for me would be &quot;adb -d push &quot;G:\apps\BenchItUp\build\android\bin\app.apk&quot; &#x2F;system&#x2F;app&#x2F;BenchItUp.apk</p>
<p>4:) I keep this window open so after i make changes to my app, i just rebuild with a test and then just hit the up arrow in the cmd prompt, that last command comes back up and i just hit enter.</p>
