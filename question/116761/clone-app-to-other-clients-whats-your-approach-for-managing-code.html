			<h1>Clone app to other clients? What&#39;s your approach for managing code?</h1>
		</header>

			<p>I work at a small ad agency as the sole developer. I&#39;m currently working on our first mobile app (using Appecellerator). The app is for a specific client of ours, but we&#39;re confident many more of our clients will be interested in the same idea for their businesses.</p>
<p>My question: Has anyone here built an app to be re-branded for other companies and distributed on the app store? I point to another company like Zoloca Labs which distributes their app rebranded for car dealers all over the country.</p>
<p>What special considerations should I make in my app&#39;s resources and code knowing that we will rebrand multiple times?</p>
<p>As a developer, I loathe the thought of maintaining multiple codebases, but since each Appcel&#39; project has its own app identifier, I&#39;m unsure of how to move forward with resale in mind…</p>
