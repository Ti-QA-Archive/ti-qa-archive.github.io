			<h1>GUI Builder for Titanium available now for Beta</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>After months of development effort, my dev team and I are proud to announce the availability of our GUI Builder tool for Titanium Studio called Forged UI.</p>
<p>Forged UI allows for drag-and-drop interface design AND code generation using Titanium API&#39;s for the iPhone and Android platform (for now, tablets to come very soon) all within the already excellent Titanium Studio IDE.</p>
<p>We are currently looking for a maximum of 20 beta testers to download and evaluate our beta and to provide feedback and bug reports if possible. To participate in the beta, please register at http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forgedui.com and once the application process closes, we will contact the shortlisted candidates directly with download and install instructions. Shortlisted candidates will also receive the GA candidate release completely free as soon as it&#39;s available.</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest and thanks to the Titanium team for releasing such an awesome product!</p>

							<div><p>Thanks everyone for the PHENOMENAL interest and response received to participate in the beta! The response has certainly surpassed my team and my expectations and because of that, we will be closing the registration period a week earlier than planned; meaning registration will close by the end of this week and we will be contacting all shortlisted beta candidates then with detailed instructions on how to download and install the Forged UI design tool.</p>
<p>So to everyone who registered, a BIG THANK YOU from the Forged UI team! Stay tuned for a welcome email by the end of week with more information on how to proceed with the program!</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone once again!</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s valuable feedback James, something we take into account as it is still possible for us to deploy outside of Ti Studio as a separate instance of Eclipse. This is still a beta and we want to work closely with the evaluators to define the final iteration (GA candidate), therefore all feedback is welcome.</p>

										<p><p>Maybe you should look into the open source Ti Developer. I use that and it does everything the old Ti dev did; but has a code editor and runs about 100% faster than Ti studio.</p>

										<p><p>James, I run tooling at Appcelerator (which includes Titanium) and I&#39;d be interested to know what you find slow about Titanium Studio and your biggest gripes. Eclipse-based products do carry a bit of overhead, but they also give a huge amount of functionality to the developer. That said, we want the experience to be great and welcome any suggestions to improve it.</p>

<li>Please run your product against Ti Dev Community.</li>
<li>Compare your product as an IDE to; Netbeans and Visual Studio.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you give me feedback, because I can see obvious differences and I can get at least one of those IDE&#39;s for free (as a professional, or both free as educational).</p>
<p>Sorry I don&#39;t mean to sound like a &#39;hater&#39;, but you guys really let yourselfs down and I hate that you cant see that.</p>

										<p><p>James, Titanium Studio is not really a realistic comparison against Titanium Developer&#x2F;Community. One is a full-fledged IDE with content assist, debugging and other features, and the other is a packaging tool with a syntax coloring editor. Different products and different workflow appeal to different people, and that&#39;s great that there is a choice. Some people prefer the command-line tooling.</p>
<p>Re: NetBeans and Visual Studio. Both are great IDEs with strengths and weaknesses. I understand that we have work to do to improve the user experience in many areas, but my purpose in asking the question is to ensure that the things we are working on align with what the community finds most important. Different people in the community definitely have different priorities. You say &quot;slow&quot; but is that startup time? Editing speed? Time to start the simulator? Packaging and deployment UI upgrades? Is it initial configuration and setup? All of those are being worked on. Some of our UI issues (confusing preferences, for example) relate to how Eclipse works and so there is work to do there to overcome those limitations.</p>
<p>That&#39;s a long way of saying that specific community feedback is very helpful and I&#39;d be happy to engage in a longer discussion online or offline if you&#39;d like to send me your impressions.</p>

										<p><p>I appreciate you guys are very far behind the likes of visual studio. But you havnt focused and got things right, not just this but most Ti projects. For instance the Ti apple api is great, but not so good for android… I dread to think what it&#39;s like for bb.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a bit mad overall at appcelerator, I feel like I made a commitment to your platform and now I&#39;m getting let down everywhere by poor product and costs.</p>
<p>I understand you don&#39;t want this kind of &#39;feedback&#39; on your forum so let&#39;s call it a day here.</p>

										<p><p>There are definitely a lot of moving parts in Titanium as a solution: The Android SDK and tools (multiple versions, platforms, and flavors), iOS SDK, IDE, build tooling, and all the rest.  With so much tech we definitely have a large surface area that needs maintenance.</p>
<p>We&#39;re heavily invested in Android - in some ways it&#39;s a much more challenging platform than iOS and our engineering resource breakdown reflects this.  Similarly, we&#39;re heavily invested in Studio - what you see today is an initial port of the best Eclipse-based web development environment that existed in the marketplace.  In the months since that acquisition, Ingo and his team have moved extremely fast to provide the level of tooling support they have, and we have lots of good stuff coming around the 1.8 timeframe to improve debugging, pre-requisite checking, and application templates.</p>
<p>Titanium isn&#39;t all bunnies and rainbows, that&#39;s for sure.  We work hard every day to make the technology work for folks, and are very pleased to hear that for a great many people it works well.  But &quot;many people&quot; isn&#39;t good enough - we want it to work well for you too, and are happy to address any specific issues you have.  Reach out to me&#x2F;us at community at appcelerator dot com with specific feedback, and we&#39;ll work together to transition that feedback into actionable todo items.</p>
<p>Thanks, -Kevin</p>
