			<h1>simple top toolbar</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>First off, excuse the lingo, but I think the name is Toolbar, Here&#39;s what I am trying to achieve is this:<br>[Path Top Toolbar] (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;screencast.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;C76Hec5PKL)<br>As you can see there&#39;s a top bar with button on the left. From my research, I see people suggest NavigationGroup but it is is iOS only, unfortunately I do target  android also. So I am thinking, maybe I will just have a View and position it at top:0 and left:0 and width: Ti.UI.FILL but this is what I am getting in the iOS simulator: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;screencast.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;6xvUxPIIZL">Monalisa of all UIs</a> strangely enough, on Android simulator it works as expected, as in, it doesn&#39;t overlay the very top status bar(the one with radio strength bars) of the phone</p>
<p>There has to be an easier way to achieve that simple top toolbar?</p>
<p>I am using Titanium Studio, build: 3.1.3.201309132423</p>

										<p><p>hi wahyudinata,<br>    In iOS7 status bar is transparent and it doesn&#39;t hide. you can set your view <code>top:20</code> for only iOS as gaurang say and give this view <code>height : &amp;#39;45dp&amp;#39;</code>  as default toolbar height in ios. Thanks. :)</p>

										<p><p>I got 2 conflicting answers, one is to add a gap the other is a appcelerator bug that is fixed at 3.2 version (below). So is the top:20 gap a temporary workaround? Also, is this only in the simulator but not in the actual device?</p>
<p>Thanks guys, I didn&#39;t realize the forum is this active!</p>

							<p>Please make sure to set the Titanium SDK to 3.1.3 GA in tiapp.xml, as this issue is already been resolved (overlapping window with status bar).</p>

										<p><p>Download latest build from appcelerator site from master, remove your previous project from simulator or device and clean build with latest SDK.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;index.html#master">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;index.html#master</a></p>
<p>It will also covering in SDK 3.2.0</p>

										<p><p>Hi wahyudinata setiawan,</p>
<p>There is some bug present in SDK but that does not mean that you can not get your desire output, find alternet way to do your work is the best choice to save time and money.</p>
<p>All developer try best to make SDK error free but there is some bug remaining in the system which is generated by conflicting environment or in perticuller situation. So it is your choice that would you like to accept any sudgession from other developer or not.</p>
<p>Here all developer gives you sudgssions only its not solution for you.</p>
<p>Please give some time to grow Platform, SDK released after testing and bug fixing. Master copy of given link is pre-release SDK.</p>

										<p><p>Oh I am sorry, I am not insinuating anything. I just wanted to know the best way to do it, if it&#39;s a workaround, I need to take a note to  remove it in the future, or whether this is the expected behavior, and more importantly I can mark the right answer as the answer. I hope I did not offend anyone.</p>

										<p><p>Hi wahyudinata,</p>
<p>I was not saying it disobligingly and apologising if it hurt you, but I am just saying that there is still improvement remaining till that we have to adjust that, after integrated success fully we can use as simple property,</p>
<p>I know till now this not a best answer to accept and feel free to revert accepting this, may be some one give you best that you deserve. I am insisting to take best knowledge among our community.</p>
<p>Thank you, Happy Coding…</p>
