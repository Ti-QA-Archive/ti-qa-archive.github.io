			<p>Hi,</p>
<p> We have a problem with our app in production, a red screen appears at the launch because of a trial module version. The module is &quot;Photoview&quot;, we paid the module three hours ago but the red screen is still visible. Could you please give us a solution as soon as possible, we can&#39;t stay with an app unusable in production</p>

							<p>Hi Yvic,<br>Have you purchased the app with the same user id as you have used to build the application? As the purchased module will only be runnable on the application build with similar id who purchased the module. But if still the problem persist I would recommend you to rebuild the project with same id for production.<br>Regards</p>

<p>We had a problem 1 week ago with the trial module PHOTOVIEW that appears into our products but was not available. One of your engineer has acted to liberate the module became available for using<br>May be it has generated a problem of ID?  </p>
