			<h1>BlackBerry Development on a Mac Coming Soon?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello, I would never bother writing an app for blackberry except that I&#39;ve already done one for iOS and Android, the client wants it for Blackberry, and this is the whole reason for having a cross platform system.  So here we go.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately blackberry development is not supported on the mac.  (Which is frustrating, because I switched to the mac to do iOS development, not appcelerator&#39;s fault i know, just saying).  So I am currently trying to setup a parallels virtual environment, hopefully allowing me to develop on a single machine.  I am finding that quite difficult, if anyone has any experience with that, please share.</p>
<p>Also, I came across this http:&#x2F;&#x2F;us.blackberry.com&#x2F;developers&#x2F;javaappdev&#x2F;macosx.jsp</p>
<p>Does this mean that titanium will be able to support blackberry development on the mac soon?</p>

							<div><p>I dumped parallels for VirtualBox a while back.  Parallels loved to get its fingers into every nook and crany of my OSX installation, and when it had an issue, all of my OSX had an issue.</p>
<p>I am disappointed in RIM. (No BlackBerry Smartphone Simulator required = be happy we are going to let you debug over tether)  There is a reason that RIM is trailing near the back of the mobile pack (without the USGov lifeline, they wouldn&#39;t exist).</p>
<p>For the record, I&#39;m not a BB hater.  Used one for a long time, got tired of slow hardware, bad updates, or waiting a year+ for native apps to interface with newer websites&#x2F;technology.</p>

							<div><p>yeah…unfortunately BB still has a large penetration into old school businesses, which are the customers for my client, which means I HAVE to do it.  </p>
<p>It doesn&#39;t really bother me not being able to debug on a simulator, the android simulators are so slow they are almost unusable, so I do almost everything on device anyway.</p>
<p>I am having a difficult time getting parallels setup though.</p>

							<div><p>android emulator is very slow, however i learned that using a multicore mac and lots of memory does wonders to it. if you&#39;re really developing for android all the time, you might consider getting a new mac&#x2F;pc</p>

							<p>You could create a virtual machine which runs windows or linux, and use that to do the development.</p>

										<p><p>Agreed.  I am working on doing that, but it is a another hurdle, and makes things messy.  Would love to have it all on one platform.</p>
