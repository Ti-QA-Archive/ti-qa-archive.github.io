			<h1>Localization defaults without using hints, and an alternative JSON i18n solution</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Firstly, this is not really a question, but more of a solution to a problem I encountered when using Titanium&#39;s localization features.</p>
<p>The problems I had with the Titanium.Locale i18n solution are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>I really don&#39;t like the way there is no support for a default language strings.xml file, meaning that I need to use hints (i.e. L(&#39;key&#39;,&#39;default value&#39;)).  I hate this solution for two reasons: firstly I need to store actual text in my app files where logic is container so all changes to copy down the line require changes to the various strings.xml, but also need changes to wherever that default is used in code file.  Secondly, I duplicate copy, so if I have a button with the word Cancel on it used in various places in my application, I need to have L(&#39;cancel&#39;, &#39;Cancel&#39;) numerous times, hardly a DRY solution.</li>
<li>I simply don&#39;t like using XML for storing resources if I can help it.  Firstly it does not support object hierarchies so it very quickly becomes unmanageable with large amounts of text, and XML is just ugly where all my other code is in Javascript &#x2F; JSON.</li>
<li>The Titanium solution is buggy, see http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-4191</li>
<li>There is no way of overriding the current locale even if you need to.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I&#39;ve come up with a simple JSON based solution, which I believe solves all the issues above.  I&#39;d love your feedback and comments if you have any.  Hope you find my <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mattheworiordan&#x2F;json.i18n-for-Titanium-Mobile">json.i18n</a> solution a help.</p>
<p>Go and take a look at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mattheworiordan&#x2F;json.i18n-for-Titanium-Mobile">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mattheworiordan&#x2F;json.i18n-for-Titanium-Mobile</a> for the small library, and a working example of how it has been implemented.</p>

							<p>Looks promising, especially for xml haters like me :)</p>
<p>One thing though (at a first glance) - I wouldn&#39;t use lang_file.json naming but lang_file.js - the files that are not .js are not compiled so if you look into the ipa file you can see them in clear.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Dan, had another quick think about this and I&#39;m really not that keen on making the files .js files for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are not actually valid JS files so validators are giving me warnings</li>
<li>I think it&#39;s useful to differentiate the files as data files as opposed to logic files</li>
<li>I&#39;m not sure I see the risk in these files being seen in the clear, they are public resources anyway which the user will see when accessing the app.</li>
</ul>
<p>Am I missing something else?</p>

							<p>Good work!<br>This suits me perfectly, as I see it as a must to be able to change the language instantly inside my app. :)</p>
