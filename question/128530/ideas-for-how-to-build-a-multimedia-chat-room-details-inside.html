			<h1>Ideas for how to build a multimedia chat room? Details Inside!?</h1>

		<section>
			<p>I am thinking of a best approach on how to solve the following…</p>
<p>I have a chat room of users, the window would simply exist with a text area for a user to enter text to chat with other users. They could also add an image into the chat room along with basic links,etc….</p>
<p>This will most likely be powered by a .net web service so I am trying to decide if it would be most efficient to simply display a webview pointing to a .net AJAX page for the chat (hence keeping most of it serverside) or keep it all local with a custom layout (tableview with labels&#x2F;imageviews&#x2F;etc) and then hitting&#x2F;pulling info from a web service db to keep updating the client..</p>
<p>Any thought to either or pros and cons??</p>

							<p>Put simply, if you do it all in .NET, the main advantage is that you&#39;ll end up with similar codebases for your front and back end. We all know that MS products are the best at playing with others, but they play great together. Going all .NET could possibly overall development easier.</p>
<p>Having said that, you are going to get a smoother, prettier, faster performing chatroom if you build it out with native components. Native UI will always beat web based UI in terms of performance and usability. You can easily pull data fro a .NET backend (I&#39;ve done it before) using <code>Titanium.Network.HTTPClient</code> and then handling the returned data as JSON or even SOAP. Check out the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;KitchenSink&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;examples&#x2F;soap.js">Kitchen Sink SOAP demo</a> that makes use of Kevin Whinnery&#39;s <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kwhinnery&#x2F;Suds">suds.js library</a>.</p>
