		<section>
			<p>Hi, I’m a newbie and trying to design a mobile app [IOS &amp; Android] that record student incident.</p>
<p>I’m using number of guides including the Forging Titanium Episode 10- Forms and have finished the interface lay out.</p>
<p>In my apps I’m trying to have lots of fields pre-populated so the teachers just need to select the value on the picker or the drop down option.</p>
<p>In the setting page there is an option for a URL address to a file [ lets call it List ]which contains Teacher name, email address and Home group&#x2F;Grade so each school can add only the teachers doing the report and as soon as they pick one of those fields the app should populate the other fields, that belong to that teacher.</p>
<p>What is the best way to do this? </p>
<p>What would be the best file format for this task to generate the List? CSV, JSON, XML  [keep in mind they are not that IT savvy]?</p>
<p>CSV would be easier for them, but how can I use that to populate those fields?</p>
<p>Should I create a database or just save the List into the file system? Given maximum number of teachers would be 40 with the three fields. </p>
<p>Any help or guide would be greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>It doesnt really matter, if you think your target Group is most familiar with CSV give them a template (e.g. Excel) and parse the CSV in your database or whatever storage you prefer.</p>
<p>If you need to add this data after Publishing the app, you are Best with a web Service.</p>
<p>You could also build a webform where the data is entered, saved in a database and your app pulls it but this requires most effort.</p>

							<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I think you can create web service on backend which will return complete list of information regarding teacher ,<br>in JSON formate via Http get or post method, you can create http client object in your application and can retrive the data and save in SQL-Lite data base and can populate the required information.</p>
