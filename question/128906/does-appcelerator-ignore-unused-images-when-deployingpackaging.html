			<h1>Does Appcelerator Ignore Unused Images when Deploying/Packaging</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Just wondering if Appcelerator is smart enough to ignore images not referenced in code, or do I need to manually remove images not used by the by the mobile platform Im deploying to?</p>

							<p>It depends on where those images are.  If they are under \Resources\android\images\ or \Resources\iphone\images\ (which is where they should be), then they will only be included by the respective platform build.</p>

										<p><p>But, ALL the images in those directories will be packaged, whether you used them or not.  It is best to clean up after yourself when you are about to do your final packaging.  Also, to a little PNG crushing to squeeze a little more package size reduction.</p>

										<p><p>Ok so to confirm this is different to the code base i.e. javascript files specific to Android will not be added to an iPhone package &amp; vice-versa?</p>

										<p><p>Stephen Feather&#39;s statement is <strong>incorrect</strong>!  Images in \Resources\iphone\images\ will NOT be packaged into the APK file for Android.  You can see this for yourself by opening the APK file with WinZip.  Also, at least when buiding for iPhone, the build process reduces the size of PNG files (you can see it doing this in the console log).</p>
<p>Gagan Tiwari&#39;s statement (text message) is correct, that any file placed in the \Resources\ directory will be packaged for both platforms (I think that&#39;s what he was trying to say).  This is why platform-specific images should be placed in the \Resources\android\images\ or \Resources\iphone\images\ directories.</p>
<p>Stuart, I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;javascript files specific to Android&quot;.  The general rule is that any file placed in the \Resources\ directory will be packaged for both platforms.  I&#39;ve never tried this, but if you have platform-specific js files, you can try placing them under the \Resources\android\ or \Resources\iphone\ directories respectively.  If that doesn&#39;t work, you can try placing them under  \Resources\platform\android\ or \Resources\platform\iphone\ respectively and see if that works.  The easiest way to test this is to build for Android and then open the resulting APK file with WinZip and see if the iPhone files got included.</p>
