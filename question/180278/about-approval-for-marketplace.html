			<h1>About approval for marketplace</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I submitted an iOS module to marketplace for approval 8 days ago, how ever, still I have not got any feedback from the authority, I sent 2 mails about this to info@appcelerator.com but have not got any reply from there too.</p>
<p>Is this normal ? Could someone share his&#x2F;her experience about submitting module to marketplace ?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>You added a comment to a question rather than as an answer.  The content of your comment suggests this should have been an answer so the author of the question has the opportunity to mark the question as answered when they feel it has been suitably answered. </p>
<p>This leaves this question in limbo as without an answer it cannot ever be marked as answered.  The community needs to be able to separate those questions that have been sufficiently answered and those that have not.  The author also has the option to add their own notes to qualify any additional steps or factors they needed to perform beyond the best answer provided.</p>
<p>This appears to be a common failing on too many of your contributions - please contribute in the correct location going forwards.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The approval process fluctuates in time based on multiple factors.  Whilst the average time is often often around 7 days it can sometimes take longer or shorter.</p>
<p>There is a large shift towards iOS 64 bit modules right now - that is likely causing a queue delay.  Additionally we are coming out of a seasonal holiday which means submissions will not have been processed in the normal time as much fewer staff would have been around - this causes a delay whilst everything is being &quot;caught up&quot;.</p>
<p>If you submitted the app 8 days ago it also means you will have spanned two weekends were staffing levels in this department differ at the weekend to the working days.</p>

							<p>I want to inform people that are in the same situation with me or just follow the thread,</p>
<p>Still no feedback about my submission, no reply to my emails sent to info@appcelerator.com</p>
<p>May be, my module is stuck in a step of submission process and so no one has realized it but I sent 2 emails to info@appcelerator.com and weirdly still there is no reply</p>
