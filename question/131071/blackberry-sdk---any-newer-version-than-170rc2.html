			<h1>Blackberry SDK - any newer version (than 1.7.0RC2)?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve been successful in building an Android and iOS app.  I would like to now focus on porting it to BB, but the SDK that I have access to is very old.</p>
<p>Is there any hope of seeing a BB SDK that will be closer to the current 1.8.0.1?</p>

							<p>RIM is in sharp decline, and for this reason it seems like Appcelerator isn&#39;t focusing on BB improvements, I haven&#39;t heard any news since they released the Beta a while ago. (Please speak up Appc if this is inaccurate.) </p>
<p>I tried to use the BB for Ti beta SDK and it was really buggy and it quickly became clear that it was impossible to make real-world BB apps with it.</p>

										<p><p>Well yes, I understand that BB is indeed a dying platform, but the &quot;coming soon&quot; BB support was the prime reason I signed up for my indie subscription.  The client I&#39;m developing the app for wanted all three platforms, with BB actually being the prime target, as many of their users are on BB.</p>
<p>I too had a nasty time getting my cross platform app to work on the 1.7.0RC2 SDK and left it behind, thinking that the RC3 would be of higher quality.</p>
<p>As David Byrne would say, &quot;Still waiting… I&#39;m still waiting&quot;</p>
<p>What does my $49&#x2F;mo get me?  Deafening silence, it appears.  grrrrrr….</p>

							<p>Just got off the &quot;horn&quot; (no phone, just chat or E-mail) with Appcelerator sales.</p>
<p>When I asked what happened to the &quot;access to pre-release software&quot;, namely BB, they indicated that they will be offering a HTML5-based solution for BB.  ARGH!  So, it sounds like native is <em>not happening</em>.</p>

										<p><p>Interesting, so really for BB apps you might be better off using phonegap, as that&#39;s more mature then any HTML5 solution that Titanium develops in the future.</p>
