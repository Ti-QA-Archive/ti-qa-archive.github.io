			<h1>Appcelerator Terms and Conditions</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Looks like there may be an issue with the current Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>Upon installation of Titanium, one is asked to agree to the Terms and Conditions of use, and it provides a link to read the TaC, which takes a user to the following page:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;terms-and-conditions-of-use&#x2F;</p>
<p>Of particular interest is </p>
<p>2) Use License</p>
<p>Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials on Appcelerator, Inc.’s web site for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not: </p>
<p>1) modify or copy the materials</p>
<p>2) use the materials for any commercial purpose […]</p>
<p>I do not see how I can read this any other way than this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can download a copy of Titanium (for a while, whatever that means though it does certainly rule out the condition that I might &quot;download forever&quot;)</li>
<li>Only to view the software (no saving any settings?).</li>
<li>Very clearly it&#39;s stated that I may not use it <strong>for ANY commercial purpose.</strong> (the important one here)</li>
<li>Also, it seems I may not make a backup of it (#1 says I can&#39;t copy it).</li>
</ul>
<p>From what I gather, people use this software for commercial purposes, and it&#39;s central to the point, when they put their software on the App Store in order to sell it there.</p>
<p>I read it because I wanted to find a piece of info that isn&#39;t there: Can non-paid members upload to the App store? I haven&#39;t seen anywhere that says the free community aren&#39;t able to upload to the app store. But it seems like they have been doing so (right?).</p>

							<p>These are the terms and conditions of the Appcelerator website.  Titanium is licensed under the Apache 2.0 open source license, so you can very happily develop commercial applications with no obligation to Appcelerator.  These license terms are included in every app you create.</p>

							<p>Not a fan of bumping threads, but I&#39;m interested in how this is viewed. I sent a query to the team about this - nothing yet there either. I made the mistake of discussing this on the same day Apple announced their relaxed policy with Non-apple frameworks - so - bump.</p>
<p>To recap, what has me worried is that the terms and conditions explicitly states we can&#39;t use this software (this is the agreement for appcelerator, mind you) for any commercial purpose. Surely this bothers someone besides me.</p>
