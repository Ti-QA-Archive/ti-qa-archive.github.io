			<h1>setAppBadge while app is closed or paused</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve been searching everywhere but cannot seem to find a definitive answer to updating the appBadge value while the app is closed. I&#39;ve seen background services you can run, but then people are saying the background service dies after 10min.  It is not possible to update the appBadge from push notifications as I&#39;ve already tried that and from what I&#39;ve read it can&#39;t be done. </p>
<p>So, what is the proper way to update the appBadge when the app is closed or paused? </p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

							<p>I use the <code>resume</code> event to update app badges. Also, you should be able to decrement the App badge in a push notification by supplying a negative number to subtract from the App badege count (on iOS using Urban Airship anyway)</p>

										<p><p>I do the exact same thing with the resume event, but if the app is closed, or paused I&#39;m not having any luck with updating the app badge with push notifications. I&#39;m not using Urban Airship, but that doesn&#39;t matter at this point. I just need to update the badge when the app is closed or paused. I see other apps doing this and would like to implement this functionality. </p>
<p>When I receive the push notification, its in the Notification Center but I never see the callback or any other method being triggered when I receive the push. The callback (within Ti.Network.registerForPushNotifications) only gets triggered when I bring the app to the foreground. Is this the way it should be working?</p>
<p>I have no problems updating the appBadge, its just when the app is paused or closed, do you experience the same thing? Not sure what else I can communicate, do you understand the issue I&#39;m having?</p>
