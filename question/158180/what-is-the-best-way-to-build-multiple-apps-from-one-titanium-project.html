			<h1>What is the best way to build multiple apps from one Titanium project?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>In the native platforms it is possible to setup projects so that one codebase can be mostly shared between several apps. The only bits that are changed are things like the app ID, splashscreen, icon, etc. What is the best way to do that with Titanium?</p>
<p>Currently it feels like the only way is to create many branches, but that does not seem efficient.</p>

<p>As for things like having to change the app id, etc, I just have an info.txt file I keep in the project directory so I know what goes with what.</p>

							<div><p>I use git these days, but sure I find scm tools very helpful. But they are best used to manage development, going from v1 to v2. If I have say 5 apps that use the same codebase but only differ in the ID and a few images, then creating a branch for each of those is a lot of merging across branches. That is what I would like to avoid.</p>
