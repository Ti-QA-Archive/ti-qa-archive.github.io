		<section>
			<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I just signed up for the Apple iPhone developer account and installed the keys and certificates as described on their website. I then went on to deploy my first app using XCode and it all worked fine.</p>
<p>Back in Titanium I&#39;m able to run my app in the simulator and it all works as well. However, I cannot click the &#39;Run on Device&#39; tab to test it on my iPod touch.</p>
<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

							<p>Thanks for the quick answer Daniel. It works now. I was not even able to get into the Run on Device tab. I installed Android in the meantime but am not sure if that was the actual cause. I guess Titanium needed some sort of updating as I just intalled the certificate today. It then suddenly changed its mind and showed the option where I could select my provision. Thanks anyway! Best, Dennis</p>

							<p>Under Run on Device, all steps must be detected by TI, otherwise the install button would grey out. </p>
<p>It&#39;s not auto-detect, just as the note implies. if the provision didn&#39;t show up, you will need to manually select it. That would be the developer profile you downloaded.  </p>

							<p>I have the same problem here. The run on device is disabled even if everything have been done correctly.<br>Everything is OK with my config and all steps have been followed (I can put my app on device with XCode) but the certificates are not detected.</p>
<p>Maybe a clue: when I open the xcode project with XCode, I have to change manually the SDK from 4.0 to 4.2 to make it work. Otherwise I have a &quot;Base SDK missing&quot; on the XCode Window that prevents the build.</p>
