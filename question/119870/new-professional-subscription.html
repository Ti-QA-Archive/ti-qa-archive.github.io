			<p>I am considering a Pro subscription for the 10 incident developer support, however my question is exactly what do these incidents cover, for example, if i am working on a project and describe a feature that I need working in an app, will they code it for me? Will they review code that I submit to fix bugs or errors?</p>
<p>I am still learning Titanium and JavaScript and so I would hope that this type of support would help me to get more complex issues coded or resolved faster than trawling the web for answers, enabling me to develop professionally as I learn, has anyone else used the pro subscription to assist in this way and how do you find it ?</p>
<p>(feedback from an appcelerator tech on this would be greatly appreciated too)</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

							<p>####Exactly what do these (10) incidents cover?<br>These cover issues you are having in your code where you get stuck and need help. If your issue results in a bug in our SDk, it will not count as one of your 10.</p>
<p>####If i am working on a project and describe a feature that I need working in an app, will they code it for me?<br>While we cant code up the feature for you, we would be more then happy to assist you in the how-to of the implementation of the feature.</p>
<p>####Will they review code that I submit to fix bugs or errors?<br>If you are having issues with your code, while we wont do a code review, we will be more then happy to help you track down the issue. </p>
