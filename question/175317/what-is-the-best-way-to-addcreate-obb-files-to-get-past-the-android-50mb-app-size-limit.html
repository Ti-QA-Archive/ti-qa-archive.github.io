			<p>I have now got to the point where I need to split my app resources so that I can upload (app.APK and Extension.APK) onto the Android PlayStore, because the app has well and truly passed the 50Mb app limit.</p>
<p>Simply put… I have the app, which is only a few Mb&#39;s, but I also have many html files with images, that need to be accessed off line because my users are often not near a phone signal.</p>
<p>Currently these files are located at follows:</p>
<p>MyApp&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;windows&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;</p>
<p>So far, I have made an obb file from the HTML folder using the terminal of Appcelerator Studio as follows:</p>
<p>jobb -d Documents&#x2F;TitaniumWorkspace&#x2F;MyApp&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;windows&#x2F;HTML&#x2F; -o appname.obb -k password -pn com.company.appname -pv 8 -v</p>
<p>This creates an APK extension file of my HTML folder!</p>
<p>I then have removed the files from within the HTML folder and created a second APK file which I assumed would be the primary APK file to be uploaded along with the above extension.</p>
<p>This method is not working….  I am obviously missing something that is needed links the two APK&#39;s or I&#39;m doing something else wrong.</p>
<p>I believe that I&#39;m not alone with this problem…. Could you please advise?</p>
<p>Is there any way for this to be done within Studio?</p>
