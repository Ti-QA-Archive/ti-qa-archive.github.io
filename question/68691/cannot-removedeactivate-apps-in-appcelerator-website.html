			<h1>Cannot remove/deactivate apps in appcelerator website</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I noticed for every failed attempt when I wanted to create a new project, the appcelerator website has an instance of that app.</p>
<p>When I clicked the X icon to deactivate the app, it returned &quot;there seems to be a problem&quot;. </p>
<p>Anyone can advice how to remove those unwanted apps?</p>

							<p>As strange as it might sound, you cannot delete apps from the My Apps section on the website.</p>
<p>Maybe we should raise a ticket about that. I mean why would I want to have every project that I am working on(even if it is a test project) submitted somewhere and not having the possibility to delete it?</p>

										<p><p>I am googling for some problems I have and I see questions about the same problem that are unanswered. I do not notice when they are posted. I just provide with an answer if I find a solution. Is that bad?</p>

										<p><p>I just noticed that I answered on many old posts. I will try to keep an eye on the date posted. But in my opinion some questions should have an answer so that people know how to solve their problem or that there is no solution.</p>
