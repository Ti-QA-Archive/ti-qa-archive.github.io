			<h1>App Restrictions?</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Will an app that simply creates a portal to a custom made app version of a website on a web server be denied acceptance into the Apple App Store?</p>
<p>If the app loads this:</p>
<p>var window = Titanium.UI.createWindow();</p>
<p>var webview = Titanium.UI.createWebView({url:&#39;login.html&#39;});</p>
<p>window.add(webview);</p>
<p>window.open();</p>
<p>After the user logs in they view pages set up inside the app from a web server.</p>

							<p>Add some functionality or added-value not present in the web version (or with a different user experience). There are no warranties that your app will be rejected, but don&#39;t give them a good excuse to do it.</p>

										<p><p>Ok. Thank you. In my mind, Facebook and Twitter count as web sites bundled as apps. Do you know if that&#39;s what they mean?</p>
<p>The app that I am building is an app for my entertainment website so I think I have the first and last covered.</p>

										<p><p>Facebook and twitter don&#39;t just link to a website and display the contents from there, they present a custom taylored experience on the device so they most certainly aren&#39;t just web site bundled apps.</p>
<p>My reading is if you just want to show a website then apple want the user to just use safari for it not an app, but..I&#39;m not apple so you may have to build, submit and see :)</p>

										<p><p>I am doing more than just displaying a website. I am building basically a mobile version of the website that will only be accessible from the app. About 80% of the pages will be stored on my web server which will be accessed by clicking links displayed on the app.</p>
<p>It&#39;s much like how you stated that Facebook and Twitter are tailored for the device.</p>
<p>I got the same thing out of the guidelines. Basically in my mind if someone builds an app that just loads their website and doesn&#39;t create an interactive or tailored experience, the app will be rejected but if someone loads their website from the app in a hidden directory on their web server with tailored content the app should be accepted.</p>
<p>I was just checking to see if anyone would be able to confirm that.</p>

										<p><p>If its not going to be available online, then why not bundle it all in an app webview? If you dont need the files to be online then having local files will let your app be used if the user is not connected to a network.</p>
<p>I think the apple policy relates to an active website in an app. If you are offering something that isnt available online I think they would accept it.</p>

							<p>One of the reasons that I was hoping to use a webview instead of building the app completely native was that webview gives me a chance to customize the look and feel of the app and include features that may not have been available on a strictly native app.</p>
<p>I feel confident enough that my design and development skills will overshadow a native app&#39;s pre-built look.</p>
