			<h1>Picker Time - setSelectedRow()</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey all, I&#39;ve asked this question before but I kept being refered to the &#39;Kitcen Sink&#39;.</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;img717.imageshack.us&#x2F;img717&#x2F;2406&#x2F;screenshot20111016at123.png</p>
<p>Referring to that image, what I want is if you push on 10:00 AM I want the picker to display 10:00 AM, if I push     12:00 AM, I want the picker to say 12:00 AM.</p>
<p>picker.setSelectedRow() is not working, the picker object exists in the background and is called into view once a time has been selected (so you can modify that row). Do I have to recreate the picker object each time, instead of using setSelectedRow()? This makes no sense to me what so ever, but its starting to look like the only solution.</p>
<p>setSelectedRow() works on PLAIN Pickers, but not Date&#x2F;Time.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Regards<br>Frustrated Dimitri</p>

							<p>i think you are looking at the wrong example in kitchen sink, look at picker_date2.js</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">value</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Date();
<span class="hljs-keyword">value</span>.setMinutes(<span class="hljs-number">0</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">value</span>.setHours(<span class="hljs-number">12</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">value</span>.setSeconds(<span class="hljs-number">00</span>);

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> picker = Ti.UI.createPicker({
    type:Ti.UI.PICKER_TYPE_TIME,
    <span class="hljs-keyword">value</span>:<span class="hljs-keyword">value</span>
});

										<p><p>Thank you for trying, but nope not what I&#39;m after. This is <strong>recreating</strong>  the Picker object.</p>
<p>Did you look at my screenshot I gave? Did you read what I wrote?</p>

										<p><p>@Dimitri I read what you wrote, but honestly the question is not that clear and you did not post any code so it is difficult to assist you.</p>
<p>It is clearly stated, that a question should be supported with code in gits or pastie, so pls try and be more patient when people are trying to help you if you have not followed the basic requirements of posting a question.</p>
<p>So if you want a better response, post some code… otherwise people will just keep guessing and then eventually get frustrated and move on</p>

							<p>Have you tried &quot;value&quot;? Setting the value of the picker directly in there? (that is what I use for the date time picker) although mine is recreating, haven&#39;t tested on a non recreating one</p>

										<p><p>Hey there, yeah I&#39;ve tried setting value, that doesn&#39;t do anything either. I&#39;m just going to resort to re-creating, don&#39;t want to waste anymore time on this. Cheers</p>
