			<h1>Stick view to side of device no matter the orientation</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey, is it possible to have a view stick to one side of the device no matter how many times you rotate it? I tried detecting the <code>orientation change</code>, but all that does is make an animation that is not pretty. What I am thinking of is possibly getting the previous orientation, detecting how many times to view was turned, and rotate the buttons to the orientation while having the view in the same side of the device. The function would return a 1 being 1 time clockwise, or a -1 being one time counterclockwise etc.</p>
<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CzY47_Dy8m0">Here</a> is my current experiment&#x2F;example of what I&#39;m trying to do using orientation change and having it dynamically change the position according to the device…but the animations aren&#39;t that special.</p>
<p>So I need help with this, have any suggestions to make it look smooth?</p>

							<p>You can set the visible screen to an opacity of 0, and show it again when the orientationchange event is finished (Or the screen has finished turning, there is no event for that, but you could set a timeout or something).</p>
<p>That way you probably don&#39;t see your view expanding&#x2F;collapsing. You can beautify it by using the Titanium animation for showing it again (A transition for the opacity).</p>
<p>Good luck, and if it doesn&#39;t work, let me know!</p>
