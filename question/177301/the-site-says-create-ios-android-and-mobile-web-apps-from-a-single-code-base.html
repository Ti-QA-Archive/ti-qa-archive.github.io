			<p>This is the claim.</p>
<p><em>My</em> single code base is on an i5 quad core machine running 64 bit Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>So. </p>
<p>Can I create an iPhone app with my single code base?</p>
<p>So far, I&#39;ve only seen the SDK&#39;s for Android and Blackberry automatically install.</p>
<p>Where do i get the one for iOS?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

							<p>Robert,</p>
<p>The answer is &quot;yes you can&quot;. The answer for you is &quot;you need a Mac&quot;. This is NOT a limitation of Titanium but a REQUIREMENT that Apple imposes on iOS developers. You cannot develop iOS apps without a Mac. Unfortunately, you cannot develop  for iOS on a Windows machine.</p>

							<p>So in plain English, the claim is just hype. Good thing I have a 15-MacBook Pro available to me. Wait, Titanium DOES run on a quad-core Intel Core i7 16GB&#x2F;1TB MacBook Pro, right? Or do you need a Mac Pro?</p>
<p>If it runs on a MacBook Pro, then what are the best practices to actually support the claim of single code base? As a <em>very small</em> development house, yes, I have a network, and yes I can set up a source code repository server, but what do I need to make this work properly? What is a good&#x2F;typical environment setup to do single code base development for iOS, Blackvberry, and Android? I don&#39;t mean iAtkos, or whatever virtual environment you can think of, which violates the Apple OS licensing agreement.</p>

										<p><p>I would not say our claim is hype, but I guess that&#39;s opinion and perspective. If you meet the development environment requirements as spelled out in our documentation, you can write an app for all platforms from a single codebase. </p>
<p>We rely on the native development tools (the compilers and SDK libraries provided by Xcode, Android development kit, Blackberry development kit). The Titanium code you write is prepared by our tooling, but ultimately compiled for the target platform using those vendors&#39; native tools. Thus, we are constrained by the limitations put forth by those vendors. </p>
<p>Apple releases Xcode only for OS X (their choice, not ours). To run on Windows or something else, we&#39;d have to re-create their SDK, their compiler, linker, debugger, code signing tools, publishing tools, etc. That&#39;s way beyond our mission and would introduce a whole new layer of potential bugs, missing features, development lag time, etc.</p>
<p>There are hacks for running OS X on a Windows computer; I don&#39;t recommend any of them nor do we support any of them officially. You could subscribe to one of the many &quot;mac in a cloud&quot; hosting services to run Xcode on a remote Mac. I encourage you to try the other development tools (our competitors) – other than a few offering cloud-compile services, none of them let you publish an iOS app without a Mac at some point in the process.</p>
