			<h1>Contact email on iOS</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>FYI - trying to get contact email on iOS works in emulator, but crashes on the device.</p>
<p>if I just simply add this line to my code, it crashes on the device (4.2.1 3GS &amp; 4).<br>contact.email</p>
<p>I can use contact.phone and iterate over the phone just fine though.</p>
<p>(Using Ti SDK 1.5.1)</p>

							<p>I have had <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;46421&#x2F;showcontacts-crashes-on-device-only">this issue</a> for over 6 months.</p>
<p>My best guess was that it was somehow related to the exchange labels on contacts not being consistent with those of the iPhone.  See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32238&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;2317-contact-picker-crashes-when-selecting-an-email">this ticket</a>, which offers a potential work around…..which for me doesn&#39;t fix the contact email issue, but your success may be better.</p>
<p>I really wish this could be resolved!</p>

										<p><p>It&#39;s a shame, but it seems like appcelerator is more a js framework for Android than a cross platform one.  This is just one of the many inconsistencies that i have found with the SDK.  The dev teams concentration is definitely on Android.</p>

										<p><p>Well from my experience I can say at first Appcelerator focussed on iPhone development, but now, with their cooperation with Paypal they focussed on Android, because it was way underdeveloped compared to iOs. </p>
<p>I think we are not in the position to complain about Appcelerator. It is free, although loads of people are working on it and pushing new versions every 6 weeks or so. I love it. It enables me to quickly develop and deploy applications. Minor glitches such as this contact thingie will be fixed for sure. I guess.</p>

							<p>Has this been fixed?  Is there a publicly accessible workaround?</p>
