							<p>If you search the Q&amp;A you&#39;ll find many people have the same size concerns.</p>
<p>Here are my observations about the APK and app size since I too have been looking into this. </p>
<p>With SDK 1.8.x you generally for even the most basic app (ie default template app) end up with a 5.2Mb APK file. If you unpack the APK, it expands to between 11Mb and 12Mb. The files that make the APK and app so big are the v8 libraries of which there are two, each library is about 5.2Mb big. The reason there are two libraries is (from what I can tell) is that there is one library for older device architecture and one for newer device architecture. So if you want to use SDK 1.8.x and the V8 javascript engine you&#39;re stuck with these files sizes. </p>
<p>One way to drop the file size is to either use SDK 1.7.5 or not use the V8 javascript engine. </p>
<p>If you don&#39;t need the updates, bug fixes and speed of SDK 1.8.x then you can shrink a basic app&#39;s APK file size to about 2Mb, the expanded folder size will be about 4Mb. </p>
<p>If you want to use SDK 1.8.x then you can choose to use the Rhino javascript engine rather than the V8 engine. Not using the V8 engine, you loose it&#39;s speed and other optimisation related features but app still work fine. SDK 1.7.5 uses the Rhino engine BTW.<br>So if you use SDK 1.8.x with the Rhino javascript engine for a basic app the APK file size ends up being also about 2.1Mb and the unpacked size of about 4.2Mb.</p>
<p>So as you can see from my experimentation there are really just two ways to cut down the APK file size, use S.D.K 1.7.5 or use S.D.K 1.8.x with Rhino.<br>The V8 javascript engine will add about 3Mb to your APK size, and 6Mb to your unpacked app size, but for that you get additional javascript execution speed and other optimisations.</p>
<p>As for optimisations outsize the SDK, you can look at optimising the file resources that are included in your app. For example some images might be smaller as JPGs rather than PNGs, some images might be smaller as indexed GIFs or PNGs rather than 24bit JPG or PNG files. Obviously you also want to remove any unused files from your resources directory. You can also host some resources (images, videos, etc) online rather than including them in the app, this would require that you download them once off or reference them as the app needs them, this obviously means that your app would need internet connectivity to run.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

										<p><p>On Mac OSX I found it useful to run a script after building for Android (we are using the V8 engine)  Create a file e..g,  distribution.sh and put it in the root of your project.  You can then run your Appcellerator terminal.  Don&#39;t forget to change the MOBILE_SDK and ANDROID_SDK vars to suit you</p>

										<p><p>I switched from V8 back to Rhino and now my app (in .apk and after install) is less than half the original size. After installation, my app went from 16.8MB to 7.8MB - still ridiculous but made a big difference for a small app. Thx for this :)</p>

										<p><p>I have not tested this but if u wanna make it work for Only lower versions then you should delete the armeabi-v7 and leave  armeabi as it is. It should work for lower versions then.</p>
