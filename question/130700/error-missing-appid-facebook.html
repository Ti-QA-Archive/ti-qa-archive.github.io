<p>that, btw, is a not so subtle hint for your next steps.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m sorry, acting in what way?</p>
<p>Asking why you think we can help YOU fix your lost facebook account, or your lost facebook app ids?</p>
<p>We can&#39;t. This is outside of anyones purvey but Facebook&#39;s.</p>
<p>You will need to setup a new facebook account, new app id, republish your app with the new credentials.</p>
<p>Additionally, asking for help on a 1 year old thread is unlikely to get any traffic in a normal situation AND your question has almost nothing to do with the original question.  Had i not been subscribed to this question, your comments would probably have never been seen.</p>
<p>So, before you get all snippy, maybe you should read how to ask a proper question:</p>
<p>Missing from your question are a number of important pieces of information. I suggest you take a look at the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Using+Questions+and+Answers">Using Questions and Answers</a> article, specifically the Q&amp;A Question Checklist.  The missing information is critical to reproducing problems in a test environment and often indicates other factors that cause the undesirable outcome you are experiencing.</p>

										<p><p>Stephan,</p>
<p>You could say &quot;That this is facebook related issue, please try on facebook&#39;s forum&quot;.</p>
<p>Instead you are making whimsical comments like unless it will become facebook forum and so..</p>
<p>Any way whatever you added may be useful for someone  but it could be great if you could made it quit polite.</p>
<p>Additionally I put my comments under this q. as i was unaware of more than one year q. is hardly visible by the users and traffic jams etc.</p>

							<p>Dear Stephen,</p>
<p>I am trying to help people offering questions and solutions. I am a developer not an expert like you.<br>Please bear in mind that acting this way you are not helping the community.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br>Sourabh</p>
