			<h1>Titanium is incompatible with iOS 4.3?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>After having installed the latest of Titanium (Titanium Studio, build: 1.0.4.201108101535) and Xcode 4.1 (Build: 4B110f, iOS SDK: 4.3), and Titanium insisting the iOS SDK is not installed, I can only conclude that Titanium is not compatible with the latest release of Xcode &#x2F; iOS SDK.</p>
<p>The latest release of Titanium was released on Aug 10, 2011, while the latest release of Xcode was released on Aug 29, 2011.</p>
<p>I hope the developers are looking, because this is pretty annoying.</p>
<p>I&#39;m off to try and find an older Xcode version I guess.</p>

							<div><p>The IOS SDK seems to be 4.3 in both the latest version of Xcode and the version of Xcode before it (4.0.2). So its my guess currently that something has changed in Xcode 4.1, rendering its SDKs incompatible with Titanium. I will find out eventually, after my Xcode 4.0.2 download finishes in 2 hours (hate AT&amp;T slowband).</p>
<p>I let Xcode install itself and all its components to all default locations, did not change anything there.</p>
<p>I am running OSX Snow Leopard, 10.6.8.</p>

							<p>XCode 4.1 for Lion won&#39;t work if you are running Snow Leopard. You&#39;ll need to use the 4.0.x version of XCode to be able to use it properly.</p>

										<p><p>Apple does have an Xcode version 4.1 for Snow Leopard (separate from the one that is for Lion, which I suspect you can&#39;t even install on a Snow Leopard system), but this confirms my suspicion that I need to install Xcode 4.0.2, thanks!</p>

							<p>OK very confused by this. I am running OSX Lion, without issue so I have just checked Xcode and running version 4.1.. I have recently (last couple of weeks) upgraded to Lion, and Xcode was not automatically included in the upgrade so I downloaded the latest version.</p>
<p>I have not had any issues at all, and the latest version of studio which updated earlier Today on my machine so probably released last night in the US.</p>

							<p>Yeah that does sound strange indeed. What exact version of Titanium are you running?</p>

										<p><p>Yep that&#39;s it then, because my version is only 1.0.4, and built on Aug 10. I wonder how I go about getting that same latest version, if I run the update function from inside Titanium, it only says &quot;no new updates&quot;. If I download it from their site, I only get the Aug 10 1.0.4 version.</p>
<p>Is Titanium 1.0.5 only available if you are running Lion or something perhaps?</p>
<p>Titanium developers, if you are reading this, can you please clarify?</p>

							<p>If someone else has this same problem, I can report that installing Xcode 4.0.2 DOES fix the problem - Titanium now agrees that the iOS SDK is installed.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, now its telling me instead:<br>iPad deploy target requires iOS version 3.2 and above.</p>
<p>So does it think that the iOS version is &lt; 3.2 ?!  Can&#39;t imagine why Titanium would think so, since the iOS SDK version is 4.3!</p>
