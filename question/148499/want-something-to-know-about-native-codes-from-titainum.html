			<p>Hi Everyone,<br>I hope somebody can give me this info. I know that Titanium generates native language files for both Android and iOS. Is it possible that I could use the files of native language (say for android) generated by Titanium JAVA files to make changes into the app natively. Say after development, if I want to add some features in the app, can I do it natively means can I develop that features using native language JAVA for android and use XML files for changing the UI. My english is bad . Hope you understands my question.<br>Same can be done for iPhone means can I also do work with xcode. with files that Titanium generated.</p>

							<p>Hi Nadeem, what you understand in little different in reality. Titanium does a mapping for JS files and Native Code for that using Java Script Engine of the platform.<br>Titanium SDK contains module and map java Script coding using Kroll Bridge.</p>
<p>but still there are 2 ways to use native coding in titanium.<br>JS –&gt; Java Script<br>1: create Titanium Module for what you want in titanium and then use it using JS.<br>2: you can do native changes after build form titanium also but you have to be expert in native side then.</p>
<p>for iOS you can refer by blog where i show case this.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Ashish thanks for your response. I have worked a lot on Android native development, I know Android very well. As much as I understands the answer of my question is no. I want opposite of what you are telling me and that is suppose I have created a new project as default a two tab app is created by titanium. Now suppose I want to do some changes say I want to add a button and do something with that. But I want to do this using eclipse and JAVA in .java files and .xml files for UI. Is it possible. Because I have tried by importing android folder in build directory of titanium project, but there are no .java files in src folder.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Nadeem, i am planning to post the same blog for android but not getting time to do that and work is in between. so may be you have to wait for some time.</p>
<p>else you have to do some R&amp;D to achieve this. in general it is NO as not recommend by appcelerator and it is difficult to make Native changes after build also.</p>
<p>But i will make it possible and easy in some time for all. till then Good Luck.</p>
