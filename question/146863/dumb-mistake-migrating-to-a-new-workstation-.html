			<h1>Dumb mistake migrating to a new workstation !!</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I got myself a shiny new Retina Macbook Pro and set it up with a nice friendly user ID kevin … but then (dohhh!) I migrated all my software across from the old machine which had the user ID of ksalt … now, whenever I try to run the iPhone or iPad emulators in Titanium I get the following error message:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-list">[<span class="hljs-keyword">ERROR</span>] :  ** BUILD FAILED **
<span class="hljs-list">[<span class="hljs-keyword">ERROR</span>] :  The following build commands failed:
<span class="hljs-list">[<span class="hljs-keyword">ERROR</span>] :      ProcessInfoPlistFile <span class="hljs-string">"/Users/ksalt/Documents/Microsoft User Data/Mac Developer build products/Debug-iphonesimulator/WolffGang.app/Info.plist"</span> Info.plist
<span class="hljs-list">[<span class="hljs-keyword">ERROR</span>] :  <span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">1</span> failure)</span></span></span></span></span>
</code></pre><p>It works with the Android emulator because I didn&#39;t have one installed until I got the new workstation. I have already reied removing all instances of Eclipse (XZend Studio, Aptana and Titanium) and the original Xcode … and I have gone systematically through &#x2F;Applications,  &#x2F;Library and ~&#x2F;Library cleaning out any reference to Developer, Titanium or Xcode, then I reinstalled Xcode and Titanium fresh and clean, but it still happens … I&#39;ve reached the stage where I&#39;m tearing out what little bit of hair I have left … Heeeelp !!</p>
<p>Where does the system store that path &quot;&#x2F;Users&#x2F;ksalt&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;Microsoft User Data&#x2F;Mac Developer build products&#x2F;Debug-iphonesimulator&#x2F;&quot; … I can&#39;t even find it with a grep of the entire world !@@!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance Mac, Xcode and Titanium gurus .</p>

							<div><p>Hi Trevor - Thanks for the fast response. In fact I&#39;ve deleted all my old projects (backed up already) and started with a completely clean slate. I created a project then immediately tried to run it in the simulator and I got this error.</p>

							<div><p>Aside … I created a user ksalt, then symlinked &#39;his&#39; home directory to the real &#39;kevin&#39; home and now I can start the simulator but it bombs with a different error when trying to run the project. </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[DEBUG] Sessiocould not be started: Error Domain=DTiPhoneSimulatorErrorDomain Code=<span class="hljs-number">1</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Unknown error."</span> UserInfo=<span class="hljs-number">0x10050cab0</span> {NSLocalizedDescription=Unknown error., DTiPhoneSimulatorUnderlyingErrorCodeKey=-<span class="hljs-number">1</span>}
</code></pre><p>I&#39;m currently trying to run it in Xcode and as soon as I opened the project, Xcode started to download OSX 10.8 Core Library, so it looks as though it may be retina support which could be the cause of the secondary issue. I&#39;ll report back as soon as the d&#x2F;L is done, but I&#39;m still keen to find out wherre this old &#39;ksalt&#39; artifact is hidden away.</p>

							<div><p>Now Xcode will start the simulator and run the project but it can&#39;t find app.js in the simulator directory. If I copy it in there it starts to ask for other missing files one by one … so now it&#39;s a bit better on the simulator side, but not on the app side :)</p>

							<p>I took the pragmatic approach and just renamed my user account back to ksalt. Now I don&#39;t get the path error I originally had, but I still have to sort out the other issue about not being able to run the app inside the iPhone simulator. However, since that is a completely different issue I&#39;ll call this one closed and pursue the new problem for a while.</p>
<p>Thanks Trevor.</p>
