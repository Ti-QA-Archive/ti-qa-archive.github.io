			<h1>Android Expansion Files</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>It looks like Android now allows for up to 4GB for the apk. It still is set to 50mb but they are giving us two expansion files that can be up to 2GB each. Is there anything we would need to do through Titanium to use those expansion files? I have been looking around but haven&#39;t ran into the answer yet. Any info would be great. Thanks</p>

							<div><p>I have an Android version of my app that is 241MB (mostly images and audio files). While I can download and test it directly to an Android device via USB, I can&#39;t upload it to the Google Play site for distribution due to the 50MB limit. How would I implement the expansion files in Titanium? Would really like some help here too!! I&#39;m not seeing any support for large Android app size in Titanium that would lead to easy distribution on Google Play.</p>

							<p>+1 ran into exact same problem – how do we do it from Titanium? For a native app you would need to make some code changes to handle Google Play Expansion Files. I don&#39;t believe there is a platform-level support for it in Titanium. If someone got it to work, or has a work-around … please share! Much appreciated.</p>
