			<h1>Autocorrect/Suggest doubling textfield on save</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>3 text fields that are opened within a modal window (First&#x2F;Middle&#x2F;Last Name).  It&#39;s important that all three have Autocorrect and Autocapitalize (hard request from the client).</p>
<p>onClick of the SAVE button within this modal I&#39;m recording all three values in an array then saving them.</p>
<p>Example where I&#39;m having the &quot;problem&quot;:</p>
<ul>
<li>User enters &quot;Johnso&quot;  in the Last name field, then gets iOS prompt to complete &quot;Johnson&quot;. </li>
<li>Users hits the space bar to accept this, and the name completes, but with a space after it.  </li>
<li>User hits backspace to remove the extra space and is prompted by iOS with other words.</li>
<li>User hits SAVE without clearing the iOS suggestion</li>
<li>The record saves and the modal closes but the LastName Field is doubled (JohnsonJohnson)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;ve tried to BLUR the text fields when save is clicked, and even setup separate listeners to fire on that BLUR, but still it always double.</p>
<p>Removing autocorrect removed the suggestions and fixes the problem, but that is not an option with this client.</p>
<p>This is an edge case, but this is how my boss enters data so to him it&#39;s &quot;a bug&quot; that I have to fix.</p>
<p>Any ideas how to get around this?</p>

							<p>It&#39;s cheap but it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blur all textfields in modal (clear autosuggest)</li>
<li>Focus on the LastName Field again (to let iOS get the proper value)</li>
<li>Add a quick setTimeout to process the data and close the window (100ms)</li>
</ul>
<p>this seems hacky and will work but I&#39;d love a more stable solution if anyone has ideas please let me know.  thank you!</p>

							<p>It might just be easier to deal with the value than with the functionality. When saving, simply strip trailing spaces from the value. Then you can just leave that last space because it will get removed anyway. Only removing trailing spaces will also allow you to have spaces in the middle of values if, for some reason, you need that.</p>

										<p><p>thanks for the idea, i apologize if this wasn&#39;t clear, but the problem is when the user tries to remove the extra space on their on. The problem is not with spaces being saved, the space save works fine and we don&#39;t care if that&#39;s in the database or not.  </p>
<p>However after the user backspaces using the keyboard, an iOS suggestion&#x2F;complete pops up on most words.  If they do not clear that suggestion and click save then the data displayed in the textfield is normal, but the save .value or .getValue() will be doubled everytime.</p>
<p>thanks again, we are going to launch like this and try to revamp as we go.</p>
