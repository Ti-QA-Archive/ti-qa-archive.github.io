			<h1>How to TERMINATE a app? (Not for store, we are Enterprise)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>PREFACE: I see every reason why you cannot put &quot;Exit&quot; application button on your app if it is going into the store… well, ours is not. It is ad-hoc right now, but will be Enterprise, so we do not have to adhere to the rule. The app is private to our firm, we have over 20 apps on the Market - this is just the first time I have been required to implement terminate to mimic a Windows phone app 100%.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">applicationWindow</span><span class="hljs-class">.setExitOnClose</span>(<span class="hljs-tag">true</span>);
<span class="hljs-tag">applicationWindow</span><span class="hljs-class">.close</span>();
</code></pre><p>Does not always work on the DROID device. Meaning, the window does destroy, but I am left with a blank background.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var intent = Ti.Android.createIntent({action: Ti.Android.ACTION_MAIN})<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
intent.addCategory(Ti.Android.CATEGORY_HOME)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
Ti.Android.currentActivity.startActivity(intent)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
var activity = Titanium.Android.currentActivity<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
activity.finish()<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>Does take me back to the device HOME page, but task manager shows my app is still running. Mixing both together, leaves a RUDE scenario of relaunching the app and getting a totally blank background.</p>
<p>&#x2F;&#x2F; For iOS I purchased the module to support EXIT. (have not tried yet for iOS)</p>
<p>So, does anyone know of the correct process&#x2F;steps to simply do .terminate() to your DROID app? Or even, mypid = getPid(); kill(mypid); would being fine… Our app must truly TERMINATE, not suspend.</p>
<p>Maybe a way to fire &quot;android:back&quot; to exit the app?</p>
<p>Thanks for ideas, suggestions, and possibly a solution.<br>Running v.1.8.1 and 1.8.2 is that matters.</p>
<p>Ozz</p>

							<p>In the docs is specified you should set exitOnClose:true on the creation time.<br>Try to move that flag into the properties of the window.</p>

										<p><p>Unfortunately these windows are created 100% at run-time, via streamed JSON files from our servers. So the createWindow does not know if it will have an EXIT button until it is too late. I will hard code and test and let you know if that resolves this screen. However, I do have another screen with the EXIT button and my quoted code above - and it works fine. It appears the deeper (or longer) the app is running through multiple JSON driven screens - it loses context that exitOnClose on the current window, is - the only window.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Ozz</p>

										<p><p>Okay - tested. It does exit the app, however, when you check the task manager - the application is still running. Thus, when you go back in - you just see a blank screen. It only applies to EXIT on the 4th or 5th screen and later. The first screen, EXIT terminates perfectly. This app has been through every profiler we can find (XCode Instruments, etc) - no leaks. So the applicationWindow current instance, is the <em>only</em> active window unless there is a bug in 1.8.1 and 1.8.2.</p>

										<p><p>This is somewhat unrelated, but streaming parts of your application other than pure data from your servers is extremely risky, especially if you&#39;re streaming code that is going to be executed. All someone has to do is set up a wifi network near one of your users, and they&#39;d be able to change whatever is streaming into your app.</p>
