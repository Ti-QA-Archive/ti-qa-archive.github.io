			<h1>Facebook publish Stream broken</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Has Facebook updated it&#39;s API? Titanium&#39;s publish stream function is now broken (both in my app and in Kitchen Sink). The hyperlinking is not working. Does anyone have any inputs on how to fix this?</p>
<p>Updating with more info after seeing Dan&#39;s response.<br>Titanium SDK: 1.5.1<br>iOS SDK: 4.2</p>
<p>Issue with PublishStream:<br>The text (specified as the properties parameter) has HREFs but is not hyperlinked in the dialog box on iPhone&#x2F;iPad. The message is published just fine and when you view it on Facebook it has the hyperlinks in all the right places. It&#39;s just that the preview in the dialog box is screwed up.</p>

							<div><p>Sid K… I&#39;m experiencing the same issue with mine… the preview seems to have lost all it&#39;s styling. It is even the same in the kitchen sink… did you manage to find out why?</p>

										<p><p>Dan: Don&#39;t you notice anything funky with the fonts and the disappearance of hyperlinks in the preview? I updated the original question with a little more info.</p>
