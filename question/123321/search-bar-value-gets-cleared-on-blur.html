			<h1>Search Bar value gets cleared on blur</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a search bar attached to a table view. See code below. When I type a search term and select one of the results, which opens a child window, the search term and result set get cleared.</p>
<p>So when I return to the search window from the child window the search bar is empty and the full set of rows is displayed in the table. I would prefer and expect that the window is the way I left it - search term still in the search bar and only my search results displayed so I can pick a different one.</p>
<p>Is this behavior by design? It is not what I find in other iPhone apps.<br>In any case, how would I make it stick?</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var searchBar = Ti.UI.createSearchBar({
                    hintText:'Search'
                });

var <span class="hljs-built_in">table</span>Data = buildTableData();

var <span class="hljs-built_in">table</span>View = Ti.UI.createTableView({
                    searchHidden:false,
                    scrollable:true,
                    filterAttribute: 'search_text'
                });

<span class="hljs-built_in">table</span>View.<span class="hljs-built_in">set</span>Data(<span class="hljs-built_in">table</span>Data.rows);
<span class="hljs-built_in">table</span>View.index = <span class="hljs-built_in">table</span>Data.index;

win.add(<span class="hljs-built_in">table</span>View);
<span class="hljs-built_in">table</span>View.search=searchBar;

							<p>I&#39;m not sure there is a property method that will persist the search entry, but you should be able to save the search and re-enter it on focus of that particular window.</p>

										<p><p>Anthony I considered that option. Thing is, I originally had this implemented as a detached search bar and table view and queried the database on each change event of the search bar in order to display the correct result set.</p>
<p>Everything, including the problem described here, worked fine, but I opted to use the built-in functionality of an attached search bar since that is probably more efficient because it filters the table instead of hitting the database and rebuilding the table for each change event.</p>
<p>I guess I will have to experiment a bit to see what works best in the end.</p>
<p>Do you happen to know what the native behavior is? As a user I would expect to return to a window the way I left it. Would be nice if it was supported by the SDK. Programmatically running a search after it has been cleared is possible, but also visible to the user (when you click on a result row, you see the text disappear and the table reset).</p>
