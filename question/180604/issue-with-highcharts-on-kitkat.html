			<h1>Issue with Highcharts on KitKat</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, </p>
<p>I&#39;m using Highcharts on my app, it was working fine on all Android versions since KitKat was released. Now on phones with KitKat, the chart is never been displayed in the webview.</p>
<p>Is anyone having the same problem? or a similar issue?</p>
<p>Thanks<br>Eric</p>

							<div><p>HI Narendra,<br>I found the problem last night, looks like kitkat is not as forgiving as the it&#39;s predecessors… There was a negative value on the data I was passing to highcharts, it wasn&#39;t a problem before, but it looks like it is now…</p>

							<p>Hi Eric,</p>
<p>I am also having a problem with Highcharts with Webview on Android.  My problem is that when I run my Titanium app on my device, the charts appear no problem. But the same code, when I compile to upload to Google Play, the chart wont draw.  Did you manage to get the chart to draw and publish your app successfully?. Mind sharing your findings and bits of your code?  Thank you in advance.</p>
