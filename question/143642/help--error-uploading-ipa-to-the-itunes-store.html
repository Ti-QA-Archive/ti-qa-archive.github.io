			<h1>HELP ! Error uploading IPA to the iTunes Store</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I wrote an update of my iOS app. The last one was available only on iPhone and iPod, the new release is adapted to run on iPad too.</p>
<p>But when I try to upload the ipa file with the &quot;Application Loader&quot;, it stops with an error message :<br>&quot;An error occured uploading to the iTunes Store&quot;.</p>
<p>I found that it could come from the java library. So I installed the new Java for OSX Lion 2012-005 as it was required… Nothing changed…</p>
<p>Application Loader is not giving me any feedback about the issue… I need to publish my update ASAP, so does anyone have a solution ? I have no idea of where the problem could be located… Is it possible that Apple is having troubles with it ? Or does it come from my project ? My mac ? My provisionning profiles ? No idea where to look for a solution…</p>
<p>Thanks a lot !</p>

							<div><p>More precisions : I am able to run the app on the simulator, and to install it on my device…. My tiapp.xml seems to be OK… but what is giving some hesitation is that I needed to create a new Titanium Mobile Project and restart coding the update from the beginning. So the tiapp.xml is having the same parameters but it is not exactly the same… don&#39;t know if it could cause some problems…</p>

							<div><p>How about you slow down, and walk through the steps you take in TiStudio to submit this.</p>
<p>You mention &#39;ApplicationLoader&#39; which is an APPLE tool.</p>
<p>I know you seem to be under the gun to get this out, but you come across as rambling.</p>
<p>Need to know precisely what you have done.</p>

							<div><p>First of all, I created a new Titanium mobile project, to completely rework my current app (wich was the first one I did with Titanium).</p>
<p>So the tiapp.xml is new. I entered the same parameters as in the previous version (app name, app id, url, publisher, copyright… and I only changed the version number to 2.0).</p>
<p>Then, when necessary I added the qr reader module I used, which is acktie for iOS version 1.3 ( I didn&#39;t make the update to 1.6). When my app is over, I test it several times with the simulator (iphone and ipad) : running well<br>Test it on my device : iPhone 4 with iOS6 : running well too…<br>And then try to build the .ipa file with my ad-hoc provisionning profile. After that I go to itunes connect, register the new version (2.0), write the description of the update etc…</p>
<p>And finally I started the Application Loader, select my new version registered on iTunes Connect and try to upload the ipa file. And then the error while uploading file appears…</p>
<p>So I tried the production profile… I tried to update Java…</p>
<p>No solution at this time… I&#39;m a bit stressed… :-s</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;m keeping heading on the Java version problème. I worked on a Android version too, so my library probably changed a bit during last weeks.  In the next post on the devforum of apple, someone is telling that Oracle Java SE7 is giving some troubles uploading with the application loader</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devforums.apple.com&#x2F;message&#x2F;705884#705884</p>
<p>My problem now is that Java is correctly installed : &quot;java -version&quot; command line returns :</p>
<p>java version &quot;1.7.0_05&quot;<br>Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_05-b05)<br>Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.1-b03, mixed mode)</p>
<p>But I don&#39;t see &quot;Java preferences&quot; in the Applications&#x2F;Utilities folder…. hu…. think i&#39;ll shot myself…</p>

							<p>Okay… I finally found where the issue was…<br>As I supposed from the beginning, it comes from the Java Library !</p>
<p>After having tried every updates on the web, nothing worked. If you don&#39;t see the &quot;Java preferences&quot; tool under &quot;Application&#x2F;Utilities&quot; folder, you have to manually remove every files of Java 1.7<br>In my case, I only keep the 1.6 version. To be sure that the version is 1.6 you can check the current version by typing : $ java -version.</p>
<p>The 1.6 jdk is here : &#x2F;System&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Java&#x2F;JavaVirtualMachines. So remove  every files in : &#x2F;Library&#x2F;Java&#x2F;JavaVirtualMachines</p>
