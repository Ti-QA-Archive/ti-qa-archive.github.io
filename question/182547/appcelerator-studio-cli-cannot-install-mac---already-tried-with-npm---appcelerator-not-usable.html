			<h1>Appcelerator Studio CLI cannot install (Mac) - already tried with npm - Appcelerator not usable</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>When launching Appcelerator Studio (on Mac OS 10.5 Yosemite) after a fresh install:</p>
<p>A window pops up (new updates) asking to install &quot;Appcelerator CLI Core&quot; (version N&#x2F;A).</p>
<p>If I click &quot;Install&quot;, an error appears:<br>(details is: &quot;<strong>Appcelerator CLI is currently upgrading or installing</strong>. Please wait until it has finished..&quot;).</p>
<p>If I click &quot;Remind me later&quot; or if I continue:<br>Appcelerator cannot be used as I cannot sign in after that<br>(it says: &quot;Appcelerator CLI is currently installing or upgrading&quot;).</p>
<p>Appcelerator Studio is just broken now.<br>Reinstalling does not fix it.</p>
<p>I have already tried the npm workarounds (to install alloy and titanium).<br>These say that titanium CLI 4 is installed.</p>
<p>I have already updated NodeJS just in case.<br>I have already set the chown to usr&#x2F;local&#x2F;bin, just in case.</p>
<p>None of these worked.</p>
<p>Problem is different than this:<br>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;145844&#x2F;cant-install-titanium-cli-and-alloy<br>.. because mx problem is with Appcelerator Studio, the new 21st of May version, which doesn&#39;t work here.</p>
<p>Problem is different than this:<br>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;145775&#x2F;mac-os-x-cant-install-titanium-cli–alloy—invalid-password<br>… because it is not a password problem.</p>
<p>Please help, it&#39;s really important that I get it working soon.</p>

							<div><p>I am getting the exact same problem.  I have tried uninstalling everything.  I even tried installing everything from scratch as root.  Wont actually let me install as root.<br>Appcelerator is completely broken for me.  It thinks Xcode is not installed either,  which it is!  Not even bothered about Android.  This needs sorting.</p>

							<p>Thank you people for your answers!<br>I have to fix a minor typo: I was on Mac 10.10 Yosemite (not 10.5).</p>
<p>Now let&#39;s get to the solution.</p>
<p>From the URL there:</p>
<p><code>https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;web.appcelerator.com&amp;#x2F;product&amp;#x2F;cli</code></p>
<p>… I did already step 1 and 2, which are mentioned in other related topics.</p>
<p>Before that I unfortunately didn&#39;t read about :</p>
<p><code>appc setup</code></p>
<p>… so I instead launched appcelerator to end installation, as they mention there too as step 3.<br>This is what I&#39;ve done before I had these answers.</p>
<p>Note that Appcelerator CLI confirmed it was installed with a version 4 already on Terminal commands.<br>It only never confirmed so in Appcelerator application, and the Appcelerator application was bugged.</p>
<p>What worked for me, before I received these answers and after days trying things, was to:</p>
<p>` - erase the entire hard disk (!)</p>
<ul>
<li>reinstall Mac OS</li>
<li>and then install Appcelerator on this entirely new disk. `</li>
</ul>
<p>It worked.<br>It was a real pain to go to that just because of installation bugs, but at least it worked.</p>
<p>So, for other people googling about this issue, as I did, you may either use Roberto &#x2F; Juan &#x2F; Chris solution, or install on a clean disk.</p>
<p>@ James Kenny:<br>Did the solution mentioned above work for you?</p>

							<p>Look here –&gt;  https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.appcelerator.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;cli       Open Terminal and begin with &quot;Getting Started with the CLI&quot; and follow the steps exactly!   If you do so, everything will work fine.<br>Make sure you have your account details ready when propted…</p>
