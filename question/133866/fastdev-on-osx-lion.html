		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Seems like for some people FastDev just works.. Has anyone who it didn&#39;t just work for found a way to get it to play nice?</p>
<p>Myself and my colleague have never been able to get FastDev to work.<br>I&#39;ve been converting my app from iOS &gt; Android for some time now, and in the end I gave up on FastDev and turned it off in Tiapp.xml.</p>
<p>I am using a MacBook Air, I&#39;ve tried 1.8.1 and 1.8.0.1.</p>
<p>FastDev does connect, I can see that it is pulling in the files etc.. But I assumed it was like LiveTanium which I have setup on iOS. That is if I change something in a file which is a commonJS module, if I go back an Activity &#x2F; window and then click on a button that effectively &#39;re-requires()&#39; the module and it should load the new code. This never happens.. I always have to re-run the entire app which takes about a minute and is really slowing me down.</p>
<p>On images it often says &#39;:not found&#39; but I have read other people getting this in Q&amp;A and most report that FastDev still works fine for them.<br>I have re-build, cleaned the project many many times. I have re-created the project many times, as mentioned it handshakes etc.. fine, it just isn&#39;t loading the new files.</p>
<p>I also notice that I have to re-start my app 3 times to get it to re-run but when I have FastDev switched off, if I press Home on the Android simulator and then re-run the debugger it re-loads the app first time. I get a black screen twice when I try to re-run with Fast-Dev turned on and then on the third attempt it seems to work.</p>
<p>Any advice much appreciated as I&#39;d love to speed things up a bit..</p>

							<p>I&#39;ll be honest, FastDev has been more of a problem at times than an asset.  I&#39;ve had updated code not get pushed via FastDev and cause errors, leading to lost time debugging code when in reality, it was a tooling issue.</p>
<p>For android, I build out straight to device.  It just works.  No time wasted with faulty emulator startups.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the info, the device is as fast as the debugger but I do like the extra info of being able to step through.</p>
<p>I find, if on the simulator your press &#39;Home&#39; quitting the app first, and then re-launch the debugger it works first time, every time, all day. But it&#39;s still slloowwwwww..</p>
<p>On iOS, I kept a separate context (window with URL property) specifically so that I could go back a couple of windows and forwards again and all the new code is loaded. Must have saved me entire days!</p>

							<p>Feel your pain, but it <em>can</em> work - I use the same OS&#x2F;versions as you and seldom have any problems once the initial deploy to the emulator has worked.</p>
<p>My rule of thumb is to regularly delete my AVD (once a day?) and keep the emulator running between deploys.</p>
<p>It <em>just</em> works</p>

										<p><p>Yeah sounds like you&#39;re a &#39;it just works&#39;.. Want to swap Air&#39;s? Mine&#39;s brand spanking but FastDev is wonky on it? ;)</p>
<p>To clarify, if you go back a window &#x2F; activity and forwards again, your module is re-loaded? Any time delay or anything?</p>

										<p><p>Nope - I love my Pro ;-)</p>
<p>regards windows &#x2F; activities - It depends.  Single context Apps in the CommonJS style will not get reloaded due to the caching layer that CommonJS applies.  New contexts (loaded via the <code>url</code> window property) will also re-evaluate and reload javascript.  Light weight windows wont.  that seems to be the rule of thumb for me.</p>

										<p><p>Now that is interesting, my app is totally single context so perhaps it is working. Is there no way to invalidate the cache? nulling etc..? I assume re-new() ing won&#39;t re-evaluate.</p>
<p>Annoying that that isn&#39;t mentioned in the docs:</p>
<p>&gt; The Fastdev server enables Titanium developers writing Android apps to rapidly test and see the changes they make in code. Instead of re-deploying the app after changes are made, the app requests whatever it needs under Resources from the Fastdev server. In other words, when Fastdev is running and your app requests app.js (or just about anything under Resources), the latest version of app.js on your dev machine gets served up to the app – there is no need for the full build-and-release process.</p>
