			<h1>Adamantium.js – chainable mobile app framework with jQuery-like syntax</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>After spending a lot of time developing mobile apps, doing the things I used to do with jQuery when developing websites, but using a lot more code, I decided to scrap the framework idea I’d been iterating and use an existing framework to leverage a jQuery like syntax and loosely couple components. Two weeks ago, I trashed all the code I had written and started fresh.</p>
<h2 id="fundamentals">Fundamentals</h2>
<p>Adamantium.js is based on the idea to let webdevelopers use existing skills and familiarity with jQuery to build mobile apps, using the Titanium Mobile platform. The architecture of apps in this framework will be based on module components and event driven interaction between these. The framework will also make extending component and element functionality and prototyping UI element constructors as straightforward as possible.</p>
<h2 id="logic-screen-library-ui">Logic, Screen, Library, UI</h2>
<p>Apps in the eyes of Adamantium.js are based on components, of which there are four kinds with different intentions, purpose and use. To simplify the concept of Model-View-Controller, the component type Logic (short for Logic controller) has merged the traditional Model and Controller into a central hub of interaction with data layers and business logic.</p>
<p>The traditional View has been renamed to Screen, to avoid confusion with Titanium Mobiles definition and use of Views. Library is the third kind of component and is a format for plugins, sort of, to prototype new methods, bind callbacks to process events and extend the UI. Which is the fourth and last kind of component, which basically allows for prototyping custom element constructors.</p>
<h2 id="example-application">Example application</h2>
<p>I have prepared a simple example application, in which I show how to use most common methods and build an app with Adamantium.js. My intention for this app is to keep it updated as regularly as the framework evolves and provide examples for all the ways too leverage Adamantium.js. I hope for this to grow by user contribution, so if you try the framework and develop a cool example or proof of concept that you’d like to share, please let me know.</p>

							<p>I have posted some ideas for version 0.2 in this blogpost: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;adamrenklint.com&#x2F;thoughts&#x2F;ideas-for-adamantium-js-0-2">adamrenklint.com&#x2F;thoughts&#x2F;ideas-for-adamantium-js-0-2</a></p>
<p>Also, the framework&#x2F;library that Adamantium.js is based on, TiFramework by Rick Blalock, is no longer in active development and &quot;has been forked for the better&quot;, as Rick puts it. The original framework is still available, but as the owner of that project recognize - Adamantium.js is the new &quot;master branch&quot;, with a lot of enhancements already in place and soon coming.</p>

										<p><p>This framework is great, I would love to see a way to track an elements parents in 0.2.</p>
<p>Say I have a textfield and when I focus on it I want the entire screen to slide up, it would be nice if I could call $(&#39;#textfield&#39;).parent(&#39;:screen&#39;).animate({top: -50, duration: 500}); or something similar.</p>

										<p><p>On the spot, Josey! Next release will feature tracking of parent&#x2F;child relationships, so then you could use it almost like that. .parent() will get the parent and .master() will get the top-level parent (for when you write deeply nested interfaces). Working on it as I type.</p>
