			<h1>Namespaces - &#39;Separating Concerns&#39; - How?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Below is a link to a pastie of some dummy code.</p>
<p>The main goal for me is to figure out how to split files and have them reference one another.  I&#39;ve never programmed with JS (which may be painfully obvious) and have little experience coding at all (also easy to spot).  The <em>idea</em> of what I&#39;m trying to do makes sense to me…it&#39;s in the execution that I seem to be, um, less adept.</p>
<p>The plan:</p>
<p>1) start the app from my <em>app.js</em> file, opening <em>win</em> from <em>params_test_receive.js</em>.</p>
<p>2) write a <em>createBaseSlider</em> function (with parameters) in <em>params_test_pass.js</em></p>
<p>3) create a <em>slider</em> in the <em>params_test_receive.js</em>, from the function in <em>params_test_pass.js</em>.  The main reason for the test is to a) learn and b) see if Titanium will prompt&#x2F;feed me a parameter list when I go to call the function from another file.  Here&#39;s hoping…</p>
<p>Running the code on the iPhone simulator, I get the error <em>&quot;could not find the file mo.params_test_pass.js&quot;</em> and I just don&#39;t know what I&#39;m missing. </p>
<p>All three pieces are in this pastie.  I&#39;m sure it could be something as simple as forgetting some needed punctuation or an &#39;include&#39;,  it could be my lack of JS knowledge or it could be that I just don&#39;t understand the concept of what I&#39;m trying to do.</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Long live Frank Zappa. </p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>Ok very good start you are handling your files really well and creating the namespaces and using anonymous functions. </p>
<p>You don&#39;t need the include in the params test receive file…. You have already included the file in the app.js file. What happens is if you include the file using the anonymous function it puts the contents available to the rest of the app.</p>
<p>Your abstracting the code into functions which is also good.</p>
<p>Also put a return in your receive file at the moment it will return the slider and you need to return the window so return win;</p>
<p>apart from that if this is your first attempt.. nice.</p>
<p>Just don&#39;t pollute app.js with code create a controller file and control from there.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>T.</p>

							<p>Wow - thanks for the quick response, Trevor.  </p>
<p>1) I didn&#39;t know that other files could just be &#39;included&#39; in the <em>app.js</em> and they would be available.  Makes sense.  Thanks for pointing that out.</p>
<p>2) The <em>return win</em> was what I was missing.  Once that was fixed, it busted me for the min and max types, but ran fine after getting those corrected.</p>
<p>3) It runs, but I&#39;m still not getting the behavior I&#39;m hoping for.</p>
<p>It seems like, now that they files are &#39;connected&#39;, I should be able to type the beginning of the a function and it should just pop up in my options&#x2F;intellisense.  But, even though it runs, the code:</p>
<p><code>var slider = mo.params_test_pass.createBaseSlider(&amp;#39;Test&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Low&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;High&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;1&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;5&amp;#39;, 1, 3);</code></p>
<p>isn&#39;t in the prompt as I type, isn&#39;t color-coded like it should be and certainly doesn&#39;t prompt for a parameter list.</p>
<p>Anyone have an idea why?  </p>
<p>4) I understand (in principle) what you mean about keeping the <em>app.js</em> file clean.  But, do you have an example of a <em>controller.js</em> or something like that?  I&#39;ve seen several different versions of &#39;best practices&#39; but am having a hard time determining where some of the logic goes vs. where the UI goes vs. where app navigation goes, etc.</p>
<p>Any insight you (or anyone) has on that, I&#39;d appreciate the input.</p>
<p>Thanks again, Trevor.  Very helpful.</p>

							<p>Well to answer this.. Studio is a little buggy but yes it should show your functions as you type. But it doesn&#39;t always…. but it does sometimes. Studio is still under 6 months old so they are ironing out the bugs like this.</p>
<p>Now the control file is actually no different to the files you have already created. It just has a function which is called from the app.js and this function actually does the initial load of the app, then when you press buttons etc you call a function in the control file to handle the processing you need.</p>
<p>It depends how far you want to go I am in the process of writing a series of blog posts on how to format and abstract your code into an MVC architecture, it will be a few weeks though as I am a little busy at work.</p>
<p>SO just keep going as your going and create separate functions as required in what seems like logical files for them to be in…</p>
<p>Something like the slider in MVC would be a helper file.</p>
<p>hope this helps… T….</p>
