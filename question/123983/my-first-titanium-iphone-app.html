			<h1>My first Titanium iPhone app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Well, I finally finished up my app for iPhone&#x2F;iPod Touch using the unbelievably amazing Titanium SDK.  The name of it is Insane Donkey, and it was approved last night for the App Store.  Would love if a few of you could download it and check it out and maybe provide some feedback on whether you believe it has potential, what else could be included that would be beneficial, etc.  </p>
<p>It&#39;s exciting!  Thanks again to the guys at Appcelerator for making a wicked product for us developers who refuse to learn Obj-C.  lol</p>
<p>Here is the link to my app:<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunes.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;insane-donkey&#x2F;id454729496?mt=8&amp;ls=1</p>

							<p>Also, for anyone wondering.  Submission of the app was on August 3rd.  They moved from &quot;Waiting for review&quot; status to &quot;In Review&quot; on August 8th around 9am.  Around 11:30pm that evening, the changed the status to &quot;Prepare for app store&quot;.  In about 30 minutes, it was changed to &quot;Ready for sale&quot;.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Sharry.  There hasn&#39;t been much movement with downloads.  I think the hardest part of deploying an app is getting it noticed!  (on a budget. lol)</p>

										<p><p>Just downloaded it.  A few pointers if I may:</p>
<p>1) I wasn&#39;t sure what I was registering for on the login screen</p>
<p>2) There wasn&#39;t any instructions on the games section.  That finder weepers game, what are you supposed to do on there lol?</p>
<p>3) I got to level  on the bubble game, it told me I needed to purchase the full version, then the full screen went black &amp; yet the music is playing in the background - not sure what to do now .</p>
<p>4) The bottom navigation is a tad confusing tbh, the home button is on the right instead of the left - is this supposed to be that way &#39;cos of the &#39;insane donkey&#39; genre?</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>Sharry</p>

										<p><p>Sharry, thanks for the pointers.  The feedback really helps me understand what users are looking for. </p>
<p>1) That is a good point.  I will add some information as to what the user is signing up for and how.</p>
<p>2) lol  Another good point.  In Finders Weepers, the goal is to find the green balls on each level.  The red balls are bad, and the gray balls are freebies.  Again, I&#39;ll be sure to add a bit of information on how to play the games.</p>
<p>3) Hmm… not sure what happened there.  I&#39;ll do some testing to see if I can replicate that problem.</p>
<p>4)I can see what you mean here.  I&#39;m working on an update that utilizes the built-in UI tabs, and when you start, it actually starts on the left-hand Daily tab, which would be what users would want to check first I would assume.  So, this will be addressed in the upcoming update.</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to add a dungeon-style treasure game, a daily lottery drawing, some fresh UI updates and additional achievements in the new update.  I&#39;ll let you know when it&#39;s released.</p>

							<p>Hi Seth,<br>Cool game design. Love the look and general feel - very bright and cheery - professional polish (without any consideration for actual any game play yet). Very interesting how you&#39;ve build in your &#39;portal or world&#39;. Seeing that model more often and it makes sense from a monetary perspective. At front of game is an interesting choice.</p>
<p>I played the &#39;pointless&#39; games (big button and gravity balls). I think my 10 year old would quickly figure it out (they&#39;re sharp like that), me on the other hand had to take some time. The gravity ball would be additionally interesting if perhaps you added accelerometer to allow balls to move based on position of iphone, and maybe shaking the balls around would add to it. The menu to the right seemed to take away from the game play real estate IMHO.</p>
<p>Moving to second from top game, the &#39;upgrade to full&#39; slide up appeared and after the first &#39;no thanks&#39; input, it reappeared in an endless loop. I had to home button escape. Restarting it, left me in the same state.</p>
<p>Otherwise, excellent first app. I too am using titan first time and am really excited to get it going. If you have any good tutorials you used pls email me (sailtothemoon@gmail.com-removethispart).</p>
<p>System:<br>Iphone 4<br>iOS5<br>14Gig<br>Carrier Rogers 11.0</p>
<p>Otherwise, great job.<br>If you have any suggestions for good tutorials, I&#39;d love to know about them (sailtothemoon<em>REMOVE</em>@gmail.com) I&#39;m excited to get my first titan app out. Cheers!<br>Lee</p>

										<p><p>Lee, thanks for your review. It&#39;s always great to get feedback from users as it gives me insight into what they expect from the app. Thanks for pointing out the bugs you found as well. I will certainly look into those. Insane Donkey has been a great learning experience. I still feel that it is a good game, but it&#39;s hard getting the word out about it. That is the biggest problem I have ran into so far. Hopefully you have some better luck getting the word out whenever you release your first app. As far as design and tuts, I drew out a rough design either on paper or in photoshop, then perused kitchen sink to see how I could best accomplish the design I came up with. If you have any questions feel free to email me. Evertith at gmail dot com</p>
