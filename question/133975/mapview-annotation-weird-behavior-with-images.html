			<h1>MapView Annotation weird behavior with images</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>We&#39;re setting the pin image for different types of annotations on our map.</p>
<p>When we do a search on the map, we clear all the annotations with removeAllAnnotations() and re-add new annotations.</p>
<p>The thing is, when we do this the image property on the Annotation seems to change to something else. It seems the annotations are probably re-used but the images aren&#39;t changed.</p>
<p>(this was for iPhone mainly).</p>
<p>Is there any way to get a workaround for this?</p>

							<p>Actually looking at the TiMapView.m this might be a bug.</p>

        annView = (<span class="hljs-built_in">MKAnnotationView</span>*) [mapView dequeueReusableAnnotationViewWithIdentifier:identifier];

            <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (imagePath!=<span class="hljs-literal">nil</span>)
            {
</code></pre><p>Seems if the annView is not nil, if it is dequeued from the reusables the image is never set on the reused annotation… right?</p>
<p>The image must be set always on the reused annotation, otherwise it will simply use the image it was created the first time with.</p>

							<p>I commented out this line in the TiMapView.m, rebuilt my project, and it fixed this annotation image problem.  I&#39;m not sure what the line does, but it seems to be working for me now.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">//annView = (MKAnnotationView*) [mapView dequeueReusableAnnotationViewWithIdentifier:identifier];</span>

										<p><p>The problem with that is you won&#39;t get any reused annotations. It will create a new annotation every time. With many annotations that will make it require more resources and it will probably be slower.</p>
<p>It is better to set the image every time. (posted an example above in a comment)</p>

										<p><p>Seth, your suggestion worked for me, but whenever I change the TiMapView.m file and build to the device, Titanium Studio seems to change the file and uncomment the line… Do you have any suggestions on what I should do to prevent it from changing the file?</p>

							<p>This optimization to reuse images should be optional. I have map data that changes based on device GPS location and&#x2F;or map center lat&#x2F;lon and the remove all function should remove all of the annotations as documented. I needed up reverting to 1.8.1 because it works as expected on that SDK version. I&#39;m no stranger to submitting bugs but I&#39;m up against an App store delivery deadline and don&#39;t have the time to pull from git, create and isolated test case and push back to git. Hopefully this is addressed in the 1.8.3 release.</p>

							<p>I have the same problem and it&#39;s really preventing the purpose of my app to work. When I first add some annotations to the map, e.g. hotels, everything looks fine. If I remove these annotations and adds another set, e.g. restaurants, the images of these annotations are the same as the first ones. If I on the other hand add the second set first, I get the correct images. So in other words, the first set of annotations that is added to a mapview decides which images should be used for the entire session…</p>
<p>No idea what to do next.</p>

							<p>Yeah its because there is a bug in TiMapView.m</p>
<p>Very easy fix, but the whole jira thing for submitting fixes is too time consuming. Also i wish there was an easy way to hack TiMapView.m for just our project, but there are no good guides for it anywhere… I can only find the file in our build did in our project, and changing that file won&#39;t affect anything…</p>

							<p>If you want to fix this yourself,</p>
<p>go into your mobilesdk, find TiMapView.m and put in the following at somewhere around line 677</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">id imagePath = [ann valueForUndefinedKey:@<span class="hljs-string">"image"</span>];
        UIImage *<span class="hljs-built_in">image</span> = [TiUtils <span class="hljs-built_in">image</span>:imagePath proxy:ann];
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-built_in">image</span>!=nil){
            annView.<span class="hljs-built_in">image</span> = <span class="hljs-built_in">image</span>;

        }
</code></pre><p>Before the line</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">annView.canShowCallout = YES<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>Fixes the bug for us.</p>
