			<h1>How close before deadline do I dare updating my app on AppStore?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi</p>
<p>Not sure if this is off topic.. but here I go:<br>I just saw I got an ios-app (created with Titanium) accepted on AppStore. Nice.<br>But I want to enhance a lot of small stuff which includes work for maybe one day.</p>
<p>How close to a deadline do you dare to upgrade? Does upgrade mean that the app has to go through the long review period again? Does it mean there is a risk of down time, when the app is not accessible on AppStore?<br>Something else I should know when I (if) I do the first upgrade ever?</p>
<p>Best regards &#x2F;Tove :-)</p>

							<p>If your app is currently live, that version stays until the next version is approved.  So there is no &#39;downtime&#39;.</p>
<p>Yes, your new version has to go through the review process again.</p>
<p>We assume 2 weeks for review, but tell clients 3 weeks. If folks would quit wasting apple reviewers time with website apps (phonecrap) and torch&#x2F;fart apps, real apps could get through much faster.</p>

										<p><p>Stephen&#39;s comments are wise – pad your estimates and planning, even though actual review times might be shorter. (i.e. the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ipstenu.org&#x2F;2011&#x2F;the-scotty-principle&#x2F;">Scotty Principle</a> or perhaps this <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=t9SVhg6ZENw">YouTube: Star Trek Miracle Worker</a>).</p>
<p>Or, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;appreviewtimes.com&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;appreviewtimes.com&#x2F;</a> isn&#39;t an official site. It uses crowd-sourced data to estimate review times. But I&#39;ve found it to be roughly accurate.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, both, for answering!<br>I guess there is no downtime? An updated version replaces previous without removing the app from appstore while reviewing I hope.</p>
<p>Well thanks again :-)</p>

										<p><p>Apple also publishes the stats for submissions and updates in the <strong>App Store Review process</strong> section of the developer site (must be logged in).</p>
<p>Always pad, too many things can go wrong at your end or Apples.</p>
