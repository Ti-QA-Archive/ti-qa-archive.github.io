			<h1>How to discovery device(or service) on Andorid?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all, I want to discovery device and service in LAN.</p>
<p>As iPhone has bonjourbrowser, I tried to find the similar way to get device on Android.</p>
<p>I found some pure java code such as JmDNS could do that. but I don&#39;t know how to import java code for using.</p>
<p>Therefore I searched Q&amp;A and found Android Module Development Guide</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Android+Module+Development+Guide</p>
<p>I created module step by step as guide but when I require module at app.js I got error message and can&#39;t use it.</p>
<p>Could any one tell me how to import and use java code clearly or does there have any other way to discovery device on Android, thanks so much.</p>

							<div><p>Please specify more information about the error you get.</p>
<p>I think many of us would be interested in such a module, so we&#39;d try to help as much as we can.</p>
<p>When I was creating something similar, I had all phones that I want to discover installed my app. So one phone would simply broadcast using broadcast address (255.255.255.255) and others would listen and respond.</p>
<p>But JmDNS seems to be much better and Bonjourbrowser compatible, so yea that module would be great.</p>

							<div><p>Thank Sosins&#39;s reply, sorry for that I didn&#39;t describe detail about errors because I can&#39;t sure does there any stupid problem I made.</p>
<p>I can create module successively and I got some directory in package, but I can&#39;t sure how to put the exist java code in each folder.</p>
<p>Should I just put exist java package in the same folder I created and do nothing?(I found some sample code on git but there are something about @kroll, and I don&#39;t know how to use that) or should I modify anything about the java package?</p>
<p>By the way, I didn&#39;t find the sample about how to call module by javascript in Resource, and I just use require(&quot;module-name&quot;) and not work.</p>
<p>Could any one show me any completely sample about create module and how to use it in Resource, thanks a lot.</p>

							<p>There is a free module in the Marketplace that it&#39;s based on jmDns  I think. I did not tested it yet but you might wanna take a look and let me know too :)</p>

										<p><p>I tried to use this module and it&#39;s workable.</p>
<p>But notice that the describe of discover method usage on web is wrong.</p>
<p>After mail to the author, I got the correct usage.</p>
<p>Discover method should be used as below:</p>
<p>var jmdns = require(&#39;com.looprecur.jmdns&#39;)</p>
<p>jmdns.discover(service_name, domain, function(service) {<br>  Ti.API.debug(&quot;It found &quot;+ service.name + &quot; &quot; + service.host + &quot; &quot; + service.port);<br>});</p>
<p>The service name should be something like &quot;__xbmc-web._tcp&quot; or &quot;_workstation._tcp&quot;  and the domain is usually &quot;local.&quot;</p>
<p>If anyone need to discovery device could use the module.</p>

							<p>You  can download a free barcode scanner for your phone and have a try. It&#39;s really very funny. I have found a free online barcode generator to make my own barcodes for products and it is really convenient and useful. I just want to share it with you, everybody, maybe you can try it someday you may have a try someday.http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.keepautomation.com&#x2F;</p>
