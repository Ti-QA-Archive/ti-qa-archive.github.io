			<h1>Could not locate the Android SDK at the given path</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have been tasked with evaluating the appcelerator software for our company.  I cannot select the Android SDK at all in titanium studio.  I know there are a lot of threads out already on this and trust me when I say I&#39;ve tried pretty much everything (excepting for getting a 32 bit windows machine and creating a new user account).</p>
<p>What I have tried:<br>I have every single piece of software that can be installed from the Android SDK installed.  I tried different combinations to see if that was the case but eventually downloaded everything…. 1.5, 1.6, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 4.0 etc etc and anything I could&#39;ve left out.  I have the most up to date tools.</p>
<p>I have updated the versions of Titanium studio to the latest in builds (1.8)</p>
<p>I have completely uninstalled the software and completely reinstalled the software (both titanium and android)</p>
<p>I have moved android sdk to a path containing absolutely no spaces.</p>
<p>I have tried both python 2.5 and 2.7.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve done other things as well.</p>
<p>I am running Windows 7 64 bit system.  I installed the git option from titanium studio to use a local copy.  These have continuously changed over time but here is the python error (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;2976836) from the logs and the windows diagnostics (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;2976874).  Any help would greatly be appreciated.</p>

							<p>Richard</p>
<p>I&#39;m sorry, but you need to install the Continuous Builds version compiled from the <em>master</em> branch of our source repository, rather than 1_8_X.</p>
<p>Simply having this installed should resolve the issue; it&#39;s not necessary to actually build your apps with it, if you need to stay with the official 1.7.5 release.</p>
<p>If this doesn&#39;t help, please report back and I will assist you further.</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

<p>Would you delete the ANDROID_SDK system variable, restart Studio, and try again, please?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>Thank you for your quick reply.  I&#39;m sorry I should&#39;ve been more specific when I said the version number I am using.  I tried the newest version of the master (mobilesdk-1.8.0.1.v20111205164258-win32.zip) already before posting.  I also just downloaded the latest master version of desktop just in case (sdk-1.1.0-20110406015524-win32.zip). I am still getting the same error.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m on a 64bit win - I have my android-sdk in the default spot and everything is hunky dory. However I just had to do a lot of un&#x2F;reinstalls in attempt to solve a whole different bug (do NOT EVER use extended chars in a filename) - and during that, I had a lot of problems with locating the SDK. Why it&#39;s ok now I cannot tell you.</p>
<p>Any diagnostics that you need from a working system I&#39;d be happy to supply.</p>
<p>As to your evaluation: </p>
<p>It is my hope that Android will finally get some attention. I started out on the iPhone, and then switched to Android as main dev. OS - and it&#39;s been horrible. However you discover that a lot of your problems is not with Ti itself, but with the way it is set up (it seems banged together with a brick using dough as cement) and the way almost everything works in a quirky way. The horrible documentation will also be a challenge. The key here is to look at sample apps (kitchen sink for reference, tweetanium for architechural inspiration), besides find the &#39;Forging Titanium&#39; series, and there is a series of talks as well, that you can both get a general impression from and also scan for concrete facts and advice (haven&#39;t got the URL handy, sorry). </p>
<p>But I believe that Appcelerator has recently hired more javadevs</p>
<p>I believe that the proposition still stands: Ti can end up with a very strong tool, because the idea is great - it is in fact the only really good crossplatform idea out there if you ask me. But the implementation is, and it pains me to say this, horrible, especially if you&#39;re an Android developer. </p>
<p>I&#39;m from Denmark - in our version of ComputerWorld there was an article about a danish agency trying out with Ti. They ended up joking that it took a little more than double the time to do things in Ti than it did doing it natively first on one then on another platform. However they said some other stuff that made it clear to me that their problems was things I&#39;ve already solved (they used earlier versions of Ti - it must have been … interesting).</p>
<p>I&#39;m about to become the lead of at least the second danish team that gives up on Ti - not because I don&#39;t like it, but because I&#39;ve been spending 80% not understanding WTF is going on, and repairing and setting up - and I&#39;m not usually THAT dim. This ratio has to change … but I think it wil.</p>
<p>I really think that Appcelerator is in danger of missing the ball on this one. It takes serious dedication and a strong stomach or very clever people to get productive with Ti as it stands.</p>
<p>Well, I&#39;m procrastinating … need to get back, I really can&#39;t advise you on wether to go with Ti or not, I&#39;m going with it - and I think that while I get smarter, Ti will get better and it&#39;ll all end allright.</p>

							<p>by the way - the last directory in the path you are looking for is android-sdk. On my system it looks like this: C:\Program Files (x86)\Android\android-sdk</p>
