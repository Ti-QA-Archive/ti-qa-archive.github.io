			<p>I&#39;m using the &#39;Package&#39; area of TI Builder to send my code to the Appcelerator cloud. This can be flaky but can be prodded into action if I restart TI Developer - However… </p>
<p>Today I find if I download my assembled app via the public link in the &#39;Links&#39; area it installs as an old version (with the old javascripts in the resources folder). If I download the .msi file directly it installs the newer code.</p>
<p>Also has anyone had the bit where the Windows installer throws an error near the end of the install but does actually manage to install the app? This happens every time I install it.</p>

							<div><p>I must admit to not trying this Andrew - I was so astounded by the finding the old version of my app posing as the &#39;new&#39; one. If it happens again I&#39;l at least try this. The installer crash though can&#39;t be accounted for. It happened also when a beta tester installed my app on his computer too.</p>

							<p>Update: As Andrew Crook suggested this appears to be  a caching problem in the browser. I had bookmarked the link to my apps download page on the Appcelerator server, so this is the likely cause of old versions being downloaded. I&#39;d assumed that the link on the page would always point to the new file on the server which I took to always overwrite the old  - so something else to watch out for!</p>
<p>I also found - although whether this was a coincidence or not - that the last couple of installs were not interrupted by the Windoze Installer throwing an error at me.</p>
