			<h1>Execution context of app.js </h1>

		<section>
			<p>I had a specific question about the execution context of app.js. If I have a event loop (while True) running in app.js and I move between different native controls does the loop continue to run or is it paused? Will code in app.js run across all controls?</p>

							<p>Hi Kashif</p>
<p>Thanks for an interesting question, which provoked an interesting subsequent discussion! :)</p>
<p>In Titanium the code of a single context runs in a single thread with each line of code run in sequential order.  Whereas, a new context (invoked, for example, by a new window&#39;s creation) runs in a separate and new thread.</p>
<p>If a loop exists and, inside that loop, another context is invoked, the child context will <strong>not</strong> block the loop&#39;s execution, meaning that both may run simultaneously.</p>
<p>&gt; If I have a event loop (while True) running in app.js and I move between different native controls does the loop continue to run or is it paused?</p>
<p>On this point, you seem to imply that you intend for the loop to run continuously, waiting on a condition to be satisfied before taking action. Don Thorp, from the core dev team, believes this would be bad practice, as it would literally &quot;suck the battery right out of the device&quot;. This would likely lead to you losing a significant amount of your user base due to its bad effects.</p>
<p>The recommendation is for you to instead use custom events, which can work across contexts. Alternatively, if you are interested in benchmarking and optimising your app, there is a technique <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ejohn.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-javascript-timers-work&#x2F;">using Timers</a> that allows you to emulate asynchronous processing that can help to improve the responsiveness of an app in certain situations. Don Thorp has verified that this would be possible.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Credit&#x2F;appreciation to Don for his patience in explaining this, and correcting my initial understanding!  :)</p>

							<p>Thanks for updating the answer. Wasn&#39;t actually going to use an infinite loop, just wanted to understand some behaviour</p>
<p>Cheers<br>Kashif</p>
