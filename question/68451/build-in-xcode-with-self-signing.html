			<h1>Build in xCode with self signing</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have written a app in Tinanium that I wish to deploy to my jailbroken iPhone for testing. I tested some native iPhone apps written and compiled  in xCode with a self signing certificate and they do work fine. </p>
<p>However, every time I want to use the same self signing certificate with the Titanium build xCode-project it does not work.</p>
<p>Does anybody have a workaround for this?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Benjamin</p>
<p>p.s. I using xCode 3.2.4 and iOS4.1</p>

							<p>Make sure the device is plugged in then in XCode pick Organizer and make sure your device is properly marked for development.  I just had an issue where my device became unregistered for development.</p>
<p>Then open your project in XCode and check these settings.<br>Select Target then right click on your application and pick Get Info.</p>
<p>Check the Properties&#x2F;Identifier and make sure it matches an existing&#x2F;working mobile provision.<br>Then look at Build&#x2F;Code Signing Identity and see that it is hooked to an iPhone Developer<br>Then Build&#x2F;Targeted Device Family is iPad<br>Then Build&#x2F;Base SDK is iOS Device 3.2 or iOS Simulator 3.2<br>Then in your project dropdown select the iOS 3.2 and Device so it says Device - 3.2 | Debug | Your App</p>
<p>Once you are this point you should be able to build to the device like your other projects.</p>
<p>If this doesn&#39;t help, please give a more specific explanation of what is happening.</p>

										<p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for your response. </p>
<p>At the moment I do not have a premium supscription from Apple to deploy my apps to a device. That&#39;s why I use a jailbroken iPhone. I&#39;m planning to get the subscription when the app is ready. But for now I wan&#39;t to deploy it using a jailbroken iPhone and a Self Signing Certificate from Apple&#39;s Keychain app.</p>
<p>The problem is that apps written in xCode work fine on my jailbroken iPhone. But some sample apps that I&#39;ve written using Titanium won&#39;t compile in xCode. Looks like there is still a setting there that points to a officialcode signing certificate. I double checked my project settings, but it still does not build.</p>
<p>I get the following error:</p>
<p>Code Signing Identity &#39;iPhone Developer&#39; does not match any valid, non-expired, code-signing certificate in your keychain.</p>
<p>Which is stange because I use a Self Siging Certificate called &quot;Test Developer&quot; that usually does the trick for apps made in xCode only. It&#39;s the Titnium apps that still have some setting incorrect.</p>
<p>Any ideas on this?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Benjamin</p>

										<p><p>Yep, it&#39;s all there. But somehowe it still gives an error concerning the iPhone Developer identity. Very strange, I triple checked my settings. Look like there is still a setting made by Titanium that&#39;s causing the problem. As I said, nromal xCode projects don&#39;t have this problem. Are there other files that I need to check? Some plist, or something?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

							<p>You could always just create a new self signed cert for iPhone Developer. That&#39;s what I did and I was able to have XCode install the app on my iPhone. I have the same setup as your self, jailbroken 3G, FW 4.1, SDK 4.1 XCode 3.2.4</p>

							<p>So let&#39;s dig this up from the grave. I can&#39;t get mine working. I&#39;ve created a self-signed cert and configured XCode I believe. The .app file is created ok but it says not verified cert, duh!</p>
<p>When I sftp my .app over to &#x2F;Applications and run on device it worked when I was running 4.0.2. Now I updated to 4.2.1 and it gets stuck on &#39;Powered by Titanium&#39; logo. Other users are experiencing this.</p>
<p>Please let me know if anyone knows issues. I&#39;m using xcode 3.2.5 and latest Titanium SDK.</p>
