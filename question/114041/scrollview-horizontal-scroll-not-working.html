			<h1>ScrollView horizontal scroll not working.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello. I have a scrollView in my app (for Android), but I can&#39;t scroll horizontally. (Vertical scrolling works fine though.)</p>
<p>I have tried adding a View, and toying around with the input parameters of createScrollView.</p>
<p>The code can be find here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;1581802</p>
<p>Can someone explain how to get it to scroll horizontally?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

							<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Try giving it a &#39;width&#39; property as well as the contentWidth property. (The &#39;width&#39; is the kind of &#39;window&#39; area you scroll through, with the contentWidth being the width of the full content you are scrolling, if that makes sense) </p>
<p>You could also try adding the scrollType:&#39;horizontal&#39; property.</p>
<p>Also, if you added the layout:&#39;horizontal&#39; property too, you could then add your labels with just &#39;left&#39; properties and they will &#39;stack&#39; to the right automatically (with the &#39;left&#39; value as the space between them), without you having to calculate their exact position.</p>
<p>hope this helps.<br>K</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the answers. Adding scrollType:&#39;horizontal&#39; worked, though I could not get vertical scrolling to work with just that.</p>
<p>However, when I tried to add a second scrollView, (having scrollType:&#39;horizontal&#39; in the first scrollView and scrollType:&#39;vertical&#39; in the second) I got both horizontal and vertical scrolling.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, I only got vertical scrolling if I had scrollType:&#39;vertical&#39; in the first scrollView and scrollType:&#39;horizontal&#39; in the second.</p>

										<p><p>The only way I get a horizontal scrollview working when nestled inside a vertical scrollview on Android is to use a layout of &quot;absolute&quot;.  Then I iterate the a left parameter for each image stacked based off their width.  This solution is compatible for iOS as well.</p>

							<p>The scrollview is either vertical either horizontal in android -  u cannot have both in the same time, and you set it&#39;s type with scrollType.</p>

										<p><p>I think it&#39;s possible to put a horizontal scrollView inside a vertical scrollView. (ie: have 2 scrollviews). I&#39;ve used that on an iPad app at least. Haven&#39;t tried it on Android yet though. It might work.</p>

										<p><p>It does not work on Android. On iOS, you have scrollViews that scroll both direction, so there you don&#39;t have to use two inside eachother.</p>
