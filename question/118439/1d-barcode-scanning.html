			<h1>1D Barcode Scanning</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I need to integrate 1D barcode scanning capabilities into my app, and am curious to know what others are doing successfully in a production-grade app.</p>
<p>AFAIK, here are the options:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Ti+Plus &quot;ti.barcode&quot; module.  Currently supports QR codes only, despite what the Barcode Reader sales page says (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;12&#x2F;barcode-reader&#x2F;commerce).  If 1D barcodes are supported, they didn&#39;t work for me and I could be doing something wrong.</p>
</li>
<li><p>TiBar. Their documentation states it is beta grade and not suitable for production use.  I was only able to get it working in the Simulator, and not on the device itself for some reason.  Also required some additional steps in XCode to properly compile.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Any suggestions on getting 1D barcode scanning to work in Titanium?  I&#39;m focusing on iOS now, in case that makes things easier.</p>
<p>Thanks!<br>Adam</p>

							<p>Probably not the answer you are looking for, but in my opinion 1D scanning via the camera is only suitable for casual scanning like the occasional UPC lookup.  I need fast, error-free scanning for point-of-sale so can&#39;t have users framing the barcode in an image view.</p>
<p>I settled on the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ipcprint.com&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;products&#x2F;barcode-scanners&#x2F;linea-pro&#x2F;">Linea Pro</a> scanners which required me to write an objC module to interface with their SDK.  But it gives me very fast, reliable laser scanning, and a credit card swipe too.</p>
<p>I also dabbled with TiBar back at SDK 1.4.x and got it to work on a device, but I don&#39;t remember having to jump through any extra hoops.  But camera based 1D scanning just isn&#39;t up to snuff for POS use, IMHO.  Cameras do much better at QR codes than they do 1D.</p>

										<p><p>hey doug, do you happen to have that objC code, or some clues as to how to interface with it from the Titanium API?  Thanks!</p>

							<p>in my opinion, this is a powerful tool as a <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.keepautomation.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;net_barcode_reader&#x2F;">barcode decoding</a> to scan and read 1D&amp;2D barcodes from multiple file formats and .NET image objects</p>
