		<section>
			<p>Afternoon</p>
<p>I have be asked an interesting question and before i get started i thought i would throw this one out first.</p>
<p>I work for a user research company and i have been ask if it would be possible to capture someone using a phone. for example. Once the said App is stared it runs in the background and captures screenshots and there tap X,Y every 5 seconds. Its so we can test people using the phone and interface in a controlled environment. this is not something which would go in itunes. just used by our consultants? iphone to start with</p>
<p>Doable you think? about play around now. If not i could save myself some time :)</p>
<p>Thanks In advance.</p>
<p>Mark</p>

							<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just tried an experiment with this. While it is possible to trigger the Ti.Media.takeScreenShot() from a background servive and also save the resulting image, the problem is, as I suspected, that the resulting images saved are simply the screenshot of the actual app at the point of &#39;pausing&#39; in to the background.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this will save you some time! :)</p>

							<p>While it&#39;s a nice idea, which I&#39;ve pondered on in the past for screenshots, I have a feeling that it&#39;s not possible.</p>
<p>The way to try it would be to set up a background service with an interval to call Ti.Media.takeScreenshot()  - but I&#39;d be very surprised if it took anything but blank&#x2F;black images.  I&#39;ll try and whip something up later as an experiment.</p>
