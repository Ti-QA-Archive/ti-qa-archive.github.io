			<h1>App works in simulator, stops on load screen on IPhone</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have an app that works perfectly in the iphone simulator, however when installing it on a device, the app just stops on the splash load screen and never goes past that. Has anyone seen this and how is it fixed? I already checked my file path names and they are all lower case so I don&#39;t think case-sensitivity is the issue…</p>

							<p>I have exactly the same problem.  I started with a trial version of Titanium Studio, Created my app which run in simulator, but it could not run on the device.  So I checked the generated code for iOS but did not find anything from my application gets included in the application package.  Is it possible to generate the application code and load it to a device with the trial download?</p>

							<p>I found Titanium studio does not support debugging on device. Select the run icon instead of the debug icon, then for iphone, enter the certificate info and wait for iTunes to get invoked and install the app into the device.<br>But I am still wondering if it is possible to generate the application code with the trial SDK download?</p>
