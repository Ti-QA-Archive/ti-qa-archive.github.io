			<h1>Application failed codesign verification</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>A couple of weeks ago we distributed a Titanium app without issue, now today - possibly due to Apple&#39;s Provisioning Portal update yesterday? - our latest app won&#39;t submit.</p>
<p>It doesn&#39;t show up in Xcode&#39;s Archives tab, so I tried Application Loader and I got the following Message:</p>
<p>&gt; Application failed codesign verification. The signature was invalid, contains disallowed entitlements<br>&gt; or it was not signed with an iPhone Distribution Certificate.</p>
<p>Unfortunately as far as I can tell, none of this is true. The app store provisioning profile is valid, as is the distribution certificate (both have been removed and re-downloaded). I even created a new certificate, attached the provisioning profile to that certificate and tried re-uploading the app. All to no avail.</p>
<p>This may not be a Titanium problem, but there obviously is an issue with the app not appearing in Xcode&#39;s Archives tab.</p>
<p>I&#39;m running Titanium Studio, build: 3.1.0.201304151600, version 3.1.0 of the Titanium SDK, and am completely hamstrung.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>In XCode&#39;s Organiser, open your list of provisioning profiles and check none of them have expired. Sometimes even profiles that have zero to do with the current app you&#39;re trying to submit will cause failures. Delete or renew all expired profiles and give it another go.</p>

										<p><p>I figured out how to change the scheme to iOS, archived the app and uploaded it via the Xcode Organiser. Got the same error message again :(</p>
<p>Looks like it&#39;s a problem with the project file Titanium&#39;s generating.</p>

							<p>Looks like the old trick of restarting the project from scratch worked. To clarify, what I did was deleted the project from Titanium Studio, created a new project (call it newproject), closed Titanium, re-downloaded the source from SVN into newproject-svn, then copied the .project and manifest files from newproject into newproject-svn, then deleted newproject and renamed newproject-svn to newproject :)</p>
<p>Basically this means that all the relevant source code files are there for Titanium to build, but it&#39;s a fresh new project with a new GUID etc. That&#39;s now done the trick.</p>
<p>Thanks for all your help Boydlee.</p>

							<p>You might be having identical certificates in both login and system in my keychain.</p>
