			<h1>File size with 3.5.0 SDK</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>hello,</p>
<p>i build the same ios app with 3.4.1 and 3.5 SDK and ran it on a iphone4 device. with 3.4.1 the file size was less than 10 MB, with 3.5 it has now almost 19 MB. </p>
<p>how much forward looking is the use of 3.5.0? in other words, how important is 64-bit in practise now and one year ahead? </p>
<p>alternatively, are there some effective means to reduce the filesize with 3.5.0?</p>
<p>thx for sharing insights.</p>

							<div><p>Interesting, I had not checked file sizes when I was testing, assuming that the code in GA would be smaller. Reading this from the release notes:</p>
<p>&quot;This Release contains the following changes to support 64-bit builds:</p>
<p>New, 64-bit build of JavaScript core, now 80% smaller, and based on a much newer codebase&quot;</p>
<p>I thought this would mean smaller IPA&#39;s… Just compiled a project I have been working on with 3.5.0. There are no external modules and it is only an iOS app. Here is what I did:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean the project, set 3.4.1GA as the target SDK, compile, take IPA file size from the build directory</li>
<li>Clean the project, set 3.5.0GA as the target SDK, compile, take IPA file size from the build directory</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the result:</p>
<p>3.4.1 - 15.1 MB</p>
<p>3.5.0 - 27.6MB, almost doubled in size! </p>
<p>Not sure why… anyone have any insight?</p>

										<p><p>Yeah… not sure if it is that linear? Just seems a little extreme, doubling in size? Maybe I&#39;m wrong. Would just like to understand…</p>
