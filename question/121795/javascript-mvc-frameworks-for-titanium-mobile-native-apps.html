			<h1>Javascript MVC frameworks for Titanium Mobile Native Apps</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am looking for an MVC framework I can use with my Titanium app. I&#39;m also hoping to get some basic OOP functionality with the framework.</p>
<p>Does anyone have a recommendation based on dev they have done? I am currently looking at Backbone.js, ExtJS, PureMVC and custom.</p>
<p>I have seen some response on other threads, but no firm answer. Also I realize that Titanium is able to use its own API for creating views and data communication, I wouldn&#39;t consider this MVC. I am looking for a structured framework.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

							<p>For my current project I&#39;m using PureMVC with Prototype (of which I changed the Class-method a little). First I tried PureMVC with MooTools, but the last version of MooTools would not run in Titanium. I&#39;ve added some of the MooTools features to Prototype, and am very satisfied with the result. Finally, I&#39;ve also built a basic ActiveRecord-class for the models. So, in the end I kind of built my own framework (with copy-paste and writing some original code). It needs a lot of finetuning, but I am very happy with the result so far.</p>
<p>PureMVC is great: it is lean but powerful! I could have finished my first project much faster if I had used it, and PureMVC leads to clearer code and better architecture of the app.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure whether ExtJS will work in Titanium. You should try both iOS and Android: Rhino is not WebKit JavaScriptCore. I&#39;m using PureMVC in combination with Prototype works on both platforms.</p>

										<p><p>Very helpful. I&#39;ll take a closer look at pureMVC moving forward. So Prototype works well then too? I generally use jQuery. Do you know if there would be any issues there?</p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t know what the value is in using jQuery: it is meant to manipulate the DOM – which is something one does not use in Titanium (which is actually a wrapper for the native API&#39;s), with the exception of webviews, of course. </p>
<p>Prototype works fine. It is a very simple framework (of which you only need a part); unfortunely it&#39;s OO-features are less advanced that those of MooTools – I don&#39;t know exactly about Ext (I once used it for a web-project, and was quite impressed by it). I will look into the changes I made to Prototype&#39;s Class-method (which were somehow important to me). </p>
<p>You will have to get used to PureMVC – it takes some time to &#39;get&#39; how it works. Examine the examples: that helps a lot. Once you start to use it for your own project, PureMVC becomes clearer. The documentation is great: especially the simple rules.</p>

										<p><p><strong>@Mark Aalderink</strong>: How&#x2F;where can I get a copy of your cutdown version of PureMVC? Looked at your blog… http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.riawolf.com&#x2F; , but could not find any link :( Like what you did btw…</p>

										<p><p>This is not my blog. I just sent you an e-mail with the port.</p>
<p>What I&#39;m interested in is getting into contact with other Titanium developers to discuss the architecture of Titanium apps. I think it would be wise to develop a (simpler) framework such as Yii (which I love) for Titanium. </p>
<p>PureMVC works great because, if you follow the rules, you thoroughly separate data from views. Often you manipulate data in one window, which affects other windows. In my first project I used events to do the trick, but it became messy. PureMVC makes this a lot cleaner.</p>
<p>What I&#39;m struggling with is the use of controllers (whether there is any use actually). Does anyone have some insights on this?</p>

							<p>Your best bet is to check out the frameworks section on the 3rd Party Tools page on the wiki here: </p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Third-party+Tools</p>
<p>There is a framework called Foundation that may be what you are looking for.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m the maintainer of Extanium. If you have questions, just ask me. There is a tutorial published in the german print magazin PHPMagazin.de - but it&#39;s german only. I may translate it in english and publish it on extanium.org if I find some spare time for that.</p>

							<p>I guess my next concern is how likely is it that if a developer uses any of these frameworks, that the mobile app will break after updating to a new Titanium Mobile SDK. If it is likely, I&#39;m thinking very low touch frameworks, just directory structure and some base classes, and just enough to strengthen the js OOP with things like Class.extend.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m gonna propose my framework. It supports the navigation between pages with animation.</p>
<p>I built a Facebook-menu-alike app as an example. It works on both Android and iOS.</p>
