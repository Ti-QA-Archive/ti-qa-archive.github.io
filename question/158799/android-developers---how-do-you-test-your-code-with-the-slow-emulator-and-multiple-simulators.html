			<h1>android developers - How do you test your code with the slow emulator and multiple &#34;simulators&#34;</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi friends,</p>
<p>I am trying to build my first android app after successfully launching my 8th iOS app, and I am a Titan since 2010. So, I wanted to step up my game and go into the android market. However, when I tried my hello world android app, I face these two issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>I do not know which device version to go with when launching the app in android emulator, and what real device is it going to support. i.e. Galaxy s4, s3, mini … etc. </li>
<li>When launching the emulator, it takes ages to launch and install the app. whereas the iOS simulator doesn&#39;t take more than one minute MAX. </li>
</ul>
<p>1) I am wondering, do you guys really wait for the emulator to launch? or do you have some tricks that I am not aware of.<br>2) Do you skip the emulator and test it in a real device instead? if yes, is it much quicker? because I am thinking of buying a galaxy device just for the sake of testing my app with it.</p>
<p>Thank you all, and have a great day&#x2F;evening ..</p>

<p>We test on hardware, straight to device. Exception, if we need to see how something functions&#x2F;looks in an older API</p>
<h4 id="do-you-skip-the-emulator-and-test-it-in-a-real-device-instead-">Do you skip the emulator and test it in a real device instead?</h4>
<p>90% of the time, yes</p>
<h4 id="the-ios-simulator-doesn-39-t-take-more-than-one-minute-max-">the iOS simulator doesn&#39;t take more than one minute MAX.</h4>
<p>There is a difference between an emulator and a simulator.</p>
<p>Use the x86 image instead of the arm image if available.  There are some things the x86 image does not have, so keep that in mind.  Use snapshot feature so you don&#39;t have to launch up the entire emulator process (think of it as a <em>save</em> for the emulator).  Consider using LiveView if you are an enterprise level client, or TiShadow to launch your app into an already running emulator or device.</p>

										<p><p>Now, as for hardware to begin your collection:</p>
<p>Start with the 3 google devices: Nexus 4, Nexus 7, Nexus 10 by order of your dev needs.</p>
<p>If your code doesn&#39;t run on a google device, write better code. <em>grin</em></p>
<p>You then branch out, most often by screen size&#x2F;resolution.  </p>
<p>Coming soon to a TiStudio near you, the ability to target an AVD of your choice instead of a titanium generated one.  This will allow you to target the Nexus 4 image as well as motorola avd images.</p>
<p>Unless you must have network connectivity, ebay, craigslist.  You dont care about a &#39;clean&#39; id if you arent throwing it on the network. (you might care if you buy a truly stolen phone, but Big Red is a jerk about blacklisting perfectly good phones)</p>
<p>Craigslist: &#39;Looking to buy android phone xyz, have $50&#39; see if you get a hit.</p>
<p>If you want phones with service, check out swappa. I&#39;v bought twice, and s3 and an s4 and am very happy with the experience.</p>
