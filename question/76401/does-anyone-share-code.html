			<p>I was wondering, is there anywhere that Titanium users gather to share code so as to save us having to re-invent the wheel every time we write an app?</p>
<p>Or am I just being lazy? :-) </p>

							<p>I was having that discussion with some friends the other day. We all said it would be great to share functions and libraries and some online tutorials and it would probably save tons of work for everyone.</p>

							<p>I think this is a great idea. If you poke around the Q&amp;As you&#39;ll find snippets here and there. But it&#39;s a very inefficient system for finding what you need when you need it. Something more wiki like would be good for tips &amp; techniques also.</p>
<p>Appcelerator has mentioned that they&#39;re overhauling the documentation as part of the version 1.5 release. Supposedly that&#39;s only a few weeks out. So, maybe that will provide a means for user-generated content.</p>

							<p>Github.com is a nice way to share code.<br>I will upload my first app with as soon as I finish it. Hopefully in 2 weeks.</p>
