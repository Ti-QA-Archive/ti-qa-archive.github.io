			<h1>Alloy - re-architect a web-centric app with Alloy; best practices, tips/tricks?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all,<br>I have a cross-platform app in which the UI was designed by a web developer. Lots of link-style navigation sometimes 5 levels deep. Somehow, I need to salvage this app using the existing design (for now) because it was agreed to and signed off by the stakeholders before I arrived on the project AND without any input from a mobile-first developer.</p>
<p>I can readily convert the UI elements to alloy, but I&#39;m encountering a roadblock for navigation. Those from whom I inherited the app used Matt Apperson&#39;s <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appersonlabs&#x2F;MASlidingMenu">MASlidingMenu</a>. I can choose something else if needed, however. But other than that, it&#39;s &quot;click this link&quot;, go to a child page, &quot;click another link&quot;, and so on. There are about 20 or 30 main views, each with conditional views. Also, tabgroups, navgroups, or action bars were NOT designed into the application. So I&#39;m stuck with a large number of views that currently require custom navigation. That&#39;s the back story.</p>
<p><strong>My question:</strong> What are some accepted best practices - or tricks of the trade that you use - to manage view navigation that also efficiently manages memory? I&#39;m thinking along the lines of a hidden tabgroup that manages the views behind the scenes. But I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a viable approach not having done something like that before. Or do I use windows and create controllers on button click event listeners?</p>
<p>This question may be too vague for a &quot;fix my code&quot; style forum, but I thought I&#39;d throw it out here anyway. I&#39;m really not sure how to proceed with this issue.</p>

<p>On a different note, Matt advised me NOT to using that sliding menu because it&#39;s no longer being supported or enhanced. I&#39;m working with Ricardo Alcocer to use is widget instead. If someone has an idea and would like to discuss how you would proceed rather than trade forum posts, please contact me here or on my LinkedIn or Twitter accounts.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
