			<p>I developed my android app, everything works exactly how I want it to. However I would like to design something in photoshop and make my app look the way I want it to now, so its got a similar look and feel as our website does. For example I am using tabs, which I could change, however I was hoping to be able to make the two tabs smaller right justified and then place a logo in the left corner. </p>
<p>Ultimately Im just confused with theming not sure where to start.</p>

							<p>To fully customise the interface, especially with tabs, you will have to build your own UI and window&#x2F;view frame logic. There are a few ways of doing this, but the best place is to just start putting things together to see if the app works the way you need it to - with &#39;pseudo-tabs&#39; or whatever, then drop the design in later.</p>

							<p>Hi,</p>
<p>for elements such as navbar, buttons and labels, you can use background images to give a different look but there&#39;s some components which are more strict in terms of customization, like the tabbar. For these, the solution will be to create some custom component or use one made by someone.<br>I recommend customizing simpler components and then build up experience for the more difficult ones.</p>

							<p>Ok thanks, thats good information. Lets say I redesign how I want the app to look to keep the tabs cause I really dont mind the way they look if i can put a logo above them or something like that. So can I move down where they sit and have a small bar above it that I can style(have a background image, and a logo).</p>

										<p><p>You can&#39;t move the tabbar position, it&#39;s stays on bottom for iOS and on top of the screen for Android.</p>
<p>You can put an image&#x2F;logo in your window so that it stays very close to it.</p>
