			<h1>Android emulator won&#39;t run</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey, I&#39;ve got an insanely frustrating issue that I cannot figure out.</p>
<p>Android used to work acceptably… meaning the emulator would run and apps would load on it after a few minutes. But I haven&#39;t used titanium in a while and now, after running a few titanium of the compulsory updates, whenever I try to run an app, no emulator appears, titanium just keeps opening the &#39;Run Configurations&#39; window.</p>
<p>There is no error or other message on screen so I have no idea what it&#39;s trying to tell me. There is no output to the log, obviously because nothing has been run yet, it&#39;s just opening the run config window, and titanium tells me that the Android SDK is installed and is up to date.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried everything I can think of except completely reinstalling titanium.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried editing AVD definitions (tried as many settings as I possibly can), I&#39;ve tried deleting old definitions and adding new ones, I&#39;ve tried API 10 - 19, and Google API&#39;s 10 - 19. I&#39;ve tried running the emulator outside of titanium and then clicking run within titanium, I&#39;ve even completely removed all traces of android sdk and re-downloaded and reinstalled&#x2F;configured everything. Everything just gives me the same result.</p>
<p>Strange thing is, if I open run configurations &gt; Emulator &gt; Manage AVDs and then select one and click &#39;start&#39; the emulator will run. But it will then obviously just run the emulator, it doesn&#39;t run the app, and if I then click run within titanium again it does exactly the same thing again.</p>
<p>I have 2 options as far as I can see:</p>
<p>1) completely reinstall titanium. As I&#39;ve tried everything else, it MUST be a titanium issue and not an android sdk issue.</p>
<p>2) Just not bother with the emulator, use an old GalaxyS device I&#39;ve got laying around and hope newer devices work without testing. I know the android sdk&#x2F;emulators are 99% useless normally, but I was hoping I could at least get a simulation of some newer devices.</p>
<p>Any help appreciated!</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Bin using the android emulators - they are just bad. Use the GenyMotion emulator instead it is VERY fast, very easy - and you will not think about self harm.</p>

										<p><p>BTW <em>&quot;…it must be a titanium issue…&quot;</em> !== true.</p>
<p>the emulator is a universally reviled implementation outside of the titanium world as well.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m having the same problem you describe, but with select genymotion virtual android devices.  It works flawlessly for my virtual Galaxy Nexus 5 running 4.4.2, a virtual Galaxy Nexus running 4.3 and  4.2.2, but when I try to run the app on a virtual Galaxy Nexus running 4.1.1 or a Nexus One running 2.3.7, I just get the &quot;Run Configurations&quot; window as described in the post above.  I can use these virual devices fine if I open them directly in genymotion, but I can&#39;t seem to get Ti Studio to put my app on them for testing on Android 4.1.1 or 2.3.7.  :( Any ideas?</p>
