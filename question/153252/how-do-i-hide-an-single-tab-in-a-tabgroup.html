			<h1>How do I hide an single tab in a tabgroup</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Is hiding a single tab in a tabgroup even possible? I have searched the forum for this answer but haven&#39;t found anything that gives a definitive answer. If this is not possible at the moment, I&#39;d like to suggest this be added into the API. I think this would be a very useful property to use.</p>

							<div><p>I think the question is clear without the answers for any of the above bullet items if you are willing to assume reasonable defaults.  &quot;Is it possible to hide&#x2F;show a tab in Ti.UI.TabGroup?&quot;  I&#39;ve been trying to find an answer for this myself without luck.</p>

							<div><p>I did not provide a further answer or comment as despite being asked for additional information, an unknown but seemingly related person suggested they was no need to add extra information.  Then you provided some extra info but not the code snippet requested.</p>
<p>We are not here to guess, we are here to help.  Sometimes it appears the author is not happy to do their part - this appears to be one of those times.  This may have been a misunderstanding - but as you see from what I just said above, nothing appeared forthcoming.</p>
<p>Added to this, the answer suggested by Muhammad would be the most likely answer without any code given.</p>
<p>If you have more information you can provide - I will revisit.</p>

<p>The project I created using the Tabbed Application Wizard so the source code can be derived by anyone.</p>
<p>I simply would like to know if there is a way to hide a tab in a tabgroup.</p>

							<p>Any luck on this? Driving me crazy. Cross platform app and no matter what platform I test on, can&#39;t find a way to hide then show a single tab in a tab group.</p>
