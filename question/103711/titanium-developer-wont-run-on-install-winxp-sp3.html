			<h1>Titanium Developer won&#39;t run on install (WinXP SP3)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi folks…</p>
<p>I&#39;ve just followed the Windows (XP SP3) step-by-step installation guide, set my paths, variables, software installs, etc. and have reached the &#39;Launch Titanium Developer&#39; section of the guide. On launch, I continually get an error, which just states that the application failed and that an error log has been created. Can&#39;t find the logs, and I&#39;m baffled as to why it&#39;s failing? I&#39;ve re-checked all paths and variables - which are correct - but no joy :(</p>
<p>Any advice for me please?</p>
<p>Cheers - Leo.</p>

							<div><p>Thanks Hal…the guide isn&#39;t specific to WinXP, but to Win7. I&#39;ve changed all path references from C:\Program Files (x86)\ to C:\Program Files\ as I&#39;m using a 32bit version.

							<p>Please don&#39;t post answers to your own question - it makes it difficult for others to follow the conversation and also means that you cannot close the thread at the end.</p>
<p>The instructions were to post the results to gist. Please would you do this?</p>
<p>What antivirus and firewall software are you using? Try disabling both while you install Titanium.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for posting your diagnostics output. Yes, that all seems fine.</p>
<p>Are you installing Titanium Developer while logged in as an administrator? Obviously, it won&#39;t install correctly without sufficient privileges.</p>

										<p><p>Sorry for the radio silence Hal. Yes, I&#39;m running TD as an administrator. I disabled my antivirus software and tested TD - it didn&#39;t run, then I disabled my firewall on top and it ran. With the firewall disabled, in order to preserve the integrity of the PC, I disabled the wireless radio just before disabling the firewall. TD worked! But…in order to continue with the setup wizard, I have to login, which requires Internet access. It&#39;s a catch 22 situation; I gotta disable everything to get it to run, but then can&#39;t proceed unless they&#39;re enabled. One route is to source a different firewall. Incidentally, ZoneAlarm has cleared TD for access to the Internet, does TD need to be cleared to act as a server?</p>

										<p><p>I cleared TD for full Internet and Server access in ZoneAlarm Free, but TD still wouldn&#39;t launch. I enabled the Windows firewall, and disabled ZoneAlarm, and it works perfectly!<br>Gonna install a different firewall above and beyond the Windows one, and test if TD works. I&#39;ll leave this thread open whilst I do that, then comment on it and close the thread. Hal, thanks for your help - really appreciate it.</p>

<p>How are you connected to the Internet?  Do you have a hardware firewall that your PC is behind?</p>

							<p>Hi Hal,</p>
<p>No joy. I ran the Install Diagnostics via the Command Prompt, and followed the instruction set. I&#39;ve checked all path echos + versions, and they are as they should be. Gonna try downloading the Developer.msi again, and see what happens..</p>
