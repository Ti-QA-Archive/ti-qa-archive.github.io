		<section>
			<p>I have a problem publishing my app on Google Play.<br>When I upload the app I created the Google Play website states that my app will be available on 0 devices.</p>
<p>I then made a test, created a Single View App from the template, changed nothing, created an APK to publish and uploaded to Google Play. The same problem. &quot;The app will be available on 0 devices&quot;.</p>
<p>Tried it with building against 4.0.3 Google APIs SDK and 2.3.3. Standard SDK.<br>I am using the Titanium 2.0.1 GA2, but also tried a Ti 2.1.0 SDK.</p>
<p>Why are apps built with Titanium not available on any device in the Google Market?</p>

							<p>The question should actually be: Why is the app that YOU are trying to submit not available on any devices on the Google Market.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe you haven&#39;t ACTIVATED a particular APK that you uploaded. (I&#39;m leaning towards this one)</li>
<li>You somehow have created an application with such a unique combination of hardware and permission requirements that no known device can run your application (highly unlikely)</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>Well, as I have stated: I also created a new project, used the given Single Window Template, changed nothing, neither in code, nor in tiapp.xml, immediately generated an APK for Android Marketplace and I get the same message after uploading the app.</p>
<p>It&#39;s even one step before activating the APK. I am uploading the app, after uploading I get the screen to enter the title and description, selecting countries, … and on the bottom of the page it says: &quot;Your app will be available on 0 devices&quot;.</p>

										<p><p>Ah well, you we&#39;re right. That&#39;s a bit confusing I think: Directly after uploading the apk, the view switches to the descriptions&#x2F;titles&#x2F;… and it states &quot;0 devices supported&quot;. I had to switch to the APK&#39;s tab, activate the APK, switch back to the &quot;Details&quot; tab and then it refreshes the supported devices. </p>
<p>Thanks!!</p>
