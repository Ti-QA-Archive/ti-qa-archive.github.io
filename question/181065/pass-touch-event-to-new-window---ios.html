			<h1>Pass touch event to new window - iOS</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>The aim is to allow a user to hold down a table row, a new tranlucent window will pop in with a slider placed in the same possition as the row.<br>What i need is to pass the touch event (that is currently on the tableview), straight to the slider which the user is now touching &#39;over&#39;. However, by default, moving your finger on the screen moves the table underneath the newly opened window.</p>
<p>obviously letting go and then touching the slider works, but it is this step that i want to remove.</p>
<p>I dont want to bloat the table by adding a slider underneath every row etc etc.</p>
<p>The user should be able to hold down the row, slide the slider that has popped up and release to hide it, seemlessly and in one move.</p>
<p>Is this possible? Im at a loss with this one!</p>
<p>Im not sure examples of my current code would help here, it is a simple tableview with a window containing a simple slider opening on touch start. But if needed just give me a shout.</p>

							<p>What I would suggest is simulating the entire thing. Place all of the Sliders ontop of the TableViewRow on a View with 0.0 opacity, then when the user taps on that row it animates the SliderView to show, and then use the TableViewRow&#39;s <em>touchstart</em> and <em>touchmove</em> to calculate the difference between the start and current position of the touch (Only the X coordinate), and then move the Slider accordingly (After mapping it from 0-platformWidth to 0-1). When <em>touchend</em> is called, then hide the SliderView.</p>

										<p><p>I think this is going to be the only thing thats possible. Not sure how this will effect table performance, but there is only one way to find out! Thank you for your help Colton</p>

										<p><p>No problem. On newer devices I don&#39;t think this should impact performance at all. Depends how many rows you&#39;re trying to render I guess, and how much else is in each row.</p>
