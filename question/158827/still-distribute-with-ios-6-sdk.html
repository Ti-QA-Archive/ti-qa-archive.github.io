		<section>
			<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>i have to update an older app by me… Of course it&#39;s based on ios SDK 6, but i can only choose to work with ios7 sdk in the newest titanium version &#x2F; XCode Version 5.</p>
<p>Cause i don&#39;t wanna fix to much stuff on the app - is there any way to publish it with ios sdk 6 in this times? </p>
<p>Help would be great! :-)</p>
<p>Best,<br>Nico</p>

							<p>Apple require you to build and submit Apps using the latest iOS &#x2F; XCode combinations.<br>This does not mean that device owners who havent upgraded to iOS7 will not be able to run the App, it just means they will not get the iOS7 look and feel.<br>So, the problem is more that iOS7 users may get a less than optimal user experience if you do not adjust the App to work with iOS7</p>

										<p><p>@Nick - I think you are wrong on this one.</p>
<p>Whilst Apple wants everyone to shift, this is not yet enforced and would be unlikely to be so quick out of the gate after launch with companies and individuals at different stages of development with their own apps.</p>
<p>As with last time (think iPhone 5 required support) - Apple announced when the cut off date would be for apps that had yet to embrace the extra support.  Only after that date did it enforce it.  The last date you could submit an app that did not support the iPhone 5 tall screen was April 30th as May 1st was the date all apps had to support it.  This was over 6 months after the launch of the actual handset.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Whilst Apple hopes you will adopt iOS7 and XCODE 5 they are currently not requiring you only use one and build to the other - although this will come.</p>
<p>As with iOS6 Apple happily accepted apps for a period of some months before they required iOS6 based apps (which would still work down to iOS 4.3 (if they were written correctly).  This was the same time that they enforced the need to support the iPhone 5 taller retina display.</p>
<p>They do not enforce this change over straight away as it takes time for apps to take advantage of new apis and with the current iOS7 this is also a big UI change for developers to embrace and master.</p>
<p>Expect this enforcement sometime early 2014, probably around March.</p>
<p>To learn how to manage both 6.1 and 7.0 SDKs at the same time check out this great article&#x2F;guide of how to manage it.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stereoartist.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;build-for-ios-6-1-after-updating-xcode-titanium-mobile">Build for iOS 6.1 &amp; 7.0 before&#x2F;after Updating XCode [Titanium Mobile]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It makes sense to start the transition - but if you have an update to push - I would go ahead and push the update.</p>
