			<h1>One codebase for multiple platforms - Best Practice?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a fairly large codebase for an Android&#x2F;iPhone app, and I&#39;m hoping to hear some suggestions on best practice for keeping the code as clean as possible while supporting multiple platforms.</p>
<p>In KitchenSink, the following is fairly common:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(Ti.Platform.name == <span class="hljs-string">'android'</span>) {
   //<span class="hljs-keyword">do</span> something
}
<span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
   //<span class="hljs-keyword">do</span> something <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>
}
</code></pre><p>That&#39;s fine for small, isolated cases like the example apps.  But for a large codebase, it makes the flow of the code less obvious.  It is also not very flexible if I want to add additional cases for iPad or Blackberry (or Windows Phone 7?) in the future.</p>
<p>My code is very object-oriented, so an alternative that comes to mind is to have the various implementations of an object override some base case.  A contrived example:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">//in a file "Text.js"</span>
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">Text</span> <span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
   <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.welcome = <span class="hljs-string">"Welcome to the app."</span>;
}

<span class="hljs-comment">//in a file "Text_Iphone.js"</span>
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">Text_IPhone</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
   <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.inheritFrom = Text;
   <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.inheritFrom();

   <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.welcome = <span class="hljs-string">"Welcome to the iPhone app!"</span>;
}

<span class="hljs-comment">//in a file "Text_Android.js"</span>
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">Text_Android</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
   <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.inheritFrom = Text;
   <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.inheritFrom();

   <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.welcome = <span class="hljs-string">"Welcome to the Android app!"</span>;
}
</code></pre><p>I would still need an initial conditional statement to determine which version of the Text object to create, but after that, all code could use the object without ever checking the platform again.  All platform-specific code would be organized in appropriately named files this way.</p>
<p>There&#39;s some obvious downsides to this though, like code&#x2F;file bloat, having to check if code is defined in the base class or overridden in a child class, and the potential for duplicate code in the case of multiple definitions of a  function.</p>
<p>I&#39;d really appreciate hearing what approach others are taking to this issue.</p>

							<p>Thanks for the link, I had missed that post.  Slide 14 mentions the basic branching conditionals which I&#39;m hoping to avoid.  Slide 31 mentions a component oriented application that they&#39;ll be providing sometime soon, which might give me some ideas.  Any other info in the mean time would be helpful, though.</p>

							<p>I&#39;d be interested to find out what methodology most folks are using too!</p>
<p>So far we are If&#x2F;then&#x2F;else branching…..</p>

										<p><p>I think as the mobile SDK advances with newer releases the need to use the if (android) conditionals will go away. For example, setting the backgroundImage on a view works on the iPhone and as for the android you have to use the image property. That will be fixed in hopefully the next release. It appears this next release has a lot of work put in for the android platform.</p>

							<p>My base code isn&#39;t <em>that</em> big, but I simply copy+paste my main code (I code for iOS first, then convert to Android) and place the code in the same folders just under the &quot;recourses&#x2F;android&quot; subfolder. When compiling the Android version, Titanium will overwrite all files in the regular resources folder with files in there. So I just take out all my Ti.iPhone &#x2F; Ti.iOS &#x2F; Ti.iPad calls and add in the Android versions of them.</p>
<p>Keeps it clean, but it&#39;s quite annoying if I do a mass update of a page or something. But my code is just small enough that I can just copy+paste over and do the necessary changes. For a larger project, I don&#39;t know how well this would work though.</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve had good luck so far following the Tweetanium project&#39;s code structure. I did not do so well trying to roll my own solution before and ended up eventually splitting the codebase. Like you say, the if&#x2F;then code gets quite cumbersome and performance went into the pit for me. </p>
<p>For this project, I&#39;m well along with functionality and still working with a single codebase. Performance is good, nearly equal on both platforms. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve had to tweak the UI a lot for platform differences. Being an Android user, it pains me a bit to say that iOS is a breeze and androis is a pain. But, that&#39;s the simple truth of it. I&#39;ve spent the last day tweaking my app to make it look presentable on android. The iOS version still looks a lot nicer.</p>
