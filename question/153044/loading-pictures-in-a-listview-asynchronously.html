			<h1>Loading Pictures in a ListView Asynchronously</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>In the application I am working on. I am implementing a search for profiles feature. The search result will be displayed in a ListView. I have managed to display name and surname of my user in this list view.<br>I would like to add their picture  in the ListItems of the ListView.The are on server the search result  the picture URL. I would like to know if it is possible to launch the download of the picture asynchronously and update the list items once the picture has been downloaded.</p>
<p>Thanks for your replies :)</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The answer is yes, but you might end up with a harder time of it.</p>
<p>Firstly, the ListView is designed to be data specific rather than view specific so you have no direct access to the views to update and will instead have to pass new data in instead.</p>
<p>The process is easy enough but gets more complicated by the number of the simultaneous connections you will need to manage, which is actually restricted by the OS on both platforms.</p>
<p>The logic of the solution is;</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a XHR download wrapper function you pass the image URL to and a callback to handle the successful download</li>
<li>internally to the wrapper you save the image in your own file store system that manages duplicate filenames (if there are any) and then passes back the local file reference</li>
<li>then update the row - provided you have an association to it.</li>
<li>you should manage the download trigger to start ONLY when required - so if there are 50 rows, but 5 per screen start the first few and then trigger more as the table is scrolled to expose more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless you have a very specific need - you should leave this to the ListView&#x2F;TableView as they do have these things built in and normally perform better than routines you may be able to provide.</p>
<p>Where you can gain a speed advantage is if you cache the downloads between uses so keeping 100 or so images so that next time you call the wrapper it knows there is a file and uses that RATHER than calling for a new one - saving the download altogether - this way only the first hit is an expense.</p>
<p>Remember though you should always determine the potential performance increase against the extra code, re-usability, overhead in storage and more.</p>

										<p><p>Once more trick you could employ which is done by the more professional apps is to determine the images that will be required in a set of calls, call a server api to make a SINGLE large image made up of the smaller images placed next to each other in a canvas.  You then download this image and slice it up to separate files placing those where you need them.  This has the performance benefit of a single download avoiding all of the many individual connections and handshakes that increase the time frame when lots of smaller files are being called.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your answer. It really helped me.  I really like this idea of picture Atlas.</p>
