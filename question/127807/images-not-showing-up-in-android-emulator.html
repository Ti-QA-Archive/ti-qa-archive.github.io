			<h1>Images not showing up in Android Emulator</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been working on an Android App for a while now and it&#39;s getting near complete. Just working on some multi-layout multi-firmware debugging at the moment. I have a few actual devices I can test on (luckily) - </p>
<ol>
<li>my own Samsung Galaxy S (Gingerbread 2.3.3)</li>
<li>My Girlfriend&#39;s old Samsung Galaxy Spica (Eclair 2.1 update 1)</li>
<li>My Girlfriend&#39;s new HTC Cha Cha (Gingerbread 2.3.3 I think)</li>
</ol>
<p>I haven&#39;t done any testing on the Cha Cha yet but that&#39;s last on my list. Currently I have an app working pretty well on the Samsung Galaxy S and for some reason it&#39;s crashing the first time I test it on the Galaxy Spica (I&#39;ll start a seperate question about that). I&#39;ve set the Android SDK to version 1.5 to try to accommodate older phones if possible.</p>
<p>Anyway, my main issue here is I want to try to use the emulator do do multi-res testing as it&#39;s probably the best way to do it (despite the slowness)</p>
<p>I tested the app in the emulator and noticed two things -</p>
<ol>
<li>First, the images (buttons) aren&#39;t showing up. tabs are fine, custom fonts fine. </li>
<li>Second, the tab group buttons seem grey at the top instead of blue on my Galaxy S.</li>
</ol>
<p>So my question is this - does anybody know why the imageviews aren&#39;t showing up on the emulator ?  (and is it running an older firmware</p>

							<p>I have seen the fastdev server cause issues with updating images. You can turn it off by putting </p>

							<p>I face the same issues - images display fine on device, but not emulator. I read somewhere that it&#39;s an issue to do with the actual emulator and not Titanium, but not certain on that.</p>
<p>It certainly gave me a fright when I updated the content on my app over the air, ran it on the emulator first and couldn&#39;t see any images.</p>
<p>Hopefully somebody with a little more knowledge might be able to provide a definitive answer.</p>

										<p><p>It&#39;s pretty weird - I have a tableview of rows pulled from an XML file with images on a remote server.  I added several new rows with an update to theXML and the associated thumbnail row images didnt display on the emulator (fine on device). I did another update recently (same process) and those images displayed fine!</p>
<p>I came to the conclusion that if it was all working fine on devices then I didn&#39;t need to spend too much time worrying about why they&#39;re not appearing on the emulator.</p>
<p>As I said previously, I have read somewhere that it could be an issue with the actual emulator - so if that&#39;s the case it&#39;s not a Titanium issue.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>That&#39;s correct, I think it&#39;s still an issue coz my ticket http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-4900 is still not solved.</p>
<p>Cheers, Erik</p>
