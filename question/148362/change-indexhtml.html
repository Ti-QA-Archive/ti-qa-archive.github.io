			<h1>Change Index.HTML</h1>

		<section>
			<p>ive just installed titanium and the android sdk for development. In my project i have an index.html but its not loading that when i do a build, it keeps loading a &#39;welcome to titanium&#39; html page which for the life of me i just can&#39;t find anywhere to see where its being loaded from.</p>
<p>How the heck do i set my index.html to be the one that is loaded when the app first loads? I have tried adding</p>
<p>index2.html (index2 as a test) but its still loading this welcome to titanium url even when i make a new blank project.</p>

Please expand on your question with as much information as would allow someone to know what problem you are experiencing.  Providing only details about a <strong>index.html</strong> and <strong>index2.html</strong> without suggesting what you are try to achieve or where you are placing the files is very limiting.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>As you have written <strong>mobileweb</strong> as a tag I am going to assume that you are creating a html5 web app using Titanium.</p>
<p>If this is correct can you please;</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide the contents of your <strong>app.js</strong> file</li>
<li>Indicate where you are adding the <strong>index2.html</strong> file; in a folder or as a reference in a file?</li>
<li>Are you trying to show a <strong>webView</strong>?</li>
</ul>

							<p>The Titanium doesn&#39;t workwith HTML5. Id you want this, the you have to go to phonegap … In Titanium the start file is named &#39;app.js&#39;.</p>

										<p><p>@Rainer; you are aware that Titanium DOES support html5 style apps?  The code syntax is almost identical to the mobile apps for iOS, Android and Blackberry.  The option is available every time you create a new project.</p>
