			<h1>Creating an ipa - I can&#39;t find the build/iPhone directory</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I have come to the point where I need to create an ipa so I can test my App</p>
<p>My first question - can someone ponint me in the right direction for some good documentation that tells me how to do this.</p>
<p>Also in my Studio I cannot find build&#x2F;iPhone directory. Is this normal or do I need to do something that creates this directory within my project. From what I can gather from reading posts is that I have to build my project in order to create the ipa but i&#39;m expecting something in the build folder in order to do this.</p>
<p>Any assistance is greatly appreciated as I need the ipa to test my App using testflight as a distribution method.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p><code>build</code> folder is not shown in Titanium Studio, but if you browse in finder to the project folder you will find it there. Anyway, you do not need the build folder, Titanium Studio build the ipa file for you.</p>
<p>Use &quot;Run on device&quot; from Titanium Studio to create a .ipa file signed with a development profile. You will be able to &quot;rescue&quot; the ipa file from your iTunes software (right click the app &gt; Reveal in finder). Or use &quot;Distribute - App Store&quot; in Titanium Studio to create a distribution signed .ipa file. Then go to xCode &gt; Window &gt; Organizer &gt; Archives and there will be your file.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the info but i&#39;m going to need a bit more help please. I have just joined the iOS Developer Program (today) which I hadn&#39;t before.<br>From Titanium Studio I choose &#39;Run&#39; which shows the IOS Simulator but can&#39;t see where &#39;Run on device&#39; is or is this the same thing? Even so when i do this I cannot see where the .ipa is created (I have searched all the folders in Finder) - I also don&#39;t understand about the development profile - is this something to do with the iOS developer program and do i have to set something else up? This is the first time I am doing this and i&#39;m not sure i have done all the steps I should do. Thanks.</p>
