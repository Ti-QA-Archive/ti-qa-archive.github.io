			<p>Hi all,<br>Didn&#39;t really know where to post something like this. So, I decided here. I started a titanium mobile chatroom on stackoverflow in hopes that we could get quicker turnaround on responses that are more relevent to the current sdk releases. Please participate. It can only help our community grow.  Find it here <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;rooms&#x2F;41561&#x2F;titanium-mobile">SO titanium-mobile chatroom</a></p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>As someone who has provided answer to 1,973 separate questions and help out here on average 20 hours a week providing answers on topics from the very latest versions of the Studio, CLI, SDKs, pre-release stuff including betas - I am confused as to what sort of turn around is better than you already have than here.</p>
<p>There are very few questions that go unanswered for any period of time, there are many many people pitching in to help here, some give a bit of time - some give a lot.</p>
<p>We have some community members that could be better and some that can be too enthusiastic - but as this is a community led support service - we accept them all.</p>
<p>Whilst I like your enthusiasm your goal of moving people to another location will only actually hurt the community you wish to help.  By hoping that people leave here to go there, people who do will have must less support than they do here.  By logical extension there will be be two groups - served by different mind sets.  Everyone loses out.</p>
<p>If you really do want to help - then pitch in here and help.  If your compliant is that you are not being assisted by others quickly enough - then given I am the one who has become involved in your most recent question within minutes of you posting it - I am not sure how fast you would prefer things to be.</p>

										<p><p>Malcolm. it&#39;s not a complaint. Just another avenue. And it wasn&#39;t intend to pull people away. It&#39;s quite easy to do both. I find chatting in real-time often helps me on things that don&#39;t really warrant an involved Q&amp;A.<br>It appears that you were offended. That was not the intent. More choice for problem resolution is better, in my opinion.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ll have to second Malcolm. I spend a bunch of time reviewing, viewing, asking, answering questions on this forum and it is definitely THE location for collaboration with other developers and a place to get your questions answered.</p>

										<p><p>I was not offended - I have thicker skin that that.  I am very proudly linked to this Q&amp;A and the community here and whilst not perfect in its ability to provide every avenue of connection - it is the hub for when people want to learn, to help, to give back and to seek general advice.</p>
<p>There may not be a real time chat - but you have to remember people here are giving up their free time.  So they are generally not able to offer real-time support, but broken up into blocks of time.</p>
<p>Plus if you look at answers from some of the old hands here including; myself, Stephen Feather Tim Poulsen, Tony Lukasavage, Aaron Saunders, Dan Tamas, Nick Milner, Christian Brousseau  and yes even Ray Belisle - some are very detailed, with full explanations of why something should be done a certain way with code showing how to make further enhancements - follow ups that go on for a few days or more, dealing with related questions from other who come later.  It is not possible or advisable to try and provide that whilst someone is asking question in real time.</p>
<p>Most of the code I provide to explain to someone the best way to do something is cross platform tested - even on devices and through platform versions.  Sometimes the same code is tried any multiple SDK versions and beta versions.  This all takes time.  I am often writing code - a hundred lines long on an iPad because someone needs something and I have left my dev machine.</p>
<p>I am not suggesting your ideal is bad - just the reality of hoping that real-time chats to aid you is how things will get better - is simply not feasible given the work that everyone is doing behind the scenes.</p>
<p>I and a few others have conversations behind the scenes in order to derive the best solution when our individual minds do not have an answer.  Sometimes you gain that benefit from people who will not appear in the Q&amp;A as their community help is given in other ways (I am thinking of a few right now) - but they will happily give their opinions and suggests to us (their friends) so we can impart it on you.</p>
<p>Right now it is coming up to 10:30pm in the UK I am still in the office because I wanted to provide support to the community - and in particular a few questions that came in after 6pm.  As I am sure you know - we do not get paid for this - I am in fact own my own app development agency that is my very full time job.</p>
<p>Now be certain I am answering your question and points but I am not directing all at you specifically - but for those who come afterwards - so they might get an idea of the way the help they ask for and receive is provided to them.  Sometimes this is a thankless task - sometimes we get abuse - seriously people abuse you for helping them.  Swearing in a foreign language appeared in another question today (not mine) - uncalled for and an unnecessary.  Yet we all still go on.</p>
<p>So yes - I am all for community and improving it - but this is the place people come and unless there is a genuine and significant improvement to be had elsewhere - this is where people should stay.</p>

										<p><p>Seriously? I was trying to provide more resources, not be divisive by any means. I don&#39;t see how my post warranted such a lengthy and vociferous defense. But it obviously struck a sour note. Simple way to solve this – don&#39;t like the idea, then ignore it and move on. Or someone at Appc can remove it altogether.</p>
