			<h1>ButtonBar for Android?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, I&#39;m curious if anyone has implemented something similar to a button bar for Android?</p>
<p>I find myself in need of the ability to horizontally place 1-N buttons on the screen inside of a view.  It appears (from my testing) that I need to take care of the calculations of where to place the buttons to space them properly (left to right).</p>
<p>A few questions<br>1) Am I missing something where TI can help with placing them?</p>
<p>2) Has anyone built any reusable code for this?</p>
<p>3) Do others think it would be useful for me to try to build this as reusable class?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>This is far from an elegant solution but given that better support is coming from native TI in 1.6 I think this will work.  It&#39;s basically a function that takes some info about the layout and generates the &quot;left&quot; values for your buttons.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    /*
     * <span class="hljs-type">This</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">method</span> will <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> an <span class="hljs-type">array</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> <span class="hljs-string">"left"</span> values
           to equally space buttons horizontally.
     */
    styles.spaceButtons = function(containerWidth, numButtons,
                                       buttonWidth, buttonSpacer)
    {

        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> padding = containerWidth - 
        ((numButtons*buttonWidth)+(buttonSpacer*(numButtons-<span class="hljs-number">1</span>)));
        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> lefts = [];
        <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> i = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i &lt; numButtons; i++)
        {
            <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> thisLeft = padding/<span class="hljs-number">2</span> + 
                          (buttonWidth*(i))+(buttonSpacer*(i));    
            lefts[i] = thisLeft;
        }
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> lefts;
    }
</code></pre>

										<p><p>What appears to be coming in 1.6.x is the horizontal layout and percentage width support for android.  When you asked if anyone had written a class for a pseudo buttonbar, I thought you were talking about handling the mutually exclusive nature of the buttons in the group, and the selected state to allow the selected color or image properties to yield the visual clues.  The actual layout placement strikes me as fairly easy to work around.</p>
<p>However, if you write a class to handle the mutual exclusivity and post it publicly, I&#39;m sure several of us would be happy to vote it up too.  :)  Just like I am doing with this part of it.</p>

										<p><p>Oh, sorry I guess I mistook what the ButtonBar did for iOS.  I was just looking for something that would place buttons horizontally - properly spaced.</p>

										<p><p>In that case your code is probably preferable on both platforms.  In iOS, a buttonbar will act similar to an &quot;option group&quot; of push buttons in VBA.  They are mutually exclusive.</p>

							<p>Hi Frank</p>
<p>Yes, you would need to devise the formula to position the objects left to right, although Android&#39;s new support (in 1.6.X) for <code>layout:horizontal</code> and percentage widths may help with this. See tickets <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32238-titanium-mobile&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;1225">#1225</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32238-titanium-mobile&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;1176">#1176</a> respectively for info.</p>
<p>Yes, it would be sensible to create a reusable class. If you are asking whether it would be helpful if you shared it with the community, then I would guess it would, and I would imagine you would gain a lot of new friends because of it! ;)</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the info on the upcoming support.  I&#39;ll whip something up and share it.  Can&#39;t promise that it will be the most elegant solution but it will probably be helpful for a few people before 1.6 comes out.</p>
