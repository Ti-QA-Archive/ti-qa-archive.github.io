			<h1>Problem with Android SDK in both, Windows 7 and OSX</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi. I had problems running the Android emulator in Windows 7 and OSX. I already solved the problem in Windows creating new system variables and all that, but still can&#39;t run the emulator in my Mac Mini. It&#39;s an old Mac Mini with Snow Leopard. I didn&#39;t install Java and I have no idea if that&#39;s required in this system, because I checked Oracle&#39;s website and Java 1.6 is not available for Mac (I couldn&#39;t find any link). So I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s me or is the system that&#39;s not working. This is what I get when I try to run my app for Android:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[INFO] logfile = /Users/John/Documents/Apps/<span class="hljs-keyword">Test</span>/build.<span class="hljs-literal">log</span>

</code></pre><p>The process to get the system running for iOS was fine, but for Android is a pain in the ass. Can you improve that a little bit? You should make a lot of things more clear, such as the installation of Java, for example. I was going crazy until I found out that you require Java 1.6 instead of 7, for example. The name of the folder for the Java SDK has to be written without spaces??? Those things make everything extremely complicated for a process that should be extremely simple (the installation).</p>

							<p>When starting Titanium Studio, you are presented a Dashboard.</p>
<p>If you go into the <strong>Configure</strong> section, you should be presented 2 big buttons. One on the them is to configure Android development. If you click it, it should download all the necessary components for you (or update if needed). This is very useful when you need to &quot;repair&quot; a partial install.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

							<p>Hi Christian. Thanks, but obviously I already know those buttons, I installed everything. I also updated the SDKs in both computers. In Windows 7 I made it work, but I still get a lot of warnings and the result on the emulator of simple examples look awful, so I think something is not working right yet. For the Mac, I followed the same process, but I get the errors listed above. I tried a few things, such as clear the projects, erase the virtual-Idontknowwhat from the Android SDK console, but I still get those errors. What will be useful is to know if I have to install the Java SDK for the Mac and where do I get those files. Because I didn&#39;t install that and I didn&#39;t find how to install it (I went to Oracle&#39;s website and they don&#39;t have an install for Java 1.6 for the Mac).</p>
<p>I wish it were as simple as click those buttons, but it is not. I installed everything according to Titanium&#39;s instructions from two computers with different OSs and the Android SDK didn&#39;t work in both. Something has to be improve there.</p>
