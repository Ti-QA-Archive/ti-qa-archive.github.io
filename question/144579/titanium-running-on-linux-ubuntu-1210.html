			<h1>Titanium running on Linux Ubuntu 12.10</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I just wondered if anyone else was running Titanium on Ubuntu 12.10 and if so was the install straightforward? I have it installed (I believe) 95% successfully but have hit a stumbling block.</p>
<p>I have a fresh install of Ubuntu, successfully installed and setup JDK 6u37, set paths etc (or the equivalent in Linux), installed Android SDK and required platforms etc. Titanium starts and says that Android SDK is installed correctly (yay). I open a new project using the default 2 tab template, but when I go to run the app (to see that my install is really successful) the Android Emulator is not an option on the little dropdown button, only mobile web. Android is DEFINITELY ticked on the list of deployment targets on the project setup page and Titanium is configured to find the Android SDK in the correct folder. </p>
<p>Anyone else had this occur? I&#39;ve been back and double checked that Android is selected as a deployment target and it is. I&#39;ve also opened another new project but no luck.</p>
<p>BTW, I&#39;ve been using Titanium successfully on a MAC when at work but wanted to use it at home too, hence the Ubuntu option (I don&#39;t have a MAC at home and WinXP isn&#39;t listed as being a supported platform for Titanium). I thought I knew my way around Titanium but this has me stumped.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any advice.</p>
<p>Phil</p>

							<p>Phil, you certain you have the proper version of the Android SDK installed?</p>
<p>Version 8 of platform SDK and version 8 Google APIs?  Does AVD Manager show any emulators installed?</p>
<p>Can you install to an Android device?</p>
<p>HTH.  Bob</p>

							<p>Bob, thanks for that. It&#39;s one of those problems that just didn&#39;t feel right (and one that I hadn&#39;t seen when using the Mac) so I reinstalled the Android SDK on the Linux platform and all is good now.</p>
