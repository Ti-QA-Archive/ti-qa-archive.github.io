			<p>Hi,<br>My app was rejected today for the following reasons &amp; Apple&#39;s Message below:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-string">" We found that while your app offers In-App Purchase(s) that can be restored, it does not include the required "</span><span class="hljs-keyword">Restore</span>" feature to allow users to <span class="hljs-keyword">restore</span> the previously purchased <span class="hljs-keyword">In</span>-<span class="hljs-keyword">App</span> Purchase(s).

							<p>Hi,<br>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>We have already built one app using the native iOS (XCode) development and we have used the same Non-consumable IAP type without having the Restore Button in that App. And currently, its available on App Store.<br>For implementing this App&#39;s IAP we have referred to the apple&#39;s steps, please refer to the following link:<br>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;ios&#x2F;#documentation&#x2F;NetworkingInternet&#x2F;Conceptual&#x2F;StoreKitGuide&#x2F;AddingaStoretoYourApplication&#x2F;AddingaStoretoYourApplication.html#&#x2F;&#x2F;apple_ref&#x2F;doc&#x2F;uid&#x2F;TP40008267-CH101-SW1</p>
<p>We think that, Store Kit Module which is used for IAP in Titanium also needs to follow these steps. Can you please verify that Titanium has included all the steps which are mentioned by the Apple?</p>
<p>And please let us know that, is it possible to implement the similar kind of Steps (suggested by Apple) by using Titanium framework or not?</p>

							<p>As Alberto has said, if you add IaP to your app and the chosen type of purchase is Non-Consumable then you must have a restore button for any previous IaPs.  Whilst you may previously have had an app make it into the store without this functionality (not sure how) this is not how it is done correctly.  Otherwise your app users are losing an important right.</p>
<p>Consider this scenario;</p>
<p>Your app is a game and you allow an IaP to purchases coins, with those coins the player can buy something or advance somehow.  Once spent those coins are no longer available for the player - that would be a &#39;consumable&#39; - the player would not expect to get those back once spent (or at least should not.</p>
<p>Now consider the type of IaP you say you have actually included - Non-Consumable</p>
<p>Your app is a text editor and you allow an IaP to export your document to MS Word, this feature is not included in the standard version.  Now imagine a user of your app purchases the ability to export to MS Word.  A week later they change their phone and re-download your app.  They would rightly expect to be able to &#39;RESTORE&#39; their purchase of the export facility.  This would be done with a &#39;Restore&#39; button, they should not expect to have to purchase it again and the ability to gain access to the export option should be obvious, again the &#39;Restore&#39; button.</p>
<p>Because you have included a Non-Consumable you have to have a Restore button and that button should be obvious for the user of the app to be able to select.</p>
<p>The Store Kit for Titanium is doing EXACTLY what it should and EXACTLY what is required.  Had you have created the app in XCODE then you would have had the same problem.  Apple is asking you to respect paying the audience of your app.  The demo code that comes with the Store Kit gives you examples of how to add a restore button.</p>
<p>If you should have used a consumable IaP then no need for the Restore button.</p>
