		<section>
			<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I have had no end of trouble tring to get titanium developer to work on winxp.</p>
<p>The IT guy was here and said that the program looks to be full of bugs.</p>
<p>I have managed to get the emulator working and showing the mobile screen. However, I have created a hello world application - just created a project really as per instructions on this site.</p>
<p>The emulator loads but no sign of my app and this error message shows?-</p>
<p>[ERROR] Error generating R.java from manifest</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>I have spent quite some time trying to help you with <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;100891&#x2F;emulator-screen-option-shows-as-loading">your previous question</a>. If that question is resolved then it is good practice&#x2F;etiquette to mark one of the answers as &quot;best&quot; to close it. Please read <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;contribute.html#participating_in_the_q&amp;a">Participating in the Q&amp;A</a> to find out how to use these forums effectively.</p>
<p>Have you installed and configured python yet, as I advised previously? Please follow the instructions in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;installing_on_windows.html#install_diagnostics_for_windows">Install Diagnostics for Windows</a> again, but this time please <strong>do not</strong> paste the output here - create a <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;">GitHub Gist</a> instead (as advised in the instructions).</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>Hi there, I tried to close the posts but saw no option to say close. If you direct me I will do this.</p>
<p>Yes installed and confirmed python and everything and even the IT guy has done all these steps to make sure it&#39;s correct.</p>
<p>Outcome was the developer is very buggy and looks like I will need to find an alternative. Being directed to the same diagnostics page is not helping me. Even the IT guy said all works correctly as per the diagnostics page.</p>
<p>Still no working developer platform.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help but I think I&#39;m going to need to locate another method for app development.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Annemarie</p>
<p>The diagnostics script honestly is the best way to help you, without actually being at your machine.</p>
<p>Anyway, you should see a link next to the answers beneath your questions stating something like &quot;mark as the best answer&quot;. Clicking on this will close the post.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>Thank you, I have done this but on my own post as the issue hadn&#39;t been fixed by me or the forum. The IT guy fixed it. </p>
<p>No much else I can do now but just give up. Thank you again for you time. All results come back fine for the diagnostics after I installed Python. All environmental variables set, Java installed etc. Have run out of idea&#39;s.</p>
<p>Thank you again.</p>
