		<section>
			<p>I think I already know the answer to this question, but…</p>
<p>As multi-platform developers, we are confronted with the burden of owning several platforms to support the products we develop</p>
<p>Already reluctant to drop several hundred on an iPhone, I just found out HTC has no plans to support Android versions greater than JellyBean (4.1), which means I will never have support for BLE, which means I now have to drop another few hundred on an Android</p>
<p>So, the question is, are there any options&#x2F;programs available to developers to help lessen this burden, or are we all DOOMED!</p>

							<p>Unfortunately, having a large pile of toys is the bane of mobile developers everywhere. If you&#39;re a consultant, I suggest you build in the cost of maintaining a library of devices into your contracts. You could pair with other local developers to share the burden. You might have an <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;opendevicelab.com&#x2F;">Open Device Lab</a> near you or maybe you could set one up. Find a local meetup group related to mobile development and ask members there if they&#39;d be willing to share devices, test apps for you, etc. Keep an eye on craigslist and ebay for cheap older devices, or buy them off friends or relatives (for as little as you can get them to take!).</p>
<p>There are online testing service that will test for you – upload your apk&#x2F;ipa and they&#39;ll test it on their devices. It probably works great. I think I&#39;d want to have the device in hand myself to trust the test. But that&#39;s probably just me.</p>

							<p>Well, for what it&#39;s worth as a &quot;strategy,&quot; I usually just end up keeping an APK stored on the net somewhere and asking several friends if I can use their phone to test it out here and there. Between their phone purchases and mine, I seem to always have a range of phones that span 3 or 4 years old to brand new.</p>
