			<p>I have two strings.xml files in which I write some literals in order to have a multilingual application. But I have a problem since yesterday which is the following: I cannot see my app &#39;writing&#39; the literals in my app, some I added yesterday are not visible and the name of locales literals are shown instead. I tried to delete all files from build folder and change tiapp.xml in order to force a full rebuild but with no luck.<br>Two more clues:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have forgotten to write in one of these files some literals and these I added last are not seen but the older ones work properly.</li>
<li>I Android all work properly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks in advance for your time.</p>

							<div><p>Fotis, You mention two strings.xml.. I presume they are for two languages.. say &#39;en&#39; and &#39;fr&#39;.. with all the same elements in the XML, but different language. Could you check which language shows up fine? .. also try removing one of the stings.xml.. forcing the resolution to happen from only one file to zero in on the culprit. Thanks.</p>

							<div><p>Neo, removing the one of them had no result. I removed both and I still had some literals from these files. It&#39;s like these files are somewhere cached, but I don&#39;t know where.</p>

							<p>I tried to create a new project from scratch, and that solved the problem, but not for a long time. After one day of work in these new files, I have the same problem. Does anybody know why this thing happens? I&#39;m desperate! I can&#39;t recreate the whole project from scratch in order to solve this problem. It&#39;s horrible!</p>

										<p><p>I just notice that there&#39;s no localization folder on the generated XCode project at all.<br>I&#39;ve seen in other posts that there might be a problem with projects that have spaces on its name.<br>That&#39;s not my case.</p>
<p>I&#39;m guessing this is a Titanium bug.</p>
