			<h1>How to perform database inserts/updates on a separate thread?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Our iPhone application syncs with a server with a lot of data with cross relationships. Connecting to our API is easy and seamless, but as soon as the request is received successfully the GUI and application locks up.</p>
<p>I assume these updates are performed on the same thread as the rest of the application, so is it possible to trigger a new thread to perform the database inserts and updates?</p>

							<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible. Try using db transaction, it should speedup things a lot. You can also postpone db import until UI is rendered (and that way make illusion things are working fast).</p>

										<p><p>Just had a look into DB Transactions, this would be great if I didn&#39;t have to collect auto insert IDs generated by the database.</p>
<p>The GUI is rendered before the database performs it&#39;s updates, however as soon as the database does begin updates, it freezes the application, which stops the user from navigating to other sections available.</p>

							<p>Using JAVA Script, to run something on different thread. i found to use a <strong>different function call</strong> for your database query… but check the documentation also for this.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks but the API sync and database updates are already performed in separate functions. I have one callback function for the API request, it then calls a separate function to update each table necessary.</p>
