		<section>
			<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I have been trying to install the Titanium developer on my Windows 7 work pc for several times, however it ended up with failure each time. I keep getting the &#39;unable to download SDK&#39; error message towards the end of each installation. Any idea?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>I installed a fully-working Titanium environment onto Windows 7 just yesterday, and I didn&#39;t have any problems.</p>
<p>Just a suggestion, but close Titanium Developer between each SDK download.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

										<p><p>Hi Hal,</p>
<p>Just checked. We don&#39;t actually have a proxy server. Is there a bundled installer available at all? So It won&#39;t need to download the SDK from the appcelerator server.</p>

							<p>I have spent the last few hours, frustrated, trying to install on Windows 7 Ultimate, 32 bit. I&#39;ve read through the forums and tried all of the suggestions: turned off antivirus, shut down all firewalls, turned of UAC, rebooted, tried an aletrnate install location, etc. Nothing helps.</p>
<p>The install crashes and burns at &quot;Downloading and extracting the Mobile SDK (1.2.0)&quot; with an error box title &quot;Installation Failed&quot;  &quot;Could not query info: Invalid HTTP Status Code (0)&quot;</p>
<p>I see many instances of this mentioned here in the forums, so it&#39;s not an isolated issue to my machine. Why doesn&#39;t anyone have a concrete answer to what is causing the issue, and what to do to make sure it doesn&#39;t happen?</p>
<p>I really want to try this platform, but if I can&#39;t even get it to install … and no one who is developing it cares to respond … what&#39;s the point?</p>
<p>Does ANYONE have a link to a zipped install for download instead of this buggy MSI?</p>

										<p><p>I still haven&#39;t managed to install it on my Windows 7 PC yet. The error won&#39;t go away no matter what I do (I have tried pretty much the same thing as Thomas has). </p>
<p>Would there be a bundled installer (PC version)? Instead of downloading it from a remote server as it seems to be problematic for many users.</p>

										<p><p>The only thing left to try is a different internet connection setup. We are on satellite here. The sat modem connects to a linksys hub which acts as the primary router. I&#39;ve heard of some sites (Twitter search) which fail through Hughesnet because of some web acceleration softwear at the NOC.  So, I&#39;ll try it on a laptop connected to WiFI&#x2F;DSL later today at a different location.</p>
<p>But if someone responsible for development is reading this it would be really helpful to provide those with this issue an alternate installation download because at this point the whole platform is unusable for us. Even Microsoft provides an alternate to MSI on their own sites.</p>

										<p><p>OK.  Some new information.</p>
<p>The installattion succeeded perfectly on a laptop when connected to a DSL, and not through a Hughes sat-modem.  I have yet to test if the software works properly as well, when the laptop is connected again at the office through the sat system.</p>
<p>Note for the developers.  I also can not log in to post here when on the office sat system. The login screen continually says the email&#x2F;password combo is not valid.  The only way I can post is to ask for a password reset, and continue from there.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know how many folks may be behind a Hughesnet modem, or similar, but it is becoming apparent that something in the calls on these pages is not compatible with the software at the Hughes NOC.  Again, a good argument for alternate install options.</p>
<p>Inwill test the software, and the other suggestions above later tonight or tomorrow.</p>
<p>Thanks to all for their help with this!</p>

<p>Can you confirm whether you have tried disabling your antivirus and firewall just for the duration of the installation?  Does this help?</p>

<p>Yes, I understand; you already made that clear. We still need confirmation from Chan though.</p>
<p>As you can tell, this thread is becoming confusing. Most of the time it is best for you to simply open your own Q&amp;A question, so that you can ask for help directly rather than mixing your issue in with someone else&#39;s. As much as the problems appear to be identical, this often isn&#39;t always the case when the source of the problems is eventually discovered.</p>
<p>Obviously, you can always subscribe to Chan&#39;s question, and post your solution here if you find one.</p>

<p>Would you explain the type of internet connection you have, and list any hardware you are using? It would be good to get to the bottom of this, so that a solution can be found for everyone.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Hal,</p>
<p>PC - Windows 7 Enterprise (32bit)<br>Connection - All work PCs are connected to the Internet through a hub&#x2F;bridge (no proxy or hardware firewall)</p>
<p>The strangest things is that I followed Thomas&#39; advice and managed to install the Titanium Developer inside the virtual machine (XP Mode) on my PC without a problem, however I was unable to sign in (in XP Mode) with my account. I&#39;m getting the &#39;Request time out, make sure you&#39;re online&#39; error message in the IDE (next to the &#39;Sign In&#39; tab).</p>

										<p><p>Hi Hal,</p>
<p>Just a follow up with the last comment. I copied the &#39;Titanium Developer&#39; folder to the &#39;Program Files&#39; folder in my Windows 7 &#39;C&#39; drive. and double-clicked on the Titanium Developer.exe to open&#x2F;run it, and the download popup window appears, but it kept getting stuck at 99% and the error message &#39;Download Failed&#39; comes back again.</p>
<p>I have created a rule in Windows Firewall&#39;s advanced settings to bypass any restrictions for Titanium Developer and run the .exe as an administrator via right-click -&gt; &#39;Run as administrator&#39; and still no luck.</p>

										<p><p>Personally, I would not put the installer into the file it is going to install the software to.  Delete everything related to Titanium in <code>C:\Program Files</code>, <code>C:\ProgramData</code> and <code>C:\Users\username\titanium</code>. Log into the machine as the administrator, rather than using <code>runas</code> and try again with your AV and firewall disabled.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Hal,</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion, I just checked those directories mentioned in the post. But they don&#39;t actually exist on my PC I think it might be because the Titanium Developer hasn&#39;t been installed yet.</p>

							<p>Chen,</p>
<p>I think I have a solution for you, at least this worked for me.</p>
<p>1) Take a laptop with Win 7 to another location, say a WiFi hotspot, and attempt the installation using the MSI from there. That worked immediately for me indicating something in our satellite setup, probably at the Hughes NOC, was blocking the connection.</p>
<p>2) Bring the laptop back to your primary office LAN where the setup was failing and copy the &quot;c:\program files\titanium developer&quot; folder from the laptop to the target PC.</p>
<p>3) On the target PC navigate to the new &quot;c:\program files\titanium developer&quot; folder and open&#x2F;run &quot;Titanium Developer&quot;.  In my case at this point the SDK connecetd and downloaded the same files that had been failing using the MSI. After about five minutes when the downloads completed, the main signup&#x2F;login screen appeared.</p>
<p>4) Login with your username and password, and hopefully you&#39;re all set.</p>
<p>If you still are having trouble with getting a proper install with the MSI in step one, and have a way to contact me, I would be happy to zip the folder for you and send it to you. </p>
<p>Best</p>

										<p><p>Hi Thomas,</p>
<p>Thank you so much for the detailed instruction. I followed your guide and installed without a problem on a XP PC (XP mode inside my Windows 7 PC) at work and copied&#x2F;moved the &#39;Titanium Developer&#39; folder in the &#39;Program Files&#39; folder from the XP machine to my Windows 7 32bit machine, and clicked on the &#39;Titanium Developer.exe&#39; to run it. It triggered the download but I have the same error message again &#39;Download Failed&#39;. I wonder what the problem is? I don&#39;t think I need to manually modify the Windows Firewall settings, or do I? Sorry to be a pain. This has never happened with any other online installers before.</p>

<p>If you disable the Windows Firewall, <strong>for the duration of the installation</strong>, as I advised in my other answer, it will determine whether it is contributing to the issue. There should be no need to change Windows Firewall settings if it transpires, by disabling it, that it was not the cause.</p>

										<p><p>SWAG… could this last bit be a permissions? Sounds like the download is going through fine, but it can&#39;t write and close the file in the chosen location. File write errors at the end might be due to insufficient permissions, insufficient space, or having the destination file open in another program or directory. Again just a thought.</p>

<p>OK, this is my last try, and then someone else will have to take over.  :&#x2F;</p>
<p>Please would you follow the instructions in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;installing_on_windows.html#install_diagnostics_for_windows">Install Diagnostics for Windows</a>?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

										<p><p>Hal thank you for all your help. Unfortunately, I&#39;m unable to diagnose the problem, all packages in the list are installed on my machine.  </p>
<p>I think might have to just wait till the next release of the installer.</p>

<p>Surely we had already established that you could not diagnose the problem yourself? This is why you posted a question here.</p>
<p>If you want someone to help you, <strong>please create a GIST of the output from the code in the above link</strong>, so that someone can attempt to help you further.</p>

<p>Next time, PLEASE CREATE A GIST OR A PASTEBIN rather than pasting your diagnostics output here!!!!!  This is because the output easily gets corrupted when you paste it to the Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>Anyway…</p>
<p>The following should be the very first paths in your PATH environment variable. You have them in the middle.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-attribute">C</span>:\Windows\system32;
<span class="hljs-attribute">C</span>:\Windows;
<span class="hljs-attribute">C</span>:\Window s\System32\Wbem;
</code></pre><p>On your system, adb is not recognized. Hence, follow the workaround found at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;installing_on_windows.html#workaround_for_a_missing_%3Ctt%3Eadb%3C&#x2F;tt%3E">Workaround for a missing adb</a>.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t determine whether you have the correct packages installed, because of the bad formatting.</p>
<p>I suggest your resolve the above problems, and then <strong>create a new gist</strong> of your diagnostics, as explained in the instructions at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;installing_on_windows.html#install_diagnostics_for_windows">Install Diagnostics for Windows</a>.</p>
<p>Regarding your original issue, I can only reiterate previous suggestions about its cause - either that it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>local firewall</li>
<li>local antivirus</li>
<li>insufficient disk space</li>
<li>insufficient permissions (it&#39;s advisable to run TiDev as administrator to install SDKs)</li>
<li>network firewall</li>
<li>poor quality connection to the internet</li>
<li>restrictive local quotas</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than this, I&#39;m afraid I am out of ideas.</p>

							<p>Thank you for the quick reply Hal H, but it doesn&#39;t really resolve the problem in my case.</p>
<p>I couldn&#39;t close the Titanium Developer as it hasn&#39;t even been installed yet, because of the error. Every time I start the installer it run through several steps then indicates that it&#39;s downloading SDK v1.0.0, then just before the end an error message pops up, saying unable to download the SDK!?!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Chen</p>

<p>This is not really an answer - it&#39;s a response to an answer and, hence, should be posted as a comment to the answer it relates to. This makes it much easier for other to follow the conversation.</p>
