			<h1>ImageView and Remote Image caching</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have an iPhone app that uses a Imageview to display a remote image to the user. The image is  a CAPTCHA graphic used as part of a sign on process. The image is unique each time (with a different name). </p>
<p>The problem I have is that the remote image seems to be stored in the applications tmp directory and, after having the app penetration tested it was pointed out that if a keylogger had been installed and that was related back to the local images in the tmp dir it is possible to deduce what the user response to the CAPTCHA was.</p>
<p>Now I know there are a lot of if and buts about this scenario, but I was wondering if there was any way of either stopping this tmp caching or at least removing the image from the cache when it was finished with?</p>
<p>The image URL is determined via a REST call to a server and I was wondering if I ensured that the REST server sent back a no-cache directive in the HTTP headers, if this would prevent this problem ?</p>

										<p><p>Hi Aaron,</p>
<p>so my understanding is that this method would ensure that the api call would be actioned each time as the URL is always unique, but would this stop the Imageview caching the image it retrieves in the tmp dir. This is my problem as the image that it gets back does come across each time (it always has a unique name) , but the tmp dir fills up with these cached images and I need to try and find a way of either ensuring they do not cache or ensuring they get removed. </p>
<p>I am assuming the way the remote imageview works with a URL is that it downloads the image first and then displays it from the tmp dir ,what I really need is a flag on the ImageView to ensure it &#39;cleans the image up&#39; i.e. deletes it when it is finished with.Perhaps I need to do this by checking the tmp dir and deleting the image within my code.</p>
