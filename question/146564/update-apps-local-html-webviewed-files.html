			<h1>Update app&#39;s local html webview&#39;ed files.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve been struggling with this on and off for a while and keep working around it, but I really am tired of it and want to figure out a solution.  For some reason I never ask things on here because I would prefer to puzzle out problems myself than simply get an answer.  I&#39;ve got a tableview that each row links to a .js, with respective contents essentially identical as below (not withstanding the html file it loads within the webview).  Example:</p>
<p>var win = Titanium.UI.currentWindow;</p>
<p>var webview = Titanium.UI.createWebView({<br>    backgroundColor:&#39;#ffffff&#39;,<br>    left:0,<br>    top:0,<br>&#x2F;&#x2F;    height:&#39;auto&#39;,<br>    url:&#39;bilirubin.html&#39;<br>    });</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">win</span><span class="hljs-class">.add</span>(<span class="hljs-tag">webview</span>);
</code></pre><p>Now, the question is this..  Short of making an update to html page X and then being required to update the whole app again which can take weeks, what is the easiest way to sync the local html file with a newer remote version.  I&#39;m a doctor, not a programmer, and although I&#39;ve slowly been able to write a couple of apps on the app store, for the life of me I can&#39;t figure this problem out.  I&#39;ve looked on marketplace and tried different options, but they never really work.  </p>
<p>I believe the simplest thing is to have at a regular frequency check online and determine if the remote html file size is different than the local one, and if so download the file.  </p>
<p>But to where?  Since these original html files are not in the read&#x2F;write portion of the app directory (I believe this to be true), how do I either overwrite the original or reference the newer version.  I don&#39;t think I can overwrite the original.  Is it to simply never reference the original html files within the resources directory and somehow reference them to within the read&#x2F;write portion of the app so that when they&#39;re overwritten the changes are pushed on to the GUI without any other issue?</p>
<p>Any help is greatly appreciated!</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Not as hard as you think, at the moment you are reading from the resources directory, this is normal and the best practice when read-only files that come supplied with the app are concerned.</p>
<p>However as you want to update those files, you would be better off copying the initial version on first run from the resources folder to the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Filesystem-property-applicationDataDirectory">applicationDataDirectory</a> and the using the this as the default in the future.</p>
<p>Any new versions can be downloaded to this location.  Your webView code would simply change to;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">
<span class="hljs-component">var webview = Titanium.UI.createWebView({
  backgroundColor:'<span class="hljs-comment">#ffffff', </span>
  height: Ti<span class="hljs-string">.UI.FILL</span>,
  url: Ti<span class="hljs-string">.Filesystem.getApplicationDataDirectory()</span> + 'bilirubin<span class="hljs-string">.html'</span>,
  width:  Ti<span class="hljs-string">.UI.FILL</span>,
}</span>);
</code></pre><p>Another benefit is this file will be backed up automatically for the user - you can turn this off if it is not required though.</p>
<p>As a tip, a first run routine is also simple; you create a function to handle all of the work you want to occur the very first time the app is run, at the end you use a property to store the work was done.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Ti.App.Properties.setBool(<span class="hljs-string">'firstrun'</span>, <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>);
</code></pre><p>And at the start of the routine check this value has not been set - if it has do nothing and move on.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">If</span> (Ti<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>App<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>Properties<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>getBool(<span class="hljs-string">'firstrun'</span>, <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>)) {
   <span class="hljs-attribute">...</span>
   <span class="hljs-comment">// first run code</span>
   <span class="hljs-attribute">...</span>
   Ti<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>App<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>Properties<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>setBool(<span class="hljs-string">'firstrun'</span>, <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>);
}
</code></pre><p>I hope this makes sense, if not let me know.</p>
