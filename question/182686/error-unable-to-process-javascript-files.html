			<h1>[ERROR] Unable to process javascript files</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I know there are a lot of questions asked similar to this most notably unable to encrypt javascript files, and the workaround is to install vc++ redistributable. I had it installed and even had try to repair and reinstall to be sure, but I cann&#39;t get rid of this error. I had been running and building my app fluenty but all of sudden I don&#39;t know what happened, it started showing this error.</p>

							<p>Hi Karan ,<br>Can you paste your error logs here in the console ? Also , if you havent already enable your traces so that the logs are more verbose . Do you have an older sdk installed ? like a 3.5.0 ? 3.5.1 ? try moving to them in your tiapp.xml and give it a try</p>

										<p><p>Here is a suggestion . Did you try launching your simulator from an android studio ? Try just a sample app on the android studio and launch your simulator . See if it launches . Other thing from your appcelerator studio try install&#x2F;launching your app on an android device, This is to eliminate the possibility that vc++ is doing something wrong . If the test app on android launches then their might be an issue with ur appc studio . If it doesn&#39;t , then your android sdk and hence your vc++ runtime is causing an issue</p>

										<p><p>Yup My simulator works in the android studio.</p>
<p>Got same error on launching the app on an android device in appcelerator studio.</p>
<p>I think the issue is with vc++ runtime. Is there any way I can resolve that.<br>As I had them already installed.</p>

							<p>Seriously, I regret for choosing Appcelerator Titanium&#x2F;Platform to be the technologies for building mobile apps. It was the worst experience for me in all the sdks and toolchains. You guys have build something nice but your tools are worst. Its more than a 6 months for me working on appcelerator and finally I decided you have worst tools, everything just brokes anytime, and your support the worst. Its more than a week since <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;182686&#x2F;error-unable-to-process-javascript-files">I asked question</a> on your community and developer q&amp;a. And still you haven&#39;t even cared about it.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know how many times I have reinstalled the whole thing, maybe more than 4-5 since then. And even then things broke many times.</p>
<p>Take this problem of mine I have today reinstalled everything deleting even the traces I found on my laptop. Still I am stuck.</p>
<p>I really loved your idea, thats why I chose your appcelerator platform. But guys I am so upset with your support and tools. My first big mobile project had came to end in building, you can imagine my frustation from this.</p>
