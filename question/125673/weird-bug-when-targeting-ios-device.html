			<p>So, I&#39;ve been working on an app that&#39;s running quite smoothly on simulator.</p>

<p>After cleaning up the build folder I can run in on simulator again, but same thing will happen again if I try to built to device.</p>
<p>Oh, and if I run the project on Xcode I got a bunch of <code>missing @end</code> on ApplicationRouter.m file…</p>
<p>thoughts?</p>

							<p>Okay, figured it out, definitely a case of a bad file,.. Ti doesn&#39;t like <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sugarjs.com&#x2F;">sugarjs</a>. Even you don&#39;t include &#x2F; use the file anywhere in the app, if it&#39;s part of the package, the bug&#39;s there. Kinda wish the builder has more information on which file <code>The file lib&amp;#x2F;functions.js is corrupted</code> or something..</p>
<p>I thought since sugarjs mostly overriding prototype functions, it&#39;s okay to just throw it in… and it works fine on the simulator. In any case, I&#39;ve cut and pasted the parts I need from sugar,.. and it&#39;s working fine now…</p>

										<p><p>Ashish, thanks for your response.  Wish I had known this yesterday :).  </p>
<p>What threw me off was that the code with those non-space blank characters worked fine in the simulator and the fact that commenting out the code didn&#39;t  get rid of the problem.  To answer your question, I am not using any 3rd party modules.</p>
<p>BTW, what do those triangular icons next to names mean?</p>

										<p><p>So I re-saved what I thought was a png to a png again and it cleared up my issue. I discovered this by looking at the build log after copying appicon.png to the Resource root.</p>

										<p><p>Yeah, that bug error only appears to files that generally corrupts Ti. Most case it&#39;d be images, but not always (hence I leave this Q open).</p>

							<p>I had this as well, in the end it turns out the problem was with a custom Info.plist file. I had used custom fonts in my app, and had copied a Info.plist file but instead of putting it in my root directory, had dumped it into Resources. </p>
<p>Removing the plist file from Resources and putting it back into the root directory, then doing a clean and re-build on my project and it was fixed straight away!</p>
<p>If you&#39;re using custom fonts or plist files then they would be well worth checking.</p>

							<p>My turn to experience exact same thing. The weird part though - is that I&#39;ve been happily compiling to device for 2 days. Now all of a sudden - internal errors and SystemExit 65 preventing me from getting app out of Simulator and onto device for one last test.</p>

							<p>Well as many people mentioned here the main problem here is a corrupted file. In my case was a corrupt .png image that was in my app file. After deleting it, it compiled properly and sync the app in iTunes.</p>

							<p>I had a similar issue and it took me several frustrating hours (and some hair pulling) to figure out what was going on.  I hope this solution helps in your case.  </p>
<p>Being new to Appcelerator&#x2F;Titanium, I thought I&#39;d benefit from a book… and bought the Kindle version of &quot;BUILDING MOBILE APPS with TITANIUM&quot; by TIM POULSEN et al (I like it). I copied &amp; pasted a few lines of JS code from the book and, as it turns out, that was the beginning of my problems.  That code I copy-pasted had some NON-SPACE BLANK characters and the xcodebuild was choking without giving a useful message and without even pointing to the problem area.  The problem was happening even when I commented out the code.  After a few fruitless reinstall&#x2F;restart&#x2F;recreate cycles, an octal dump came to my rescue and showed me the offending characters.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">% od -c offender.js
0000000   \t  \t  \t  \t   T   i   .   <span class="hljs-keyword">G</span>   <span class="hljs-keyword">e</span>   o   <span class="hljs-keyword">l</span>   o   c   a   t   <span class="hljs-literal">i</span>
0000020    o   <span class="hljs-keyword">n</span>   .   p   <span class="hljs-keyword">u</span>   r   p   o   s   <span class="hljs-keyword">e</span>      **   =      **   "
0000040    <span class="hljs-keyword">G</span>   <span class="hljs-keyword">e</span>   t       C   <span class="hljs-keyword">u</span>   r   r   <span class="hljs-keyword">e</span>   <span class="hljs-keyword">n</span>   t       <span class="hljs-keyword">L</span>   o   c   a
0000060    t   i   o   <span class="hljs-keyword">n</span>   "   ;  \<span class="hljs-keyword">n</span>
</code></pre><p>Notice the double stars!  They are the NON-SPACE BLANK characters.  When I replaced them with proper spaces, the problem went away.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is, what you see in an ebook is not necessarily what you get. If you buy an ebook and you see some code that you want to copy&#x2F;paste, do so from the code that comes WITH the ebook, not FROM the ebook.  Most ebooks including the one that cost me a day comes with downloadable code.</p>
