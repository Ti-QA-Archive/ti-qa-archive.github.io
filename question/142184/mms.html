										<p><p>Hi how to set it like wallpaper is like save to photo-gallery and then set it as wallpaper, not sure whether using Appcelerator this can be achieved without custom module support.<br>But having News about MMS, for that you need some APIs or career service. <strong>like AT&amp;T is providing for USA and its REST APIs which can be used for MMS in USA</strong>. so same thing can be looked for other countries. </p>
<p>for this you have to register for developer program at <a href="developer.att.com">developer.att.com</a>.</p>

										<p><p>Hi, for MMS there is no need of going to native side only, i heard that AT&amp;T is also looking for Titanium Module and they may come up with it soon… though you can try REST APIs using <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.1&#x2F;index.html#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Network.HTTPClient">titanium HTTP client</a> and to set a image as wallpaper if you do not want to save it in photo-gallery, you have to look again,may be for that you have to go native module of titanium.</p>
