		<section>
			<p>Hi</p>
<p>It seems a lot of people have had similar problems, but not many have been resolved. Is there anyone that actually knows what is wrong? </p>
<p>I cannot get my emulator up and running, it is complaining about not being able to read the .ini file which is said to be corrupt, it suggest to recreate it, anyone know how? Without having to reinstall everything? </p>
<p>I have developed android before in Eclipse without these problems , and I can see the the emu manager that I do have the 1.6 targets for emulation. So what is it about this ini file problem? </p>
<p>Anyone have had similar problems?</p>

							<p>Ok, </p>
<p>So I have now investigated the ini files which all seem to be just fine. During my android development the only thing I can say is that there are two targets created in an older version (still useable) avd manager and two new ones for titanium with a new avd manager, the four targets reside in the same android path and shows up just fine for each of the two managers and systems. The older one with 1.5 target in Eclipse and the new titanium one with target 1.6. My system with titanium runs as standard, so if I run android.exe from cmd then the new avd manager is run. The new avd is not recognising the old targets, but the new ones are there and fully ok. So, it still remains to understand why the adb is not recognising my newly created targets, which obviuosly are run from titanium test&#x2F;debug folder.</p>
<p>It might seem as a solution to remove the old targets, however that will destroy my earlier development that I am still using at present.</p>
<p>So I tried to move them out of the way. but avd still finds them . .</p>
<p>I do not want to delete them from avd manager . . . :(<br>I should be able to run both systems you might think . .</p>
<p>&#x2F;Jörgen</p>
<p>Anyone?</p>

							<p>Wow, what a great response. :( </p>
<p>I still have the same problem. I removed all the old targets and recreated these new ones, no luck, now at least I have no ini file problem, but I get a python error stack. If I stop the adb I get the ini file corrupt again. :(:(</p>
<p>Anybody know why?</p>

							<p>[RESOLVED] So in conclusion</p>
<p>Do not use user accounts in Windows that uses none english letters, in my case swedish åöä. The reason is that scripts in Titanium and ini files are created with the letters åöä exchanged for stranger looking pairs of signs, which when using titanium stops things like starting the android emulater properly, it stops the avd manager to create proper targets and it stops starting the application in the emulator because of a sqlite connection. Ofcourse I am not sure exactly what the problem is, but by using a standard name like &quot;Mobile&quot; everything just worked, so if you have these problems, try this one too before you give up!! ;)<br>(And yes, I tried recreating everything in my first user namespace but with same problems)</p>
<p>Was this helpfull for you? Please let me know. ;)</p>
<p>Regards</p>
