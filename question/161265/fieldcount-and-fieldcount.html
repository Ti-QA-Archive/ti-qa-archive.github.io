			<h1>fieldCount() and fieldCount</h1>

			<p>If ti is an abstraction layer to enable shared code between platforms then why are there discrepancies in the data base API such as this:</p>
<p>fieldCount() is used iOS to return the field count</p>
<p>but on Android it is not the same, and in calling this on Android you throw errors.</p>
<p>Surely as an abstraction layer i should be able to call either and the abstraction layer figure out which method to call.. i now have to write and abstraction for the abstraction which seems to make little sense!</p>

							<p>The platform is not completely at parity between all supported OS&#39;s. This is for a variety of reasons; Some UI elements have no exact match in all platforms. Equally true of some of the other implementations ( Gelocation, Communication between apps [ intents vs openUrl ]  are two examples). In the case of getter&#x2F;setter properties and methods there has always been some slight differences. In my experience it is better to always use the properties as they seem to fully implemented between platforms</p>

										<p><p>Oh, yes!  That&#39;s the first one i&#39;ve come across where the property is not supported.  Raise a community ticket to get them in parity , or add into the iOS implementation yourself and raise a pull request</p>
