		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m trying to install my app on multiple devices… can anybody help me out with this…</p>
<p>To my understanding, I need to add the devices to the provisioning portal and I&#39;m required to create a a provisioning profile for the testers. I just need to provide the tester with a copy of the provisional profile and the .app folder.<br>They then just drag and drop both these files into the itunes…</p>
<p>Are these the only things they need? Do they require the other certificate? Can somebody point me in a correct direction to help me test on multiple devices.</p>
<p><em>edit</em>  Also do I need to have the device attached to my machine or can I just email the profile and .app to them ?</p>
<p>Thanks guys</p>

							<p>It&#39;s worked for me to email the provisioning profile file and a zipped version of the app. My testers dragged &amp; dropped the provisioning profile into iTunes first, then the same with the app zip, then synced their phones. For later updates, I just sent them the app zip again. You don&#39;t need to send them  your certificate, and you certainly wouldn&#39;t send them your private key. And no, you don&#39;t need to have them attach their phones to your mac.</p>

							<p>Give this a try: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;testflightapp.com&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;testflightapp.com&#x2F;</a></p>
<p>&quot;iOS beta testing on the fly. With TestFlight, developers simply upload a build, and the testers can install it directly from their device, over the air.&quot;</p>
<p>It is pure awesome-sauce.</p>

							<p>For testers which are at OS 4.x, by far the easiest thing for the user is an over the air install they can do with one click of a link in an email or your About box (if already installed and doing an upgrade).  The trick is to create a *.ipa file with the provisioning profile embedded.</p>
<p>OS 4.x added the ability to install the <em>.ipa via a download provided the download link is to a special </em>.plist file instead of the *.ipa itself.</p>
<p>See my reply in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;88651&#x2F;developingdistributing-inhouse-apps">this</a> thread.  If you don&#39;t have your own web server where you can host the file, you could consider using <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.diawi.com&#x2F;">this</a> to provide the download links.</p>
<p>For OS 3.x users, I think you can just email the <em>.ipa and they can do a single install via iTunes.  Probably by just double clicking the </em>.ipa attachment in the email.</p>
<p>The *.ipa is compressed so tends to be half the size of the .app folder method besides.</p>
