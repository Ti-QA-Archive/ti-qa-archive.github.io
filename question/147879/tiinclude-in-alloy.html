							<p>Hi Michael,<br>Yes you can use easily &quot;Ti.include&quot;.<br>Please put you file in<br>    <strong>app –&gt; assets –&gt; {folder name &quot;abc&quot;} –&gt; filename.js</strong></p>
<h2 id="and-this-file-we-can-add-this-type">and this file we can add this type</h2>
<h2 id="ti-include-quot-abc-x2f-filename-js-quot-">Ti.include(&quot;abc&#x2F;filename.js&quot;);</h2>

										<p><p>Thanks for the answer Mritunjay,</p>
<p>But what if I want to have my files in different paths than assets&#x2F; ?</p>
<p>For example, I want to keep some .js files in a folder named Common&#x2F; and some in a folder named lib&#x2F; and others in a folder named utilities&#x2F;</p>
<p>Can I do this? Because if I cannot do it, I find no reason to put everything inside assets (including photos etc.) since the reason I want to do this is to keep things in order and not all together inside a folder including the jpg files.</p>

										<p><p>What I would like EXACTLY, is to create a custom folder in the same level as assets, controllers, views, etc. and include .js files from inside this folder.</p>

										<p><p>if you want to access something as <strong>Common&#x2F;name.js</strong>, or <strong>lib&#x2F;something.js</strong>, or <strong>utilities&#x2F;another.js</strong>, you would put them in the following paths respectively:</p>
<ul>
<li>app&#x2F;lib&#x2F;Common&#x2F;name.js</li>
<li>app&#x2F;lib&#x2F;lib&#x2F;something.js</li>
<li>app&#x2F;lib&#x2F;utilities&#x2F;another.js</li>
</ul>
<p>We will not be supporting arbitrary folders inside the app folder structure, which would in turn undo its structure.</p>

										<p><p>oh.. That is so bad.. I had a structure until now that I followed in every app that I made or helped make in titanium but I guess I will have to change the way I am arranging my files.</p>
<p>By the way, I noticed that Mritunjay used assets&#x2F; as the base folder while you used lib&#x2F;..</p>
<p>Do both work? And what if I have the same folder with one specific same .js file in both of these base folders? Which one will Ti.include use??</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!!</p>

										<p><p>app&#x2F;assets and app&#x2F;lib do the same thing, they just copy these files to Resources at compile time. app&#x2F;lib&#x2F;somefile.js would overwrite app&#x2F;assets&#x2F;somefile.js at compile time. The only reason both exist is as a form of organization, allowing you to put JS libraries in app&#x2F;lib and stuff like images, videos, and other files in app&#x2F;assets.</p>

							<p>I was very disappointed to see that you can only use require on .js files that are located inside the <strong>app&#x2F;lib</strong> folder.. I hope there is some functionality for Ti.include though..</p>

										<p><p>Please don&#39;t add answers, use the comments. It helps keep the conversation in order.</p>
<p>I&#39;d suggest reading through the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Alloy_Framework">Alloy guides</a> if you are making a comment like that. The whole point of Alloy is providing structure (among many other things). It seems that this is being missed on your part. All you have to do is move your libs to the &quot;app&#x2F;lib&quot; folder and everything will work just as it did before. </p>
<p>Also, if you question was answered by the answer above by Mritunjay Singh, then mark it as &quot;best&quot; so the next developer coming through will no there&#39;s a resolution.</p>
