							<p>Hello,</p>
<p>did it work in the past? Which version of Android are you using? Are you on a mac or win or linux?</p>
<p>Best,</p>

										<p><p>Yeah, sorry I did not provide much context. I was throwing it out there quickly to see if anyone else had issues like this before. </p>
<p>I actually just fixed it.</p>
<p>My app is working on iOS and I just submitted it to the App Store, so now I am seeing if I can build for Android also. It turns out that I had changed the default name of the icon from appicon.png to Icon.png. This was causing a build error since the file was not found.</p>
<p>For some reason, the build log is not displayed in the console for Android like it is for iOS. I just realized this and was able to find the error in the build.log file that you can find in the file hierarchy of the project.</p>
<p>Thanks for trying to help!</p>
<p>PS I am using Android 2.1 API 7, latest Titanium Studio and SDK 1.7.3 on Mac OS X Lion.</p>

										<p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>as an additional comment, the Android emulator will start a lot slower than your iOS simulator. The first time you see the difference, it&#39;s amazingly painful.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the tip. I have a feeling I may put off Android for a while to wait and see how iOS sales go. I think Android will be more painful with several different versions to build for, various screen resolutions, tweaks to my code needed (it&#39;s crashing on a few screens), etc.</p>
