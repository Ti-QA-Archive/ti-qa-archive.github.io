			<h1>TiScrollView&#39;s Wrapper View</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>After looking around Ti&#39;s ScrollView implementation, I understand that it uses a UIView called wrapper to hold child views, and that it is also used for scaling.</p>
<p>This works very well, when used for normal purposes (when the user doesn&#39;t scale the scrollView). However, when using it for adding an ImageView to the scrollView, for pinch zooming, things go bad. </p>
<p>Since the wrapperView holds the ImageView, upon scaling, any spaces around the ImageView (i.e. of the wrapper view, as the imageView is smaller than it), are also scaled, thereby adding borders around the scaled image. </p>
<p>####My question:<br>Is there any way to directly add a view to the scrollView and use the same for scaling? (In this case, the ImageView)? If not, is there a module that will allow me to achieve this? If not, would someone be interested in making one? I simply cannot wrap my head around making a module to pass the UIScrollView. </p>
<p>####Meta:<br>TiSDK: 3.0.0.GA<br>iOS: using 6.0, but my app provides support from 5.1</p>

							<p>I managed to solve this problem on my own. </p>
<p>The way Appc. has programmed the scrollView, the minimum width and height of the wrapper view are always equal to the width and height of the scrollView.</p>
<p>After considering that, I had to consider the width and height of the image I was downloading. After I got those two, I quickly derived a ratio, and scaled the image down before adding it to the scrollView. </p>
<p>So far, we have an image that is centred and is resized to be no more than the width or the height of the scrollView(which ever is greater). </p>
<p>Double tapping simply sets the width and height of the imageView back to the original dimensions. But here was the catch: Earlier, I forgot the set the contentWidth and contentHeight properly. This caused the unusual stretching of the wrapperView and thus the borders.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the resizing I do, before adding the image to the scrollView. I fire this on the postlayout (optionally the load) event of the imageView.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var <span class="hljs-built_in">source</span>Width = win.data.width,
    <span class="hljs-built_in">source</span>Height = win.data.height,
    <span class="hljs-built_in">source</span>Ratio = <span class="hljs-built_in">source</span>Width&gt;<span class="hljs-built_in">source</span>Height? <span class="hljs-built_in">source</span>Height/<span class="hljs-built_in">source</span>Width : <span class="hljs-built_in">source</span>Width/<span class="hljs-built_in">source</span>Height,
    destWidth,
    destHeight,
    destRatio;

imageView.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'postlayout'</span>, imagePostLayout);

<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> imagePostLayout(e) {
    var targetWidth = Ti.Platform.displayCaps.platformWidth,
        targetHeight = Ti.Platform.displayCaps.platformHeight;

    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">source</span>Height &gt; targetHeight) {
        destRatio = (targetHeight/<span class="hljs-built_in">source</span>Height);
        destHeight = <span class="hljs-built_in">source</span>Height*destRatio;
        destWidth = <span class="hljs-built_in">source</span>Width*destRatio;
    }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">source</span>Width &gt; targetWidth) {
        destRatio = (targetWidth/<span class="hljs-built_in">source</span>Width);
        destHeight = <span class="hljs-built_in">source</span>Height*destRatio;
        destWidth = <span class="hljs-built_in">source</span>Width*destRatio;
    }

    imageView.applyProperties({
        width: destWidth || targetWidth,
        height: destHeight || targetHeight
    });

    imageView.removeEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'postlayout'</span>, imagePostLayout);
}
