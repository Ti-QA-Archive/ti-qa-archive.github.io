			<p>I am having problems getting startet with the Cloud Services.</p>
<p>I want to use the cloud services for a already existing native IOS application. I Found on the website that there is a Free Model, limited in Storage Space, API Calls etc.. However the documentation says u need to register for Appcelerator Platform to user the cloud service for a native IOS App, with is from what i saw limited in time or not for free.</p>
<p>I also found a Cocoafish SDK to download somewhere on the website but no documentation for it. And i don&#39;t know if its outdated or still supported.</p>
<p>So is it actually posible to users the BaaS Free Model for a native IOS App?</p>

							<p>Hi Christoph,</p>
<p>Appcelerator Cloud Services are available both for the Appcelerator Platform and for Titanium. You can get more information on getting started in the link below. Just scroll down to the section on enabling cloud services in Titanium Studio:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;cloud&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;acs_quickstart</p>

							<p>Hello Gregory,</p>
<p>as i mentioned in my first poste i want to use the cloud service for an already existing native IOS App written in ObjectiveC in Xcode. From your answer i suppose that is only possible if i have a Appcelerator Platform subscription.</p>

										<p><p>Christoph,</p>
<p>You can sign up at the &#39;free&#39; level and use the services. There is no need to purchase the platform.</p>

										<p><p>ty Ray,<br>but if i understand you right, than that is what i already did.<br>My Problem is that i don&#39;t know where i can get the SDK for IOS, since the documentation link me to the dashboard, on witch i have no access without platform subscription.<br>Or is the Cocoafish SDK i found the right one to use?</p>

										<p><p>Once you have access to the dashboard, click on the top right where it says Create An App (ACS Only). Once you click on ACS Only, then you will walk through creation of a new ACS project. There you get the keys for connecting. Yes, then you can use the cocoafish SDK or you can access the backend using the REST api, your choice. Does that make sense?</p>
