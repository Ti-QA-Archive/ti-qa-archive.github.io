			<h1>tabBarHidden only partially on Android - why?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a tabGroup that contains one tab into which I load my windows.<br>To all my windows I add the property <code>tabBarHidden: true</code> on creation.<br>The phenomena is that the first window will still have the tab bar shown on top. Also the title of the window will be that of the tab, not that of the first window. I create the window as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">controller.tabGroup = Titanium.UI.createTabGroup({<span class="hljs-property">id</span>:'MainTabGroup'});
controller.<span class="hljs-constant">tab</span> = Titanium.UI.createTab({
    <span class="hljs-property">id</span>:'<span class="hljs-constant">tab</span>', 
    window: controller.mainMenuController.getView()
});

controller.tabGroup.addTab(Babbel.controller.<span class="hljs-constant">tab</span>);
controller.tabGroup.open();
</code></pre><p>The following windows are opened like this and they all have no tab and show their own title:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">controller</span><span class="hljs-class">.tabGroup</span><span class="hljs-class">.activeTab</span><span class="hljs-class">.open</span>(<span class="hljs-tag">controller</span><span class="hljs-class">.categoryController</span><span class="hljs-class">.getView</span>());
</code></pre><p>Does anyone see a problem with this code or knows of a workaround? I tried adding a dummy window on start, but most of the Android devices are to slow in loading the next window right away, so the dummy window (with the tab) shows..</p>
<p>Btw, I&#39;m using Titanium SDK 1.7.2 and Android SDK 2.2</p>

							<p>This might have changed, but in 1.7.1 you could not hide the tabBar for a specific window in Android. </p>
<p>Is the goal to re-load your windows into the tabgroup?</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m using 1.7.2 and the tab bar hiding seems to work in general.</p>
<p>My setup is that I&#39;m basically just navigating down a hierarchy. As I posted above, I start with creating a tab where I put in a window with my main menu, the main menu will load a new window into the active tab (the same tab) depending on what the user selects.</p>
<p>The problem is that only the first window I add to the tab (the main menu) will not hide the tab bar. all the following windows I add by navigating down the application hierarchy will listen to the tabbarhidden. </p>
<p>It&#39;s really just that one initial window that won&#39;t accept the property and I don&#39;t understand why.</p>

										<p><p>Hi. No, I have not. But why would I? The other pages look perfectly fine. It is the initial menu window that shows me the tab that I tell it not to show me.<br>Looks like I really explain myself so badly? It&#39;s very simple really. I have let&#39;s say 5 windows. All 5 windows I tell to hide the tab bar. It works for 4 of these windows - no tab bar. But for one - the first and initial window - the tab is shown no matter what I try to do against it.</p>
<p>The only difference I can see programmatically is that the initial window is implicitly opened by calling open on the tab group, which contains the one tab with the root window set to my menu window. The other windows are called with activeTab.open and that seems to respect the window properties.</p>

										<p><p>I think it might be an issue of the tabgroup forcing that first window to always show. My thought was if you remove it after the other windows are opened this might force the window to refresh without the associated tabgroup or at least force the constructor to be set differently.</p>
<p>This could also be related to the behavior of the Android Tabgroup, in the below post Don mentions you can&#39;t hide the group so I wonder if this is related. </p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the link. But it&#39;s one year old and as I stated several times, the hiding of the tab bar does work. Only not on the initial window. And I don&#39;t want to remove the &quot;faulty&quot; menu window after the others are loaded. First of all I want to be able to go back to it and second what is the point of removing the bad window when it is not visible. The problem I have with the window is when it is shown, not when I&#39;m on one of the other windows which are doing exactly what I want which is hiding the tab.</p>
<p>I guess I give up here. Thanks for your patience, but I&#39;m not sure I got my point across correctly and I&#39;ve been reading the Q&amp;As for hours without success. Will have to live with the tab on the first window.</p>
