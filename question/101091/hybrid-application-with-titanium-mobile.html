			<p>Hi All,<br>this is my first message in this forum, and I would like to say hello to all the participants.</p>
<p>I would like to understand the &quot;flexibility&quot; degree of the framework.<br>For example, it is possible to have &quot;hybrid application&quot;, with some routine coded and other exposed as web page.</p>
<p>Thanks to all in advance</p>
<p>Davide</p>

										<p><p>Welcome, Davide - nice to meet you! :)</p>
<p>One thing, though; with this Q&amp;A forum, it&#39;s better to post a comment when responding to someone else&#39;s answer, as it makes it easier for others to follow the conversation.</p>
<p>Really, you should <strong>never</strong> post an answer to your own question, even if posting the solution, because you can&#39;t mark that answer as &quot;best&quot; meaning that you can&#39;t close the question when its finished.</p>
<p>Read more about Participating in the Q&amp;A, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;contribute.html#participating_in_the_q&amp;a">here</a>.</p>
<p>Good luck with Titanium - I hope it meets your needs. Feel free to ask any questions you like; this is what makes the Q&amp;A such a useful resource for other new users to search.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

							<p>While i experienced Titanium, basically a mix can be done , probably the way  of  window&#39;s form with some webview embedded. </p>
<p>The only risk you have is related to the performances, webview pages (local or remote , pay attention where are some limitation due to security) are significantly slower than the native code, for the rest the mix can be done and solve some porting issue. if your engine is based on the web standard you can keep working easily the same code and work around the embedded code. just pass variables.</p>
<p>For instance take a look here http:&#x2F;&#x2F;audiobox.fm&#x2F;  . The core is html5 + javascript . the different mobiles keep the same code but embedded their native webview.</p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>
<p>Andrea  </p>
