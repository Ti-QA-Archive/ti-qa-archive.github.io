			<h1>commonJS debugging</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m starting to re-factor my application using the commonJS methodology which it seems is now considered best practice.  However, I seem unable to activate any breakpoints in my modules when I use the debugger.  A similar question a few months ago in this forum was asked and an answer suggested installing the continuous 1.8 sdk build.  I&#39;ve installed that but still don&#39;t seem to get any debugging going on with any modules I access using &quot;require&quot;.  Is this a known issue or am I doing something wrong?</p>

							<div><p>Have tried it with a top level file i.e. one I require in app.js and it works.. It appears that it fails on files which are then subsequently loaded and not fully available.. I will try it later today with an embedded file.</p>
<p>Do you have a jira account for bug placing. As this might need to be raised</p>

							<p>You might check your version of Titanium Studio with the ticket notes mentioned <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TISTUD-523">here</a>. Says an issue was fixed in 1.0.7.</p>
