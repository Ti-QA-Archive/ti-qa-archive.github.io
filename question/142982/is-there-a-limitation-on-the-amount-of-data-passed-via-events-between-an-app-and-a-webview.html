			<h1>Is there a limitation on the amount of data passed via events between an app and a webview?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>We&#39;re trying to build a mobile application for the iPhone that utilizes a mobile map (built with the Leaflet javascript library) inside of a webview.  Our app retrieves lat&#x2F;long coordinates from sqlite, builds json (geoJson actually) and sends those coordinates to the webview to be plotted on the Leaflet map.    The webview and app are connected using event listeners.</p>
<p>The problem we&#39;ve found is that firing an event to the webview with a large json (100-200 KB) payload slows both the app and the webview to a crawl (30 seconds to load the data into the webview), especially in our test builds on an iPhone 4.  JSONLint gives our data a clean bill of health, and we&#39;ve tried stringifying the json before firing the event with the same results.</p>
<p>The delay is not as noticeable on the simulator, and there is no noticeable delay when we load the json directly into the Leaflet webview using jquery&#39;s getJSON.</p>
<p>One workaround that I&#39;ve found is to fire an event for each coordinate; this is much faster, but firing 50-100 events between the app and webview each time a user filters a tableview doesn&#39;t seem efficient either. </p>
<p>Is there a known limitation on the amount of data that can be reasonably passed via events to a webview?  </p>
<p>Thanks for any insight,</p>
<p>Silas</p>

							<p>The limit is not the size (as far as I know). The problem here is the serialization. When you send the json, it is serialized, sent to the receiving event where is de-serialized. This means huge delay.</p>
<p>Sadly I don&#39;t have an ides how to improve this :(</p>

							<p>I don&#39;t have an answer to your exact question, but I have a suggestion for a workaround. First just put the json in a file, and have the webview javascript load that file. If the webview can do that quickly, then the problem is passing the data in the event. If it doesn&#39;t, then the problem is the webview itself.</p>
<p>Assuming that pulling the data from a file improves things, I would save the geoJson to a temp file, and pass the file path via the event, and have the webview load it.</p>

										<p><p>Shannon,<br>Thanks for your suggestion!  I will work on code to create temporary geoJSON files from the database; in the meantime, my work-around is to create static json files that mirror our database tables, and then filter the json data in the webview map separately from the tableview in the app. –Silas</p>

										<p><p>Shannon, I&#39;m finally trying your suggestion to generate temp files for use in the webview, but I&#39;m having trouble seeing those files from the javascript in my webview.  I fire an event to pass the following file path to the webview:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> appFilePath = Ti.Filesystem.getFile(Titanium.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory, <span class="hljs-string">'test.geojson'</span>).nativePath;
</code></pre><p>but the path doesn&#39;t appear to work from the webview, even when I hardcode it:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">file://localhost/Users/smathes/Library/Application%20Support/iPhone%20Simulator/5.0/Applications/D<span class="hljs-number">5A5F845</span>-<span class="hljs-number">6F86-4A22</span>-B<span class="hljs-number">3D6-2C97</span><span class="hljs-number">00153855</span>/Documents/test.geojson
</code></pre><p>I&#39;ve tried <code>file:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;</code> and this doesn&#39;t seem to work for me either… do you know what the proper syntax is?</p>
<p>Thanks again,<br>Silas</p>

										<p><p>Please ignore the last question about loading json from from the application data directory into the webview.  The above code does work.  I was trying to load the JSON file into my html by using jquery&#39;s getJSON and it was failing silently.  I used javascript&#39;s XMLHttpRequest to get the same file and it works fine.</p>
