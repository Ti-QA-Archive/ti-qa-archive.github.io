			<h1>Images in tableview rows need to re-fresh when they are scrolled off screen (ANDROID)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have some nice custom tableview rows which contain a remotely hosted image.</p>
<p>Now in iOS the images are downloaded and then rendered in the rows.  When you scroll the rows off screen and then scroll them back onto screen, the images are still there.</p>
<p>However, in Android, when you scroll the row offscreen and then bring it back onto screen, android actually has to re-download the image.</p>
<p>Basicly it seems like the images arent staying in the cache properly, in my very basic description of the issue.</p>
<p>Has anyone else come across this issue and know of a good solution?</p>
<p>Thanks!!</p>

							<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Use this function for caching images (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;866330). It works gr8</p>

							<p>You just need to cache the images yourself. Download and save them, and then when you&#39;re creating your imageView, use the local copy of the file for the &quot;image&quot; property instead of the remote copy.</p>

										<p><p>Seems like the reasonable approach, but since this works just fine on iOS, was hoping for a more systematic solution</p>

										<p><p>For most apps, remote images should be cached anyway. It makes your app much more responsive and uses less bandwidth, which is especially important because mobile networks are pretty unreliable and data is now capped.</p>
<p>There are a lot of discrepancies between iOS and Android support in the Titanium Mobile SDK. Some of these are caused by actual differences between the platforms, and some of them are because of Appcelerator. You just have to do a lot of testing and debugging to discover them and then find ways to work around them. You&#39;ll find yourself doing lots of little experiments. For me, I experimented with tableview rows vs. creating my own views and adding them to a scrollview, and I really like the latter solution. Tableview rows seem to be very unpredictable and buggy, and for most purposes, they&#39;re not much more convenient than just using a scrollview. I know for a fact that adding images to a scrollview does not reload them the way they&#39;re reloaded in a tableview, so you might just have to fall back to that if you&#39;re unwilling to use caching.</p>
<p>You should also experiment with different versions of the SDK. You should try 1.7.5, 1.7.6 (nightly), and 1.8.0 (nightly) to see if your problem has been fixed. In my experience, all of those are stable enough right now for everyday use.</p>
