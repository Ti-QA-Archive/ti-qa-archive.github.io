			<h1>Send an unsigned ipa to my client</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m developing an app for a client that wants to publish the app in Android and iOS stores with his account, but he wants me to provide him with unsigned apk and IPA so he can sign them with his certificate without giving me access to its accounts. Their rule is not to allow external developers to access their developer accounts.</p>
<p>I can not provide him with the source code because the app is customized for every client but the client does not own the source code.</p>
<p>The unsigned apk is simple because it is generated in the android build folder, but I&#39;ve not seen where to get an unsigned IPA and Titanium Studio does not let build for production without the production certificate</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>Hi Pedro, you have ask your client which app identifier (com.somedomain.appname) they want, then create a certificate which matches this identifier. Then sign the ipa send it the customer, they should easily resign it afterwards with a tool like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;maciekish&#x2F;iReSign">iResign</a></p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ve seen that you can not create in Apple developer portal  two apps with the same bundle id once one has been created, but I could create it first with my account, sign it, delete the identifier in my account, tthen they create that identifier in their account and resign the IPA<br>Could it work in that order?</p>

										<p><p>sorry i told you some wrong information, there is even no need to use the same identifier, they can also change that later. so just sign your app with any app identifer and provisiing profile, this all can be changed later.</p>
