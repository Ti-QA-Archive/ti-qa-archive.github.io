			<h1>Redrawing the screen upon change of orientation when the window has a background image</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>This is probably a bit of a newbie question as I am currently learning Titanium and JS for my first app, so apologies if I am going off in completely the wrong direction! There are many questions I have here, but I&#39;ll try and keep it to 1 which is: </p>
<p> Is there a way of clearing the contents of a ScrollView on orientation change when the containing Window has a background image?</p>
<p>Context: </p>
<p>I am trying to create a window that has a ScrollView, which in turn contains a grid of small fixed-width Views - tiled across and down the page. In the background the containing window has an image. </p>
<p>When the orientation changes I redraw the window with however many of the fixed-width columns are now able to fit on the screen. This seems to work fine when the Window has a simple background colour - the window clears and redraws correctly. However if I give it a background image instead the old &#39;tiles&#39; are left on the screen when the orientation changes - they have changed orientation but shouldn&#39;t be there at all. The new tiles are then drawn over the top which looks a mess.</p>
<p>I just know someone is going to say that there are far easier ways to do tiling and re-orientation than this. :-) Happy to discover how if so!</p>
<p>I think I am using SDK 2.1 (I say &#39;think&#39; as only 2.1.0-2.1.2 are in my project build path, but the compiler confusingly says 2.0.1). I have currently only tried this on Android (2.3.3 and 4.0 - emulator and devices), not iOS. </p>
<p>Things I have thought of so far and failed with:</p>
<p>Tried changing the background image when orientation changed. No effect to the tiles.<br>Tried removing the ScrollView completely from the window and re-adding it - just gave an error message saying (paraphrasing) view not found.<br>Tried giving the ScrollView the background image instead. No effect.</p>
<p>Code example:</p>
<p>Window created like so:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">btnSubmit</span><span class="hljs-class">.addEventListener</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-function">function</span>(e) {

            <span class="hljs-tag">globs</span><span class="hljs-class">.GV</span><span class="hljs-class">.tabs</span><span class="hljs-class">.currentTab</span><span class="hljs-class">.open</span>(new <span class="hljs-function">TileList</span>({
                <span class="hljs-attribute">title </span>: <span class="hljs-string">'My Tile List'</span>,
                <span class="hljs-comment">//backgroundColor: '#009999',</span>
                <span class="hljs-attribute">backgroundImage</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'background.jpg'</span>,
            }));

    });
</code></pre><p>The &#39;TileList&#39; code, cut-down to what is relevant:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">/*jslint white:true vars:true plusplus:true  */</span>

							<div><p>OK, I&#39;ve now got that event firing on iOS too, and it does a similar thing - the old &#39;tiles&#39; stay on the screen for a period of time after orientation change (3-10 sec). They do then disappear correctly though. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve a feeling that the fact this happens on all platforms probably means that I shouldn&#39;t be attempting it anyway - but I would be grateful for any help.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m a little unsure of how to picture this in my head. But have your tried adding a view right under the window and setting the background image of that view instead of having a window background image?</p>
<p>So:<br>Window &gt; <strong>View</strong>&gt; ScrollView &gt; Tiled View</p>
<p>This view if created like this</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in">var</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">self</span> = Ti<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>UI<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>createView({
    backgroundImage: <span class="hljs-string">'something.jpg'</span>,
});
</code></pre><p>The view should automatically fill all available space but you could also put the Ti.UI.FILL constant into the width and height.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, good idea but unfortunately it didn&#39;t seem to make a difference. </p>
<p>In essence I am simply trying to present a different layout on screen when in landscape or portrait mode. It is obviously possible, as lots of apps do it, however I suspect I am going about it the wrong way. Time for a little more research I think!</p>

							<p>OK, I think I&#39;ve figured out the answer. Having a background picture was a bit of a red herring, it just so happened that I first noticed it when I&#39;d added the picture.</p>
<p>It appears that you do need to remove the ScrollView from the Window first if you want to draw another over the top. I had obviously tried this before, but the reason it wasn&#39;t working was because Titanium was reporting that the Window had 0 (zero) children, so when I asked it to remove &#39;children[0]&#39; it couldn&#39;t find the ScrollView. Using the getChildren() method didn&#39;t work either.</p>
<p>Fiddling around with the debugger I noticed that the property that contains the child views of a window is actually called &#39;_children&#39;, which is different from the online docs. When I use this the old ScrollView is removed, and the new one drawn on the window fine, regardless of whether there is a background image or not.</p>
<p>Just add the following code before you create your ScrollView (note: JSLint will moan about the &#39;dangling&#39; underscore:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"> <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">instance</span>._children.length &gt; <span class="hljs-number">0</span>){
<span class="hljs-class">       <span class="hljs-keyword">instance</span>.remove<span class="hljs-container">(<span class="hljs-title">instance</span>.<span class="hljs-title">_children</span>[0])</span>;
 }</span>
</code></pre><p>This is true in Titanium SDK 2.0.2, Windows, using Android 4.0.3. I&#39;ve not tested in anything else yet. I downgraded from SDK 2.1.2 as I couldn&#39;t get the debugger to fire up with that version.</p>
<p>Now of course I&#39;ve just got to figure out whether this is the best way of doing tiling anyway. :-)</p>
