			<h1>Is it possible to merge/record two audio files with Titanium SDK?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I have a few questions about Audio recording with Titanium.<br>I&#39;d like to build an app that can record audio (via the microphone). During this recording, I&#39;d like to play in the same time an audio sound. Is that possible?<br>I also would like to save the recorded audio file and to merge&#x2F;combine it with that audio sound we played during the recording. Can I record both sounds in the same time or should I merge them after the record process?<br>The sample audio file will be short (20s or less) and I&#39;d like to add that sound to the audio file recorded via the microphone repeatedly.</p>
<p>Many thanks to anyone who can bring me some answers.</p>

							<div><p>Hello,</p>
<p>AFAIK, you can&#39;t do this with vainilla Titanium. You will need to create a native module in each platform to be able to call it within Titanium. Check <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;12687458&#x2F;android-how-to-mix-2-audio-files-and-reproduce-them-with-soundpool">this android code</a>. </p>
<p>Best,</p>

							<p>I think you can achieve this in two ways:</p>
<p>1: Check for some module available with this functionality that way it will be easy.</p>
<p>2: You can record audio using media API and can combine them using file read and write operation simply.</p>
<p>Have not tried the combine operation personally but recording code can be taking from kitchen sink app.</p>

										<p><p>File read and write operation i mean is, </p>
<p>1: read the first audio file from file system.</p>
<p>2: read the second file from the file system.</p>
<p>3: Append the content of second file in the first file or perform the write operation on a 3rd file.</p>
<p><strong>check the file append operation doc here</strong></p>

										<p><p>what do you mean by merge, after merging both file will be played together , same will happen if you append the file content one into another.</p>

										<p><p>For me, it&#39;s not the same thing. If I <strong>append</strong> the file A to the file B, the final file will start with the content of the A file and will end with the B one. Opposite that with the <strong>merge</strong> process, both files will start in the same time and the content of the final file will be like an overlay of both files.</p>

							<p>Thanks for your answer.<br>I checked the Marketplace this morning but unfortunately didn&#39;t find anything.<br>What do you mean by &quot;combine them using file read and write&quot;? Could you be more precise?</p>
<p>Rgds.</p>
