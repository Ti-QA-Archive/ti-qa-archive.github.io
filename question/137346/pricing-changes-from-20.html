			<p>Hi! I just got a strange phone call from someone claiming to be from Appcelerator asking a few questions about my &quot;business&quot; and suggesting me to become a &quot;partner&quot;. That person also told me that if I was making any sort of revenue from my apps I was in breach of terms. That shocked me as I was under the impression that one could sell apps created through the free version of Titanium Studio. She told me that since v2.0 that is no longer true. So I asked what it cost to become a partner and she told me 5000$&#x2F;year. I gasped and asked what happened to the Indie subscription? She told me no longer exists since 2.0. So…</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Was this a prank call, maybe from a competitor?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Can I release apps in the App&#x2F;Play Store and charge for them with the free edition of Titanium Studio? Or release free apps supported by ads?</p>
</li>
<li><p>If not, what is the cheapest plan that allows me to do so and what is its price?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Many thanks</p>

							<div><p>We realize there is a lot of conflicting information out there about this.  Our intent is and has always been to provide a free and unrestricted version of the platform.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_mobile">Titanium Mobile</a> is and has always been open source under the Apache 2.0 license, and relies on open source software to power it.  That software can be used without financial obligation to Appcelerator in any form.  In fact, there is no legally defensible way to claim otherwise.</p>
<p>Titanium Studio is proprietary software which we make available for free.  This is where confusion has arisen internally at Appcelerator.  Our pricing terms remain confusing - quite frankly, even I don&#39;t understand them fully.  We recognize this problem and are working on clarifying our licensing terms as it relates to our toolchain.  I will offer as much clarity on this topic as I can, as soon as possible, either through this thread or the developer blog.</p>
<p>But rest assured, there is no secret agenda to charge for commercial apps built by developers who don&#39;t have paid subscriptions.  This is an unfortunate breakdown in communications.  You can continue to publish apps, free of charge, using Titanium Studio and Titanium Mobile as you always have.   We appreciate your patience, and please stay tuned.</p>

							<p>Kevin Whinnery : &quot;There is a lot of confusion around this because we haven&#39;t done a good job clearly communicating (both internally and externally) our pricing structure for premium services. But read my lips - the core platform and tools are free and open source. You can publish commercial apps with no financial commitment to Appcelerator.</p>
<p>Our paid offerings are for support, access to pro services, and for more favorable rates on cloud services usage. We will post better info on those to the dot com site ASAP.&quot;</p>
<p>Also most identical situation with another person getting a call but should give you a firm answer!</p>
<p>So I would not worry about it as it sounds like if it was a legitimate call then the sales staff are just not up to speed!</p>

										<p><p>The first link has a reassuring statement from Kevin Whinnery: &quot;Our intent (communicated directly from our CEO) is that it will always be free to develop commercial applications with the core Titanium SDK, without restrictions.&quot;</p>
<p>Though the licensing pdf raises some concerns regarding &quot;App Explore&quot;, the free version: </p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;May Create unlimited No and types of Apps (for internal or B2E use only)&quot;;</li>
<li>&quot;Can be subject to advertisement inserts&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Doesn&#39;t quite match what Kevin said… &quot;for internal or B2E use only&quot;, does this means no paid apps published in App&#x2F;Play Store?</p>
<p>Sharry can you, or anyone from Appcelerator, expand on this? Thanks</p>

										<p><p>I think the way I read it and from all the conversations its really simple but jargon and being political masks three key points:</p>
<p>1) The tools like studio are free now and will always be free, its open sourced and there to get you building products in the most productive way you can as you don&#39;t need studio to do thats always going to be the way.</p>
<p>2) Publishing your apps for free or charged for will never be subject to charges from Appcelerator.</p>
<p>3) Appcelerator don&#39;t want to make money from developers or the apps we build but from the paid services which are support and ACS and so on. The more enterprise level clients are where they want to make money and not the community and developers that use it.</p>
<p>Thats my take from all I have heard!</p>

							<p>i got a call today, too which was actually a really nice talk ;)<br>We where talking about my current appcelerator-plan …i&#39;m still with the old professional-plan… and whats this is including..i think the mainpoint was that the company i&#39;m working for can charge money to our customers we are building titanium-driven apps. -&gt; means we are allowed to make money with the titanium framework</p>
<p>I hope i got this right ;) @Kevin Whinnery</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Toni, in my case I&#39;ve started playing with Titanium 6 months ago as a hobby to see if I can actually create compelling apps. Eventually I want to make some money out of this, but if 100$&#x2F;year for the App Store License already sting me you can imagine 5000$&#x2F;year. It may make sense for a company with a few developers, but for individuals looking to get started in the app world is a different matter. Lets see what answers we get, maybe Titanium is not suited for me… which would be said as I&#39;ve grown fond of it after creating an app for iOS, Android and Mobileweb…</p>

							<p>It is definitely for real:</p>
<p>I have talked with sales (UK) and basically you are now looking at $5000.00 a year minimum. </p>
<p>I explained that this was not an option for me being a sole-trader and so I&#39;d just renew my Indie subscription as per the invoice they had sent me for $399. The sales manager informed me that she didn&#39;t think they were allowing any of the old subscription plans any more, but would ask her MD. I was then told that they would allow me to renew, but that it would definitely only be for one more year and would cost $499. When I protested that I already had an invoice for $399, they pretty much said &quot;take it or leave it&quot; - with a subtext of &quot;think yourself lucky&quot;.</p>
<p>TBH I don&#39;t object to them charging whatever they want for whatever level of support they want to offer - it is their business model and in fairness, you can build apps for free and sell for $$$.</p>
<p>BUT - I do object to being sold a particular subscription &quot;pack&quot; than included &quot;goodies&quot; such as modules that suddenly and without warning gets pulled and replaced with something costing 10x as much.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Chris, it&#39;s unfortunate to hear that, plans and prices should be clear from the onset. At least the UK sales people didn&#39;t tell you couldn&#39;t sell apps for money as they told me…</p>

										<p><p>I was just auto-renewed this week for $399 for the Indie plan - didn&#39;t get an invoice - the charge just turned up on my credit card.  I guess I should consider myself lucky as legally I&#39;m entitled to another year of benefits under that plan even though it appears not to exist anymore (and, at least under American law, money changes hands, deal done).</p>
<p>We went to the 2.0 launch meetup at App HQ and they said there that pricing would be announced in June.  I guess we should hear something next week.</p>
<p>I&#39;m like most of you guys - trying to make ends meet in a competitive global market for apps.</p>
