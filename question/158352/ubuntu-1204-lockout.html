							<p>Hi Nick<br>I&#39;ve tried your suggestions without success, however I&#39;ve copied some of the te?t from the screen &quot;ddxSigGiveUp: closing log. Server terminated with error (1) closing log file.    Using. Config file&#x2F;etc&#x2F;xii&#x2F;xorg.conf. NVIDIA.API mismatch. The nvidia kernel module has version 304.88 but this nvidia driver component has version 319.32 please make sure that the kernel module and all NVIDIA driver components have the same version</p>

							<p>So let me get this straight. You are using Linux, but have no idea how the thing actually works?</p>
<p>Using Linux is usually reserved to the initiated, so if you are having trouble with things like your X-Server and understanding how driver works, then maybe Linux is not the best OS for you.</p>
<p>Also, this question should not be addressed in the Titanium Q&amp;A (where Linux knowledge is not everyone&#39;s strongest point). You really should look into Linux dedicates sites and forums.</p>

										<p><p>Sadly its ill-informed comments about linux that continue to inhibit its take up by less technically able people. Ubuntu being one of the better examples of a lunix distro that goes out of its way to be more accessible and easy to use. Drivers are possibly the most problematic subject across all operating systems, including Windoze…</p>

										<p><p>You can wave your Linux flag (and use condescending terms like Windoze…) all you want. But the fact remains that this guy is literally stuck out of his Windows Manager. So what do you suggest? All you Linux love won&#39;t save him.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, it is true that Ubuntu has made some great strides in tying to bring Linux to the masses. But to me, if your user doesn&#39;t understand what goes under the hood, Linux is not (yet) the OS for him.</p>
