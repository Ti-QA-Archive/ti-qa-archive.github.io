			<h1>AVD Emulator Stopped Launching</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Application type: mobile</p>
<p>Titanium SDK: 2.1.2.GA? I did not see it in the log after a relaunch</p>
<p>Platform &amp; version: Google APIs Android 2.2</p>
<p>Device: Android emulator 20.0.3</p>
<p>Host Operating System: Windows 7</p>
<p>Titanium Studio: 2.1.2.201208301612</p>
<p>My &quot;run in android emulator&quot; was working fine for most of yesterday. The emulator would launch just fine and I could see my work. The emulator locked up at one point and I shut it down. Since then when I attempt to run in android emulator I get the following log error:</p>
<p><code>[INFO] Building TiBountyHunter for Android ... one moment
[INFO] Titanium SDK version: 2.1.2 (08&amp;#x2F;24&amp;#x2F;12 14:46 ed7f777)
[ERROR] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 1
[ERROR] Timed out waiting for emulator to be ready, you may need to close the emulator and try again</code></p>
<p>However, If I launch the AVD manager and start a device I created separately, my work will show up in the new device I created. However, this new device is not the same device as called out in the TiApp Editor (Different Android SDK and screen type). </p>
<p>Essentially, I have a work around, but clearly something stopped working and I don&#39;t know what. I&#39;d like to get back to the way it was working (I could launch the emulator from Titanium).</p>
<p>I have used the AVD manager to delete all devices, Reboted, and tried to create new devices from Titanium. Any time Titanium is required to launch the emulator - it does not launch.</p>
<p>Any ideas are appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>Yes, Visuddha is  correct, in windows system adb.exe is not exited when you close the emulator. so you have to close the adb.exe by your self.</p>
