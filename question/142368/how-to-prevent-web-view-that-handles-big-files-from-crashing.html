			<h1>How to prevent web view that handles big files from crashing</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>The case below is about only when the web view is alive and on the screen (not after it closes and needs to be released from memory).</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to let the user load and preview files (images, docs &amp; pdfs) through a webview. There are problems with iPad 1 when the files are too big and make the app crash. How could I prevent this? The only way I figured out till now it to check the size property of the Filesystem.File with which I feed the web view. Isn&#39;t there any other better way? Something like monitoring the web view and when I get a memory warning to make it stop loading. Because even big files start displaying ok but as the user scrolls the web view on the device, it crashes a bit later. For the current project it is sufficient if the user will scroll for a couple of pages. So, I could live with making the web view stop loading after a while. But I cannot figure a way to detect how much content has the web view loaded.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var swapFile = Ti.Filesystem.getFile(Ti.Filesystem.getApplicationDataDirectory(), <span class="hljs-string">"filePreview."</span> + <span class="hljs-variable">$extension</span>);

var webView = Ti.UI.createWebView({
    data: swapFile
});
</code></pre><p>PS: I cannot use the document viewer component (which is memory-wise more reliable) for this app cause I cannot customize it the way I want (it needs to be a small view, not full screen)</p>
<p>iOS 5.1 on iPad. Ti SDK 2.1.2</p>

							<p>There is no way to monitor memory usage on a webview. How big are the previews that you are loading? Even on a first gen ipad the files would have to be fairly large to cause a crash. Does this happen with just 1 file loaded, or does it happen after you load a second or third file?</p>

										<p><p>It happens for doc&#x2F;xls&#x2F;pdf files (these are the ones my users are interested in) that have a size more than 5MB. It happens on the first load already. I keep monitoring the memory (Ti.Platform.availableMemory) and after the webview is loaded, the available memory keeps dropping (probably as it progressively loads the document? ) from ~42mb to 0 and thus crash.</p>

										<p><p>See thats hard. You&#39;re on a first gen ipad trying to open really big files. You can either try one of the doc view&#x2F;quick view modules on the marketplace or you can try and make you&#39;re files smaller.</p>
