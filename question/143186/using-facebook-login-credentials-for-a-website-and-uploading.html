							<p>Your mobile app and the website are 2 different applications in the eyes of Facebook, so it won&#39;t matter if you&#39;re logged into FB within your app, you&#39;ll still have to login to FB with the website. Now, if you own the website, you could easily setup a page or api that is only accessible from within your application when the use is logged in so that images can be uploaded. However, if you don&#39;t own the website, image uploading will be tough as you won&#39;t be able to do regular web forms to upload images from your phone.</p>

										<p><p>Yea, the best bet here is to expose any necessary functionality via an api. If you could easily login and post through an api that they expose, then it&#39;ll be much easier for you to interact with it via your mobile application.</p>
