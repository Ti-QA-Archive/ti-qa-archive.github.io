			<h1>Interacting with the Remote Audio Controls on the iPhone Lock Screen</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Has anyone had success receiving events from the remote controls that appear on the iPhone&#39;s lock screen? I&#39;ve tried to do this in the past, but my application kept crashing.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re able to comment or share code, that would be appreciated greatly !</p>

										<p><p>Great that there is a module available for this, but I&#39;m also one of those people that has to figure out why. I&#39;ll use that module if I can&#39;t get to a resolution by tomorrow.</p>

										<p><p>The module above only works with Ti.Media.Audioplayer, I&#39;m trying to control audio with Titanium.Media.Sound as Audioplayer will not play local audio files :(</p>
<p>Any ideas how to do this with Ti.Media.Sound ?</p>

										<p><p>The TiMobile API hasn&#39;t been extended to wrap this functionality. Thats why the module was needed for access to the remote events.</p>
<p>Like I said though, before purchasing, be sure to contact the dev and see if it works for the lock screen.</p>
<p>Also, Sound is really intended for environmental audio, while audioPlayer is intended for music&#x2F;speech longer pieces of audio.</p>

<p>Titanium.Media.AudioPlayer<br>An audio player object used for streaming audio to the device, and low-level control of the audio playback.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried using AudioPlayer in the past but no luck, I receive network errors when trying to reference local files.</p>

										<p><p>Up, I take that back.  Our audioPlayer updated and is custom. So ignore that.</p>
<p>Use the videoPlayer instead, allows for local&#x2F;streaming and custom player controls.</p>

										<p><p>and on ios videoPlayer allows for .m3u8s</p>
<p>On android, take a look at the &#39;kcwdev.audio&#39; module in the marketplace, allows seeking, progress, some stuff missing from the Ti implementation.</p>

										<p><p>Cheers, but it doesn&#39;t appear to have remote audio control events.</p>
<p>I&#39;m hoping to have a &quot;progress&quot; event as well, otherwise I have to setup a loop that checks the progress of the audio file (which can&#39;t be good for memory and other resources).</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ll be honest, much of the Media framework hasn&#39;t been updated in years, outside of changing the way the modules log information.</p>
<p>Both sides were (ios and android) bits of hackery to begin with.</p>
