			<h1>Navigation bar image loading slowly in webview window</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Greetings, </p>
<p>My application has four tabs, each one with a window attached to it. The navigation bar in each of that windows is a custom image. I am loading the images when calling the <code>createWindow</code> function as specified below: </p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> dashboardWindow</span> = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
    title : <span class="hljs-string">""</span>,
    barImage: <span class="hljs-string">"/images/application_barImage.png"</span>,
    backgroundImage: <span class="hljs-string">"/images/emptyBackgroundImage.png"</span>
});
</code></pre><p>The image is loading just fine in all of the windows, except for one, where I load a webview from a local URL. In this case, the navigation bar image loads but it takes a lot of time. Before the image loads, the default blue navigation bar appears. I tried to make an easy example to show some code but it appears to work fine. I guess the problem might be my webview being too heavy. I create the webview only after all the other components are created but the problem persists. </p>
<p>I need to find a workaround because the webview is very important and is the first screen in the application. </p>
<p>Titanium Studio: 1.0.7.201112281340<br>SDK Version:     1.8.0.1</p>

							<div><p>I forgot to tell but I am targeting iOS 4.2.</p>
<p>I also have the common flickering problem when loading the webview window.There are many questions about this on the Q&amp;A but none of them targets or solves exactly my problem. Many of them refer to problems in iOS 5 or prior to Titanium SDK 1.8. I don&#39;t have the flickering problem when switching tabs or loading any other window as described in many of those questions. It is only the first time the tab with the webview window is loaded.</p>

							<div><p><strong>Loading the webview in the focus event worked just fine</strong>. It was so simple :S I read the docs for this event but unfortunately it is very poor, as it is in many other cases. By reading it, I should be able to understand that components like a webview should be created in the focus event (or maybe all components?).</p>
<p>Thanks a lot Sindre!</p>
<p>P.S.: Sorry I didn&#39;t post any of the code. It is a complex logic where I fetch data from a server to plot some charts on a webview. It is complex because I need to make 4 different requests and plot only when they&#39;re finished. There aren&#39;t any synchronization mechanisms so I had to find another way to do it.<br>I didn&#39;t want to post all that logic and thought that posting only the code with the function calls would be unsufficient. I realize now that it wouldn&#39;t.</p>

							<p>Well, the code is <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;3153453">here</a> but I think it will not help you understand what was going wrong. It is working fine because the creation of the webview is made in the focus event as Sindre suggested. If I take the code out of that event, the webview flickers when loading and the navigation bar image takes a lot of time to appear. So, <strong>putting the code into the focus event is the solution and it was Sindre Sorhus who gave it.</strong></p>
