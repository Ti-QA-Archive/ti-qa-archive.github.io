			<h1>Menubar appears when CreateWindow is used on Mac - Desktop</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a desktop app that I created for Mac that runs fullscreen. In the app I have buttons that open flash files in a seperate window using CreateWindow.</p>
<p>When I open the window A menubar appears at the top of my screen for my app. Is possible to have that bar not appear? or does it have to because I am using CreateWindow</p>

							<div><p>Although I don&#39;t want the menubar to show up it doesn&#39;t look right either.</p>
<p>The menu options go from left to right:</p>
<ol>
<li>Apple Icon</li>
<li>Smaller apple icon - this drop down has information about my app</li>
<li>Edit</li>
<li>Window</li>
<li>Help</li>
<li>The title of my app</li>
<li>Edit - when I mouse over this the drop down appears where #3 is.</li>
<li>Window - when I mouse over this the drop down appears where #4 is.</li>
<li>Help - when I mouse over this the drop down appears where #5 is.</li>
</ol>
<p>Problem 1 - I don&#39;t know why the title of my app doesn&#39;t show up where the small apple is.</p>
<p>Problem 2 - I don&#39;t know why Edit, Window, Help appear twice.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t want the menubar to appear so if I can do that then I don&#39;t need to worry about the above problems with the bar.</p>

<p>This was a bug that was fixed, but showed up on 10.5. Are you running this on Leopard? Seems you were using Snow Leopard, but do you have a machine running 10.5 ??? Use the newer SDK and it should go away.</p>

							<div><p>I am packaging this from my Windows machine for Mac. After I package I am testing it on a Mac that is 10.5.8 (Leopard).</p>
<p>I thought if it was going to be packaged in the cloud then it would be using the proper sdk. It shouldn&#39;t matter if I package from a PC or Mac does it?</p>

<p>You still need to configure your application with the right SDK, and the 1.1.0 SDK had that menu problem with it. If you package with 1.2.0.RC3 you shouldn&#39;t get that problem as it was fixed.</p>
<p>Have you tried changing the version of the SDK ?</p>
<p>The packaging server just uses the same version you have configured on your machine.</p>

<p>I tried a build with 1.2.0.RC3 but I am getting the http status: 400 error.</p>
<p>I had the 400 issue in another post you helped me with and determined it was the default_icon.png issue. I fixed that and was able to do a build with 1.1.0 but today I updated the sdk and I got the error again.</p>
