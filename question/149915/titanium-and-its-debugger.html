		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m trying to use the debugger. I really can&#39;t figure how to work correctly. Is it buggy?</p>
<p>problems faced:</p>
<p>1) when I set a breakpoint, sometimes it will stop on it, sometimes not. Is there some condition that says where a breakpoint will be respected or no? concrete example: (in a alloy controller, and yes I know I have to debug the files in resources folder at this time)</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">foo</span><span class="hljs-params">(event)</span> </span>{
 <span class="hljs-comment">//do something...  I put a breakpoint here</span>
}
</code></pre><pre><code class="hljs">$<span class="hljs-class">.whatever</span><span class="hljs-class">.addEventListener</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'singletap'</span>, foo)
</code></pre><p>In this case it never stops at &quot;do something&quot;.</p>
<p>2) when I remove a breakpoint, even when I rebuild the app, the breakpoint seems to be in Neverland and the debugger will stop on it. The funny thing is that if you work with alloy it&#39;s even worst because this &quot;imaginary not removed breakpoint&quot; will be at another line of code most of the time.</p>
<p>3) when the debugger does stop on the breakpoint I&#39;ve set, I don&#39;t really know where it has stopped, before the call of statement, after? I can only guess when I inspect the variables state at this time and does a &quot;step into&quot;</p>
<p>4) when debugging on device (in my case an HTC sensation with android 4.0.3) There are various consoles available. one is &quot;app <em>appname</em> on device&quot; so I expect to see all the output of my app in there. Like a Ti.API.info(…)… well nothing appears there. I have to watch at the device console which is outputing 10000 messages per second (system, other apps, etc.) , I can&#39;t work like that. How can I see only what I want?</p>
<p>5) when I try to debug a response from an API or the data passed in an event, I sometimes get very very long strings responses. The problem is that the debugger does not show the whole string but is limited to ?? characters. It&#39;s just impossible to look at it easily.</p>
<p>There are more problems but these are the most annoying ones at this time. Any help greatly appreciated.</p>

							<div><p>Having read your questions, I wonder if you are hoping everything will be done for you and leave nothing left for yourself.  Your dismissive tone and words, both here and below should be toned down if you are wishing to gain a real answer.</p>
<p>You have asked several questions and really these should have been split up into several questions one at a time - to give you enough time to have responses for the first which may have cancelled out the rest.</p>
<p>The platform can and does give you a fast easy way to produce cross platforms apps.  Expecting everything to do everything you want in the way you want it is fine - but reality means that something will not and something may but will take a bit of time.</p>

							<div><p>I really don&#39;t see why my tone is a problem in any way. These are a lot of issues I&#39;ve encountered when working with the debugger, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s my fault or not and started to wonder if there was  a problem with it. I am used to tools like the chrome inspector. on the other hand, I&#39;ve seen a lot of questions with &quot;sub points&quot; that can be related with each other so it makes sense for them to be in the same place but one might argue about it, ok. Since I would like to know how to work with the debugger I prefered to group all the points here. Writing in a place like this removes all the &quot;way of speaking&quot;. If you interpreted this as an agressive tone, it&#39;s not. Also English is not my language and I might write something that looks bad to you but it&#39;s not intended.</p>

										<p><p>Technically yes, but there is no way for sure to know what the alloy command actually does.</p>
<p>As I said, the full debugger support is announced for version 3.1. You may get it to work, but keep in mind that it is not supported. </p>
<p>So <strong>no</strong> it is nut buggy as you imply. Simply not fully implemented yet.</p>

										<p><p>Christian is correct. You can&#39;t currently use the step-through debugger with breakpoints directly in Alloy controllers yet. In TiStudio 3.1 with Alloy 1.1.0, you will be able to. In future versions more of the Alloy files will be debuggable in this fashion, like the model and adapter code.</p>

										<p><p>Ok so you should reflect that in the docs because it&#39;s clearly stated that you can debug a titanium app built with alloy using the files in the resources folder. There: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Alloy_Debugging_and_Troubleshooting. There is absolutely no mention of &quot;not fully impemented for alloy&quot; or &quot;we don&#39;t know what the alloy command does&quot; so actually you should expect some problems when using the debugger with alloy apps… But for now, let&#39;s forget the possibly Alloy related problems, what about points 4 and 5? Any help on this?</p>

										<p><p>You can debug from the generated files in Resources folder. You can&#39;t debug from Alloy files in the app folder. It states that pretty clearly in the first paragraph of the documentation link you referenced. I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;we don&#39;t know what the alloy command does&quot; because I certainly do. ;-)</p>
<p>4) I don&#39;t typically use that same workflow, but when I&#39;m sifting through adb logs I just use grep from the command line, something like:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">adb logcat <span class="hljs-string">| grep "</span>what im looking for<span class="hljs-string">"</span>
</code></pre><p>I believe ddms also allows you to set filtered views of the adb logs which should allow you to do the same in a GUI interface</p>
<p>5) Conveniently checking out large amounts of data in the console is usually a pain in the ass proposition. This is generally not unique to Titanium. If the data is that large that it can&#39;t be printed effectively, perhaps you should write it out to a file that you can access directly? Then you can dump it into a beautifier of some kind and get a sense of what you are operating on that way.</p>

										<p><p>ok there were some misunderstandings: </p>
<p>a) &quot;we don&#39;t know what the alloy command does&quot; :  I am directly quoting what said Christian Brousseau in its third comment that seemed strange to me.</p>
<p>b) I have these problems when I am debugging the controllers code in &quot;Resources - alloy - controllers - foo.js&quot; so the resources folder, an alloy controller. Can that be debugged or not ? this is what I meant by &quot; (in a alloy controller, and yes I know I have to debug the files in resources folder at this time)&quot; in the &quot;point 1)&quot;</p>

										<p><p>@tony</p>
<p>Thank you for the adb advice. (I don&#39;t know much about working with the command line and adb) I thought that the &quot;app on device&quot; console was there to filter this as you have described it. </p>
<p>If you don&#39;t work usually like this, could you share some tips about how you work to debug your app? (it it&#39;s not too long and does not bother you)</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also thought about the beautifier way. I had installed a json beautifier in Sublime Text 2 and it works well but as I said the strings are truncated when too long so when I &quot;beautify&quot; the strings they are not valid JSON and I didn&#39;t know&#x2F;thought I could dump the content in a file. (and still have to find how) I really thought the debugger would handle this :)</p>

										<p><p>After doing a small test. Exactly like in point 1). The debugger does not stop (as I said before), not when debugging with an Android Device, nor with the Android Simulator BUT yes it stops correctly in the iPhone simulator. (I don&#39;t have an iPhone to test on a real iOS device)</p>

										<p><p>I think I see the issue you are encountering. Alloy is regenerating the controllers on each build and is thus knocking out your breakpoints in Studio. Not sure why it&#39;s working on ios for you, it could have to do with how the files are linked. In any case, can you make a test case and submit it to the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC">Titanium Community Jira project</a>? Be sure to include the smallest possible test case that exhibits the issue, as well as all the details you gave here that surfaced the problem. This way we can get this in front of the engineers eyes and hopefully get resolved. This might even fall in my lap, not sure though without further investigation, hinging on the ticket of course.</p>
