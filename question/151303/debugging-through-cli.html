			<h1>Debugging through CLI</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>How can I debug an application (step through&#x2F;break on errors) through the new CLI. I assume there&#39;s some port that you can connect the Chrome Remote Web Inspector to.</p>
<p>By the way, the new CLI allows for so much greater productivity than the bloated Eclipsey UI.</p>

							<p>Unfortunately, the new CLI does not support interactive debugging apps. This would be a cool feature someday.</p>

							<p>Chris: Thanks for the reply. I would really like to express how important this is. The current IDE, while a great option for people who have grown used to Eclipse, is extremely bloated and is likely difficult for people with mobility disabilities. People have their workflows that they cannot change for many reasons (20 years of using Vim, for example, will rule out any possibility of switching development environments, especially if a user has RSI or a mobile impairment). There are a huge number of engineers who are extremely intelligent and would make valuable contributions to the community if the debugging environment had a more open infrastructure, that more closely resembled the new (awesome) CLI. The open sourcing of Titanium is extremely awesome, and the new CLI is the one reason why I decided to give Titanium another shot. It definitely shows that you&#39;re moving in a direction that can reach these engineers. I don&#39;t believe it would be incredibly difficult to get the exact same debugging backend that was built into Kroll, to play nicely with the webkit remote debugger. (It simply connects over http). Is there a better way to voice my concern and advocate that this feature be considered a priority? In other words, what could I do in order to help this feature become added in an upcoming release?</p>

										<p><p>I think we&#39;re both in the same boat with respect to Eclipse-based IDEs. Other debuggers certainly would be cool, especially a CLI one.</p>
<p>Getting a feature like this added is not super easy. We have already planned what we&#39;re going to work on for at least the next 6 months. There is not much room for adding something of this size.</p>
<p>Traditionally you would create a Jira ticket, then it would have to be promoted from a community ticket to a official TIMOB ticket, then get scheduled, and finally someone to work on it. To accelerate this, you could become a customer and then you have access to the support team. They have the ability to escalate issues. If you are a big customer, then you could gain even more traction.</p>
<p>Now, if you&#39;re a bit of a hardcore hacker, there might be an easier way. The Titanium CLI has a hidden option for iOS and Android builds called –debug-host. For iOS, it&#39;s value is a colon separated list consisting of &lt;ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt;:&lt;airkey&gt;:&lt;hosts&gt; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_mobile&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;cli&#x2F;commands&#x2F;_build.js#L1244">see here</a>). I&#39;m not sure about Android since it&#39;s currently all in the old builder.py scripts (this will change for 3.2.0 when I port it from Python to Node.js).</p>
<p>You could write some Node.js (or whatever) TCP server that listens on a port and then pass it into the build command via the –debug-host param. When the app is launched, it will connect to the server and pause the JavaScript engine to wait for you to click step through the code.</p>
<p>Now the downside. I have no clue:</p>
<ul>
<li>what protocol it uses</li>
<li>if it&#39;s encrypted</li>
<li>how you set breakpoints</li>
<li>how you send commands</li>
<li>tell what file you&#39;re in</li>
<li>if this functionality is apart of the open source Aptana Studio or if it&#39;s in Titanium Studio</li>
<li>what an &quot;airkey&quot; is</li>
<li>what &quot;hosts&quot; is</li>
<li>how Android differs from iOS</li>
<li>if this is using some Eclipse based debugging system</li>
<li>etc, etc</li>
</ul>
<p>You could dig through the iOS and Android source to uncover most of these and possibly some packet sniffing. I for one would be interested to know. I wish I had the time to hack on this. It would be cool and fun. :)</p>

							<p>Hi, you might be interested in checking out Ti Inspector (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;titaniumninja.com&#x2F;debugging-titanium-apps-with-chrome-devtools&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;titaniumninja.com&#x2F;debugging-titanium-apps-with-chrome-devtools&#x2F;</a>). It only works on the iOS side for the moment, but it does pretty much what Chris was mentioning in his post.</p>
