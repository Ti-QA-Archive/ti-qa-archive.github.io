			<h1>Use L() i18n translation feature with a different locale</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>does anyone know whether it is possible to use the new translation feature in Titanium 1.5 with a different locale than the platform locale? Currently, Titanium seems to use the platform locale automatically but I want that the user can choose a different language than the platform locale.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Walter</p>

							<div><p>I tried doing this using a different strings.xml file for each language (placed in the &quot;i18n&#x2F;&quot; folder at the root level of the project). Intuitively, this seemed like the right thing to do. What I discovered, however, is that while I found it easy to get the user&#39;s current locale, I was unable to find a way to change the user&#39;s current language (which, alas, Appcelerator&#39;s docs state is a read only property). In addition, I was wary of changing the user&#39;s language, should the app crash before the language was changed back to its original setting.</p>
<p>After thinking about it some more, I realized that what I really wanted was not load the app with all text set according to the language setting on the user&#39;s device, but rather to allow the user to switch languages at any time while the app is running.</p>
<p>My solution was to change the way I wrote the strings.xml file.  I made modifications similar to this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">&lt;resources&gt;
    &lt;<span class="hljs-type">string</span> <span class="hljs-property">name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"en_songs"</span>&gt;Songs&lt;/<span class="hljs-type">string</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span class="hljs-type">string</span> <span class="hljs-property">name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"fr_songs"</span>&gt;Chansons&lt;/<span class="hljs-type">string</span>&gt;
&lt;/resources&gt;
</code></pre><p>So now my strings.xml file contained both English and French text (obviously this could be modified to include whichever and however many languages were needed).  </p>
<p>Near the top of my app.js file, I declared the following global variables:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> language = <span class="hljs-string">"fr_"</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">//the default language setting</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> titleObjectsArray = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">Array</span>(); <span class="hljs-comment">//all objects which have a "title" property which gets changed when the user changes languages</span>
</code></pre><p>I then defined my buttons and labels. To wit:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var b3 = Titanium.UI.createButton({
    title: L(language+<span class="hljs-string">'songs'</span>), <span class="hljs-comment">//e.g., "fr_songs"</span>
        <span class="hljs-variable">key</span>:<span class="hljs-string">'songs'</span>, <span class="hljs-comment">//custom property </span>
    <span class="hljs-built_in">color</span>:<span class="hljs-string">'white'</span>,
    font:{fontSize:<span class="hljs-number">15</span>},
    <span class="hljs-variable">width</span>:<span class="hljs-number">160</span>,
    <span class="hljs-variable">height</span>:<span class="hljs-number">39</span>
});

titleObjectsArray.push(b3);
</code></pre><p>The user can change the language setting at any time by selecting either &quot;English&quot; or &quot;Français&quot; from the Menu. </p>
<p>After the user chooses either English or French, the global variable &#39;language&#39; is set to the appropriate value (&quot;en<em>&quot; or &quot;fr</em>&quot;). I then loop through all of the items in titleObjectsArray and call a function to change the .title property of each one based on the current setting of the variable &#39;language&#39;:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">  <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">changeText</span><span class="hljs-params">(whichItem)</span></span>{
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> theKey = language+whichItem.key; <span class="hljs-comment">//e.g., "en_songs" or "fr_songs"</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> theText = L(theKey); <span class="hljs-comment">//get the appropriate string from strings.xml</span>
    whichItem.title = theText;
}
</code></pre><p>{I do something similar with all items that need their .text property changed, and actually use a modified version of the above function to change all items, regardless of whether they need their .title or .text property changed.)</p>
<p>I am still tinkering with the code and will undoubtedly make changes as I move forward, but so far this is working quite well.  The only text I haven&#39;t been able to change on the fly is the text in the title of my tabs. (Any ideas&#x2F;suggestions?) I haven&#39;t tried it yet with objects like text areas that have a .value property which needs to be changed, but I&#39;m guessing that it should work just fine.</p>

							<div><p>Hi.<br>Good idea, although I have to change the language while the application is running. I&#39;ll try something similar to your solution. For tabgroup, I created a function that creates my tabgroup, so I think it will just close the current tabgroup and recreate it using the function, so as to change the language of all windows, including the text of the tab.</p>

							<div><p>Hey Andrew… stumbled across this and I&#39;m doing a very similar thing, but I&#39;ve decided to let the individual views and windows do their own updating (handling both text and image updates). Then the &#39;language manager&#39; just fires off an event for the windows to update and poke their children to do the same.</p>
<p>I&#39;m guessing your solution is more performant, but I ?think? I need more local logic to handle some non-standard updates (hmmm, or do I - maybe I&#39;ll be re-writing some stuff this weekend : )</p>

							<p>Facing the similar issue. </p>
<p>Would like to change the Language of the App. I am using the <strong>i18n</strong> folder structure:</p>
<p>&#x2F;en &#x2F;strings.xml</p>
<p>&#x2F;fr &#x2F;strings.xml</p>
<p>I use the <code>L(&amp;#39;property&amp;#39;)</code> to fetch the string of the property, in English <em>(by default)</em>; Though I would like to change the language to fr on the fly. Surely having all the file structure and so on is made for the language to change on the fly?</p>

							<p>Solved…<br>The User&#39;s iOS &#x2F; Android sets the language depending on their Device Language Settings. You can even test it in the Simulator by:<br>1- Getting out of the app:<br>2- Settings &gt;&gt; General &gt;&gt; International &gt;&gt; Language</p>
<p>The concept of changing Language on the fly isn&#39;t a use case.</p>
