			<h1>Memory and garbage collection</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have been running a few tests, as it has been well documented that it is possible to crash apps dues to the way that the memory is handled.<br>It would appear that although when you close a window or null an object, it is added to the stack of memory to be freed, it does not get deleted immediately. This is where the problem lies, as it is when the memory gets low that it becomes possible to crash the app… This leads to my question… Is there no way to force the memory to be freed immediately?</p>

							<p>That is the nature of JS garbage collection isnt it ?  Elligable objects are marked for deletion and when the next sweep occurs they are freed. You dont have control of when that sweep occurs.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>In most cases memory is automatically freed and garbage collection is handled for you.  It is the other times that are the problem.</p>

							<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I would like to recommend to you a module that I have recently published that calls the native java garbage collection:</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;7916</p>
<p>I use this technique quite a lot in my apps.</p>
<p>hope that helps :)</p>
