							<p>It depends on your implementation… if you Play anything remotely there are always to Partys whoch are involved. On the one Hand its the Provider and his upload Speed and on the other Hand its your Connection, wlan&#x2F;3g&#x2F;edge. In any case the File must be buffered&#x2F;downloaded before playing it.</p>

										<p><p>No, I am not saying that your provider is slow but he <em>could</em> be I just dont know. Its your task to check that. Even with wifi you have to buffer the file, nothing is instant (yet) on remote access.</p>

										<p><p>No, Simulator is faster than a device. This does not affect the connection speed, since it depends on the connection. However in most cases a device will be using 3g&#x2F;edge&#x2F;lte and it just depends on the provider.</p>
<p>If it takes 3-10 Seconds until your file is being played, than thats fine. Just show feedback that the file is being buffered or something similar.</p>
