			<h1>Save downloaded file from remote server not working (Android)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have searched and tried every piece of code I could find on the net but can&#39;t seem to get exactly how to save a file to my phone&#x2F;emulator from a remote server.  I have a mp3 on one of my Dreamhost servers and I am trying to save it to my phone.  I tried to run it through the emulator and store it on my Windows 7 laptop.  That did not work.  I installed the app on my Android phone and it still will not download and save the file.  Is there a bug in Appcelerator with this?  I am slowly growing impatient with Appcelerator.  I though it was supposed to be this great cross platform code base but it does not work and is not documented with a lot of things.</p>

							<p>When having an apparent problem, it is best to tell us the SDK level you are trying to use.  Also more info than &quot;did not work&quot; would be really helpful.  We are just shooting in the dark here.</p>
<p>But since you mention it is a mp3 file, one possibility is the size of the file may be creating a memory overflow issue if you are trying to save the file using the <code>f.write(xhr.responseData);</code> method in your code.</p>
<p>With iOS it is easy to avoid that problem using the &quot;file&quot; property of the HTTPClient object.  However it is not supported in the android version of the HTTPClient, at least as of SDK 1.7.2 anyway.</p>
<p>A user did come up with a method to achieve the same end with android however, and it is described <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;35041&#x2F;large-file-download-on-mobile.html#answer-197841">here</a>.  Try integrating that method into your code and see if it solves your problem.  If not, please tell us the SDK level you are using, the relevant portion of your code, and what errors or symptoms are occurring.</p>

										<p><p>I did see this example along my travels of the Appcelerator Q&amp;A but stayed away because I saw mention that it was a hacky way to do it.  I did use the latest build of 1.8 for the SDK but that did not resolve it.  Also, they were small mp3 files being max 3 Mb.  Looks like the hack is the way to go currently.  Thanks for the answer Doug!</p>

										<p><p>Well, it is a hack to the extent it relies on digging through the SDK source to find undocumented properties such as the responseData object type and native path.  It is has the possibility of breaking in future SDKs since it relies on the properties remaining available.  Hopefully if that ever happens the &quot;file&quot; property available in iOS will be implemented.  But for now IMHO this is by far the best way to download to a file under android.</p>
