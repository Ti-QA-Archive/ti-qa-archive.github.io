							<p>Wait, are you just making up your own properties and hoping they work? And if they don&#39;t come here and ask?</p>
<p>Put your elements in a container:</p>

										<p><p>Padding, Margin etc are some of the basic styling properties and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a sin to think that it will be supported here as well !!</p>
<p>And when I searched, I was not able to get anything on these in the docs<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Alloy_Styles_and_Themes</p>
<p>And as far as I&#39;m concerned, Q&amp;A section is for asking doubts to experts.</p>
<p>Anyway thanks for your answer !!</p>

										<p><p>Keep in mind that TSS is not CSS. TSS simply exposes the styling properties of Titanium UI elements as defined in our documentation. If you feel a property is missing, please submit a <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org">feature request on Jira</a> using a JSON syntax that is perhaps confusingly close to CSS.</p>
<p>Furthermore, though it&#39;s a much larger topic, Titanium is not HTML. You&#39;ll thank yourself later if you move beyond the notion that you can&#x2F;should do stuff in Titanium like you would do with a web page.</p>

										<p><p>Alright guys…. thanks !!<br>Will take some time to get used to things as this is my first ever application using this framework. And I expect some nice feedbacks&#x2F;response rather than rough&#x2F;tough ones here.</p>

										<p><p>Let me see if I can paint a bigger picture, one outside of the small, small web world you seem to be coming from.</p>
<p>You are building apps, to run on platforms, namely iOS and Android.  Every window, view, label and slider you create in javascript maps to a native element via a proxy.  You can&#39;t have MORE in the javascript, then you have in the real native &#39;thing&#39;.</p>
<p>You want to pad a Ti.UI.Button. A Ti.UI.Button maps to a UIButton.  If you were writing NATIVE OBJECTIVE-C, you would still be subclassing (do you even know what this means?) either UILabel or UIButton in order to add padding functionality.</p>
<p><code>and I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a sin to think that it will be supported here as well !!</code></p>
<p>You didn&#39;t <em>just ask</em> you made up your own little make believe properties and then wondered why the don&#39;t work.</p>
<p>Because you are just making stuff up, in our minds every question you ask in the future is tainted.</p>

										<p><p>Hrm, <strong>maybe</strong> it <strong>IS</strong> a sin.</p>
<p><strong>Sloth</strong> - didn&#39;t take the time to read the Titanium documentation or to understand the technology you are targeting</p>
<p><strong>Pride</strong> - arrogantly believed that you know whats best for Titanium, Apple, mobile technology in general and just arbitrarily decided to write your own properties.</p>

										<p><p>Kris, Stephen&#39;s comments might be a bit harshly worded. But his points are valid (and he&#39;s actually a nice guy once you get past his snark). Please do spend some time with Titanium. I encourage you also to read through the iOS Human Interface Guidelines and Android Design Guide to get a feel for what&#39;s expected on the native platforms. Mobile is a vast undertaking. I know I had a huge learning curve to work through when I switched from web to mobile. But it&#39;s fun and worth the effort.</p>

										<p><p>@Stephen….With all due respect, </p>
<p>my question was </p>
<h3 id="-quot-is-it-really-possible-to-add-padding-to-ui-elements-in-alloy-framework-quot-">&quot;Is it really possible to add padding to UI elements in alloy framework ?&quot;</h3>
<p>The one mistake I did is mentioning what I really tried to do  !! And that made up all this ! </p>
<p>You are the expert here and the technical stuff you pointed out is correct. I&#39;m a beginner here and ppl like me would like to learn things from experts like you. And I believe everybody might have worked their way from their small, small worlds to reach current position. So it&#39;d be really appreciated if you can put your comments in a gentle manner.</p>

							<p>@Stephen: lay off the espresso!</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a little trick that I use for buttons: Just build in some extra left and right spaces, like this:<br>&lt;Button id=&quot;mContractsEntryButton&quot; onClick=&quot;contactsEntryClick&quot; title=&quot;   Contacts   &quot;  class=&quot;mButton&quot; left=&quot;10dp&quot;&#x2F;&gt;</p>
