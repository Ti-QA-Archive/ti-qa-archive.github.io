			<p>Hi all.</p>
<p>I am getting an error 400 - Bad Request when i try and post an image from an iPhone app running in the simulator.</p>
<p>In my searches through here there are a few people who have had similar problems so i have tried out a number of fixes.</p>
<p>1) It works locally using localhost running an apache server.<br>2) It does not return the error in the PHP script on the server, just the bad request error which is coming from apache.<br>3) When i comment out the image part, i get the error from the php script telling me the upload failed (as expected).<br>4) I have noticed that both my local server and remote one do not have &#39;json&#39; in their HTTP_ACCEPT.</p>
<p>Here is my function that makes the xhr request;-</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;1748312</p>
<p>The object with all my post data is shown here;-</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;1748333</p>
<p>And lastly the eventlistener that calls it is here;-</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;1748334</p>
<p>Unfortunately i cannot access the php error log on the server but i feel the code should be ok (as it works locally) but it is perhaps the server config that is wrong.<br>I have made sure that the upload target folder has writable permissions (as it does locally) and it is running php on linux so no IIS funniness to deal with - should be pretty similar to the local apache instance, surely.</p>
<p>I seem to have two options. Go back to the host people and ask them to help with access to the php logs, which i expect will not be a quick thing. Or do something else.. any suggestions greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>My local set up<br>Titanium SDK version: 1.6.0<br>iPhone SDK version: 4.2</p>
<p>Oh and in order to get to the part of the app that offers this form you have to have seen at least one other view that successfully gets (and i do mean &#39;GET&#39;s) data from the same API.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Jez</p>

										<p><p>Hi, thanks for the suggestion but sadly it does not work.<br>I tried using the stringify method on the whole JSON object as you suggested and i also tried it on just the photo before adding it to request. Both times just send a blank value for photo.</p>
<p>I also tried this in the sim and on device, the photo is definitely being uploaded as the console in xcode showed the progress bar data gradually getting higher, so i think this is definitely something on the server.</p>
<p>Others have had similar issues so i will try more on the server side of things - maybe try and debug my FILES array as that seems to be empty.</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>Jez</p>

							<p>One problem that I had once had to do with the content type. Try <code>application&amp;#x2F;x-www-form-urlencoded</code>. Generally it&#39;s a good idea to use wireshark in order to see the requests of your application. </p>
