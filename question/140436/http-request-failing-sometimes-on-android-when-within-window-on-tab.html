			<h1>Http request failing sometimes on Android when within window on tab</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a bit of a problem on Android that I can&#39;t quite get my head around. Basically I&#39;m getting some user information from a Drupal site. On Android I was having an issue when I couldn&#39;t get the data because on Android it doesn&#39;t seem to remember the session as it does on IOS so I started adding the cookie to the the requests as follows.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">xhr.setRequestHeader(<span class="hljs-string">"Cookie"</span>, Titanium.App.<span class="hljs-keyword">Properties</span>.getString(<span class="hljs-string">"userSessionName"</span>)+<span class="hljs-string">'='</span>+Titanium.App.<span class="hljs-keyword">Properties</span>.getString(<span class="hljs-string">"userSessionId"</span>));
</code></pre><p>I then noticed that this helped on some occasions but not others. For example if I launch the app in the emulator it would be successful maybe 2 times out of 5 at best, even though the request to the server is identical each time. When it fails I get errors such as Unauthorized: Access denied for user 0 &quot;anonymous&quot;</p>
<p>I then decided to copy the same request into my app.js so that it&#39;s one of the first things to happen and it works 100% of the time.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the code for app.js or window in tabgroup</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> DrupaniumPoints = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'drupanium_framework/drupanium_points'</span>);
DrupaniumPoints.drupaniumGetPoints(data.user.uid, DrupaniumApp.getDrupaniumURLS(<span class="hljs-string">'rest_path'</span>), DrupaniumApp.getDrupaniumURLS(<span class="hljs-string">'site_path'</span>), <span class="hljs-number">5000</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">data</span>) </span>{});
</code></pre><p>and for the http request</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">exports.drupaniumGetPoints = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">uid, rest_path, site_path, timeout, onSuccess</span>) </span>{

    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> url = rest_path + <span class="hljs-string">'views/app_membership_points?args='</span> + uid;

    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> xhr = Titanium.Network.createHTTPClient({timeout: timeout});
    xhr.open(<span class="hljs-string">"GET"</span>, url);
    xhr.setRequestHeader(<span class="hljs-string">"Cookie"</span>, Titanium.App.Properties.getString(<span class="hljs-string">"userSessionName"</span>)+<span class="hljs-string">'='</span>+Titanium.App.Properties.getString(<span class="hljs-string">"userSessionId"</span>));
    xhr.send();
    <span class="hljs-comment">// When the connection loads do:</span>
    xhr.onload = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{
        <span class="hljs-comment">// Use the status Code in the variable statusCode</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> statusCode = xhr.status;

        Ti.API.log(<span class="hljs-string">"drupaniumGetPoints  httprequest status is: "</span> + statusCode);

        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(statusCode == <span class="hljs-number">200</span>) {
            <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> response = xhr.responseText;
            <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> data = <span class="hljs-built_in">JSON</span>.parse(response);
            onSuccess(data, statusCode);
        }
    }

    xhr.onerror = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">e</span>) </span>{
        Ti.API.error(<span class="hljs-string">'Bad Sever Points =&gt;'</span> + e.error);
    };
}
</code></pre><p>Hopefully that should be enough code and my explanation of the problem makes sense.</p>
<p>Please bear in mind that none of the issues I&#39;m having on Android occur in IOS.</p>
<p>This is using Titanium SDK 2.1.1 and was the same on 2.1.0</p>

							<p>So your real session id is 865cmdujrpmlg52abgrrkk3960.  But when you send two Cookie headers, most likely, the second header is going to trump the first, and in the $_COOKIE array, you would only see the second.</p>
<p>But that header isn&#39;t coming out of thin air; it&#39;s being generated by drupal.  So you need to work through the code in the debugger to see when that header is being received by your software, and then why it&#39;s getting added to subsequent requests.</p>
<p>It could be that the cookie is just getting added implicitly by the HTTPClient.  In other words, if a single HTTPClient object makes a request, and that request comes back with a Set-Cookie header, the HTTPClient object will store the cookies and use them on subsequent requests.  If you&#39;re calling setRequestHeader() to add cookies, you&#39;re just adding <em>another</em> Cookie header to the request.</p>
<p>If you want to manage the cookies explicitly (and I think that&#39;s a good idea, unless you&#39;re going to guarantee the use of a single HTTPClient object throughout your entire app – which you could do with a nice CommonJS module, btw), you might want to look at the clearCookies() method – that might get rid of the double Cookie header problem.</p>

										<p><p>Ok I have found that if I include the following on the next request to the server it does seem to clear the issue.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var xhr = Titanium.Network.createHTTPClient({
        <span class="hljs-keyword">timeout</span> : <span class="hljs-keyword">timeout</span>
    });
xhr.clearCookies(<span class="hljs-string">"http://www.example.com"</span>);
</code></pre><p>In regards to the common js module I currently use multiple modules for the various requests. Are you suggesting that I should roll them all into module?</p>

										<p><p>Sorry – I got a bit stream-of-consciousness on you there.</p>
<p>You could use a single HTTPClient, and if you wrapped it in a CommonJS module, you could access that one instance anywhere in your app:</p>
<p>MyHTTPClient.js:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> _instance = null;

function <span class="hljs-type">MyHTTPClient</span> ()
{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (_instance == null)
    {
        _instance = <span class="hljs-type">Ti</span>.<span class="hljs-type">Network</span>.createHTTPClient (<span class="hljs-decorator">{...}</span>);
    }

    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> _instance;
}

module.exports = <span class="hljs-type">MyHTTPClient</span>;
</code></pre><p>elsewhere in your code:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> MyHTTPClient = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span> (<span class="hljs-string">'MyHTTPClient'</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> c = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> MyHTTPClient();
</code></pre><p><code>c</code> now contains a reference to your single instance of HTTPClient.</p>
<p>Doing this could let you use HTTPClient&#39;s built-in cookie management.  But I could see problems with this, in that network requests are asynchronous.  I&#39;m not sure what would happen if you made a request while a previous request was pending…</p>
<p>So you don&#39;t need to do this; it&#39;s more of an interesting mental exercise.  I think the way you&#39;re explicitly managing the cookies is better anyway.  There are nice advantages like you could store the session so that it persists through an app restart.</p>

							<p>Can you add some logging to your server to capture the entire $_REQUEST array and log it to a file?  I suspect that the requests are <em>not</em> actually identical each time, if your server is sending back different results each time.</p>

										<p><p>Drupal already logs all the requests made to the server. And the url it&#39;s receiving is the same on all occasions. It just not consistently recognising the user as being logged in.</p>
<p>However I have found the problem which I don&#39;t fully understand but it is now working. Along with the user information I was also getting other content but as this content didn&#39;t require the user to be logged in I hadn&#39;t bothered adding the cookies to the request. Adding the cookie header to all requests seems to have fixed it.</p>

										<p><p>The URL wasn&#39;t the problem, as you found out.  Dumping the $_REQUEST array would have shown you the cookies being sent.  Comparing successful requests to unsuccessful ones might have shown you the problem.  Anyway, glad you solved it!</p>

										<p><p>Well it&#39;s mostly fixed, I still have one problem.</p>
<p>On the user page, it either displays login form or their account details. When they login the window is refreshed to then show the account details, this is the same requests as I was having problems with before. But when the window refreshes I&#39;m gettting the same errors where the user is not authenticated, but if I reload the app it works fine.</p>

										<p><p>Have you verified in both situations you&#39;re setting the same cookie (or cookies)?</p>
<p>Again, I think it would be wise to examine the exact cookies being sent on that request (by logging on the server side), since you have pointed out that it&#39;s not as simple as just setting the user information in the cookie.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not familiar with Drupal&#39;s authentication mechanisms, but if you emulate a browser by accepting, storing, and resending all cookies sent from the server, you should be able to make this work.</p>

										<p><p>Ok I think I can now see the issue but not sure why it&#39;s happening.</p>
<p>On the successful requests there is just 1 cookie being sent, i.e. the one I set.</p>
<p>On the requests that are failing there seems to be 2 cookies, the one that I have set and another one which I have no idea where that&#39;s coming from</p>
