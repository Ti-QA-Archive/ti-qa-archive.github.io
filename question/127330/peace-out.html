			<p>Well, y&#39;all. It&#39;s been fun… it&#39;s been real… but it hasn&#39;t been real fun.</p>
<p>I think I&#39;m done with Appcelerator. Too many issues. Too few ways to find a resolution. Too expensive to get any meaningful support packages for small developers. And too little help offered by the community.</p>
<p>I will miss doing more native stuff, but I think I&#39;m headed to the PhoneGab camp.</p>
<p>Peace out.</p>

							<p>Hi Jason.</p>
<p>You&#39;re the second one in short time leaving Titanium for similar reasons.</p>
<p>While I agree that Titanium has a lot of basic core issues that can make new developers frustrated, I don&#39;t agree that help from community is poor. You asked two questions, one was asked 12 hours ago, second a day ago. Both were badly formed … you need to understand that people can&#39;t fix anything if there is no enough information and in many cases if they can&#39;t reproduce bad behavior. We all have everyday work and it&#39;s our good will to help you or other community members. That said, you need to understand that questions like &quot;this doesn&#39;t work&quot; or &quot;help me with this&quot; would take a lot of time and effort to get to some solution. To get good answer, the question must be asked in a proper way: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;catb.org&#x2F;~esr&#x2F;faqs&#x2F;smart-questions.html">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;catb.org&#x2F;~esr&#x2F;faqs&#x2F;smart-questions.html</a></p>
<p>On the other hand, there are guys from Appcelerator that are hired for answering question on Q&#x2F;A (pretty cool, right) among other things, so they care about problems people from community are facing. Their responses are OK (could be better in some cases, though), but even they can&#39;t help you if you provide limited information about your issues. You are not the only one here asking for help, there are a lot of other developers asking question and providing better information about their issues. So, if they have limited time to answer questions, I think it&#39;s reasonable that they won&#39;t spend much of their time on questions that would take a lot of time and effort to get resolved (it&#39;s better to answer to 10 well formed question than to 1 badly formed - don&#39;t look at things from personal standpoint).</p>
<p>So I think it&#39;s a bit frivolous from you to leave, I think you should be more patient. Titanium is getting better. I&#39;ve been using it since 1.5 and I had moments like you have now (I regretted why I didn&#39;t choose PhoneGap, or even better - why I didn&#39;t develop native application), but I looked to the future (and managed to solve issues that I had) and I saw positive steps in Titanium.<br>My application works pretty well at the moment, I&#39;m working on application that will be used by field workers in the company I work for, for the input of large data sets that will be transferred over the net and be synchronized with our online database. At the moment, I have 850 files (each file is one component) and have developed complex forms and layouts that works well. So, complex applications can be developed with Titanium, that&#39;s for sure.</p>
<p>I&#39;m happy to work with Titanium, I love to program in JavaScript and I don&#39;t want to return to PHP (which is my first programming language love). What I don&#39;t like about Titanium is that a lot of their core functionality don&#39;t work and that is not being fixed quick enough. From engineering point of view, that is unacceptable (for example, Chromium dev team fixed core issue in 1 day, although it was not top priority and the fact that they have around 30 000 issues opened). The thing is, guys from Appcelerator listen and response in a right way. I think they understand existing issues in Titanium and I think and hope that in the future we will see improvements in Titanium core functionality. :)</p>

										<p><p>Ivan, thank you for your thoughtful answer. And you could be right, who knows. We&#39;ll see if the grass is really greener or not.</p>
<p>I echo a lot of what you say. I am frustrated with the inconsistency between platforms. I am dumbfounded when I search for bugs that I encounter in the software on Q&amp;A and then see the timestamp says &quot;1 year ago&quot; or more and still no fix. And people keep echoing &quot;this still hasn&#39;t been fixed?&quot; and no responses from anyone at Appcelerator with guidance.</p>
<p>When I love Appcelerator, I LOVE IT. But when I hate it, IT IS THE BANE OF MY EXISTENCE.</p>
<p>I feel like I am often left with no place to turn. And I am left with no choice but to spend hours upon hours step by step trying to narrow down the problem by painful trial and error. Usually my entire productive momentum, along with my enthusiasm, is totally sapped by the end and I&#39;ve lost a couple days of productivity. As the only developer working on mobile in the company, I can&#39;t afford to do that.</p>
<p>If it happened once… fine. But it&#39;s just happened too many times. And this last time was just the last straw.</p>
<p>My question was bad? Maybe. But there is no good way to describe it. Runs in debug&#x2F;run but not deploy. Nothing else is really relevant. If it works in run then it should work on deploy. That was my feeling and confirmed with a friend who does a lot of professional development with Appcelerator. (he says he&#39;s had similar frustrations with PhoneGap also, since he&#39;s done both… but we&#39;ll see)</p>
<p>Look I believed in the platform… I think it&#39;s a great concept. I have done development on all kinds of languages and platforms. I have been getting more and more into JavaScript for everything… eventually envisioning the world that is NodeJS on the server, JS on the client, and JS for mobile. Beautiful. Re-using objects from one to the other.</p>
<p>But at this point my frustration cup runneth over and I can&#39;t take it anymore.</p>
<p>Sorry, don&#39;t mean to start WW3. Sorry for my comment about the community, but the rest I will not apologize for.</p>

										<p><p>Well, IMHO, you&#39;re right about the rest, most of the people experience similar things. They (Appcelerator team) know all this, we&#39;ll have to wait a bit and see if there will be change. I think they should triple their efforts to make platform stable and bug-free. Now they have very strong competition, Adobe is known for quality products, we can expect the same from PhoneGap.</p>
<p>Now, think about average Joe The JS Programmer, he tries Titanium and thinks - OK, it&#39;s cool, but I played a bit with it and some things didn&#39;t work, API is okay, but could be more practical, some things were hard to find in doc, etc. On the other hand he tries PhoneGap and thinks - well, it&#39;s not so cool as Titanium, but everything works great here, documentation is fabulous, community has some top class experts … which one will average Joe The JS Programmer choose?</p>
<p>From engineering and management point of view … unstable and immature platform is not preferable no matter of (cool) features it has, too much time is spent on finding workarounds, isolating bugs, finding working examples, things in documentation, etc.</p>

										<p><p>Ivan has many good points as always!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been pleading to Appcelerator to focus more on fixing critical bugs than features since I&#39;ve started using it about version 1.4, without any luck. There is also a lot of missing documentation, sometimes you&#39;ll need to look trough Kitchensink and the QA in hopes for some hints on how to do things…</p>
<p>Anyway, I feel like you do, but still, even with the bugs, I think I would have used a lot more time coding an app in Objective-C.</p>
<p>Titanium has more bugs than Cocoa, but is a lot faster to build.<br>Phonegap has less bugs and better documentation, but is a lot slower to run.</p>
<p>That&#39;s why I like Titanium, it gives me the performance I need with the language and fast development I love.</p>

										<p><p>Jason, were not measuring who&#39;s is bigger here…. I think what Alberto is suggesting is that maybe you&#39;re giving up too fast. Personally, I&#39;m very hapy with Appcelerator - and you can look me up in Q&amp;A - I ask a lot of questions and encounter more then a few corners - but I do my best to overcome them and find a solution, because I know, at the end of the day - it&#39;s worth it.</p>

										<p><p>Maybe. I&#39;m not saying I for sure won&#39;t be back. And you can say I told you so then. But I&#39;m ready to try another ballfield.</p>
<p>One thing… if I come back or not. Appcelerator should take note of the new PhoneGap:Build cloud platform that eliminates the need to make sure you&#39;ve got all the up to date SDKs on your computer by compiling it in the cloud. That is pretty awesome.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m all for testing and trying different things - that&#39;s how I know I make the right decision - and that&#39;s true not only for the platform, but also for the code you write.</p>
<p>One more thing I think you should take into consideration is Appcelerator&#39;s latest acquisition of PracticleCode: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;appcelerator-acquires-particlecode&#x2F; </p>
<p>As for cloud building - I kind of see it as a disadvantage - I like the fact that my machine does the building and that I has access to the native source if I need to - I sometimes find myself open the code from the build folder in xCode and compiling from there…</p>

										<p><p>Cloud building seems like a two-edged sword.  On the one hand, it has the potential to mean you can create targets your own development machine cannot.  Such as build an iOS target from a Windows machine, or a Blackberry build from an OSX machine.</p>
<p>On the other hand, not everyone will be comfortable with their source being shipped off somewhere else and the implications it has.  Also, even if you can build for other targets you are faced with harder debugging.</p>
<p>The only way I can think of to &quot;debug&quot; an iOS app under Windows would be to litter the code with info() and debug() statements to the console (as we did in Ti Developer days) then run the Windows version of the iPhone Configuration Utility, hook up the device using USB, and use the console tab to view the messages displayed.</p>
