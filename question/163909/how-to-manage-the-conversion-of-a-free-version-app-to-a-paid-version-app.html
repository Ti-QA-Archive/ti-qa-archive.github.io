			<h3 id="hello-friends-">Hello friends.</h3>
<p>I have a question. It could be the most asked question since AppStore exists but here I go. I want to submit an application which has some iAds on his Windows and which I have to remove if the final user pay $1 dolar (really, I have to remove them and give some other features to user). Now, how should I manage that conversion? There are two ways: -&gt; Detect in the app code that the user has paid $1 and hide iAds (iAd.hide(), the same for the rest of the features) | OR -&gt; Should I build two applications, one as free version and another as paid versión?. Thanks in advance, I will be very grateful for your answer.</p>

										<p><p>I am with @Stephen, you create one version and have an in-app-purchase to upgrade the app to more stuff or no advertising.</p>
<p>When using the in-app-purchasing solutions you offer the user one or more &#39;extras&#39; this list comes from an api call to Apple (or Google), it returns the list of available extras you have specified in the app store entry for that product.  It returns back a name or a code, using that you enable or download those features or content and mark the app as now having that option in properties for example.</p>
<p>The user from that point onwards on that device gains that option (they can add it to any other device on THAT apple ID without further charge).  They MUST be offered a button to restore previous purchases - on that info you enable those features they have purchased.  With iOS you should also request an API receipt from Apple to confirm the purchase is valid (think checksum).</p>
<p>This way your users ONLY get what you wanted, the prices are controlled per app in the app store entry you edit.  You just need to note which they app has and make it available each time they use the app without requiring any further checks (as you will have already done them).</p>
<p>They are happy and you are happy.</p>
