							<p>Yes you could do by implementing in-app purchases with the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;StoreKit_Module_In-App_Purchase_Testing">StoreKit Module</a>.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

							<p>I don&#39;t really see where you are getting with these questions, but let&#39;s see if I can answer them anyway.</p>
<p>Since paid apps and in-app purchases are enforced by the same body (Apple or Google depending on the platform), you cannot implement in-app purchases if you cannot charge for apps in the country you are in. </p>
<p>This in NOT a Titanium issue, this is enforced at the platform level. Even if you developed your application using ObjectiveC or Java, you would still be faced with the same problem. </p>
<p>In-app purchases are not tailored to trial version. In fact, that model is not very much used on the stores. What you usually see are <em>&quot;lite&quot;</em>version of an app and prompting the user to purchase the <em>pro</em> version on the app store.</p>
<p>What in-app purchases are generally used for is to sell additional content (think extra levels on angry birds, music on iTubes or Magazines editions, etc) </p>
<p>Your use case, where your users are redirected to your website in order to purchase the app in not permitted on the app stores. Because what you are trying to do here is to go around Apple and Google to make your sale. They do not allow that, <strong>every</strong> transaction had to go through their infrastructure and they will collect a 30% fee in the process.</p>
<p>Also, I strongly suggest that you read some documentation on the matter, this would allow you to have a better grasp on some of the general concepts on in-app purchases in general. Thus facilitating your approach in the future.</p>
<p>I hope I made things a little clearer for you</p>

										<p><p>Whether you add the ability for your user to purchase a 3$ application or a house. You will still have to implement in-app purchases. There is no degree of complexity based on the amount you want to charge.</p>
<p>You either make it work, or you don&#39;t.</p>

										<p><p>It is as if you don&#39;t want to understand.</p>
<p>Whether your app does a one time bill thing or even a full shopping cart. There will come a time, where you are going to have &quot;commerce&quot; dedicated code. And that code has to be written no matter what your app does.</p>

										<p><p>That will not be possible no. But I don&#39;t know if google Wallet are the same as the Google Play&#39;s purchase mechanism. Normally, if users can buy apps on the app store, they can buy stuff inside the apps.</p>
<p>While PayPal and credit card are accepted inside apps, they can&#39;t be used for in-app purchases. Only commerce (think Amazon or another merchant)</p>
