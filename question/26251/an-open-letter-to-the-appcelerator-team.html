			<h1>An open letter to the Appcelerator team</h1>

		<section>
			<p>I guess this is an open letter to the Appcelerator team. I love the concept behind Titanium mobile, and we are some way down the line in developing our first iPhone app using the product, but recently we have been having some problems. Firstly SDK version 1.2 was a washout as far as we were concerned - we just couldn&#39;t get anything to run, not even KitchenSink (we develop on macbook pro running osx 10.6), on any version of the iPhone SDK. Now we have Titanium Mobile SDK 1.3, and we still have plenty of issues. The accompanying KitchenSink just won&#39;t compile, so we have reverted to a previous version, which will work up to iPhone SDK 3.1.3, but not with SDK 3.2 (Nib file problem). Our own app, which was working fine with mobile SDK 1.1.2, now has fatal SQLLite errors when we run it (no changes on our part). We really need to know if this product is going to help us to develop commercial apps. At the moment I would say no, and I will not commit to upgrading our subscriptions to Pro or Enterprise unless I have some confidence that these issues can be resolved. At this moment we are close to cutting our losses and reverting to Objective-C.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>David Lavery - CEO, Smartworks IT</p>
<p>Postscript:<br>Many thanks for the advice, Kevin. Great improvement. Our remaining issue is that we cannot get a mobile app to run against the iPhone SDK 3.2. We get: 2010-05-18 12:02:57.002 test3[35933:207] Failed to load NSMainNibFile MainWindow_ipad. Any ideas? We can get the Kitchen Sink iPad app to work fine, and for now we are working with SDK 3.1.3 for mobile.</p>

							<p>Unfortunately I have to agree with you David. I loved Titanium and still do. Every time Appcelerator announces a new release, I&#39;m so excited and I bet I am one of the first to download and try it immediately. But with the later releases, 1.2 and 1.3, along with new great features added, the number of bugs are not reduced. Sometimes I had to look at every line of the log to &quot;guess&quot; where come the issue, the other times I had to make some dirty &quot;hacks&quot; in the code to get it works but that is not really what I would like to do. Furthermore, getting help in the Q&amp;A forum is so difficult since it is not topic-style so that I could easily locate where to find the same issue. Search function does not work well unless I type the exact phrase - which is in some case impossible. These are several reasons that make me hesitate to invest 100% in Titanium such as buying a Mac for iPhone development or subscribe to the Professional Plan. Anyway, it&#39;s now 4.30 am, I&#39;m writing this after working on a weird bug for more than 6 hours. </p>
<p>Things will change, that is for sure, but I hope Appcelerator will soon find a way to fully test every release in the future. Personally, I prefer a complete test release with less features to a release that has many new great features but not fully tested.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

							<p>Hello gentlemen,</p>
<p>I&#39;m sorry to hear that you&#39;ve run into issues with the latest version of Titanium.  We&#39;d like to help you get over the hump with the 1.3 release if we can.  The first thing I would try to get the Kitchen Sink running is to create a new 1.3 project, and copy over the Resources directory of the 1.3.x Kitchen Sink into this new project.  With your own project, that is another thing I would suggest, also - try creating a fresh 1.3 project and moving over your existing code into the new project.</p>
<p>While we have many hundreds of apps and developers encountering success using Titanium (pro and community users alike), rest assured that our desire and goal is for 100% of our developers to have a positive experience with our product.  Let&#39;s get to the bottom of the issues you are having.</p>

							<p>I think Ti folks don&#39;t have enough time to do complete testing for their upgrades. </p>
<p>Most of my frustrations did disappear after I removed everything in &quot;&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&quot; &amp; &quot;~&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&quot; , then do a fresh reinstall. </p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
