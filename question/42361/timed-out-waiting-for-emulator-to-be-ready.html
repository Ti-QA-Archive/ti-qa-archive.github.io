			<p>Is there a way to increase the timeout with Appcelerator waiting for the Android emulator to start up? Mine takes slightly longer than it should (call it Antivirus or something-or-other) and it only launches successfully every 3&#x2F;4 times that I try to start it.</p>

							<div><p>I increased the timeout by modifying <em>C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Titanium\mobilesdk\win32\1.4.0\android\builder.py</em></p>

</code></pre><p>but that still did not fix my problem.<br>My emulator would never start, but I read a post that said to copy ANDROID_SDK\platform-tools\adb.exe into my ANDROID_SDK\tools folder.  That allowed my emulator to start but titanium could not find the device.</p>
<p>I copied <strong>ANDROID_SDK\platform-tools\AdbWinApi.dll</strong> and <strong>AdbWinUsbApi.dll</strong> into <strong>ANDROID_SDK\tools</strong> and <em>FINALLY</em> was able to view my helloworld app</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;m on a mac, so I went to the terminal and put this in:</p>
<p><code>titanium config android.emulatorStartTimeout 0</code></p>
<p>That will make it wait forever, but the emulator never properly started, so the problem is elsewhere (for me anyway).</p>

							<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>The only thing I&#39;ve found to work is to run up a cmd or shell prompt and run:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">./adb <span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">kill</span>-<span class="hljs-keyword">server</span> &amp;&amp; ./adb <span class="hljs-keyword">start</span>-<span class="hljs-keyword">server</span> &amp;&amp; ./adb devices</span>
</code></pre><p>when I experience a problem. It tends to only occur when I have too many programs running at once ( ie am short on Memory, disk, CPU or timeslice etc ) </p>

										<p><p>yes, sure it was three years ago, but this worked for me! I&#39;ve spent, well, more hours than I am willing to admit trying to get an app to run or debug in an android emulator with no success at all (until I got the tip about GenyMotion - but that wont&#39; run directly from the Studio.)<br>I had this idea that perhaps the Titanium 3.2 would fix my emulator woes, but no luck. Gregor&#39;s tip however resulted in success and made my day. Thanks!</p>

							<p>@Albert, you have the platform 4 (API 1.6) installed installed? It is needed for building. You might also have a stuck <code>adb</code> process or it&#39;s not responding correctly which is a common occurrence for the <code>adb</code> server.</p>
<p>What version of the Android tooling are you using and how recently did you install the Android tools and platforms. If it&#39;s been in the last couple of weeks. You may need to get a current CI build to handle the name change that Google did.</p>
<p>Our continuous integration (CI) system provides updated builds approximately 30 minutes or less after a change has been committed to github. Please refer to our <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;doc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;get_continuous_builds">Continuous Builds for Download</a> guide for obtaining one for your platform.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the suggestions.</p>
<p>I installed everything a week ago. I&#39;m running titanium developer 1.2.1 which now (automatically?) updated the SDK to 1.4 I believe (where can I check that anyway?). </p>
<p>At least I can choose 1.4 from the project edit screen, but it doesn&#39;t make any difference.</p>
<p>I looked at your continuous build for download guide but I don&#39;t have any of the dirs (&#x2F;programdata, windows 7) which are mentioned.</p>
<p>I also killed the adb.process a couple of times and retried. Tried different projects (kitchen sink, and a hello world). Still no luck.</p>

							<p>I had the same problem, but solution was not listed here : the problem came from my user home dir which had accent (i&#39;m french).. Android sdk doesn&#39;t like that as he&#39;s using some core file access APIs that do not support extended charsets. Use only core ascii chars to spell you windows user name.</p>

							<p>There is an eclipse setting not exposed by the TitaniumStudio that will do this for you.  In your workspace create a file: .metadata&#x2F;.plugins&#x2F;org.eclipse.core.runtime&#x2F;.settings&#x2F;com.android.ide.eclipse.ddms.prefs</p>
<p>This file needs one line:<br><code>com.android.ide.eclipse.ddms.timeOut=150000</code></p>
<p>If you need more than 150000ms increase that value.</p>

							<p>This worked for me (Mac OS X 10.8.5, Titanium SDK 3.1.3.GA):</p>
<p>Let the emulator starts and unlock it.</p>
<p>Open the Terminal (Mac):</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">cd [android-sdk-location]/platform-tools
./adb <span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">kill</span>-<span class="hljs-keyword">server</span>
./adb <span class="hljs-keyword">start</span>-<span class="hljs-keyword">server</span></span>
</code></pre><p>If you use Windows go to the Command Prompt:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">cd [android-sdk-location]\platform-tools
adb <span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">kill</span>-<span class="hljs-keyword">server</span>
adb <span class="hljs-keyword">start</span>-<span class="hljs-keyword">server</span></span>
</code></pre><p>Clean and build the project (Win and Mac).</p>

							<p>If you are still not able to find a work around , try following :</p>
<p>Open Terminal :</p>
<ul>
<li>cd <strong>path to your titanium project ( eg : &#x2F;Users&#x2F;namespace&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;Titanium_Studio_Workspace&#x2F;Test )</strong></li>
<li>type <code>titanium build --platform android --build-only</code></li>
<li>type <code>adb install -r &amp;#x2F;Users&amp;#x2F;namespace&amp;#x2F;Documents&amp;#x2F;Titanium_Studio_Workspace&amp;#x2F;Test&amp;#x2F;build&amp;#x2F;android&amp;#x2F;bin&amp;#x2F;app.apk</code></li>

<p>This cant possibly work. The &quot;build only&quot; option guarantees that he emulator won&#39;t launch. All this does is compile.</p>
