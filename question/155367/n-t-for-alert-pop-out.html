							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Newline characters should be encoded using <strong>\n</strong> as you already appear to know, so the problem must be in the code you use to display the results of your database calls.</p>
<p>The <strong>\n</strong> encoding does not work everywhere so you should test in a label or an alert box first, then start testing the the results of your select statements.</p>
<p>Try this as an initial test</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">alert<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-string">"Line 1\nLine 2"</span>)</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>This should display as follows;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Line <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
Line <span class="hljs-number">2</span>
</code></pre><p>If this works then so far so good.</p>
<p>Try adding debug lines from your select statement - for example (adjust for your own variables);</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// assumes that fields1 holds at least two lines</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// example; line a\nline b</span>
Ti.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">'test1: '</span> + fields1);
</code></pre><p>Do this output in the console look something like this?</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">test1: <span class="hljs-built_in">line</span> <span class="hljs-operator">a</span>
<span class="hljs-built_in">line</span> b
</code></pre>

										<p><p>The code was designed to explain the following;</p>
<ul>
<li>A label is displayed with a temporary string</li>
<li>A button is displayed that you click<ul>
<li>The label is reset to empty so we know anything this function does is going to update the label with something new</li>
<li>Your multiple line text string is stored in a variable so we may test it, new lines are added with the <strong>\n</strong> sequence as you rightly require</li>
<li>I open up a test database (not yours so I do not corrupt anything)</li>
<li>I remove my test table if it exists - makes testing easier</li>
<li>I recreate my test table</li>
<li>I then insert the test string into the new table</li>
<li>I then list the ONLY record in the test table back using a basic select statement</li>
<li>I place the results of the test field that should contain the test str into the text property of our label</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This will now display the next with line breaks as you wanted to see, having been stored inside a database and then retrieved from the database - all correctly.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Malcolm, i really appreciate your great help!! But i still need a bit of help from you!</p>
<p>Because what i want to achieve is to create a tableView with different types of questions in each row. So for example, when the user click on the first row, it will show them the full question for question1. Similarly, when the user clicked on the second row, it will show them the full question for question 2 and etc.</p>
<p>My code allows me to do that already but what i&#39;m facing is that i the SQLite manager can&#39;t recognise \n \t when i put it in the database. So i&#39;m think if there is any logic i can use on your way which will be able to allow me to achieve what i want? </p>
<p>I&#39;m really very sorry for constantly asking you for help. But i really sincerely appreciate and your kindness and efforts in trying to help me get my problems solved. Once again, thank you :)</p>

										<p><p>I am confused - your question started off as &quot;how do I include <strong>\n</strong> in the database and then display it afterwards?&quot;, this is what my code samples explained - how to add the syntax into the database and how to retrieve that.</p>
<p>Are you now saying that the question is actually &quot;How do I add <strong>\n</strong> in the Firefox plug-in <strong>SQLite Manager</strong>?&quot;  If so that means you have only just introduced a rather key piece of information a day after the original question was asked.</p>
