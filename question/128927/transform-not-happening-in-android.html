			<h1>Transform not happening in Android.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I can make an object transform using rotate, and scale as long but animating them doesn&#39;t tween.</p>
<p>My code was :</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> bInit</span> = Ti.UI.create2DMatrix().scale(<span class="hljs-number">0.5</span>);
<span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> bObject</span> = Ti.UI.createImageView({...,transfom : bInit});
<span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> bScale</span> = Ti.UI.create2DMatrix().scale(<span class="hljs-number">4</span>);
<span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> bAnim</span> = Ti.UI.createAnimation({...,transform : bScale});
bObject.animate(bAnim);
</code></pre><p>No love.  No tweens.  Just an instant change.</p>
<p>The dot dot dot (ellipsis) represents duration, opacity, and other bits non essential to the question of, why don&#39;t my transforms tween?</p>
<p>Thanks for any insight!</p>

							<p>animations in android does not works as expected (specially if you tried on ios before). For example, I remember that opacity can&#39;t be animated, remove from your animation properties and try again. And always set the duration property, in android is a must.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m currently animating opacity fine in Android.<br>Transforms do not animate regardless of how they&#39;re added to the object.<br>I can go bObject.transform or bObject({transform: blah}) and either way, I get no love.</p>
<p>I can animate opacity, and position, but I cannot use any transforms to rotate or scale.<br>Anybody have any ideas or insight?</p>

										<p><p>I know this doesn&#39;t get you closer to a solution, but I&#39;ve been using the nightly build of 1.7.6 for over a week now and haven&#39;t run into any new bugs. You might want to try that. The 1.8.x nightly didn&#39;t work well for me, but you might even want to try that one, too. Unfortunately it seems as though the Appcelerator team cares very little about Android and even less about Android API bugs that only affect things like animations, colors, borders, opacity, etc.</p>

										<p><p>Nightly build, eh?  I wasn&#39;t aware of such a thing.<br>Are you saying the 1.7.6 nightly allows these transforms in Android?</p>
