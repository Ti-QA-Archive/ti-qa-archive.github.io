			<h1>Documentation for layout, heights + tableview events.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>First off, this appears to be a great product, I&#39;ve been hacking away with it for a few days now, but a few things have irked me, mainly around the lack of documentation.. I&#39;d love to see an O&#39;Reilly book on it !!</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I can&#39;t find any documentation about the layout:  attribute, specifically, I think I understand how layout:&#39;vertical&#39;  works, ie, it&#39;s like a non-floating div, as opposed to an absolutely positioned div.. but I&#39;d rather not make guesses when trying to build a real-world app. Looking for the attribute under the View documentation, it&#39;s not even listed. So am I using a hack, or is it just undocumented ?</p>
</li>
<li><p>I can&#39;t find any documentation how height: auto works, sometimes it does what I think, and expands to fit the remaining space, othertimes not.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There are Events listed for TableView that just don&#39;t fire, any of them that I can see.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Sure, I&#39;ve seen alot of comments about &quot;look at the examples&quot;, but that only shows me what happens when I use the same code, it doesn&#39;t tell me why certain things happen, and doesn&#39;t tell me what alternative things I can do, or give pointers when it goes wrong.</p>
<p>Also, Googling stuff to find solutions I end up finding old solutions using the old version of Titanium, specifically stuff at http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.codestrong.com</p>
<p>It&#39;d be great to have a big banner saying &quot;1.0 users ignore this it&#39;s out of date&quot;.. because there have been so many changes to the API and because there&#39;s so little documentation people are going to be trying out old unworking code and wasting their time.</p>

							<div><p>I second this. By now I&#39;m pulling all my hair out trying to figure out how the layout stuff works by trial and error and it really is a big waste of time. The API docs are hopeless and as the original question states, a lot of other examples out there are out of date.</p>

							<p>+1 understanding how all of this works is really a nightmare and a great waste of time. And if you think you have understood how this works with Android … try your application with IPhone and be sure the way the application works will be totally different !</p>

							<p>I&#39;m very disapointed with the way how window.open won&#39;t fit screen space. I vote for this question and really need answer.</p>
<p>Edit: I have found my way !!! use this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> nextwin</span> = Ti.UI.createWindow({
    modal: <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
})
</code></pre><p>then newtwin will fit the screen. You can use fullscreen if you want but you will lose the top bar :)</p>
<p>For tableview event, kitchenSink have a lot of example. The mainly way to have event and datas are this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">
var rows = [
    {<span class="hljs-string">title:</span> <span class="hljs-string">"the title one"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">myattribute:</span> <span class="hljs-string">'views/myview1.js'</span>},
    {<span class="hljs-string">title:</span> <span class="hljs-string">"the title two"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">myattribute:</span> <span class="hljs-string">'views/myview2.js'</span>},
    {<span class="hljs-string">title:</span> <span class="hljs-string">"the title three"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">myattribute:</span> <span class="hljs-string">'views/myview3.js'</span>},
];

var mainTableView = Titanium.UI.createTableView({
<span class="hljs-label">    data:</span> rows,
<span class="hljs-label">    top:</span> <span class="hljs-number">10</span>,
<span class="hljs-label">    height:</span> <span class="hljs-string">'auto'</span>,
<span class="hljs-label">    separatorStyle:</span> Ti.UI.iPhone.TableViewSeparatorStyle.NONE
});

mainTableView.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, function(e){
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (e.rowData.target)    {
        var nextwin = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
<span class="hljs-label">            url:</span>e.rowData.myattribute,
<span class="hljs-label">            title:</span>e.rowData.title,
<span class="hljs-label">                        modal:</span> <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>,
<span class="hljs-label">            backgroundColor:</span> <span class="hljs-string">'#000'</span>,
        });
        nextwin.open({<span class="hljs-string">animated:</span><span class="hljs-literal">true</span>});
    }
});
</code></pre><p>rowData taken from event have every information you need. My documentation is KitchenSink. Website is very in late…</p>

										<p><p>Agreed. Once again this is just one example of layout issues. What we really need is a pointing in the right direction to some detailed documentation on expected behavior for various layout properties and such. We need a broader understanding, not just a few examples.</p>

										<p><p>I am struggling to determine what is the size of the component after the layout is complete. But I don&#39;t know when the layout of component is over. I have a component which I add it to some other component. i call it as working pane. I want to know the size right after it is opened. But so far no luck. Sometimes I get the data and application works fine and sometimes it fails to get the size. I am calculating the size on windows event. Android emulator API 3.0 and Ti-SDK 1.7</p>
