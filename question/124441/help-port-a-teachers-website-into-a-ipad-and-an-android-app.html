		<section>
			<p>I do not have any experience creating apps for neither iPhone&#x2F;iPad nor Android devices.  I want to convert my dad&#39;s website (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grkraj.org">GRKRAJ.ORG</a>) that he has created for his students (I help with my limited skills maintain his website) and create an App for iPad&#x2F;iPhone and an App for the Android devices.  Can anybody help me?</p>

							<p>After looking at the content, and taking into account the fact that you are new to this and will have to learn a framework of some kind, I&#39;d point you towards PhoneGap.  More target platforms (6 vs 2 {no, blackberry doesn&#39;t &#39;count}).  Your content is already in HTML.  Even though Titanium supports web views, you will have to write up code to get TO the web views.</p>
<p>The content is rather wide (great demonstration graphics in the sites) and lends itself more towards a tablet distribution over a phone display, although, it could be adapted for the smaller displays.</p>
<p>Your father has collected a lot of great information over the years.</p>

							<p>This website is free and I am paying for the hosting fees - since I live here in the US and can afford it.  This is meant for his students and others who are studying similar subjects.  He thought this might be the best way to disseminate the knowledge he has acquired over his teaching career.  And no, I also am not looking to profit from this.   I am just the &quot;messenger&quot; here :)</p>

							<p>Thank you, Devin.  I sent you an email with my contact info.  Please let me know if you received it.  We really appreciate your help.  I thank you all for looking.  I hope to learn from this process and hope to keep the apps (if successful) updated to the best of my abilities.  Thanks again.</p>

							<p>I did not hear from Devin.  Can anybody be kind enough to help me?  I downloaded Eclipse and Android libraries and was able to compile a simple HelloWorld apk.  I do not have a Mac - so I guess I am out of luck with regards to an iPad app.  If anybody can help me with either Android or iOS app, I would really appreciate it.  Thank you.</p>

										<p><p>Devin, I clicked on your name, which took me to your profile, then clicked on DevMail and that is where I entered my contact info.  I also went to your personal website (via LinkedIn) and on the forum&#39;s Contact Us page, also sent an email with my contact info.  I hope either of these two emails will reach you :)</p>

							<p>Hiâ¦ Devin never did get in touch with me.  I hope he is doing OK.  If anyone would like to help (I am still catching up to Android - since I have a Window PC (which can be used to develop Android apps) - but no MAC), I would really appreciate it.  I really need some help.  Please let me know.  I do not have a lot of money, if it takes cash to get some help, I am OK with it as well.</p>
