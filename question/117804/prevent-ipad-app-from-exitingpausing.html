			<h1>Prevent iPad app from exiting/pausing</h1>

		<section>
			<p>We&#39;ve run across a few iPad apps (MenuPad, MailChimp, etc.) that intercept the home button so the app just restarts when it&#39;s pressed. We&#39;re developing an enterprise level app and need the same type of functionality. How can we achieve this with Titanium?</p>

							<p>It was my understanding that Apple was even more anal-retentive about intercepting the home button as they were the volume keys.  So I am surprised if any apps in the app store are allowed to do this, even if they are designed for a specific purpose&#x2F;environment like MenuPad (which I was not aware of previously).</p>
<p>Thus I thought the only apps which would get by with it our in-house enterprise apps, which of course is what you are developing anyway.  But my point is that this liokely isn&#39;t a common request because I always thought doing it would mean an automatic rejection from the app store.</p>
<p>I suspect to truly intercept and usurp for your own purposes would require a custom <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;module_ios.html">module</a> using objc code.  However, you may be able to get by using a technique the kitchen sink demonstrates.  Try running kitchen sink on your iOS device then put it in the background.  After 3 seconds, you will see a popup asking if you want to relaunch it.</p>
<p>The 3 second delay is simply because that is what kitchen sink is doing.  You could make it immediate or a 100 milliseconds or whatever, then instead of asking the user just relaunch it.  Take a look near the end of the kitchen sink <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;KitchenSink&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;KitchenSink&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;app.js">app.js</a> around line 342, and also at its <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;KitchenSink&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;KitchenSink&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;bg.js">bg.js</a> background service handler for ideas.</p>
<p>If you want to truly usurp the home button, try a web search to find the objc code to do it.  If you can find that, post back here and I&#39;ll make a little module for you.</p>
