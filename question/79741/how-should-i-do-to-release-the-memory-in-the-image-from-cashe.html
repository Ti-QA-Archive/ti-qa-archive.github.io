		<section>
			<p>I am developing the book that consists of 102 images by using scrollableView. However, it worries due to the problem of collecting of the image in cache, and will stop before long. </p>
<p>Therefore, whenever the page is sent, I want to release the image on the previous page. However, there is no one like &quot;release&quot; in titanium.</p>
<p>How should I do to release the memory in the image?</p>

							<p>Yes it is possible to say that only the current and previous and next pages are loaded, then every image&#x2F;view after that has a image = &quot;&quot;</p>
<p>You can also, write classes for it to only draw the page you open and maybe a class that release any page that goes away or isn&#39;t visible.</p>
<p>as for the window closed stuff that Farid is talking about.<br>it should work that way.</p>
<p>in Obj-c every element that is created gets a &quot;retain&quot; count (you actually call it with retain in obj-c), but when these get loaded in a master view&#x2F;window (window url in this case) then the &quot;master&quot; window should hold the retain for all its childs, and when the window gets closed&#x2F;released the retain goes to 0 and obj-c calles Dealloc automatically.</p>
<p>But in obj-c whenever you do it this way, so create an element and add it to a view you also should release the same object straight away cause the retain count is hold on by the master view&#x2F;window, I didn&#39;t have a look at the Titanium git or code so I don&#39;t know how they handle these things.<br>also I know C++&#x2F;C# and now am learning obj-c too so I&#39;m not even sure how to code in obj-c yet.</p>
<p>As far as this explanation goes I know that in Titanium whenever you add views to a different &quot;master&quot; view and close the &quot;master&quot; view it does release the memory for all it&#39;s childs.</p>
<p>But I don&#39;t know how that goes in a scrollable view…</p>
<p>otherwise here are some topics that might help:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;86381&#x2F;dynamic-scrollable-view-with-3-views-at-a-time</p>
<p>and a code im working on at the moment (this definitly a work in progress but maybe you can figure something out)<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;rVU6uQfU</p>

							<p>Either you optimize the ScrollableViewClass or you have do overwrite the nonvisible views with an empty view. I made an pro supoort ticket for that , but this may take some weeks to be fixed.</p>
<p>so if you feel like coding some objective c, fork the code on github and refactor it there ..</p>

							<p>Same issue with us. It&#39;s a huge deal. How should we release the memory taken by the image objects? I&#39;ve even tried putting the ScrollableView in a window and close the window. Apparently the garbage collector is not acting on it and doesn&#39;t release the memory.</p>
<p>I am starting to think that the only plausible way, at this moment, is to have them all in a separate js file in a separate context. If the window is closed in this case, it might actually release the memory (I am hoping). Haven&#39;t tried it though. Even if it works, it&#39;s extremely more restrictive than a properly implemented garbage collector!</p>
