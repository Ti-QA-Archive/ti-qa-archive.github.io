		<section>
			<p>Hello</p>
<p>EDIT: On the simulator it all goes super fast, just on the device is the crappy speed. I knew there could be a slight of difference in speed, but this is a bit too much difference in my opinion.</p>
<p>I want to know how i can make my app faster. I have 500 lines I have to insert into my tableView, and it takes 25 seconds.. This isn&#39;t normal is it?</p>
<p>What can i do to make my app run smooth? </p>
<p>This is my code: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pastie.org&#x2F;1884471</p>
<p>It&#39;s quite urgent.</p>
<p>I&#39;m using iPhone SDK 4.2 and Titanium SDK 1.6.2. With this I&#39;m using an SQLite database.<br>Can this problem be because of the SQLite database?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>Tjeu</p>

							<p>my suggestion is to attempt to isolate were in your application the bottleneck is an then attempt to optimize the code.</p>
<p>you are doing alot of string manipulation and database stuff repeatedly to create each row item.  you also do not have a className on you rows, which is a must.</p>
<p>If it were me, I would strip the row creation method down to bare minimum, create functions for alot of the stuff you are doing and then start adding the function calls in, one by one until you determine what is causing the performance issue</p>

							<p>Why are you using a unique className for each row? </p>
<p>Do they have different layouts? </p>
<p>Think on a className like on a template. You set this up and the os will use the same layout to render all of the rows that are sharing it.</p>
<p>Try to use clear dimensions for the elements inside the row (where is possible). Each &quot;auto&quot; will force the device to make some calculations, this eats cpu.</p>
<p>And finally if you don&#39;t manage to get the results you are looking for use this gist made by Dawson to create a table that adds more rows on scrolling. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;810391<br>However this will break your search so you will have to figure out how to fix it :) ( hint: cache the results from the db in a json object).</p>

										<p><p>Well I already did it with a JSON object (result.push{row1: rows.fieldbyname(&#39;row1&#39;), row2: ….}, but didn&#39;t improve anything. Also the removing &#39;auto&#39; and changing it to static values didn&#39;t help :(.</p>
<p>It shouldn&#39;t be normal that 500 records takes 25-30 seconds to load?</p>

							<p>How about doing it the same way Apple and Google are handling tableviews in their AppStores: Don&#39;t add all rows at once. Only add 50 for example and then do &quot;dynamic adding of further rows&quot;…like you can see in the KitchenSink examples &#x2F; source. </p>

										<p><p>The search bar won&#39;t be of use then, I need to search through the results with the search bar. Or is there a way to work around it?</p>

										<p><p>You can do the same with search bar…the search bar calls a specific search-function, right?<br>And you then get a result set of tablerows from the search….and then you can treat that result set the same way as it is done in the kitchensink example. Whether you dynamically add the rows for the complete amount of rows or just a subset doesn&#39;t matter. You only have to handle it in your functions.</p>

										<p><p>The search bar works with the filter option towards the rows. Also it won&#39;t be possible to have my index on the right side of the screen, or can you work around that too?</p>

										<p><p>Well, you can&#39;t have everything…..if you need to have all rows on screen my suggestion is:</p>
<ul>
<li>use &quot;className:default&quot;</li>
<li>minimize any graphic objects in your table (backgroundImage, any ImageViews inside your rows, rightImage, etc.)</li>
<li>use the javascript date function to find out, which part of building your table takes the most time by setting the start and end date and putting it out on console for example. Maybe you can still optimize your code.</li>
