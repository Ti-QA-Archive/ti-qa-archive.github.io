			<p>Im obviously overlooking something too obvious, but I have been trying to configure my Titanium Studio for 5 days now, and continue to have problems with the Andoid portion.  I program on Xcode just fine and Eclipse just fine, and am so very excited to  being using Titanium Mobile, but I install it, configure it for xcode just fine, but for Android, I just cant get the SDK&#39;s right. </p>
<p>I get one of 2 errors [Titanium SDK Home] The Desktop-SDK root path &#x2F;users&#x2F;johnbexxxxxx&#x2F;library&#x2F;applicationsupport&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;sdk&#x2F;osx&#39; is not a directory…..or I get &quot;Could not locate a Titanium Mobile SDK at the given path&quot;.  Im leaving out the details of the configuration only because I have followed the literature to the word. I have the Android SDK installed at myname&#x2F;android-sdk&#x2F;tools&#x2F;android and have everything updated.  </p>
<p>I tried for several days doing it through the &quot;LEARN&quot; tab, but then decided to use the documentation and the video to do it manually and either way, I cannot get it going. When I do a sample project, the Xcode and iOS Simulator work perfect, but everything on the Android side does nothing.  I click on &quot;preferences&quot; tab and highlight &quot;titanium&quot; and immediately it tells me one of the two messages above depending on which Android-SDK version I choose.  What on earth am i missing?  Is there a bug lately?  </p>
<p>Should I take Eclipse off of my machine?  Im sorry to sound like such a Newb and to be so vague, but it just seems like such a simple process and I dont get the expect results.  If you know of an error that others have been running into please let me know. Or, if you know that the documentation is more accurate than the video than let me know.  Anything before I just give up and go back to Eclipse. I dont want to do that but cant waste anymore time trying the same thing over and over…I think they call that insanity and I think Im so close that I cant see the forest between the trees at this point.</p>
<p>Respectfully,<br>John</p>

							<p><em>The Desktop-SDK root path &#x2F;users&#x2F;johnbexxxxxx&#x2F;library&#x2F;applicationsupport&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;sdk&#x2F;osx&#39; is not a directory</em></p>
<p>This is really a PITA. The Desktop SDK was discontinued, but the install still requires it. Many people post here in these forums with this problem.</p>
<p>Look at http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;129786&#x2F;could-not-locate-a-titanium-desktop-sdk-at-the-given-path.</p>

							<p>have you tried using the widget in the dashboard? Also the wiki has some pretty clear instructions also <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Installing_Studio">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Installing_Studio</a></p>

							<p>Well if I understand that correctly, the Aptana studio can only be used as an Eclipse plugin, but not the Titanium Studio.  Im building Mobile apps and have installed the Titanium studio and have started my app as a &quot;Titanium Mobile project&quot;.  Am i understanding the differences correctly?  Whats the diff. between Aptana Studio and Titanium Studio?  Web design versus mobile design correct?</p>
<p>Thank you,<br>John</p>

							<p>I&#39;m going to say it prematurely but thank you a ton! I wasted 5 days trying to find the answer and not bother the forum people about it. I should have asked on day one!</p>
<p>Thank you again!<br>John</p>

							<p>The link provided by Chaim Krause solved the issue and everything is now working correctly.  I thank you so much.  I should have asked days ago but figured it was just a user error on my part.  If this is a redundant problem it really should be noted in their documentation because if I almost gave up on Appcelerator, and I have a ton of patience, it makes me wonder how many people have actually walked away all together because of this.</p>
<p>Again, may thanks for the link!</p>
