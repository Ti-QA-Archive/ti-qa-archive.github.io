			<p>Can Appcelerator dump all of the videos on this site? They are misleading, and to me looks like its a bait&#x2F;switch tactic to get people to sign up and then pay for support.</p>
<p>Most everything on there is out of date (for example, the demo showing how to post to TwitPic, those files referenced dont even exist).</p>
<p>Also, how about a straight-up &quot;tutorial&quot; section?  </p>

							<p>How &#39;bout you read the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;doc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;get_started">Getting Started Guides</a>? That + KitchenSink taught me everything I know, plus a little help from this Q&amp;A board :)</p>

<p>Seriously, Josh and Scott, they are giving away this tool for free.  Cut them some slack if the <em>free</em> tutorial videos are a bit outdated.  As someone who used the above mentioned items to teach myself (and publish an app already!) I would prefer that the developers keep coding and improving this excellent product instead of updating the videos.</p>

										<p><p>I understand that they&#39;re giving it away for free, and it looks like it can be a great asset to those who dont want to learn Objective C.  </p>
<p>My point, though, is that if you&#39;re giving away a product and it totally deviates from the examples you have posted, then they need to be changed.  I mean seriously, all they have to do is a screengrab while they&#39;re doing a simple project.</p>

							<p>The Kitchen Sink application is your best bet as far as examples go. Not a tutorial per se, but an invaluable resource.</p>

							<p>I came here to post almost the identical comment Josh. Those videos are completely useless. How exactly does one go about learning how to use Titanium? I&#39;m about done with hunting and pecking for a simple How-To.</p>
<p>And Bart, that&#39;s nice. Unfortunately, I&#39;ve no idea how to make use of The Kitchen Sink and as far as I can tell, I need to pay you $200.00 a month for someone to explain it to me or to just read something that&#39;s not hyperbole. Awful.</p>
