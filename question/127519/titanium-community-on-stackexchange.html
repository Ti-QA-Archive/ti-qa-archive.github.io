			<p>I just created a proposal for a <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;area51.stackexchange.com&#x2F;proposals&#x2F;36142&#x2F;titanium?referrer=TSdg3EBXjcuWOd_QE4pDRg2">Titanium community on StackExchange</a>.</p>
<p>I&#39;m tired of the bad questions, angry users and negative attitude. I want a place where good questions and answers are rewarded. Where the search is not useless. Where we can start from scratch, with a solid QA system. I want an unofficial alternative to this QA. With stricter rules on quality and community moderators that control the mess.</p>
<p>Help me achieve this by <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;area51.stackexchange.com&#x2F;proposals&#x2F;36142&#x2F;titanium?referrer=TSdg3EBXjcuWOd_QE4pDRg2">voting on my proposal</a>.</p>

							<div><p>Sindre,<br>I agree with some of your comments although I don&#39;t think the search is useless but has some issues.  I am not sure why the push for unofficial?  Seems providing a user prioritized list of enhancements&#x2F;features to Appcelerator might be a good option versus declaring complete separation from Appcelrator with an unofficial alternative.  I have lots of confidence in Appcelerator and having something outside of the company seems counterproductive IMHO for the community (now we have two places to look for answers).</p>
<p>I am always quite amazed out how responsive the community and employees of Appcelerator are to questions to the community.  Changing venue will not make things perfect (grass is not always greener but just different).</p>
<p>I applaud the courage you have to ask for change but think moving away from the core team&#x2F;company website is not the right move and pushing for specific changes is better.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<div><p>While I&#39;m not for community separation either, the fact is that the current QA is very limited, and miles below StackExchange in both features and quality. There is also a lot of Titanium <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;search?q=titanium">related question on StackOverflow</a>, almost 1300.</p>
<p>To be clear though, this is only to test the waters. If there is no love for this, I won&#39;t pursue it further.</p>
<p>I feel I should mention some important things QA is missing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Useful search</p>
</li>
<li><p>Real question ranking</p>
</li>
<li><p>Community moderators (way too many bad questions)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Being able to edit questions and answers</p>
</li>
<li><p>Only downvoting for users with some points</p>
</li>
<li><p>Question priority based on user rank (active users should get more priority)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Being able to report questions&#x2F;answers&#x2F;users</p>
</li>
<li><p>And a lot more…</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>There is some work going on regarding Q&#x2F;A, maybe we could push some more work :)</p>
