			<h1>Appcelerator Website is Broken</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,<br>First I must say I really enjoy Appcelerator and I enjoy the software, but today, I&#39;m annoyed, very annoyed, so I just have to rant about some things that have annoyed me for a while now.</p>
<p>First of all, I waited for 40 minutes, tweeted @appcelerator a several times, without getting any reasonable response, and now (after the 40 mintues) as it turns out, I missed the webinar, just because I got the incorrect link in my Mail (I guess that is due to the webex system). Speaking of which - I&#39;m from Denmark, and I had to select &quot;Amsterdam&quot; timezone (Copenhagen wasn&#39;t in the list), which is perfectly fine, but it was listed as GMT + 2, which isn&#39;t true. Denmark, Amsterdam and Cairo are GMT+1.<br>I know it was the correct time I was on, and I started attempting joining the Webinar in 8:55 San-francisco time (which was 5 minutes before the webinar should have started..)</p>
<p>Then there is Cocoafish.<br>I&#39;ve been excited about Cocoafish ever since it was announced. So excited in fact, that I&#39;ve been mislead multiple times.<br>Here is what I mean:<br>When I visit: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;appcelerator-cloud-services&#x2F;<br>It says &quot;Cloud Services are encouraged to register for an Appcelerator Account (it’s free).&quot;. I think to myself - great! Click that.<br>I get redirected to a &quot;Confirm your login information&quot; form, where I enter my Appcelerator password and the email is already pre-filled for me.<br>And then:! I am asked to sign up.<br>Well, I guess I have to sign up again for Cocoafish or something like that, so I try to sign up, and now it says that such account already exists, which is probably because it does, because I&#39;m logged already into it. </p>
<p>So. A sign up for for an already signed-up account is pretty much dead end without any chance of actually getting anywhere. Pretty bad UX I&#39;d say. </p>
<p>There are other rants, that I&#39;ll just keep for myself right now, but I would like to ask Appcelerator to please, be a little more verbose, and re-check some of the things you do (like signup forms, or things like that). I know you can&#39;t give out information about things like Cocoafish, but a tweet reassuring that it&#39;s coming soon would be nice. Also, when you hold your webinars, please tweet that they have started. If twitter is bad for you, fine, give me a channel I should check every now and then and I&#39;ll check that when looking for important up-to date information.</p>
<p>In the end, I think Appcelerator is a great product, and I love using it, even though there are a lot of things to do, but the Information flow is pretty bad for Appcelerator at the moment. The forums (or Q&amp;A) don&#39;t really suit the community (in my humble opinion), as well as there are rants about the docs out there (although I&#39;ve seen screenshots of the new ones, and they look awesome), etc. </p>
<p>Regards,<br>Norris.</p>

							<p>Hi Norris,</p>
<p>Sorry you ran into problems with the webinar, and we appreciate your feedback on the web properties.  As you note, we&#39;re trying to unify our navigation quite a bit in conjunction with the upcoming 2.0 release.  We typically also tweet out updates for our webinars through our main Twitter account, but in this instance we did not schedule updates to go out.  We will make sure to do so in the future.</p>
<p>Check back on our developer blog and <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;sap">the SAP announcement page</a> for recordings of the webinars, which we plan to make available ASAP.</p>
