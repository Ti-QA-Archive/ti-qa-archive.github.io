			<h1>Studio Update Install failing on OSX - &#34;locking is not possible in the directory&#34;</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all, I need some help. After a few weeks of vacation inactivity, I started Studio and was told my version was expired. Nothing was in my upgrade url&#39;s so I downloaded and attempted to install the latest version of studio. After downloading and dragging the icon to the application folder, I received an error that I didn&#39;t have permissions on the configuration directory under studio. I ensured my account and admin had read&#x2F;write and now I&#39;m getting a bizare error dialog:<br>&quot;Invalid Configuration Location&quot;, &quot;Locking is not possible int he directory &quot;&#x2F;Applications&#x2F;titanium Studio&#x2F;configuration&#x2F;org.eclipse.osgi&quot;, &quot;A common reason is that the file system or runtime enviornment does not support file locking for that location…&quot;<br>Worse, Studio will not start at all and I can&#39;t go forward or back - I&#39;m dead in the water. Any suggestions? Appreciate any advice.</p>

							<p>You can trash the Studio install and start from scratch, just make sure that you don&#39;t trash your workspace. The default workspace is usually <code>~&amp;#x2F;Documents&amp;#x2F;Titanium Studio Workspace&amp;#x2F;</code>. This should make it so you can reinstall Studio without losing any of your work.</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve run into this issue before on another application built ontop of eclipes, while deleting the application and then reinstalling it is a solution, an easier fix would be to open terminal an enter in the command <strong>sudo chmod 755 -fR &#x2F;Applications&#x2F;titanium Studio</strong> (Use 777 if 755 doesn&#39;t work for you, just note it is not as secure) as this will allow all the folders to have full read write permissions. The next launch you might get a message stating something along the lines of <em>can&#39;t open workspace &#x2F;root&#x2F;(name of workspace location)</em> just change the workspace to the ~&#x2F;Documets&#x2F;(Location of the workspace you&#39;ve been using) I know this sounds like a lot, but is really easy to do and a lot faster than having to reinstall the applicaiton.</p>
