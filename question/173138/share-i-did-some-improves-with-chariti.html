			<h1>[Share] I did some improves with ChariTi</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi everybody, this is just a share post for improved the ChariTi.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mcongrove&#x2F;ChariTi">ChariTi</a> is a great alloy framework, and it&#39;s open source! But  no matter how powerful framework, each person’s habits is always a little different, or that we can not meet the needs of all, ChariTi is not exception. In the course I also found some deficiencies, and therefore had to improve it myself :)</p>
<p>As this framework after I improved, just named: ChariTi-CB, the following are some improved features:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Switch language by manual in the app. The normal situation, if you want to use the i18n feature or support multiple languages in the app, you need to let the user to change the phone’s language setting. For this case in ChariTi-CB, you can just let user to change the language in the app, and it will not affect the phone’s language setting.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Support the animations when switch the page. There is no animation in ChariTi when you switch the page, so I added 4 animations , they are slide left, right, top and bottom.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can change the database name in the core.js file for the app. ChariTi just hard code it in each place when you call the database.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can set whether you need to use the default “Settings” button. ChariTi will add a settings button in the menu or header bar, if there is no settings feature in your app, you can disable it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Improved the APP.log function. ChariTi just can print the text debug messages within APP.log function, I have improved it and support to print the object and you can add the description with it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>By default, ChariTi will save all debug message into database, and I think when we are in the development stage , it don’t need to save all debug messages in database in each time, so I add a setting value for handle it, you can disable or enable this feature.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Improved the auto update function. This is a useful feature in the ChariTi, if you have a server or a website, you can put the configuration file (app.json) into your website, and you just need to update this file, it will be check in the app and auto update the settings what you changed, if you just do some small changed, then the user don’t need to go to app store to download the app again, he can just update the changed by auto download this remote app.json file. There is a “minimumVersion” setting in the ChariTi, if this value is changed, then user cannot update the app by remote configuration file, but there is also no anyways to let user to do in this time, I suppose the app should be popup a box alert user to go to app store or google play to download the new app, so I added two setting field for improve this: “appStoreLink” and “googlePlayLink”. When the  “minimumVersion” changed, user click the alter box’s comfirm button, it will auto redirect to app store or google play to download the app.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Enhance the remove children function. Please consider the following scenarios:<br>There are 4 screens, you need to use the <code>APP.addChild</code> to navigate them: screen1 -&gt; screen2 -&gt; screen3 -&gt; screen4, after you go into screen4, and you want to back to screen2, by default ChariTi just can back one screen with the <code>APP.removeChild()</code> function, or you can use the <code>APP.addChild</code> to add a screen2, but in this way, the controller stack will keep to increase, so we should use the <code>APP.removeChild</code> for remove the screen4 and screen3 after switch back to screen2. In this case, I enhanced the <code>APP.removeChild</code> function to support remove to define screen.</p>
</li>
</ol>
