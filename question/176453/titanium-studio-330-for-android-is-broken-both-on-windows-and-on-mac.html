			<h1>Titanium Studio 3.3.0 for Android is broken both on Windows and on Mac!</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,<br> this is a cry for help with sadness and disbelief.</p>
<p> Sincerely… what&#39;s going on?</p>
<p> I was using previous versions of the app both on Windows and on the Mac and everything worked (not smoothly, but at least it worked!)… then something happened and I wasn&#39;t able to test my android apps on Windows because Titanium started to say that the Android SDK wasn&#39;t configured. I tried to reconfigure it, redownloaded it, I&#39;ve followed most advices (even the craziest ones) both on StackOverflow and the Appcelerator&#39;s forums but nothing seemed to fix the problem… someone pointed to some apparently fixed Jira bugs… someone to some nodejs versions… but at the end, at least for me, no success…</p>
<p> At least it still worked on my Mac…</p>
<p> Well that was, of course, before I decided to let Titanium update itself to the latest release… then even my Mac was broken… and after 10 hours wasted trying to fix the problem I used TimeMachine to restore my files back to where they were and I was able to return to work…</p>
<p> Today I decided to retry on Windows, because I can&#39;t believe, that this basic platform functionality, running Android, could be broken in the latest and shinest version of Titatium Studio…. yet it&#39;s still painfully broken….</p>
<p> I uninstalled everything related to Titanium, downloaded and installed Studio, then configured it to use Android… everything seemed ok, it connected and downloaded the Android SDK, then it told me that it was configured….I smiled…<br> I restarted Titanium and it told me it wanted to update…I let it update and then everything was again broken…</p>
<p> Android SDK red –&gt; ok let&#39;s configure (It says &quot;Not yet configured&quot;) so let&#39;s click on Configure –&gt; Ouch it starts to download Android again (didn&#39;t it do it just 10&#39; ago?), nethermind let&#39;s wait —&gt; Mmm… something must have gone wrong because it still doesn&#39;t know the downloaded Android SDK version —&gt; Let&#39;s try again pressing &quot;Settings&quot; instead of configure –&gt; version 4.1.2 is checked but if I press configure I&#39;m back to the download loop…</p>
<p> Ok, what now? I really don&#39;t understand…</p>
<p> I thought that the Appcelerator solution was the only viable mobile multiplaform solution but if I&#39;m not even able to start developing with it, what should I use it for?</p>
<p> I hope someone here will be able to explain to me what I&#39;ve done wrong and why I&#39;m so wrong about all this thing….</p>
<p> Thank you</p>
<p> Stefano</p>

							<div><p>Hi Dharmik,<br> yes it works…. and that&#39;s terrific… </p>
<p>but why if a Titanium Update is broken with some previous config files it doesn&#39;t delete them or al least suggest you to do so… because it&#39;s great to have you guys helping us but it seems all a little <strong>&quot;arcane&quot;</strong>….</p>
<p>Anyway this solution seems to solve the problem on Windows (I&#39;ll try later on Mac)… </p>
<p>I hope this post will be useful to other users in my same situation….</p>
<p>Thanks again<br>Stefano</p>

										<p><p>Same issue here. The build command for Android platform (Windows 7 64 bit), hangs on and run forever. Looks like a node.js relatived issue (maybe an hook problem). That&#39;s the build IS NOT INVOKED and the build process run in an infinite loop.</p>
