							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Short answer - you can&#39;t.</p>
<p>Assuming we are not talking about a simple syntax error.</p>
<p>If your app has crashed at operating system level - then the OS has managed a crash event - your app is no longer running and has no opportunity to run more code - for whatever reason.  If it could run more code it would not have crashed.</p>
<p>You have to test your app often in many different ways and on as much kit as you can get.</p>

										<p><p>You could use a different approach;</p>
<ul>
<li>Log events of your own - for example; opened window, current memory, current storage</li>
<li>Run these either at each main app event - for example just before closing a window or opening another, making changes to a database</li>
<li>Save these in a file or a DB and marked them as not sent with a date&#x2F;time</li>
<li>Just before the app closes mark the new entries as not required</li>
<li>When the app starts up - check the DB if there are any entries that are still marked as new - the app must have crashed</li>
<li>API call those over to your server at this point and reset them as processed (same as if app closed correctly)</li>
</ul>
<p>This was your next app start-up will send your own app log</p>

										<p><p>Check in the ChariTI app <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mcongrove&#x2F;ChariTi&#x2F;blob&#x2F;1.2.2&#x2F;app&#x2F;lib&#x2F;core.js">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mcongrove&#x2F;ChariTi&#x2F;blob&#x2F;1.2.2&#x2F;app&#x2F;lib&#x2F;core.js</a> Matt has added that functionality with a custom logging function that writes to the console and dumps to the database.  On restart, user can send the export from the database via email.</p>
