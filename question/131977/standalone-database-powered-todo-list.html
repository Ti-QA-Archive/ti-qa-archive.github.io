			<h1>Standalone database-powered todo list</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;d like to build a todo list manager that can run on the desktop (maybe in a browser?) that reads and stores it&#39;s data from some type of database backend.  I need the database because I have meta data that I&#39;d like to attach to the tasks for sorting and prioritization.  Most importantly, I want the application to be able to run from a USB stick.  I don&#39;t want to require installation, and I don&#39;t want it to live online.  I&#39;d simply like a system (similar perhaps to tiddlywiki) that could utilize a database and leverage CSS and maybe HTML5.  Is this possible through appcelerator?</p>

							<p>Appcelerator actually won&#39;t officially be supporting the desktop project going forward, as it will be a community led effort.  Even with the desktop product though, it does require installation of an embedded runtime.  For something like what you&#39;re describing, you could probably distribute an HTML file which used local storage to provide the experience you&#39;re targeting, similar to tiddlywiki.</p>

										<p><p>Well I wanted the database to be mobile.  Using local storage would mean that the data would live on the machine and wouldn&#39;t move with the actual app.  Are there any alternatives?  Maybe something besides Appcelerator?</p>

										<p><p>I think the only way you could avoid having an installed app, and still use HTML&#x2F;CSS with a remote database would be some form of <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cross-Origin_Resource_Sharing">cross-origin resource sharing</a> with a local HTML file.  </p>
<p>Beyond that I don&#39;t know.  Titanium, AIR, and every other HTML-based cross platform tool I know require some kind of installation process.</p>
