			<h1>Upgrading accross iOS4 -- App crashes on startup</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Here&#39;s my Scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have an app currently in the marketplace, and installed on my phone.</li>
<li>I upgrade my phone from iOS3.x to iOS4</li>
<li>The existing app works fine</li>
<li>I am developing an update to the app with Titanium</li>
<li>When I try to install the Titanium app ontop of the existing app, the app crashes on startup every time.</li>
</ul>
<p>The important factor here is the upgrade from iOS3.x to iOS4.  I can install the updated app over the existing app perfectly fine on iOS3.x.</p>
<p>I should also note that doing a fresh install of the Titanium app on iOS4 work fine.  It&#39;s just the upgrade from our previous app to this one on iOS4 that is broken.</p>
<p>This leads me to believe that it&#39;s Titanium trying to access the previous database or properties that&#39;s causing the crash.</p>
<p>I realize that Titanium doesn&#39;t officially support iOS4 yet, but is it possible to get a timeframe on when it will?</p>
<p>I would like to submit my updated app to the app store with iOS4 support, but all of our customers with the old app who upgrade to iOS4 and then upgrade our app will be &quot;hosed&quot; so-to-speak.</p>
<p>Is anyone seeing a similar issue?  Are there any hotfixes that anyone knows of?</p>

							<p>Make sure you follow the changes Titanium recommends for iOS 4.0 compatibility:  http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2010&#x2F;05&#x2F;titanium-and-iphone-os-4.html</p>
<p>Also I found in my own testing, that on iOS 4 I had to fully uninstall from the device &amp; reinstall the app whenever it was crashing as you described.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Mike, I have definitely updated the necessary files as described in that blog post.</p>
<p>Uninstalling and re-installing works fine for development, but I can&#39;t ask our users to uninstall the app and re-install to alleviate this problem.  Many will update from the original app to my the new version, and if they are on iOS4, it will crash.</p>

							<p>This isn&#39;t good. Does the same thing happen in stimulator? Which iOS 4.0 beta are you using?</p>
