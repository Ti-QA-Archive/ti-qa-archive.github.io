			<h1>Android Notifications with a custom Manifest.xml</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m trying to get notifications working in Android and I&#39;ve followed the instructions at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Android+Notifications. I put the extra stuff in my tiapp.xml file as specified in the tutorial (scroll to the very bottom) and the external JS file that specifies the service is a copy and paste from that tutorial. But I still can&#39;t make it work.</p>
<p>I think what is happening is that there is a conflict between adding the stuff to the tiapp.xml and the custom AndroidManifest.xml file I&#39;ve added to my project. Basically, I think it&#39;s ignoring the tiapp.xml stuff. But adding the code from the tiapp.xml to the AndroidManifest.xml file doesn&#39;t work. I get errors that bunch of things are not declared or are invalid.</p>
<p>So is there an alternative way to declare the service in the AndroidManifest.xml file that WILL work? I&#39;ve tried reading the Android documentation, but it doesn&#39;t seem to match up with what I&#39;m passing into Ti. Thanks.</p>

							<p>if you are trying to set this code in actual AndroidManifest.xml then it does not reflect. </p>
<p>so just copy your AndroidManifest.xml and put that file in the same location with the name <strong>AndroidManifest.custom.xml</strong> and then edit that file.</p>

										<p><p>Sorry, should have been clearer. I have the Custom Manifest working already. but then adding stuff to the tiapp.xml is not picked up because the manifest file already exists. I did figure out how to migrate the stuff I had added to the manifest file to the tiapp.xml though, so things are working for the moment.</p>
<p>But it would still be nice to know how to add that stuff directly to the manifest. You know, for someone else that can&#39;t back their changes out like I could.</p>
