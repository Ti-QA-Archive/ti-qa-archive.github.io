			<h1>dynamically change content inside app after build</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have built an app for both android and iOS for my client, but he wants to be able to alter the app after I have compiled it. i.e. change images, change an xml file etc so that he can give it to different people.</p>
<p>Android this is easy, i gave him a batch file that will decompile the apk (with apktools) he modifies the resources and then runs another batch to recompile and resign</p>
<p>can i do something similar with my iOS app?</p>
<p>I also need to be able to change the app name so that it can be installed on the same device more than once.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>For IOS, that requires a provisioning profile for each appID</p>

										<p><p>Not knowing the entire situation I&#39;ll ask, if you already have him tearing apart your apk, why not just give him the source code and let him compile it up from that?</p>

										<p><p>Another option depending on the size of the project, have a back end that delivers changes based upon a code&#x2F;key.  The variables in the app are set based upon an XML or JSON file pulled from a remote server based upon an initial key value entered into the app at initial run.</p>

							<p>thanks for the info. server based system has the problem that i cant have the same app installed multiple times on the same phone.</p>
<p>giving appcelerator seems measy, but its a worse case solution. batch files are by far the easiest for him</p>

							<p>well, then you can compile just once, (keep your source code) and at least for the first time your app should be able to access the internet and download a configuration file (your XML or JSON).  Everything should be contained within this file. It&#39;s something like an &#39;activation&#39; procedure. </p>
<p>I m not sure though about the application id - I believe that you will need to recompile it with a different ID in your manifest. </p>
<p>(kinda weird situation you have here!) :-)</p>
<p>Let us know how it goes though, it&#39;s tempting to find out the final outcome!</p>
