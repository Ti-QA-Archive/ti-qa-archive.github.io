			<h1>AppID Cannot start with a number</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am using Titanium Studio SDK 3.4.0, trying to build an IOS app for IOS 8.x.</p>
<p>My IOS AppID contains the team ID as the prefix, XXXXXXXX.com.domain.app, which begins with a number. This was establish early on when the app was first built, before the &quot;no number&quot; rule was enforced.  Now that this rule is in place I cannot build my app with the original AppID.  When I remove the prefix, I can build the app.  However, Xcode interprets the archive as  a new app, and does not find a matching app in iTunes Connect.</p>
<p>This <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;125077&#x2F;cannot-create-an-app---the-app-id-should-start-with-a-letter---apple-requires-app-id-to-start-with-a-number">work around</a> was valid for a period of time, but its solution no longer applies to the latest SDK release.</p>
<p>Does anyone know a work around or solution for this issue?  Any assistance you can provide would be appreciated.    </p>
<p>Thanks<br>James</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>This is a painful situation and I do not envy you.</p>
<p>However; it is possible to work around this but not by any automated way.  You have to contact Apple directly using the web forms.  This will take human intervention by them and you may not get the answer you want first time (just to warn you) but try again.</p>
<p>State very clearly the history of the App ID, the work-around and the now refusal and ask how can you now change the app id WITHOUT breaking the link between existing users and newer versions of the apps going forward.  They will likely need you to perform actions and to be able to verify your membership (make sure this is up to date and paid for and will not expire within a couple of weeks.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;itunes&#x2F;go&#x2F;itunesconnect&#x2F;contactus&#x2F;">iTunes Connect - Contact Us</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Whilst the issue is of their making and a suitable automated workaround by them should have been considered as a plan for those affected - it is unwise to bring up the stupidity the current situation forced upon you.</p>
<p>Smile at the nice people whilst they try and help you fix the problem they caused.  Think of it as &quot;being nice to the drunk driver who has crashed into your car - as you need him to sort out the problem&quot;.</p>

										<p><p>Malcolm,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.  I had contacted Apple prior to this post with the hope that they would change the AppID.  I will try them again.</p>
<p>Their suggestion was to open the Titanium project in Xcode, add the prefix, and build the archive in Xcode.  When I do this, I am still hit with the validation error generated in Titanium Studio.  Apparently, Apple gave me the impression that the App can be built with the prefix on the AppID.  I believe the error is a Titanium error because the text and format are exactly the same.  I was hoping there was a work around in Titanium that can be done to deactivate the validation edit. </p>

										<p><p>Update: I was able to get around this issue by building the project in Titanium Studio without the numeric appID prefix. After the project was successfully built, I opened the xcodeproject file in Xcode. In Xcode, I added the numeric prefix by editing the &quot;id&quot; property on the plist file. After saving, the plist file I was able to build the archive directly from Xcode. Doing this associated the archive with the proper app in Organizer, and I was able to validate and submit the project for review. The app was approved without any issue.</p>
<p>Also note, that prior to submitting the app, I tested the build on a device to ensure there were no adverse effects of the unorthodox build procedure.</p>
