			<h1>How to get a transparent hole in a view</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I would like to have a view that is 50% opaque and then have a clear hole through the middle of the partially opaque view. I can&#39;t seem to get it to work. I have tried adding the round view to the larger perimeter view and the other way around. The inheritance of opacity seems to make this impossible. Hopefully this is simple and I am just missing it. Thanks.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>This seems harder than it really is - you just need to think about it differently.  </p>
<p>Opacity is not the solution as was noted by Stephen as opacity is inherited.  This is to be expected as the child views are lower down than the parent view - so as the parent view has an opacity the child view must also start with that opacity level before any values it has are taken into account.</p>
<p>Back to the problem; the solution is not two views or any type it is actually one single view but the use of different properties.  Unfortunately you cannot use <em>backgroundColor</em> to achieve this as that covers the whole view - again - no matter what type of view.</p>
<p>From your question you appear to understand how to make a view a circle.  So you were actually very close to the solution.  The key here is to have a transparent background colour - that manages the see through hole.  The cool thing is how you then use this very same (now circular) view to &quot;appear&quot; to sit inside a 50% translucent background view.</p>
<p>You use the different property I mentioned.  Given you have already used border radius to make the view a circle if you give the border a colour and then make it think you get a bordered circle.  But if you make the view much larger and have a very big border then the border actually becomes the &quot;background view&quot; - but again, just a single view.</p>
<p>How this fits into your app depends on your needs, the code below shows how to make a 50% black background with a fully transparent hole in the middle.</p>
<ul>
<li>Titanium with the Alloy Framework</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// view</span>
&lt;View id=<span class="hljs-string">"polo"</span>&gt;&lt;/View&gt;
<span class="hljs-comment">// tss</span>
<span class="hljs-string">"#polo"</span>: {
    backgroundColor: <span class="hljs-string">'transparent'</span>,
    borderColor: <span class="hljs-string">'#7f000000'</span>,
    borderRadius: <span class="hljs-number">375</span>,
    borderWidth: <span class="hljs-number">250</span>,
    <span class="hljs-variable">height</span>: <span class="hljs-number">750</span>,
    left: -<span class="hljs-number">187</span>,
    top: -<span class="hljs-number">127</span>,
    <span class="hljs-variable">width</span>: <span class="hljs-number">750</span>
}
</code></pre><ul>
<li>Titanium without the Alloy Framework</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="hljs">var polo = Ti.UI.createView({
    backgroundColor: <span class="hljs-string">'transparent'</span>,
    borderColor: <span class="hljs-string">'#7f000000'</span>,
    borderRadius: <span class="hljs-number">375</span>,
    borderWidth: <span class="hljs-number">250</span>,
    <span class="hljs-variable">height</span>: <span class="hljs-number">750</span>,
    left: -<span class="hljs-number">187</span>,
    top: -<span class="hljs-number">127</span>,
    <span class="hljs-variable">width</span>: <span class="hljs-number">750</span>
});
win.<span class="hljs-built_in">add</span>(polo);
</code></pre><p>The dimensions are for example only.  This code will create an oversized view that expands outside the window itself (at least on an iPhone 6.  You can change the values to suit your needs.  The negatives allow the oversize.</p>
<p>You cannot change or set the background colour as this will break the process as the background colour interferes with the border colour.</p>
<p>If you did want a specific colour for the &quot;hole&quot; you would simply place another view to fit over the top of the one above.  You can also use the above technique to contain the &quot;polo&quot; in a smaller space by placing it inside a parent view that simply acts to contain and more importantly restrain (clip) the polo.</p>
<p>Code tested on iOS just now.  Obviously using this technique and mixing and matching it you can create some cool effects - or just a simple hole in a view :-)</p>

							<p>Yeah, opacity is inherited.  Which is truly annoying at times.</p>
<p>You could create your own opaque image in photoshop and use that as the background of the image (with your completely transparent circle in the middle of that image).</p>

										<p><p>For clarity Kosso, your answer does not avoid opacity inheritance in fact it does not use opacity at all - it uses the alpha channel of the RGB values either hex ARGB or decimal RGBA.</p>
<p>Using the technique with a background colour ends up with an <em>inheritance like</em> result as the background colour cannot be differentiated from any other views.  Using it with the combination of border colour simply blends the border colour with the background colour.</p>

										<p><p>Alpha : Opacity. Whatevs. same effect to me. </p>
<p>My point was that yes, in fact I can have a semi-opaque view with a solid opaque view added to it that indeed does not inherit the alpha transparency. </p>
<p>I wasn&#39;t actually answering the &#39;polo&#39; question.</p>
<p>eg: </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">

<span class="processing">    var semi_opaque_view = Ti.UI.createView({

        backgroundColor:<span class="hljs-string">'#7fff0000'</span>  <span class="hljs-comment">// 50% alpha red</span>

    });

    var solid_view = Ti.UI.createView({
        <span class="hljs-variable">width</span>:<span class="hljs-number">100</span>,
        <span class="hljs-variable">height</span>:<span class="hljs-number">100</span>,
        backgroundColor:<span class="hljs-string">'#00ff00'</span> <span class="hljs-comment">// solid green</span>

										<p><p>Kosso, you are just demonstrating expected behavior and there IS inheritance, but you are making the child more opaque which exactly the opposite of what the original question asked.

							<p>One way to avoid inherited opacity is to NOT use the opacity property when colouring views, but instead use the hexadecimal way of setting a color with opacity:  Do this with 8 Hex Characters, where the first two are the opacity. </p>
<p>eg: </p>
<p><code>backgroundColor: &amp;#39;#11FF0000&amp;#39;</code>  will give you a red with an opacity of &#39;11&#39; (HEX) = 17&#x2F;255 = 0.067% </p>
<p><code>backgroundColor: &amp;#39;#7FFF0000&amp;#39;</code>  will give you a red with an opacity of &#39;7F&#39; (HEX) = 127&#x2F;255 =~ 50% </p>
<p><code>backgroundColor: &amp;#39;#FFFF0000&amp;#39;</code>  will give you a red with an opacity of &#39;FF&#39; (HEX) = 255&#x2F;255 =  100% (ie: solid)</p>
<p>This same tick can also use the &#39;rgba&#39; format, as is used in HTML&#x2F;CSS for exactly the same inheritance reason. </p>

										<p><p>Kosso,</p>
<p>I have tried this already, but I get the same results as I do when I set opacity. The child cannot be less opaque than the parent. I have included code indicating what you suggested, but I do not get different results that I do with the opacity setting. Are you getting a different result?</p>
