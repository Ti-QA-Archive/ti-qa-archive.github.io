			<p>How to distribute Titanium iPhone&#x2F;iPad apps in behalf of a client with a current Enterprise distribution license? </p>
<p>I have created a Titanium app with the help of Titanium Studio for a client who just purchased an Enterprise Distribution License. The problem is that his company does not have either the time or the know-how how to do any of this. In fact they want to give me the log in ID and password of the current Enterprise Agent, so that I could get the Distribution Certificate and do all that necessary to distribute the app to around 60 of their employees. I am not sure, however, that this would be the right way,  mostly because all correspondence would go to the currently designated Agent&#39;s email address, which I don&#39;t have access to. Should I ask the company to either invite me to be the Agent, or, assign me an Agent status before I do anything else?  Unfortunately, I cannot find any information on this subject (whether or not a contractor can be the Enterprise Agent for his client). </p>
<p>I would like to hear from anyone who&#39;s been in a similar situation, but most of all I would like to hear from somebody who knows what is the best practice in this case.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance,</p>
<p>Alex B.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you for your answer Joseph. Dough&#39;s article about Wireless Ad Hoc Distribution is excellent, however there are now answers in there for those of us who needs to generate even the Distribution Certificate in behalf of a client who owns the Enterprise Distribution License.</p>
