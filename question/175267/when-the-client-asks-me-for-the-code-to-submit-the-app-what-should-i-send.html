			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>If my clients wants the code to submit it themselves not using TitaniumStudio, but Xcode, what code should I send them? The one inside the build directory? It is the same?</p>
<p>I am a little bit confused.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>My first question would be to ask them why.</p>
<p>Titanium does the entire process for you and you are the developer.  I have to be honest I have never actually submitted an app via xcode directly as there is simply no need.  Having run the app through xcode to benefit from instruments I can tell you the app works just fine.</p>
<p>The one inside the build folder will be using your profiles, certificate and other identifying elements - so they may have trouble configuring those to perform a build for production without your assitance - so again seems strange.</p>
<p>It might be;</p>
<ul>
<li>They do not like you and want to walk away - chances are you are great - so unlikely this one</li>
<li>They want to hold up payments - if likely this one; we never submit an app to the store until final payment has been made - suggest you have the same rule - including providing them with sufficient code to do the same for themselves.</li>
<li>They may not think you will provide them with the code, your contract will state if you should do or not.  The general rule is - you did it for them, they paid you - their code.  Some developers charge extra - seems weird to me.</li>
<li>They think they are great or an employee wants to show off - not usually a good reason.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask them why and get a good reason - one that does not cause problems as I mentioned above.</p>
<p>Keep in mind there is a huge difference between the code in xcode to build an app and source code - the client may think asking for the code ready to submit is both those things - they are wrong.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks a lot Malcom, that makes sense, I will investigate further the reason for the request of submitting the app via xcode and not TS. I have a follow up question. A person with knowledge on native iOS development would be able to understand the code generated by TitaniumStudio build?<br>Thanks again!</p>

										<p><p>Yes and no, whilst all Titanium APIs are mapped directly onto iOS (or Android) APIs not all parts of the built app are compiled straight down at compile time.  Many are mapped in real-time when the app is running.  Your client is much better off with the Titanium source.  It is as industry standard as you can get now, so many developers, so many custom modules, so many app using it already in the stores.</p>

										<p><p>If you still need to give the client the code, there is a Python script, transport.py provided in the SDK that converts the project correctly so that it can be passed on in its entirety as outlined <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bencoding.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;04&#x2F;11&#x2F;using-titaniums-transport-py&#x2F;">here</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;87221&#x2F;how-to-deliver-iphone-xcode-source-to-client">here</a>.</p>
