			<h1>Calling a js file from inside itself</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a js file (loadprofile.js) that loads up a my profile and any items that I may have &quot;liked&quot;. This file gets some json data displaying the my information, the items I like, and the information of the user who posted the items that I liked.</p>
<p>When I click on the name of the person who posted the item, I call the same loadprofile.js file and pass in that user&#39;s id to display their profile. </p>
<p>This all works well until I attempt to close these newly created windows. Because I call the file from within itself, I am seeing errors.</p>
<p>Are there any suggestions as to how I can fix this?</p>

							<p>Honestly, if you are calling the same file recursively, there is a serious problem with your programming style.</p>
<p>Your question does not have any where enough information for us to help you at this point.  Post your code to a gist, and someone can look over it for you.</p>
<p>Missing from your question are a number of important pieces of information. I suggest you take a look at the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Using+Questions+and+Answers">Using Questions and Answers</a> article, specifically the Q&amp;A Question Checklist.  The missing information is critical to reproducing problems in a test environment and often indicates other factors that cause the undesirable outcome you are experiencing.</p>

										<p><p>Sorry for posting this, I just needed to review my code. For my application, calling the same file recursively is necessary. </p>
<p>The issue was that I was trying to remove a variable and set it to null when I closed the window before I declared it.</p>
