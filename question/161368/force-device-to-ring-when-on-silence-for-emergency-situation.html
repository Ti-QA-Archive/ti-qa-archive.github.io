			<h1>Force Device to Ring When on Silence for Emergency Situation</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello Appcelerator,</p>
<p>I unfortunately cannot supply a code example because of legal reasons, so this is an &quot;is this possible&quot; question.</p>
<p>Our apps purpose is to send out public safety messages. These are things like road closures or extreme weather. Sometimes it can also be things related to life-or-death situations, like an out of control train carrying fuel or something requiring immediate evacuation of an area. </p>
<p>In a perfect world, these kinds of situations would happen when everybody is awake and coherent. Unfortunately, they normally don&#39;t. Since they often happen when people are sleeping and have their phone on silent, sending out a message won&#39;t be able to get the public aware of the emergency. </p>
<p>So, the question: Is there a way to override the silent settings on the phone, or change the phones volume to alert the public of this, regardless of what their phone settings are currently at? We developing for iOS and Android, but if you know the answer regarding Blackberry devices I would love to hear it also.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I am sorry but I think you will find this is not possible, at least not with Titanium.  I am not sure if it could be done by creating a platform specific modules and hooking them in.</p>
