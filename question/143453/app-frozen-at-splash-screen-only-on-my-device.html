			<h1>App frozen at splash screen ONLY on my device</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Application type: mobile</p>
<p>Titanium sdk: 3.0.0 - 3.1.0</p>
<p>android 2.3.7 cyanogenmod 7.1.0</p>
<p>device: samsung galaxy s2</p>
<p>host operating system: ubuntu 12.0.4</p>
<p>LOG: </p>
<p>V8Object: Runtime disposed, cannot set property &#39;userAgent&#39;</p>
<p>WindowManager: App freeze timeout expired</p>
<p>WindowManager: Force clearing freeze: AppWindowTokenblablabla</p>
<p>For a while I was developing my app fine but got tired of just receiving alert popups when things dont work. I wanted to actually debug on my device so I told adb to forward tcp port 5858 to my host computer&#39;s port 5858 and ran node-inspector on that. </p>
<p>Once I did that the app would boot up with the Appcelerator portrait splash stretched into landscape mode (as my windows are all in landscape mode). This was strange but everything works fine once I tell it to continue running via node-inspector. </p>
<p>However now that I&#39;ve turned node-inspector off, uninstalled the app, rebuilt and installed without forwarded ports I still get that same stretched splash and the app just sits there waiting. It doesn&#39;t say anything about waiting for a debugger.</p>
<p>So I turned off &quot;usb debugging&quot; on my device. Now it shows a black screen then freezes every time. I sent the apk to a friend who installed and ran it just fine without any freezing. He even compiled my source on his machine and it worked fine.</p>
<p>Any ideas what could be wrong with my setup? I am thinking it has something to do with adb or my device settings. How can I make a &quot;non-debug&quot; build with titanium?</p>
