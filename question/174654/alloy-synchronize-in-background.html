			<h1>Alloy synchronize in background</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello guys</p>
<p>i wander dose Alloy provide background synchronize , for example in Java we do use Service Class to do a job every x minutes even if the application is closed so we can use it to push notification download data etc .</p>
<p>I&#39;ve googled it but couldn&#39;t find a solution , my target is to synchronize data even if the app is closed in Ios and Android with Alloy </p>
<p>any one to lead me the way ?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Short answer - Yes (I think - your question is not suitably clear)</p>
<p>Longer answer;</p>
<p>Alloy is not the thing you search on, Alloy is the MVC framework this is not a different language, Titanium is the key.</p>
<p>Sounds like you are after background services;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.App.iOS.BackgroundService">ios</a></li>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;138478&#x2F;background-service-on-android">android</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The app still needs to be running in the background, so closed must mean no longer the active app.</p>

										<p><p>so i can&#39;t use background service when app is closed ?</p>

										<p><p>There are three states of an app;</p>
<ul>
<li>Foreground - app is the one currently being displayed to the user</li>
<li>Background - the device has gone to sleep or another app has become the one currently being displayed</li>
<li>Closed - the app has been removed from the task manager, shut down in some way or never been started</li>
</ul>
<p>Your code can run when in foreground, in background if it uses the background services but not when the app is closed.  If the app is closed it is not in memory and so has no ability to run any code.</p>
<p>So you if you mean closed as in not running, rather than closed means not in foreground then - No.  You cannot run any code in your application when the app itself is not running.</p>

										<p><p>sure , u r right , but in Java i was using alarm intent to start service every 60 seconds even if the applications is closed , my goal is to sync information with remote server if the user locked he&#39;s phone i have made it on ios but in Android the service stopped when i exit the app</p>

										<p><p>You can still use intents in Titanium - hooking something off the alarm reminded me of somthing I saw a while back - is this helpful?</p>

</ul>
<p>It is a module a friend of mine wrote that always a simplified hook into the Alarm Manager service.</p>
