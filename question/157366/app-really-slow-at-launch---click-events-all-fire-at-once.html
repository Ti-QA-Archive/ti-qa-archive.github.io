			<h1>App Really Slow at Launch - Click Events All Fire at Once</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>When I launch my app for the first time on an iPhone (this also happens on Android), everything comes up, but no click events get registered.</p>
<p>Then, about 20 seconds later, any clicks I had made, all fire at once.  So if I touched 5 buttons, 5 things will suddenly happen.</p>
<p>What causes this and what is the best solution?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<div><p>do you have internet connection off and analytics on? I had a problem similar to this, because the app tried to connect to analytics but couldn&#39;t so it was hung for like 15 seconds until the http call timed out.</p>

							<div><p>No, this is with internet connection on.  </p>
<p>It seems that the app is unresponsive until all the downloading of data is done, even though the HTTP requests are fired off async.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, this is likely what we&#39;ll have to do, but it seems odd that my main window loads and is completely unresponsive while async downloading is happening.  If it&#39;s async, why are my click events not registering until after those HTTP requests have completed?</p>

										<p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>check in DDMS or Instruments for logs. Sounds like you are blocking the main thread (UI one) with something waiting for your network calls). What happens if you start your app with no network?</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro</p>
