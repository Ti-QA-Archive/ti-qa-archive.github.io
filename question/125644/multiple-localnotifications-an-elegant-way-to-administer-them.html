			<h1>Multiple LocalNotifications: an elegant way to administer them.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I would like to ask some help on an elegant way to administer multiple notifications over multiple sessions. </p>
<p>Take for example the iOS calendar app. How would you administer all of those reminders and the notifications that are associated with them. </p>
<p>The approach that I would take is to build a database where to store the reminders time. I am perplexed about how I would go about to cancel a reminder. </p>
<p>Would you cancel all the reminders and the reschedule them all?<br>What if you had over 1000 localNotifications? That would take lots of time. </p>
<p>Thanks for your thoughts.</p>

							<p>Per the Apple documentation, an application can have at most 64 notifications scheduled at one time (repeating ones count as one). You can always alter the 64 stored, but I suspect that is notnwhat you had in mind,</p>
<p>I&#39;m not an expert on local notifications, as I disliked Titanium&#39;s implementation enough to write my own module and use that instead.</p>
<p>One major issue, based on my understanding of the titanium source when you create a new notification they return a TiAppiOSLocalNotificationProxy….which you cannot really do anything with such as save it to a property or anything. Thus, as soon as the proxy loses scope and it gets cleared up the dealloc will cause the notification to be cancelled. This is one reason in the KitchenSink example the notifications are included in the background example, because with their implementation if you closed the app and still didn&#39;t have a variable holding on to it….it would cancel the notification. This is not a requirement in normal iOS but with the Titanium implementation you have to hold on to the variable.</p>
<p>You can cancel using the proxy returned from creating the notification by calling the cancel method. Alternatively there is a cancelAll method you can call, and recreate the one&#39;s you didn&#39;t mean to cancel.</p>

										<p><p>Sadly, I wrote the module as part of my day job, so I do not really own the source. </p>
<p>However, it wasn&#39;t that difficult to write….so seeing as there is interest I might consider writing it again on my own time. If I do, would you prefer I follow the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;IOs&#x2F;#documentation&#x2F;iPhone&#x2F;Reference&#x2F;UILocalNotification_Class&#x2F;Reference&#x2F;Reference.html">Apple documentation</a> closely or make it more Titanium like where I keep it simple and use &quot;text&quot; instead of &quot;alertBody&quot;?</p>

										<p><p>I think more Titanium like, since it will be used for Android too.</p>

										<p><p>No, it won&#39;t be used for Android too. Even the native Titanium code is under the iOS name, because it&#39;s significantly different functionality on Android. Check out the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;latest&#x2F;Titanium.Android.Notification-object">Titanium Android Notification</a> support if you are interested in that. Alternatively, you could look into adding an event to the calendar and having the alert do that.</p>
<p>There just isn&#39;t strong support for iOS local notifications, so that&#39;s what the module was for.</p>
