			<h1>Alloy debugging files in /lib and /widgets - problems</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve upgraded to Titanium 3.1.0 and updated Studio to 3.1.0.<br>(building for iOS target SDK 6.1)<br>I&#39;ve been using Alloy since released in December and really like the new ability to set breakpoints in the original code file rather than the derived file in Resources.</p>
<p>I am debugging with an iPhone simulator (6.1) on a Mac running mountain lion.</p>
<p>But it seems that I can no longer &quot;step into&quot; or set breakpoints in code located in the &#x2F;lib or &#x2F;widgets folders.</p>
<p>If I set a breakpoint in a widget folder, the debugger displays code in a random spot in my controller which called the widget.  The variables in the debugger look like they belong to the widget.</p>
<p>If I set the breakpoint in the derived widget file in the resources folder the same thing happens.</p>
<p>Is this a known problem or am I doing something wrong?  Any workarounds?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance-</p>

							<p>Hi Joel,<br>I&#39;ve tried to recreate this issue on a local project of mine. Here is what I did:</p>
<ol>
<li>Created a new widget and added it to the main view.</li>
<li>Alloy generated &quot;widgets&#x2F;myWidget&#x2F;controllers&#x2F;widget.js&quot;</li>
<li>I&#39;ve set up a breakpoint there and launched the app.</li>
<li>The app stopped on the breakpoint as expected.</li>
</ol>
<p>The only think I&#39;ve noticed is that the breakpoint marker on the generated file is gone when you re-launch. This is pretty much expected as the file is being touched outside the Studio and the markers that we set on it get removed because of that. However, if you&#39;ll open the Breakpoints View you will see that the breakpoint still exists and the debugger will get that breakpoint information and stop as requested.</p>
<p>I would recommend cleaning the project by doing Project -&gt; Clean, or by manually deleting the Alloy generated files under &#39;Resources&#39;.<br>If that doesn&#39;t help, we may need to test this using your project, so we&#39;ll need to get a copy of it (or some other test case that shows the same issue).</p>
<p>Thanks!<br>-Shalom G.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Shalom-</p>
<p>I just tried it again with my app.  I did a project clean (done it several times already), then deleted the files from the resource folder, then added breakpoints to the widget.js file and the resources&#x2F;…&#x2F;widget.js file (different lines just to be sure.)  Verified that the breakpoints are in breakpoints view.</p>
<p>When the breakpoint is hit the debug window displays a random line in the controller that created and called the widget.</p>
<p>I cannot send you my project, it contains keys that I cannot have floating around.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll try to get the time to build a sample case.</p>
<p>(The same thing happens on another app I am creating, so I don&#39;t think this is caused by just this one app.)</p>

										<p><p>HI Shalom,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve had not been able to make a simple test case, but I have two complex projects which show the problems setting breakpoints in &#x2F;lib and widgets.  What is the best way to send you the zipped project?</p>
<p>thanks-</p>

										<p><p>Hi Joel,<br>Can you also send me all the modules you are using?<br>At the moment I get into &#39;errors breakpoints&#39; that hit because I&#39;m missing some of the support, so getting what you have will save me some time.<br>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>Yes, I was able to recreate this, and looks like I was also able to fix it.<br>The fix was pushed to the &quot;beta&quot; stream, and to the &quot;nightly&quot; stream (those are for 3.1.1 and the 3.2), and both streams will have the fixed version available by tomorrow.<br>You can update your Studio to 3.1.1 beta, or have another Studio installation on your machine (your choice :)).<br>In case you would like to update the studio, the easiest way is by selecting the &#39;Beta Release&#39; option through the preferences -&gt; Appcelerator Studio -&gt; Updates, and then do check for updates through the Help menu.<br>Another option is to grab it manually by following the instructions at http:&#x2F;&#x2F;preview.appcelerator.com&#x2F;studio&#x2F;</p>
<p>Let me know if that fix work for you (again, it should be available by tomorrow).<br>Cheers,<br>-Shalom</p>

							<p>Right now the only files that you can directly set breakpoints in are the &quot;app&#x2F;alloy.js&quot; file or any of your controller files. Widgets and that &quot;lib&quot; folder aren&#39;t currently supported.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Tony, that&#39;s fine.  But I can&#39;t successfully set breakpoints in the &#x2F;resource versions either.  The breakpoints are ignored in &#x2F;lib and show code from &#x2F;controllers for &#x2F;widgets.  Is that what you expect?</p>

										<p><p>If I set a breakpoint in &#x2F;resources&#x2F;alloy&#x2F;widgets&#x2F;com.bl.myWidget&#x2F;widget.js, the debugger stops and displays code from the file which called the widget: &#x2F;app&#x2F;controller&#x2F;myController.js  i.e. a random place in the calling file up the stack.  </p>
<p>If I place a breakpoint in &#x2F;resources&#x2F;myFileThatLivesInSlashLib.js the breakpoint is just ignored and I cannot step into the code.</p>
<p>i.e. the old way to set a breakpoint in this code just doesn&#39;t work.  There is no way to set a breakpoint for code in &#x2F;lib or &#x2F;widget.  Is that what you expect?</p>
