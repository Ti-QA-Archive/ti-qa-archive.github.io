			<h1>Android views ui: the width, the height and the ugly.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Let&#39;s suppose i&#39;m creating a view like this:</p>
<p><code>{
width: 100,
height: 100,
left: 10,
right: 10,
top: 10,
bottom: 10
}</code></p>
<p>Then I add this into an horizontal layout view container. With iOS i&#39;m getting what I expect: every box has same distance from the others and height and width are set to 100.</p>
<p>On Android for some reason I get the box height stretched (100% parent view) and width fixed.</p>
<p>Why is that? Why they don&#39;t behave same way? How do I get the same render on both platforms?</p>
<p>Thanks to anyone will help.</p>

							<p>My guess is that when you specify a height, and a top and bottom, it will take the top and bottom, and will ignore the height. When you leave the bottom away, i think it will display just fine.</p>

										<p><p>Indeed it works… problem is boxes are no longer positioned as they should because of the missing directive (either top or bottom). Do I have to wrap each box into another view or is there a nicer solution?</p>

										<p><p>what you can do is:<br>use one view which has a vertical layout<br>in that view you can make views with a horizontal layout.<br>when you add a horizontal view to the vertical view, you can specify a top for the horizontal views. In the horizontal views you can add the boxes you want.<br>when you think this is the solution please mark this as the solution to your question.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the help. It make sense and I&#39;ll try it out soon.<br>Anyway while in iOS Titanium is fairly good and stable, in Android is frustrating and disappointing. From my point of view Titanium for Android should not be published as 100% working. It&#39;s not nice find out about problems and quirks when the project development is already in advanced state.<br>I&#39;m not really complaining… Titanium is a great idea and it&#39;s free which is a great plus… but I cannot trust it completely until I keep getting a surprise every 20 lines of code.</p>

							<p>Elmar is right. In short, don&#39;t use opposite positioning properties at the same time. What you see is a side affect on Android (width&#x2F;height is ignored). Just use one position property in combination with width&#x2F;height.</p>
