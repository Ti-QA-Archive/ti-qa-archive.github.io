			<h1>Titanium.UI.createButton - Issues!</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>Im not sure if I have missed something crucial about the way Titanium and Javascript works, however I can&#39;t seem to use the Titanium.UI.createButton feature to work.</p>
<p>I have started working from the Generic 2 Tab &#x2F; 2 Window Example that is generated on new Project Build.</p>
<p>So, I have managed to customise Window 2 (Which I recall from a seperate js file using the &#39;url&#39; code within my createWindow function in app.js.)</p>
<p>So I have managed to create a custom looking form, but everytime I try to use the createButton to add a send button….. or even a navigation back bar, the application closes upon trying to load it.</p>
<p>Has anybody else experienced this, or perhaps could indicate a reason why this might be happening?</p>
<p>Thanks, Lee</p>

<p>There is a problem with your code, rather than Titanium. Please post it, and then someone will be able to explain the reason why it&#39;s not working.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

							<p>Try clearing out your build&#x2F;iphone folder and press launch again. Titanium doesn&#39;t &#39;know&#39; about the classes you added to your project without rebuilding the whole app.</p>

										<p><p>If you ever have this much code, I suggest going to a dump bin (Such as <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;">pastie</a> or <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;">pastebin</a>) and posting it there, then linking it here.</p>

										<p><p>When you post a question to the Q&amp;A, you will receive much more accurate answers more quickly by posting a proper &quot;usecase&quot;. A usecase is a self-contained piece of code that demonstrates your issue in the least possible number of lines. Some additional advantages of providing a usecase are that it is much kinder to those wishing to help you, because they won&#39;t have to spend considerable time replicating your issue on their systems, that you will gain a much great knowledge of how Titanium works, and lastly that the process of creating a usecase can often simplify the problem and consequently reveal the answer. You can read more about this subject in the official documentation, under the section <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Contributing+to+Titanium#ContributingtoTitanium-CreatingGoodUsecases">Creating Good Use-cases</a>.</p>
<p>Note that, if the code is long, you may want to create a <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;">Git Gist</a> or <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;">pastebin</a> rather than paste the code here directly.</p>
<p>Also, if you use the formatting syntax, explained in the link under the text area, it will be much clearer for people.</p>
