							<div><p>I would check in your Tiapp.xml and info.plist file. Go through EACH and every line and make sure that there&#39;s nothing missing or incorrect. </p>
<p>After doing this, DOUBLE CHECK it again. </p>
<p>You will probably find that the app id or something like the app name etc is incorrect or missing.</p>

							<div><p>Matthew, seems like something is missing here.</p>
<p>You said &quot;The reason they gave is : app.&#39;s not found.&quot;</p>
<p>That makes no sense.</p>
<p>Then you said &quot;I have checked for the app id , its right.&quot;</p>
<p>What exactly did apple write in the email?  Maybe a copy and paste would help here.</p>
