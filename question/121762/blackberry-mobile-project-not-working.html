			<h1>Blackberry Mobile Project Not Working...</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am unable to create a blackberry project using the titanium studio.</p>
<p>I have installed the studio , then proceeded to the new project screen and selected get SDK link, which downloaded about 250 MB of data and installed with out any problems. however when I try again it promts for a blackberry sdk location, i would have thought the software would pick up that i have the sdk installed but that is not the case.</p>
<p>where would I locate the directory which it is looking for?</p>
<p>I have read reports that blackberry is still in beta but it stated that it would be out Q1 of 2011, also something about tidev-bb-resources.zip which I also cannot locate.</p>
<p>I am really disappointed in the titanium studio as it really looked promising…</p>

							<p>It seems like a lot of people are struggling with the same &quot;can&#39;t find blackberry SDK&quot; issue you&#39;ve seen Johann.  I fought it for days before giving up and falling back to Titanium Developer.  I forget where I found the links, but a specific version of Titanium Developer + a specific version of the Mobile SDK did work for me.</p>
<p>Mostly.</p>
<p>The BlackBerry support doesn&#39;t see to be as robust as iPhone or Android.  It mostly works, but the documentation is sparse, and the feature set is limited.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;05&#x2F;major-titanium-updates.html">Appcelerator&#39;s blog</a> announced General Availability for BlackBerry support in &quot;late June&quot;.  Since tomorrow is the last day of June, I would hope that news would start flowing ASAP.</p>

							<p>I am just asking myself why would you give out software that looks like it can be configured to do a task (Blackberry Development features look like they are available) but it cannot be configured and is a dead end from the start , it just does not make sense. If the IDE config is problematic I do not have much hope for the code conversion</p>
