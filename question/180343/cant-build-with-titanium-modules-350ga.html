			<h1>Can&#39;t build with Titanium Modules 3.5.0.GA</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am able to build my project with the 3.5.0.Beta SDK, however when I try to build with the 3.5.0.GA the App no longer builds, the error I get is a linker error. I have custom modules that I have installed and I have figured out that they are the reason that the app no longer builds with the newest SDK. I am working with iOS 8.1.2 on Yosemite machine. I have followed the directions to upgrade my modules to make them 64 bit compatible. I am also doing an Alloy App if that affects anything. Any help would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Linker Error:<br>[ERROR] :  <strong> BUILD FAILED </strong><br>[ERROR] :  The following build commands failed:<br>[ERROR] :      Ld build&#x2F;netPark\ MVS.build&#x2F;Debug-iphoneos&#x2F;netPark\ MVS.build&#x2F;Objects-normal&#x2F;arm64&#x2F;netPark\ MVS normal arm64<br>[ERROR] :  (1 failure)</p>

							<div><p>ti-64 is an excellent library that allows global review which are the modules you have and if they have support for 64 bits.</p>
<p>ti-64 -g allows review globally (all your gear) all modules and what are the qe have support for 64 bits.</p>
<p>What are the modules that using in your project?</p>

							<div><p>I am using a Honeywell scanner and Teamviewer inside the app and neither of those showed up in the list in that link. I am also getting the same error when I try to build an app to put up to the Apple Store using the same modules.</p>

							<div><p>I have tracked down the SDK documentation for the modules I have built and the ones that don&#39;t work say that they are built for the armv7 architecture only. This is most likely the cause of why my app won&#39;t build so for now I guess this question can be locked. Thanks for the help guys.</p>
