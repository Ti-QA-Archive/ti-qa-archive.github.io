			<h1>Why you want me login so badly</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Every time in while (after few start of studio), you ask me login aging, you know what, not everyone has constant internet access, maybe you get benefit from it, but what possibility benefit we can got by doing so.<br>I never see an IDE will require you to login before you can use, and guess what, people from china will not able to use it, because your website is blocked by the great firewall, that is a 1.3 billon people market, good job!</p>
<p>Maybe you don’t care about it, just like you don’t care about the android one, otherwise you won’t make it so badly so suck, things that work fine on IOS, always work poorly or even incorrectly on android, I’m not talking about platform specific things, but simple things like click event image view …etc </p>
<p>You don’t think so take a look at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;141842&#x2F;please-note-that-the-following-code-work-perfectly-fine-on-ios-and-totally-suck-on-andriod">this</a> or <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;141778&#x2F;table-row-lost-click-event-after-adding-a-button-on-it-on-andriod">this</a>  </p>
<p>For those people who want to develop on android under titanium, you should think twice, because it is suck, run much slower than native app, and lot of hide bugs and unexperctedlly stopped.</p>

							<div><p>before developing an app with Titanium, make sure you know where you put your hands on instead of complaining. Cross-platforming costs this price. Develop your app on android and let me know how long it will take you to replicate the same features.</p>

							<div><p>OMG, because i&#39;m not in china, but I travel to it a lot. yes I&#39;m ranted and raved about it, but why they keep asking people to login before they can use it, is it because of the security reason, to keep your code safe, like your email or ebanking, or they like to know how you doing on your app, and see what they can do to help to you coding. yes that must be it.</p>

							<p>To answer the one question that you actually asked, Titanium Studio requires you to login every 24-48 hours in order to authenticate you for any modules used within your apps. We understand that not everyone will have constant net access, but a single login every other day hardly constitutes requiring constant internet access. </p>
<p>Even though there are no other questions in this particular thread, I will say that I&#39;ve noticed that in previous threads you seem to have possibly found bugs or working issues, yet I don&#39;t see any tickets or issues filed by you. Nor do I see a CLA, PR, or any other form of contribution with your name on it. You&#39;ve used the board to successfully rant about Titanium&#39;s shortcomings, yet you have done nothing to help identify and resolve the issues. As with any open source project, we rely on the community just as much as the community relies on us. Bugs can&#39;t be fixed unless they are brought to the attention of the Platform team dealt with properly. We rely heavily on our community for this. I guarantee that if you contribute your knowledge to the project, you&#39;ll get just as much out as you put in.</p>

										<p><p>ok this is the last one, after this I will stop ranting </p>
<p>Every 24-48 hours requires you to login is good enough to stop you WORKING. If you don’t have internet access or its block by firewall. I don’t understand what is “authenticate you for any modules”, I don’t use any and I just want to work on it, with or without internet access.</p>
<p>There’s one call <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.appcelerator.net&#x2F;p&#x2F;pages&#x2F;app_page?token=m4rZLSv6">TiDev</a>, and she doesn’t require you to login, nor she ask anything from you, that is the true meaning of open and community, and you’re just a commerce(don&#39;t deny) , you’re just exploit this community and the name of open source.</p>

							<p>Now that I got your attention, please fix those bugs, I&#39;m sorry about this ranting, I just got frustrated on my app. I can live with the login but I can’t live with those bugs, so please fix it, android is really important to me</p>
<p>and for now on I will report it to the Jira or CLA or PR (I thought posting here is reporting bug).</p>
<p>anyway thank a lot</p>
