			<h1>Newbie question: Can I do this with Titanium?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I need to create a simple mobile app, that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creates an SSH connection to an existing server, and creates a tunnel through it to its web server </li>
<li>Displays web pages from that server</li>
</ul>
<p>Can I do this with Titanium? Main target is Android although the reason for looking at Titanium is to not limit it.</p>

							<p>Displaying html pages from a server you can do.<br>But creating an SSH connection, you won&#39;t get such functionality <em>out of the box</em> I&#39;m afraid.</p>
<p>You will have to rely on a native module if you want to do that.</p>

							<p>I think yes, it is possible. Try <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openshift.redhat.com&#x2F;community&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;developing-mobile-apps-for-the-cloud-with-titanium-studio-and-the-openshift-paas">looking at this link which describe for redhat openshift module</a></p>

										<p><p>Thanks, I&#39;ll go and investigate that, it looks promising.</p>

										<p><p>Ashish, I think he means he wants <strong>the mobile application</strong> to create the SSH connection. Which is not possible.</p>
<p>The link you provided details on how to connect to an OpenShift server using SSH with Ti Studio. (its as if you took the keywords and just typed them in the search field. Of course, I may be wrong)</p>

										<p><p>@Christian, i have not used the open shift module, but as far as i know, RedHat Open shift module is for Titanium Mobile Application.</p>
<p>so i provided as a reference material, that may help in  finding some way to do similar kind of work.</p>
<p>One more thing i would like to say: who so ever is voting -ve must put comment as a reason as a developer antiquate at least.</p>

										<p><p>OpenShift can be used to develop and implements backend services for your Titanium applications. But <strong>in no way</strong> it used SSH as a connection type for mobile applications. (it is actually used for deployment and administration) </p>
<p>This is a comprehensible mistake, but I wanted to clear this up so Mark doesn&#39;t spend time on a wild goose chase.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the clarification, really appreciated!</p>
<p>Ok, so it seems like what I wanted to do is out. Maybe there&#39;s another way to do what I want, so I&#39;ll give a bit more info.</p>
<p>I have a linux box,  behind a firewall, but to which I have SSH access, and which runs a webserver.  I need to create an app that has access to the webserver. There is the potential to open up other ports but for security reasons I don&#39;t want to open up the webserver directly.  Tunneling through the SSH connection was an obvious option but I&#39;m open to other suggestions?</p>
