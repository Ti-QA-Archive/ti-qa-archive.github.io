			<h1>Can i make this in appcelerator?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>Im new to the development of apps and i&#39;ve got some questions.</p>
<p>First let me tell you about the app i need to make. As an intern at a company i need to develop an iPhone and Android app, they want me to create an app that is based on a existing CRM database.</p>
<p>-I need to get data from the database and show it on the iPhone, this data should be edited and send back to the database.</p>
<p>-Something like an auto sync, either the database or phone will sync with each other once in a while. </p>
<p>-When you are called on the phone it will also check the number in the database and if found the name is displayed instead of an unknow number. </p>
<p>-Speech, when i say search Jon, it will search for jon in the database. When i say call instead of search it will also execute.</p>
<p>These few requirements are ordered, with the first being a must have and the last as a nice option to have.</p>
<p>Question: as my question, can i make this in titanium appcelerator for both the iPhone and Android?</p>
<p>tnx in advance,<br>~Kami</p>

							<p>Speech cannot be done without developing a specific module.</p>
<p>I doubt that it is possible to catch the phone number.</p>
<p>You will have to build a webservice in order that your app communicate to your remote database</p>

<p>can appcelerator do speech for iPhone or Android or both? as you state i have to programm it differently by using the titanium.iphone.etc…?</p>
<p>i thought so that its not possible to change the incoming call module, is this possible in the native SDK tho?</p>

							<p>You could just make a mobile version of these pages, store them on your website, and then just put them in a webview in your app.</p>
<p>But yes, either way is possible.</p>

							<p>This is an old question for me, but for those interested in the app i created for <strong>iPhone</strong> with features and stuff here goes.</p>
<p><strong>CRM data</strong> sending request to webserver which reponds with an json string. Totally in love with this principle, send a HTTP request to a server and get the data you need.</p>
<p><strong>CRM data sync</strong> Instead of a sync, i created a hashtables, which represents all data a user recieved from the webservice. Reducing the amount of request to the server by ALOT. The more the user uses the app, it will use the webservice alot less and speeds it up alot more.</p>
<p>This does gives 1 disadvantage, the data in hashtables can become outdated. To resolve this i added a refresh button that simulates the first time you get data and adds it to the hashtables.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media</strong> Twitter, facebook, linkedin and foursquare updates. These are all shown in 1 list of updates. Only user related info is being shown, so that the list is still manage able.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media 2</strong> Showing comments on updates, in facebook you can have comments. These are shown and in addition you can leave a comment yourself. Meaning you can reply&#x2F;comment on an update.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media 3</strong> Creating new Updates for a social platform, this is something i&#39;m going to work on in the future.</p>
<p><strong>LinkedIn</strong> Viewing a linked in profile in full details AND connecting with the person in question. Meaning in this app you can add LinkedIn users to your LinkedIn account.</p>
<p><strong>Foursquare like places</strong> An window which shows something similiad to foursquare like places.</p>
<p><strong>Skype</strong> Verry important was the ability to use skype, after long long searching i finnaly was able to use call a skype account. Though its external just like calling an phone number.</p>
<p><strong>Catch being called</strong> Is not possible on iPhone, sadly.</p>
<p><strong>Speech</strong> As this was lowest priority, i havent looked into this anymore.</p>
