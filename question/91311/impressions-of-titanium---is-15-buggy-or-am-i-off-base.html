			<h1>Impressions of Titanium - is 1.5 buggy or am I off base?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am fairly new to Titanium, but an experienced developer in Java, and have developed native apps for the Android and iPhone.  I have been looking for a better solution than writing native apps on each platform, and evaluated Appcelerator Titanium and Adobe Air.  </p>
<p>I&#39;ve had Appcelerator Titanium Mobile downloaded for a couple days now.  Thus far, it has worked just enough to get me hooked and then is killing me with buggy behavior.</p>
<p>My experience started poorly when the Kitchen Sink 1.5.x examples failed to run on either iPhone or Android emulators.  I found the 1.4 Kitchen Sink, which did run.  I&#39;ve built a couple trivial screens which worked fine, but as soon as I tried to build anything powerful (a tab bar where one screen has a nav group), I ran into bug after bug after bug.  Some bugs are small (tab icons not displaying) and some are large.  I reached boiling point today when the Android emulator thew a Null Pointer Exception that referenced a line in the .js file that is a comment, while the iPhone emulator works fine.</p>
<p>I&#39;d like to hear from others who have been using Appcelerator – is this fairly normal behavior?  Is it related to the newly released (and possibly buggy) 1.5.x Titanium verions and older examples referencing 1.4 syntax? Or is the problem between the chair and keyboard?  </p>

							<p>Titanium can sometimes be a challenge to your temperament. But it really is a fairly immature, opensource and a free solution which actually do create wonderful apps. (I have done 4 in about 100 workhours)</p>
<p>Titanium is somewhat unbeatable in my opinion, but be prepared to struggle until you have figured out what works, and what do not. Even if titanium boast with the same code for Android and iPhone, expect to have plenty if(!isAndroid)&#39;s around your code.</p>
<p>I develop apps to iPhone&#x2F;iPad quickly on my Mac on the two wonderful iOS emulators. Porting the thing over to Android means tweaking, debugging and finding workarounds. More so in the 1.4 SDK than the 1.5</p>
<p>I suggest you to use a PC for Android development. In my opinion that is more stable than on the Mac. I sort of never got the emulator on the Mac working very well.</p>
<p>Titanium is not so buggy as it is nervous and unforgiving. Type one char incorrect and the whole chebang grinds to a halt. When all it coded correctly it actually works rather well.</p>
<p>I have been frustrated many times, struggling to the point i have traced every line to Titanium. Feeling stupid when I found the rather obvious mistake.</p>
<p>So, stay in there, expect to work a lot to map the whole thing, and indeed expect differencies between iOS and Android. Titanium is rather good, really.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m completely with Harald!</p>
<p>I&#39;d add that if your app should be cross platform (iOS + Android) you have to check it out on both platforms quite frequently. Sticking to one first (let&#39;s say iOS) and the porting it also to the other (let&#39;s say Android) it&#39;s a good way to loose your sanity ;-).</p>
