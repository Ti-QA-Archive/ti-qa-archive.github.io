			<p>Hi</p>
<p>Apols for all the newbie questions. Anyway…</p>
<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;viezel&#x2F;5781083">This Alloy module called codebird</a> includes the following line of code for its inclusion in an Alloy project:</p>
<p><code>var Codebird = require(&amp;#39;codebird&amp;#39;);</code></p>
<p>However, the download on GitHub is a file entitled:</p>
<p><code>gist5781083-df70651509ccf50a1e8b5159e100efe680aec469.tar</code></p>
<p>Which I can&#39;t get working with <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Using_a_Module">this documentation on module inclusion</a>.</p>
<p>Any advice?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>As you are using a Mac you should be able to simply download the file, open up the downloads folder and double-click the downloaded file.</p>
<p><strong>Tar</strong> is compressed file format (think zip), but you need special software on a Windows machine to open it (WinRar is a good choice), but the Mac supports it natively.</p>
<p>If you still cannot do this, then simply press the <strong>&lt;&gt;</strong> symbol in the top right of each of the two code snippets files, copy the code and then save use the name at the top of each of those two.</p>
<p>The compressed file simply contains those two files.</p>

										<p><p>Before you try and create your own module version either CommonJS or compiled CommonJS you should first of all learn how to use them.</p>
<p>As these are example test files, you would create a new classic default project and then replace the <strong>app.js</strong> from <strong>{appname}&#x2F;resources</strong> with the example <strong>app.js</strong> and save the other file in the same folder.</p>
<p>Run them and work out what they do and then how you are going to use them.</p>

										<p><p>Once you have worked out what you are doing with them you move on.  You mention you want to change them into a module, but the code is already a module.</p>
<p>As you can see from the top of the <strong>app.js</strong> the code is already being called as a standard CommonJS file - this is very normal.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> Codebird = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"codebird"</span>);
</code></pre><p>I am not sure if you have read about compiled modules and now you think you have to compile them, you do not - you can but you do not need to or have to.  There are very good reasons for creating compiled CommonJS modules - this is not one of them.</p>
<p>The need to install a zip file is irrelevant as you are not going to compile this module.</p>

										<p><p>Malcolm, hi. I can see what&#39;s happened now. With your help, particularly the line &quot;new classic default project&quot; I have managed to get this <em>module</em> running. Thank you. The problem I had before is that I had an Alloy project running, and these example files are set up for, as you said, a &quot;classic default project&quot;.</p>
<p>However, I come from a solid MVC background in other areas of programming, and am therefore very much aware of the benefits of such an approach and intend to continue with Alloy. I am trying to get to my index.xml Alloy file to either require() or include() codebird.js, and as I&#39;m sure you know, putting anyFile.js in an Alloy project&#39;s Resources dir. is not going to help.</p>
<p>Short question then, after the longish preamble: do you know how can I get this <em>module</em> running in an Alloy project?</p>
<p>And once again, thanks.</p>
<p>:)</p>

<p>CommonJS = a way to modularise code into reusable blocks (files in this case)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;CommonJS_Modules_in_Titanium">Guide for CommonJS Modules in Titanium</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The link you provided…</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Using_a_Module">Using a module</a></li>
</ul>
<p>… was for native compiled modules, this is why I thought you knew more than you did.</p>
<p>There are three main sorts of modules;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CommonJS</strong> - JavaScript</li>
<li><strong>Compiled CommonJS</strong> - Compiled CommonJS</li>
<li><strong>Native Module</strong> - Java or ObjectC code compiled into a format that can then be used in Titanium</li>
</ul>
<p>All three of these are accessed by the <strong>require</strong> keyword.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first one is the same type as used with <strong>Codebird</strong>, you will be able to tell these in the future as you can read and edit the code, they are placed inside your app code folder(s) and contain the phrase <strong>exports</strong> (usually at the bottom of the file</li>
<li>The second one you can create yourself, you take a straight CommonJS file and create a module project - this requires a little more experience - not because it is hard (tiny learning curve) but there needs to be a business rule reason to compile your CommonJS files.</li>
<li>The third version means you have experience in either native Java code or Native ObjectiveC code and you wish to extend the features of Titanium by exposing features from the Android or iOS SDKs - this requires much more experience and not for the faint hearted</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use the second or third versions then the module is installed in either your Titanium installation or your apps modules folder.</p>
<p>Many apps take advantage of these last two types as they provide things like iOS printing, barcode scanning, social networking and much more.</p>

							<p>OK bit of a breakthrough here, at last. I tried putting the two .js files in question in the app&#x2F;assets folder and <em>finally</em> they were copied across to the Resources folder <em>specifically in an Alloy project</em>. Makes some sense I guess. Anyway, I was able then to use the line:</p>
<p><code>Ti.include( &amp;#39;codebird.js&amp;#39; );</code></p>
<p>And successfully include the file in my index.js file. Thanks Malcolm, would not have been able to work that out without your &quot;new classic default project&quot; tip-off</p>
<p>:(   :|   :)   :D</p>

										<p><p>So you ignored the answer I gave you that provided you with the correct usage and does not use the <strong>include</strong> method that should not be in a MVC app.  You are also including a CommonJS file that should be used with the <strong>require</strong> method.</p>
<p>Richard, this time it <strong>was the wrong solution</strong> and <strong>certainly not</strong> the right answer.</p>
<p>I wish you luck and look upon my time trying to help you as wasted effort as you clearly do not want the answer you started off looking for and are more interested in patting your self on the back for finding an incorrect way to handle the code.</p>

										<p><p>Malcolm, hi.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sorry if I annoyed you, I&#39;m really not trying to. Your example was for a classic default app, but I need to use Alloy. Now, after reading your last post I&#39;ve gone back in to my Alloy app, substituted the include() for a require() and that works just as well. Better actually, although I won&#39;t bore you with the details of how or why. So let me stress <em>THANK YOU</em>.</p>
<p>When I read your posts above featuring the phrase &#39;CommonJS&#39; my first thought was &#39;uh, what is CommonJS?&#39;, my second was &#39;let me read what he wrote again and I can probably work that out&#39;, and my third, having read it three times, was &#39;OK I can&#39;t work out what CommonJS means, I&#39;m just gonna have to plough on and try to infer what it means from experimentation&#39;. A more ignorant way of expressing that would have been &#39;I&#39;ve no idea what he&#39;s on about, what terrible writing&#39;, which would probably have been the reaction of a younger me. Instead I thought &#39;OK, he assumes I know more than I do, I&#39;ll just have to struggle on with just the phrase &quot;new classic default project&quot; - which <em>I do</em> understand - to help me.</p>
<p>Which is a long way of saying:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sorry to have annoyed you;</li>
<li>Your advice has been really useful;</li>
<li>I couldn&#39;t have worked out how to do this in an Alloy project without downgrading to a classic project; and </li>
<li>I still don&#39;t know what &#39;CommonJS&#39; mean.</li>
</ul>

							<p>Malcolm, I should have been clearer with my question. I mean, when I open the .tar I get a dir. with two .js files in it. How do I then turn this&#x2F;these into a Module that I can use with the require(); function? The module installation documentation talks about putting a zip somewhere that Titanium Studio auto-unzips and puts somewhere. I have tried putting the .js and a .zip file in a bunch of places, but still cannot either require(); OR Ti.include(); them successfully.</p>
