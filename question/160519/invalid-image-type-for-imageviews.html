			<h1>Invalid Image type for ImageViews</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey Guys,</p>
<p>In my app, I&#39;m not sure if the file that&#39;s gonna be downloaded from the server is an image or not (but people are supposed to have only images). Is there a way to make image view not return an error when the file type that&#39;s passed in is not an image? I mean if the file wasn&#39;t an image the image view would just not view and image and not make the app crash.</p>
<p>Thanks guys,<br>Abdul</p>

<p>Where are these URLs coming from?</p>

							<div><p>Thanks for your replies guys. I&#39;m actually using the app as an FTP server and it&#39;s only supposed to receive images. So right now when a user send any file that&#39;s not an image the app crashes. So that&#39;s why haha.</p>

							<div><p>If I understand correctly what you are saying, I would, everytime you receive something from the server (download) check and see if the file is an image or not.  You can do this by checking the extensions of the file (.png, .jpg…etc).  If so, then set the ImageView to a default image you would have saved locally on your app, or just alert them that &quot;No image to be displayed or something&quot;.  Does this make sense?</p>
