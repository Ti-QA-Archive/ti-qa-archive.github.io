							<div><p>This is not a question. Are you expecting someone to write the code for you and post it back here for you to use? Try posting what you&#39;ve got so far and then asking for help if you get stuck.</p>

							<div><p>The problem with that Ashish, it&#39;s that the Q&amp;A&#39;s main function is to provide specific answers to specific issues other developers might have. Once a question had been marked as answered, other developers can benefit from the answer without having to ask the same question.</p>
<p>As many already mentioned here, <strong>this is not a forum</strong>. And this is not the place to exchange complete project code solutions explaining how to do them.</p>
<p>So Anthony&#39;s remark was on the spot regarding the fact that it was not a question per se.</p>

							<div><p>This is nonsense, you expect someone to code for you for free and you are happy eating doughnuts. </p>
<p>As a responsible Appcelerator Community member, you should try the code for once and if you face issues in understanding the code refer the good and crisp documentation available on developer.appcelerator.com. If you still face issues and is not able to grasp then post specific issue as a question. This is a community for developers to share knowledge and common issues faced and not a forum.</p>
<p>Last but not the least, TRY YOURSELF FIRST !!</p>
