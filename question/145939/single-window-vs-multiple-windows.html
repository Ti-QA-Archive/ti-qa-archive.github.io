			<h1>Single window vs Multiple windows</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I just wanted to ask what would be considered better practice and if there are any real advantages to using multiple windows, aside from the ability to transition between them on iOS.</p>
<p>My first Titanium project was a 2D game which really only needed a single window. Objects within the window would transform appropriately and be nulled out when they are no longer needed. My second app was a more full-scale application but I kept the same &#39;single window&#39; paradigm. Whenever the user moves from one screen to another, I swap the root view with a &#39;loading&#39; view, null out the root view to free up memory and then re-instantiate it. Are there any real disadvantages to doing it this way as opposed to using multiple windows?</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>Jay.</p>

							<p>There certainly are advantages and disadvantages in both ways.</p>
<p>When you need to create a tabbed project for example with lists that have children and get you to new windows on click, the best way is to use multiple windows. This way you keep the possibility to go BACK without having to recreate the previous window.</p>
<p>When you need to create simple applications that won&#39;t go far creating many windows (and most important, they don&#39;t have relation to the previous window) then you can use one window.</p>
<p>Your choice.</p>

							<p>Hi Jason, single window approach is considered better is most of the cases, and main advantage of this is that window object is a little heavy UI component than View.</p>
