			<p>Having fun with the tool all seems cool but where is the screen designer or have a missed something? I am new to iPhone&#x2F;iPad development being a Visual Studio developer, HashCode seems to be great in its visual approach but only produces web-app output nothing native.</p>

							<p>As opposed to a full blown WYSIWYG drag and drop gui editor, what about something like <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jsfiddle.net&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jsfiddle.net&#x2F;</a> ?<br>Imagine a simple web interface where you can write you code in one pane, and immediately see a sample of the results in another pane. Something like this would help a lot, and it should be far easier to develop than the WYSIWYG drag and drop interface. I&#39;m going to play around and explore this idea a little.</p>

							<p>The best option would be to write a WebApp  which lets us pick and place and resize  UI elements. And then generates the corresponding  Titanium API JS code for it.<br>This is on my list of things to do, but…not very high. Though it would speed dev time…</p>

							<p>I would say that an integrated debugger should be way up the list above a GUI designer - it&#39;s not that hard to do them by hand. Having said that I&#39;d be hopeful something might appear as an Aptana plugin, once the Ti-integrated version of that appears.</p>

							<p>Kevin,</p>
<p>I think you just made the justification !  Speeding up Dev time !  And along side that, eliminate coding errors where the visual design replaced hand coding. I think its a biggie. I know, many of us are coming from the woods of Visual Studio, but that is a development platform that has evolved due to the priority to create fast, error free development projects.</p>
<p>Whoa… and for those who will say &quot;Hey, I prefer to code by hand, its really the better way&quot;. Right-on bro, continue to do so !</p>
