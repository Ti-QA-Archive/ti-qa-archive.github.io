			<h1>Product purchase on iOS - Paypal?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>This is more of a compatibility&#x2F;iOS rules question. I&#39;ve googled this but I keep hearing different answers and I also know in the back of my mind that none of the answers may be quite accurate since the Appcelerator implementation of certain things may not line up with the pure ObjectiveC coding the way everyone talks about it online.</p>
<p>My question is simple:</p>
<p>Can the paypal modeul be used to purchase actual product (like clothes) in iOS? </p>
<p>The only reason why I&#39;m asking is because mixed in with the questions online about Apple&#39;s in-app purchasing doing this (which they say is a no-no, should only be used for app related stuff like upgrades, add-ons, etc.) is lots of people saying that <strong>anything product related</strong> has to be taken to the web(site?) for the purchase. Some even said it cannot be a webview within the App and that it had to go to the browser. So with that in mind, does anyone know if Apple rejects apps with the Paypal module used in the app to purchase non-app related stuff? And if so, is there a non-website solution?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I really hope so as I am currently building it into an app of my own.  As I read the rules (which are not clear) you can use the PayPal API&#x2F;module to pay for PHYSICAL goods.  You cannot use it for DIGITAL goods, for this you require In-App-Purchasing (IaP) - I know you know the difference, but wanted to state it for others.</p>
<p>As I understand it the web(site) rule is for those services that want you to sign up to access to something (think DropBox) that can have a paid element, but still digital.  This should be available as an IaP and if not then you have to do it on your own away from the app and you must not mention it within the app or allow access to it from within the app.</p>

<p>Great. That is what I thought I was understanding but it felt like trying to prove a negative at times.</p>
<p>That&#39;s a load off. Now I can resume my estimate&#x2F;quote for client. </p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
