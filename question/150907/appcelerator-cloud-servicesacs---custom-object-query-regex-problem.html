			<h1>Appcelerator Cloud Services(ACS) - Custom Object Query Regex Problem</h1>

		<section>
			<p>When did the team change the ACS Custom Object&#39;s regex query? </p>
<p>2 problems that I&#39;ve encountered now:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Back in last month(March 2013), my app was still able to perform query on the custom object with regex like this -&gt; &quot;.<em>keyword.</em>&quot;, now it returns error.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Also, the regex query won&#39;t work with chinese characters now. It was working fine back in March 2013.</p>
</li>
</ol>

							<p>Hi Gayler,</p>
<p>Regex is not a good practice when you have large data set. We recently enforced the regex rules to limit queries that can affect db performance.  We now require all regex strings starts with a none wildcard. We will look into how to support strings starts with Chinese character. Unfortunately .keyword. cannot be supported since it is problematic. It would only be possible if you have a smaller data set. Do you have a smaller dataset?</p>

										<p><p>I actually typed in &quot;.*keyword.*&quot;, the &quot;.keyword.&quot; was a mistype. However, I fixed the problem myself by using MongoHQ to store my ACS Custom Object ID-&gt;name mapping tables, which allows me to query for the IDs by using regex for name, and then query the ACS custom objects using the query service. I wonder &#39;cause my dataset is not big like up to million pages of documents which I don&#39;t really see any performance impact for my app for now. By using MongoHQ, I am able to perform query with option i and can query through the chinese characters now. So yeah, not a big problem for me already. Thanks though! Also, my name is Cayter….</p>

										<p><p>Hi Gayter,</p>
<p>Yes if it is small collection it is fine, but if your collection grows big, it will cause problem so it is not a permanent solution. We documented that all regex queries have to start with ^ but due to a bug in the code it was never enforced until recently when we noticed the performance impact. </p>
<p>Sorry about that and thanks for your understanding.</p>
