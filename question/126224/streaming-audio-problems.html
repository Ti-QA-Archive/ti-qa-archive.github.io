			<p>I&#39;ve been having a headache with Titanium&#39;s AudioPlayer control.</p>
<p>I have a streaming audio URL that automatically extracts the audio stream from a m3u8 feed. When I open it in my iPhone web browser, it plays it just fine through what looks like iPhone&#39;s built-in audio player.</p>
<p>However, when I use Titanium&#39;s AudioPlayer control (<code>Ti.Media.createAudioPlayer()</code>) to open the stream, I get an <strong>&quot;Unable to configure network read stream&quot;</strong> error.</p>
<p>Apparently, Titanium&#39;s audio player is not as capable as iPhone&#39;s built-in audio player. If that&#39;s the case, is there a way to use iPhone&#39;s audio player without having to open a new browser window?</p>
<p>Here&#39;s my audio stream for reference: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ahme-iphone-a.alburhan.tv</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Joel</p>

							<p>Part of the problem is that wowza is particular about the sessionid.<br>That id must be unique.  If the wowza server considers a request as non-unique (i.e.:2 clients request the same session id, the server throws the client back to a new .m3u8 with a new session id.  What you have here is essentially a recursive .m3u8 call which the player DOES have a problem handling at this time.  I can attest that it does handle non-recursive .m3u8 files pretty well (&#39;playlist of files&#39; vs &#39;playlist of playlists&#39;)</p>

										<p><p>Stephen,</p>
<p>I appreciate your prompt response, and I believe you&#39;ve helped me in the past with video feeds, for which I am very thankful.</p>
<p>Given what you&#39;ve said about the audio player, and the fact that the link works when launched from the iPhone&#39;s browser, regardless of how many devices connect simultaneously, is there any way to make use of iPhone&#39;s built-in audio player from within Titanium without having to open a browser window? If not, is there an alternative audio player that can handle this type of audio stream? I know that the stream itself is not a problem for the iPhone, but for the custom audio player that Titanium uses.</p>
<p>Any direction in this regard will be very appreciated.</p>

<li><p>Have you thrown the .m3u8 against the VideoPlayer instead of the AudioPlayer in titanium?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Before the .m3u8 started working in Titanium, we were looking at creating a custom module that would wrap the native Xcode multimedia code.  This was tabled as the current level of support in Titanium meets our current needs.  That is not to say that it meets our anticipated needs.  Our anticipated use of audio&#x2F;video streams will eventually require a complete matched between what the multimedia calls in the iOS classes offer and what Titanium exposes.</p>

										<p><p>Stephen,</p>
<p>Thanks so much for taking the time to answer my question. I think it would be very beneficial to wrap the native XCode multimedia code, as well as Android&#39;s equivalent.</p>
<p>For now, the VideoPlayer does work. Thank you.</p>
<p>Now, with the VideoPlayer, do you know if it&#39;s possible to keep the audio playing in the background when the app is minimized, just like can be done with the AudioPlayer? Also, is it possible for me to create special buttons to play and pause, while hiding the VideoPlayer?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Joel</p>

										<p><p>You can actually hide the videoplayer, and use custom controls. The background audio issue is one I&#39;m struggling with myself, and this post was about the only one adressing it and I have not yet found a solution.</p>
