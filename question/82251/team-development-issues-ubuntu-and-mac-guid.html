			<h1>team development issues ubuntu and mac, GUID</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I develop on a ubuntu machine and my partner uses a mac machine</p>
<p>I created a project and since I only have android installed configured it. my app is ready and shared the code with my partner, but he did not have the option to run the app in iphone emulator, though it is installed on his mac.</p>
<p>but if the app was created by him and he enabled both iphone and android sdk, it worked on my machine with android.</p>
<p>I have reviewed every source code and config file in the project and now I believe it has to do with GUID of the app and it is controlled by appcelerator.</p>
<p>what I have tried<br>i) I tried manually changing the GUID then the emulator options go away.<br>ii) I have created a new project on mac, and replaced only the resource folder from my project, the compilation starts but does not give any error and seems to hang</p>
<p>please suggest a way where I can salvage my completed project into a iphone deployable app</p>
<p>please also suggest a Team development workflow best practice</p>

							<p>This may be of some help: (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;9U2xKq)</p>
<p>Its the work-flow we use with multi-dev which allows us to have our own setup and also solves an issue we were having with the testing.</p>
