			<h1>iOS Module Build Failure: multiple methods named &#39;count&#39; found</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi All!  Got a native ios module building error that seems to my un-trained eye to be coming from the TiBase.h since the latest updates to xcode and titanium the other day.  To start, here&#39;s the abbreviated ComplieC error message:</p>
<hr>
<p>&#x2F;Users&#x2F;oli&#x2F;src&#x2F;xcode&#x2F;bcoveModule&#x2F;brightcove-ios-module&#x2F;Classes&#x2F;ComBrightcovePlayerViewProxy.m:39:5: error: multiple methods named &#39;count&#39; found with mismatched result, parameter type or attributes<br>ENSURE_ARG_AT_INDEX(callback, args, 1, KrollCallback);</p>
<p>…<br>&#x2F;Users&#x2F;oli&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx&#x2F;3.2.2.GA&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;include&#x2F;TiBase.h:149:45: note: expanded from macro &#39;ENSURE_ARG_AT_INDEX&#39;<br>if ([args isKindOfClass:[NSArray class]] &amp;&amp; [args count]&gt;index)</p>
<p>…<br>&#x2F;Applications&#x2F;Xcode.app&#x2F;Contents&#x2F;Developer&#x2F;Platforms&#x2F;iPhoneSimulator.platform&#x2F;Developer&#x2F;SDKs&#x2F;iPhoneSimulator7.1.sdk&#x2F;System&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Frameworks&#x2F;Foundation.framework&#x2F;Headers&#x2F;NSArray.h:16:1: note: one possibility</p>
<ul>
<li>(NSUInteger)count;</li>
</ul>
<p>…<br>In file included from Pods&#x2F;Brightcove-Player-SDK&#x2F;Headers&#x2F;BCOVCatalogService.h:13:<br>Pods&#x2F;Brightcove-Player-SDK&#x2F;Headers&#x2F;BCOVPlaylist.h:129:1: note: also found</p>
<ul>
<li>(int)count;</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Hopefully that demonstrates the basic issue, in TiBase.h There is a macro&#x2F;function&#x2F;whatever called ENSURE_ARG_AT_INDEX and it uses [args count] at some point, now for whatever reason it can&#39;t decide which count method to use, one from the basic foundation framework or one from a Pod package we&#39;re using for the brightcove video streaming SDK.  It&#39;s worth pointing out that this was working fine until the recent updates and it doesn&#39;t appear the brightcove sdk count method is in any way a new thing.</p>
<p>Now I&#39;m normally a python dev and obj-c is all new to me but in my mind the issue here is the ENSURE… method isn&#39;t being specific about where to get the count method it wants to use, whatever the equivalent is in this world!  Is this as I think an issue with titanium?  If not, is it a problem with the brightcove sdk (where as I say, it&#39;s not new) or a problem with the new xcode&#x2F;ios version?</p>

							<div><p>Oliver, want to clarify, you are attempting to wrap the Brightcove ios sdk into a titanium module, yeah? This is not a titanium module sourced from someplace else you are trying to build from source.</p>
<p>What was the tooling&#x2F;versions at the time this worked?</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to work out a test case for comparison.</p>

							<div><p>Hi Stephen, yes this is the brightcove ios sdk wrapped up into a titanium module, this was building and working in our test apps without issue until the last day or two, basically after the recent updates to xcode for 7.1 and titanium to 3.2.2.  The brightcove ios sdk was on the latest version 4.1.6 I believe.  I can probably send you the full output of the build.py script if that&#39;d help!  Thanks for looking!</p>

							<p>It appears that the problem is with the BrightCove module. We haven&#39;t heard others with this problem using Titanium without that module. I&#39;m sure we would have by now. Would you please contact the developer of that module to tell them they need to update their module?</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Tim, I&#39;ll give it a go, out of interest given that this isn&#39;t a new method in their SDK what is it they would need to change? Assuming renaming that method wouldn&#39;t be an option for them how can they stop something in the titanium codebase from seeing and trying to use it?</p>

										<p><p>SDK 3.2.2 added no new APIs. It was primarily a tooling update to work with the new Xcode and Google tools updates. There were a couple of fixes but nothing added on our part. I suspect that BrightCove hasn&#39;t updated to keep pace with iOS and its library changes. Beyond that, I can&#39;t help, sorry.</p>
