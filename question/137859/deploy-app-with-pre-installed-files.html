			<h1>Deploy app with &#34;pre-installed&#34; files</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi there</p>
<p>I have made an app which utilizes the ApplicationDataDirectory to store downloaded files (from my server).<br>The ApplicationDataDirectory is located in the &#x2F;data&#x2F;data&#x2F;[app_name]&#x2F;app_appdata folder.</p>
<p>I want some of these files to come &quot;pre-installed&quot; with the app to start with.</p>
<p>Where should I put these files in my project folder in order for them to be packaged in the app_appdata folder?</p>
<p>Best regards<br>Frederik</p>

							<p>Well, one way you could achieve this is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>You include those files in your app (in a directory of your choice) and you copy them the first the application is started. (if the files are already there, no need to copy them.)</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>Yes, this is a feasible solution.</p>
<p>Follow-up question:<br>How do I check whether this is the first startup of the app?</p>

										<p><p>For that, you could have many different approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>One would be to check if the files exist in the app data directory on every start. If they are not present, then it&#39;s your first run. In they are, then no action is needed.</li>
<li>On simpler (and probably faster) approach would be to set a property once the files have been copied. (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.0&#x2F;index.html#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.App.Properties">Here is the API Doc for Properties</a>). On every start, simply if the property has been set (<strong>startedOnce</strong> to true for instance). If the property hasn&#39;t been set (yet), that means the user is on his fist start. If the property is already set, then there is no action to perform. Properties are lightning fast, so accessing them on every startup won&#39;t have any significant effect.</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>Use the app.properties to set a flag that you can check at each start up.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">firstRunInstall</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span>{</span>
 // Put code <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">copy</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">files</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">on</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">first</span> run

 // Set our flag
  Ti.App.Properties.setBoolean(<span class="hljs-string">'notFirstRun'</span>, true);
}
</code></pre><p>then you can do something like:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">if <span class="hljs-list">(!Ti.App.Properties.hasProperty<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-quoted">'notFirstRun</span>')</span>{
  firstRunInstall<span class="hljs-list">()</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
}</span>
</code></pre></p>

										<p><p>Pay attention to what Christian said there.  App.Properties are pretty fast.  A file.exists() call is not.</p>

							<p>Another thing to bear in mind:  the Resources folder on the device is read-only (though not on the emulator), so any files you copy to a data directory will consume twice the amount of memory.  Once in the resources folder (which you cannot delete after the copy since it is read-only) and once in your data directory.</p>
<p>If the app does not need to modify the files, I suggest you just use them from the resources directory.  From the description, it is not clear whether the app needs to be able to modify them or only access them.  Media files are a prime candidate of things you might be downloading but need simply read-only access.</p>
<p>If you modify your logic to let them select files from either your data directory or resources directory (and that could be transparent to the user), then you save yourself the effort of copying the files plus you do not waste filesystem space for a second copy.</p>
<p>If that is not feasible in your scenario, then instead of copying them I would suggest compressing them into a zip file in your resources folder and extracting that to the data directory.  Depending on how well they compress, you&#39;d have at least some savings plus the initial app install would be smaller.</p>
<p>For iOS, I personally use <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;TermiT&#x2F;ZipFile">this</a> module to decompress but there are other options in the marketplace.</p>
