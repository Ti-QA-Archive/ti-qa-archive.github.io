			<h1>Led-light while BarCode scanning?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I noticed in http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;43721&#x2F;activate-iphone-4-led-light that there should be a possibility in iPhone to turn on the led light, while using it as a camera. Comments indicate that turning on the led does not seem to work, though it does work via an XCode example project, just as it is possible in the Android-ADK. </p>
<p>I&#39;d like to know if it is possible to use the led with barcode scanning. I need to do barcode scanning in low-light situations.</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve tried manually inserting code (at least for iOS) but it does not seem to work - for LED or flash.  In reading some of the other posts and responses from AppC and the KitchenSink, it seems that the LED light is only available for video recording and flash for a natural camera photo capture.  I asked Dev Relations about this, and they have put in an enhancement request, link below - although not currently visible externally.  I specifically requested the flash capability for my purposes, but perhaps it could be updated to include an LED option.</p>

							<p>Barcode scanner is an electronic device for reading printed barcodes. Like a flatbed scanner, it consists of a light source, a lens and a light sensor translating optical impulses into electrical ones. Nearly all barcode readers contain decoder circuitry analyzing the barcode&#39;s image data provided by the sensor and sending the barcode&#39;s content to the scanner&#39;s output port. Based on my experience, it may be impossible to use led with barcode scanning.<br><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rasteredge.com&#x2F;how-to&#x2F;vb-net-imaging&#x2F;read-barcode-vb-net&#x2F;">inline Barcode Scanning Tutorial</a></p>

										<p><p>A <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.keepautomation.com&#x2F;how_to&#x2F;barcode_scanners&#x2F;">barcode scanner</a> is only something which is installed between your keyboard and workstation. That way it doesn&#39;t matter if you enter the code by hand or using the scanner: you click in the field which needs the code to be entered to get the focus on it, next you scan your code. The only problem might be that after scan there&#39;s no automatic submit, so you need to click a button then. Didn&#39;t follow the link, so it might have some other solution.</p>
