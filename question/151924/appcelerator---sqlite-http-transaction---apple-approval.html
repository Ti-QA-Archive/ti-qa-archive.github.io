			<h1>appcelerator - sqlite http transaction - apple approval</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m developing an application in Titanium Appcelerator for IOS that will need to work also offline. For that, I need an sqlite database that needs to be synced with the online one. I chose the quickest way of doing this process, by sending the sqlite file and saving it into my application. This is a process that happens once per month.</p>
<p>My question is: Am I allowed to transaction this sqlite file? Would it be approved?</p>

<p>In 4+ years of doing this, never heard such a thing. Were it true, Facebook would be long gone.  Apple dislikes unnecessary http calls.</p>

										<p><p>Also, regarding approval process.  The reviewer can reject your app just because they dont like you, and not much you can do about it. (yeah, you get a nice answer back about look&#x2F;feel&#x2F;etc)</p>

										<p><p>Thank you very much for your answer. My question was based on a previous experience when I was trying to build an web app based on sencha and trying to load external js files. I&#39;m aware that is a different situation here.</p>
