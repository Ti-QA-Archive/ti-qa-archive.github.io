			<p>This is not a question actually, more a reflection.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve played with Titanium for a couple of months now, targeting both iPhone and Android, creating both dummy-apps and a commercial application. I had some headaches with the android SDK in the beginning but looking back some of them where related to my environment (windows7 - x64 - subversion). Of course, the android SDK lacked a lot of functionality but with 1.5 that has changed to a lot better.</p>
<p>However - to my point. What I missed as a rookie, and still, is nice tutorials and books. Sure I have the Kitchensink, which is the saviour most of the times, but it doesn&#39;t give me all the fun ideas to begin with.<br>When I started doing native android development I read a ton of tutorials and bought some books. Then I used their ideas and enhanced them or twisted them around a little and learned a lot from it.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&#39;s just because I&#39;m not a Javascript guru from the beginning. I guess it would have been a lot easier to start developing a side-scroller shooter or a recipe app in Titanium if you had done it on the web before!?</p>
<p>Anyway, keep up the good work, and if you get a book or any advanced tutorial printed, I&#39;ll certainly buy it.</p>
<p>Regards<br>Stefan </p>
