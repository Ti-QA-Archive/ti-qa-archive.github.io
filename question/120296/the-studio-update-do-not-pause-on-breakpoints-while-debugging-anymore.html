			<h1>The studio update do not pause on breakpoints while debugging anymore</h1>

		<section>
			<p>I just updated the new studio, automatic update, – great program, by the way. Unfortunately I am not capable to break at a line while debugging.  The last version was working fine.  Is that only me or is there a bug?</p>

<p>Can you tell me, is your debug button enabled (not grayed out)?</p>
<p>When you click on it, does it launch the app again?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Can you tell me which update sites you have enabled? ie, static, beta and&#x2F;or nightly updates.</p>
<p>Also, have you subscribed to any of the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;plans-pricing&#x2F;">plans</a>?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Upcoming changes to the way debugging works in TiStudio have been included in the Nightly and Beta updates, but not the Stable ones.</p>
<p>To be clear, debugging will only be available to developers with an Indie subscription or above, after the official TiStudio release at the beginning of July. For details about the differences between the upcoming Titanium Studio <em>Standard</em> (the Community version) and <em>Premium</em>, see the announcement about them <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;05&#x2F;major-titanium-updates.html#tistudio-std">here</a>.</p>
<p>To hopefully resolve your problem in the meantime, you can disable the Beta and Nightly sites and roll back the last, most recent, updates using the plugin manager. Alternatively, my preference would be to reinstall with only the Stable update site enabled.</p>
<p>Let me know if this helps</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

							<p>Paul, thank you for the time you spent answering my question.  </p>
<p>So if I get it right, debugging will be available only for Indie and up subscriptions.  This is pretty sad, considering that Titanium will then hold absolute control of the developing platform prices, as a subscription.  We will never own our working tools!  So all that work learning the SDK will be tied up to the good will of the company.  This is pretty cold.</p>
<p>Happily (???) Adobe has been approved by Apple, for app development, so we get a &quot;choice&quot; in between both platforms.</p>
<p>I sure hope you guys will not do changes like this too often, especially without notification…</p>
<p>By the way I lost some 8 hours trying to fix that undocumented change of mind and try to make that api debug for me.</p>

<p>Do you have the debugger working now?</p>
<p>If not, did you try reinstalling with only the Stable update site enabled?</p>
<p>Would you please ensure that you are using the latest 1.7.X <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Continuous+Builds">Continuous Build</a> when launching your app?</p>
<p>I&#39;d be really interested to hear how it goes.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>PS. it makes it really difficult for others to follow the conversation if you answer your own questions. The comment facility is the best way to post responses. Thanks in advance for keeping this in mind.</p>
