			<p>I found the article interesting: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tidev.io&#x2F;2014&#x2F;09&#x2F;18&#x2F;cleaning-up-alloy-controllers&#x2F;?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRonvqjMdO%2FhmjTEU5z17eokXaKwi4kz2EFye%2BLIHETpodcMTcNnPLHYDBceEJhqyQJxPr3DL9YN1N13RhnlCQ%3D%3D">link</a></p>
<p>It recommends to call $.off() after the controller is no longer needed.</p>
<p>The question is this:</p>
<p>If I call $.on() somewhere, even if all the references to the controller are removed, the controller will remain in memory, as well as all its UI objects, until I call $.off()?</p>
<p>I know with Titanium&#39;s addEventListener(), I don&#39;t have to worry about it, right? I mean, if no more references to the object, the object will be garbage collected, and all the event listeners added to it are automatically removed. Right?</p>
<p>I did run memory allocation instrument to test the $.on() scenario. I found no leak! So $.off() is redundant? I&#39;m confused….</p>

							<div><p>i&#39;d also like to see a very detailed article about this type of memory management. I&#39;m currently developing an Android app and I&#39;m expecting its slow performance and buggy features has to do with some sort of memory problem. On iOS it runs like a charm.</p>
<p>I have yet to implement a cleanup system for controllers, i really think an app benefits from it, but for now its very unclear to me what exactly stays in memory and what gets collected. Sidenote: my app basically consists of 1 window in which I load other views. This basically means i have no window stack because I need to be able to hide views and keep their state (see it as a custom sidescroll&#x2F;tablayout)</p>
