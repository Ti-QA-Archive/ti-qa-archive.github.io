			<h1>dynamically grow scrollView (for feature: very long A-Z index view)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all!</p>
<p>Is there any way to dynamically add space to the <strong>TOP</strong> of a scrollView? Unfortunately, if I increase the contentHeight the space usually will always be added to the bottom.</p>
<p>If not - is there any way to move the focus of a scrollView (contentOffset) immediately, i.e. <strong>WITHOUT</strong> animation? I though about circumventing the problem by increasing the contentHeight (and thereby adding space to the bottom), then moving an embedded view container downwards (by increasing its &quot;top&quot; property) and finally jumping the focus downwards (by applying &quot;scrollTo&quot;). However the scrolling animation is really disturbing…</p>
<p>For your background: The final aim of all this is to create an A-Z-index table of possibly thousands of entries (derived from a database) inside a scrollView. It should grow dynamically while the user scrolls upwards or downwards. Preloading the index is not an alternative since creating an tableView of e.g. 20.000 rows takes much too much time… :-(</p>
<p>Any help appreciated!</p>
<p>Simon</p>

							<p>Simon, Have you ever found a way to do this? I am currently doing something similar due to perfomance issues. I am still finishing it up but I will let you know if I get something good.</p>

							<p>I needed something similar to this - but in the middle of the view.  I created a child view and added it to the appropriate location in the parent view.  Then later when I needed to &quot;insert&quot; content, I just added it to the child view.  Worked perfectly.  I do not see why this would not work to &quot;insert&quot; content at the top of the parent view - although I have to admit I have not tried it there, yet.</p>
