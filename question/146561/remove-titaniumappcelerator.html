			<p>I am attempting to remove&#x2F;uninstall Titanium&#x2F;Appcelerator. However , in add&#x2F;remove programs (programs in Win 7), even though it goes thru the motions of uninstalling, nothing is removed. On the second screen of add remove, it shows a box with the label &quot;…programs will be removed from this folder&quot;, but there is nothing in the text box and it will not accept input. I then used uninstall from Titanium studio which removed  only the application. I want to remove the existing copy of titanium studio, appcelerator and all associated files and re-install since I encountered so many errors and omissions in the simple tutorials. Any help will be appreciated</p>

							<div><p>Doc,</p>
<p>Im sorry to hear that you had some issues with your first install. This happened to me when I first installed Titanium on my PC (Windows 7) (it turned out to just be inconstancies with my SDK locations). I reinstalled after removing the Titanium with the Add&#x2F;Remove but I don&#39;t remember bumping into any issues like the one you are describing. Try the steps here:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techradar.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;news&#x2F;software&#x2F;applications&#x2F;10-tips-for-removing-a-program-that-wont-uninstall-907471</p>
<p>Or a simple reinstall should overwrite the program and you should be ok to go. Do you remember the issues that you encountered? I would like to help you out until you are up and running with Titanium. Let me know if you have anymore issues. </p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Carter</p>
