			<h1>Permit non-technical colleague to try app?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all - I&#39;m a relative newbie. I have an app I&#39;ve developed and can run it on my own iPhone using the documented procedures. I would like to be able to permit a colleague to try it also. She&#39;s not in this office, so I can&#39;t just plug her iPhone into my laptop, nor is she technical enough to manage a Titanium deployment on her own laptop. How can I simply (I&#39;m an optimist) enable her phone and get that app uploaded for her use? Would appreciate your advice. Thanks!</p>

							<p>Just to add a bit more detail, there are two types of distribution provisioning available for the standard Apple Developer account. One is for distribution through the app store, and one is for &quot;Ad-hoc&quot; distribution which is what you need. When you create your distribution provision, make sure you use the &quot;Ad-hoc&quot; distribution option, then build your app with that. Deliver the provisioning file with the app to your colleague.</p>

							<p>Login to the Apple Developer site and go to the Provisioning Portal. Create a distribution certificate and distribution profile, then import these into your keychain and xcode respectively. Then generate an ipa of your app tied to that distribution provisioning profile using either Ti Studio or XCode. </p>
<p>You can give her the provisioning profile file as well as the ipa. She can import both into itunes then sync her phone with that.</p>
<p>Another option is to use <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;testflightapp.com">TestFlight</a>, which is a great way to distribute apps to people within your company.</p>
