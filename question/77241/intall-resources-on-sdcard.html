			<h1>Intall resources on sdcard</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;m developing an application for android and later Iphone that will be displaying content (video, audio, text and images).</p>
<p>There is more than likely going to be allot of content.<br>Initially the content will need to be installed and loaded from the sdcard as there will not be enough room on the target device&#39;s built in memory plus the application size will be ridiculous. (this application initially won&#39;t be available to the publc, so I could simply copy the folder over myself but would prefer it to be copied on install)</p>
<p>How do I get the application to install the contents to a folder on the sdcard?</p>
<p>I have seen some posts about reading from the sdcard and presume it would be similar.</p>

<p>Sometimes it&#39;s not easy to know what to search for.  Try <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;search&#x2F;externalStorageDirectory">externalStorageDirectory</a></p>
<p>There is also an example of its use in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_mobile&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;demos&#x2F;KitchenSink&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;examples&#x2F;filesystem.js">filesystem.js</a><br>Hope this gets you to the answer</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the reply and suggestion Hal.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll have a look at that.<br>I&#39;m finding it a bit tricky at the moment especially with my lack of proficiency in programming.</p>
<p>I can read it and understand, I can do the monkey see monkey do, but I can get sidetracked and overwhelemed by the list of functionalities I must figure out.</p>
<p>I have to remind myself one step at a time, line by line, function by function.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, don&#39;t be disheartened - it happens to all of us. :)<br>The key is &quot;little by little&quot; and, over time, that will build into solid experience.</p>
<p>Would you mind closing the question if you feel the answer is adequate? Thanks</p>

							<p>hey kevin ,</p>
<p>i am with you on this ,that is one nice question … </p>
<p>Hal&#39;s links were cool to give basic knowledge but they weren&#39;t the answers…</p>
<p>coming to your question… i kinda think installing things to your sdcard <strong>during installation</strong> aint possible(as far as i know-@community pls correct me if i am wrong)…but there is always a way,</p>
<p>may be you can just let the resources be on the resources directory during installation…</p>
<p>but when the user fires up the app the first time (only the first time after a fresh install) write a small helper method that would do the work of copying all your resource files from resource dir(phone mem) to the sdcard during the root window open event…</p>
<p>hope this works … [stay connected if you cant figure it out as i will be working on this in a couple of days as my project depends on this as how yours does…]</p>

							<p>Sattanaathan Ravi Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>Initially I will be able to physically put a folder on the sdcard and have the app read content from there. As this application will initially only be available on devices within a facility. At a later stage if it goes to market I will look at having the resources online and streamed.</p>
<p>Having the resources folder bundled with tha app is not an option for me as the content could get up to a gig or possibly more.</p>
<p>@Hal thanks for the support.</p>
