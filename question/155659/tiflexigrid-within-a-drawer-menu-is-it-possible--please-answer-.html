			<p>Hi guys !!!<br>Im a student and i currently working on a android development project.<br>I decided to try out titanium studio with alloy framework as my project engine.</p>
<p>Nao since i got dis two AMAZING sample app (&quot;TiFlexiGrid &amp; &quot;Drawer Menu&quot;) and both created with different widget. </p>
<p>Basically, my idea is juz pushing the TiFlexiGrid gallery into this Drawer Widget mainview, But as both of them were require a window to perform task, so is it not possible for me to integrate them together ?</p>
<p>Heres are those sample apps:<br>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ricardoalcocer&#x2F;alloy-widget-drawermenu (by ricardoalcocer)<br>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pablorr18&#x2F;TiFlexiGrid (by pablorr18)</p>
<p>I hv tried to change the required window into &quot;view&quot; instead or pushing the TiFlexiGrid Widget functions and stuff into the drawer widget and still cant get it done… did i get sth wrong with dat ? or it juz not possible to integrate two widgets into one ? </p>
<p>Im quite new to this software :) Hope someone could help me out with this! THANKS A LOT!</p>

							<p>Hi!</p>
<p>First of all, thanks for using my widget (TiFlexiGrid). </p>
<p>You can integrate two widgets, depending how they were created. What are you trying to accomplish? Like a Gallery-Style menu or something? Maybe I can tweak my widget a little to make it work with the Drawer Widget, depending what are you trying to accomplish.</p>

										<p><p>WHAOOO !! Thanks a lot for your reply Pablo. I never thought the author of widget would reply me this !! TRUE HONOR 2 ME :P</p>
<p>Currently, my idea is to locate the TiFlexiGrid into one of the page &#x2F; mainview of drawer widget. Once I click a button or swipe :P, it would bring out a drawer menu from the left with list of navigation button or link (like youtube or facebook navigation drawer). So i can click them to navigate other pages or mainviews.</p>
<p>I really love the design from your TiFlexiGrid :D !!! So i hope you could lead me how to do this<br>(No matter could I finally get this done on my school project :P still thanks again for your AMAZING widget creation. That was so awesome!)</p>
