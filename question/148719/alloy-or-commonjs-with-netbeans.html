			<h1>Alloy or CommonJS with Netbeans</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi friends</p>
<p>I am an old Titanium developer been using it since 1.2 SDK.For last one year I have not done any development and found about certain changes like introduction of <strong>CommonJS</strong> and now <strong>Alloy</strong></p>
<p>Now how do I use non Titanium Studio environment to use one of these frameworks. Alloy uses nodeJS how is it different than 2 years old Titanium development.</p>

							<p>The Ti SDK doesn&#39;t require you to use Studio. You could write your whole app in Textmate if you want. You forego some of Studio&#39;s integrated features like the compiler and code-sense, but there&#39;s always Ti CLI to compile on the command line.</p>

										<p><p>oh, and for a quick walkthrough on how to start an alloy project, you can view my <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dropbox.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;fvduidfkns66khe&#x2F;create_alloy_project.mov">screencast here</a>. Of course, it assumes using Studio as the IDE, but it may help you understand what&#39;s new about it.</p>

										<p><p>Alloy does not require TiStudio either. The <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Alloy_Quick_Start">quick start guide</a> shows how to get started without it.</p>

										<p><p>@Michael your screen was cool but not completed :(. However it did give me an overview about Alloy.</p>
<p>The example you give is about Single Window and View, how about multiple Windows, calling them and views?</p>

										<p><p>@Adnan Not sure what you mean &quot;not completed&quot;. It was simply meant to serve as an introductory primer for starting an Alloy application – nothing more. As for which is quicker, Alloy vs. CommonJS, that would depend totally on the individual. Each have their merits. If it were me, I would start with Alloy because it&#39;s new and many folks would probably have the same questions as you making it easier to get timely responses. Thank you for your renewed interest in Appcelerator.</p>
