			<h1>TideSDK | Bundle Packaging</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am now ready to package my application, but I&#39;m having problems with the network type installer.</p>
<p>It always gives me code 404 on the Application first run:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-label">Could</span> not query <span class="hljs-preprocessor">info</span>: Invalid HTTP Status <span class="hljs-preprocessor">Code</span> (<span class="hljs-number">404</span>)
</code></pre><p>I presume the installer is having difficulty with reaching the correct servers and downloading the needed runtime, but I have run through most solutions on this forum, and none have worked.</p>
<p>So I tried a bundle packaging, as it should include such runtime, but I must be doing something wrong, since it does not bundle within the MSI.</p>
<p>The code I&#39;m executing is as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">C:<span class="hljs-command">\TideSDK</span><span class="hljs-command">\sdk</span><span class="hljs-command">\win</span>32\1.2.0.RC6d<span class="hljs-command">\tibuild</span>.py -p --type=BUNDLE --os=win32 "C:<span class="hljs-command">\path</span>_to_app<span class="hljs-command">\app</span>_dir"
</code></pre><p>I also tried:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">C:<span class="hljs-command">\TideSDK</span><span class="hljs-command">\sdk</span><span class="hljs-command">\win</span>32\1.2.0.RC6d<span class="hljs-command">\tibuild</span>.py -p -t bundle --os=win32 "C:<span class="hljs-command">\path</span>_to_app<span class="hljs-command">\app</span>_dir"
</code></pre><p>And all the uppercase&#x2F;lowercase combinations. Also tried version 1.2.0.4, without sucess.<br>Am I doing something wrong?</p>

										<p><p>As Aaron pointed out, you&#39;ll need to look to the TideSDK community for help. TideSDK is no longer an Appcelerator project and is not fully controlled by the TideSDK dev community.</p>

										<p><p>@Aaron, @Anthony: I suggest this Q&#x2F;A system should display a message about tidesdk when users add the tags &quot;desktop&quot; or &quot;tidesdk&quot; to their question, so such questions could be avoided in future.</p>

										<p><p>Hi guys. There is a wealth of questions and answers on the Appcelerator Q &amp; A here. TideSDK is growing out from the original Titanium Desktop SDK and is certainly of interest of Titanium developers in general everywhere. Appcelerator&#39;s focus on mobile did not cease the interest of thousands of developers within the Titanium community for a solution (and confortable API ) for desktop.  The numbers of page views to our site and documention at <a href="[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;TideSDK.org">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;TideSDK.org</a> attest to this. On Friday, we were serving more than 3000 pageviews on the site and approximately 8200 page views on the documentation site for the day.</p>
<p>TideSDK is a community driven solution. Despite the fact it is no longer managed by Appcelerator, the community of Titanium users was the reason for the birth of the TideSDK organization and the continuation of the solution. While the Appc Q &amp; A may not be the best means of seeking support  for TideSDK (as TideSDK develops its own support channels), it remains important from my view as &#39;the&#39; source of  important legacy of information. It also remains a relevant avenue for touching base with the community of Titanium developers on developments with TideSDK that are important and of community interest.</p>
<p>After all, the solution for Titanium developers did not cease or disappear, it only transitioned from a solution managed directly by Appcelerator to one now managed by the community and a dedicated team of folks to ensure its long term future.</p>
