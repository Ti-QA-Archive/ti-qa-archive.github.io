							<p>The answer is found in the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Titanium_Compatibility_Matrix">Titanium Compatibility Matrix</a> for TiMobile 3.0.</p>
<p>3.0 is only supported on 10.7 (lion) through 10.8 (mountain lion) at this time.</p>
<p>If you are running 10.6 you need SDK 2.1.4 and earlier.</p>
<p>I wasn&#39;t going to answer this because honestly, you are making a horses rear end of yourself in these forums, however, others will see your rant and they may need an answer.</p>
<p>Additionally, in the future, there is a proper format that is recommended for asking questions to speed answering and assistance:</p>
<p>I suggest you take a look at the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Using+Questions+and+Answers">Using Questions and Answers</a> article, specifically the Q&amp;A Question Checklist.  The missing information is critical to reproducing problems in a test environment and often indicates other factors that cause the undesirable outcome you are experiencing.</p>

							<p>Couple things. First, please don&#39;t repost questions, especially if someone has spent any amount of time trying to help you. It fragments the question and splits the data which make it all hard to track.</p>
<p>Second, when you start arguing with people, especially someone like Malcolm, it will make others less likely to want to help you. We do have a large community, but just like any community, there are the people who go above and beyond and ultimately gain a bit more respect than your average community member. Malcolm just happens to be one of those kats. Just something to keep in mind for future reference.</p>
<p>Now, with all that out of the way. I see that you&#39;re using Studio 3.0.1, and on Snow Leopard. Double check to see if you&#39;re using a compatible sdk as well. Since you are on OSX 10.6, it is compatible only with 2.1.X versions of the SDK and earlier. Just make sure that you&#39;re checking out the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Titanium_Compatibility_Matrix">Titanium Compatibility Matrix</a> and that the versions you have installed and are building with are compatible with each other and your current OS.</p>

							<p>So</p>
<p>I am going to try and help you one last time, I hope you can keep your response to the facts of the issue.</p>
<p>Can you try the following - even if you have already done these - it is about ruling things out.</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the latest studio, there was a minor tweak in the last 24 hours</li>
<li>Create a brand new project &quot;Titanium Classic &gt; Default Project&quot;</li>
<li>Compile that</li>
</ul>
<p>Provide the full (even if limited) console log</p>

										<p><p>As I stated above (which must have been skimmed over), I am using using T. Studio 3.0.1.201212181159 (&lt;– notice the last 12 numbers?) with Snow Leopard OSX (10.6.7), 5.0 IOS, and 4.2 XCode.

										<p><p>You simply cannot help yourself with your attitude and unwillingness to help rule out what is going on.</p>
<p>You clearly do not want my help, so you get your wish - I am no longer going to help you.</p>
<p>So by all means mark me down, suggest my attempts to help you have been pointless.  But I am off to help those here that want to actually be helped and do not use insults and a bad attitude as some strange way of solving your problems.</p>
<p>Good Luck - I only hope for your sake that someone else is willing to put up with your poor attitude.</p>
<p>I give up on you.</p>

							<p>My answer now… I am removing your app from my system and want my account closed and information deleted. Primary reason, no visual user interface development system… paying for an addon isn&#39;t worth it to me. BTW, your matrix contradicts itself which adds to the confusion… check Xcode and OSX… under OSX,  Titanium does work with OSX 10.6 with [Titanium] SDK 2.1.x and earlier but under IOS Xcode, [Titanium] SDK 2.14 - latest. (Min Xcode version 4.2 to Max Xcode 4.5.2.</p>
