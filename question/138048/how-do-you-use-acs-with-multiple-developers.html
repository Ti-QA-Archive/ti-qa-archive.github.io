			<h1>How do you use ACS with multiple developers?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Looking and excited to utilize ACS services for a mobile app, but stumped a bit at the idea that an ACS-enabled application &quot;lives&quot; under my developer account. How do we have multiple person development teams and eventual client owners interact and get assigned access? Specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A. How do I give my fellow developer team members access to the ACS management website for the new app? Seems essential to peer into the log, users, objects that we&#39;re creating in development&#x2F;testing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>B. Eventually we&#39;d transfer to our &quot;client&#39;s account&quot; (which of course they don&#39;t yet have). I&#39;m guessing we&#39;d just &quot;start&quot; with a new account and new appkey, and clean DB at that point. Any way to migrate any existing data into that? Or change the &quot;owner&quot; of an existing application once it hits production? Or heck even while still in development, like if the developer-account-owner leaves the team for example?</p>
</li>
<li><p>C. Are there any associated permissions that come into play, assuming more than one person can access the application management console in ACS?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Very curious to hear official and reality stances on this - I can&#39;t seem to find this topic being discussed, so pointers to anything would be much appreciated. thanks!</p>

							<div><p>Jeff, interested in how you got on, or whether you received any other advice. I have some client enquiries about apps which would have ACS - the api documentation gives loads of detail - but it is the administration of the app which is unclear for me. I think I&#39;m missing the overall concepts of ACS, but also for example, from where would my client send a push notification, for example - I am under the impression this has to be built in to the app itself as an admin feature, or in to a website using the REST apis - is that correct? Many thanks for raising the topic, and for any further info.</p>

							<p>We just create a separate account for each client.</p>
<p>At this point you will need to write shell scripts to migrate data or pre load data</p>
<p>I believe there is work being done to support ACL and the concept of &quot;Administrators&quot;</p>

										<p><p>yes we do. Also from a security perspective it might just be better to keep clients data seperate</p>
