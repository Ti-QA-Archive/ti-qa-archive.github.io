		<section>
			<p>I have one idea in my mind, which is using noSQL that stores inside of the program.<br>What would be the better idea to store the tokens or important information such as ID and PASSWORD other than using noSql? I don&#39;t think SQLite is suitable. Also, App.Property isn&#39;t proper one either, because the information stored in App.Property will be erased once Application terminates. Am I correct?</p>
<p>I think this topic is important! Any advice would be really great!</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

							<p>App.Properties is persistent. As long as you don&#39;t delete the app or overwrite&#x2F;delete the property yourself, App.Properties remains stored on device.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you for clarifying it. So App.Properties would be great way to store tokens. This is another question I have. Do I just need to save user&#39;s access token for later use and restore their login info whenever they open the application? Thank you, Dan.</p>
