			<h1>Allow user to retrieve lost password</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have created a password protected area in my app.  It works fine, but what I&#39;m not sure how to handle is if they lose their password. The password is stored in properties.  I wanted to be able to send the password to an email, but it appears I cannot send an email without going through a server, and I don&#39;t want to maintain a server dedicated to this.  Using the email dialog is not an option, because then the message can be seen by anyone who chooses the send password option.  Is my assessment correct?  Is there another option I&#39;m not thinking of?</p>

							<p>Hi Kris,<br>I am agreed with Stephen, but i think you should use appcelerator cloud services to register user for that particular area of you app which is password protected. when user forgets their password then you can easily send a password reset link to their registered email id&#39;s via ACS only. Please feel free to ask if any problem.</p>

							<p>You should never store the unencrypted version of the password and you should never send it by email. You open yourself up to all sorts of security compromise scenarios if you do either. Instead, create a password reset system by which folks receive some sort of reset key. They would enter that key, along with a new password, to change passwords.</p>

										<p><p>Well this is very low security, nothing confidential in the protected area, just want to keep some users out of that tab.  But I suppose best practice would be to encrypt the password.  However the original problem still remains.  I can&#39;t email an encryption key without going through a server.  Is there no other way to get that info to the designated user?</p>

										<p><p>There is one tab (settings) that I want to protect.  The first user will go into settings and select an option to password protect that tab.  At that time they will select the password.  The next time they, or anyone else goes back in and clicks on that tab they will get an alert box that requires a password to continue.</p>

							<p>First, properties are insecure. Easily accessible, easily read.  You can use <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;benbahrenburg&#x2F;Securely">Securely</a> to store items in the keychain on ios.</p>
<p>Second,  you could just declare like most password storing or secure backup apps&#x2F;sites do that if they lose their passwords, well, tough, nothing you can do about it.</p>
<p>Third, password reset after correctly answering 3 user chosen questions. Hey, its good enough for healthcare.gov, has to be good enough for your app, right?</p>
