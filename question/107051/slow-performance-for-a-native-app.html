		<section>
			<p>Hi ya&#39;ll… </p>
<p>I&#39;ve included multiple views inside a scrollview and they all have rounded corners. My app is slow and no longer has that native feel. Can anybody help me out as to how to reduce this? I&#39;ve read the post that has guidance on how to speed things up… it didn&#39;t really help much. </p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Scottie</p>
<p><em>EDIT</em><br> iOS is currently 4.2.1 and the SDK is 1.5.1…<br>Here&#39;s the code for my views… The rest of the views are similar to this and are all inside the scrollview.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// Summary</span>
var summary_content = Titanium.UI.createView({
        backgroundColor:<span class="hljs-string">'#fff'</span>,
        borderWidth:<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, 
        borderColor:<span class="hljs-string">'#c8c8c8'</span>,
        borderRadius:<span class="hljs-number">10</span>,
        <span class="hljs-variable">width</span>:<span class="hljs-number">300</span>,
        <span class="hljs-variable">height</span>:<span class="hljs-string">'auto'</span>,
        top:<span class="hljs-number">10</span>,
        layout:<span class="hljs-string">'vertical'</span>

            });

var summary_label = Titanium.UI.createLabel({
    font:{fontSize:<span class="hljs-number">13</span>,fontColor:<span class="hljs-string">"#000000"</span>},
    textid:L(landmarkshareid+<span class="hljs-string">'_summary'</span>),
    <span class="hljs-variable">height</span>:<span class="hljs-string">'auto'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-variable">width</span>:<span class="hljs-number">280</span>,
    left:<span class="hljs-number">10</span>,
    right:<span class="hljs-number">10</span>,
    top:<span class="hljs-number">10</span>,
    bottom:<span class="hljs-number">10</span>
     });

<p>If you can, set an explicit height for the View; &#39;auto&#39; values are costly.</p>
<p>From the little code you have provided (it&#39;s not a &quot;best&quot; usecase, if you read the guide), it&#39;s difficult to determine what your app does and how the screen is constructed. However, if you have similar views repeated vertically, it may be possible to use a tableView instead of a scrollView. The advantage is that you can use the <code>className</code> property to ensure the calculations involved in drawing each &quot;row&quot; are performed only once.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sorry, but that&#39;s all I can suggest with the information available.</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Paul! Sorry for the unclear usecase… do you know if it&#39;s possible to have 2 tableView&#39;s on one window? I had a little difficulty trying this before and that&#39;s why I resulted in the views… (I&#39;ll try again)</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s OK, Scott - when you start helping out in this forum, as I am sure you will in time, you will see it from the other perspective.  :)  People have little time to spare, but want to help as many people as possible, so it&#39;s much better when questions are clear, concise and informative. I really urge you to read that &quot;Participating…&quot; article; it really explains it well.</p>
<p>Regarding two tableviews in one window, see Blain&#39;s <strong>excellent</strong> post <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32238&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;2991-ios-bug-scrollview-cant-carry-2-tableviews#ticket-2991-2">here</a>. The points that he lists are particularly good.</p>

										<p><p>Just to muddy the waters a little bit, you asked Paul if it&#39;s possible to have two tableviews on one <strong>window</strong> and the link he provided talks about why you don&#39;t want to put two table views on one <strong>scrollview</strong>.</p>
<p>I believe you can put two tableviews on one <strong>window</strong>, provided you set the height of each.  But if you have other objects too, you may need the scroll capabilities of a scrollview and we are back to the answer Paul linked.</p>
<p>But also note that the crux of the problem described in that ticket is use of &#39;auto&#39; for the heights.  In certain scenarios it may be practical to use either a static height for the tables determined at design time, or to dynamically calculate the desired height at run time before creating the tables.  This in turn can lead to being able to let a scroll view calculate the content height and it <strong>may</strong> be possible to pull off.  However, I suspect it would work best to not allow either embedded table to actually scroll itself.  That is, the entire table should be visible.  Else imagine the potential confusion for a user when trying to scroll the table contents instead of the scrollview (or vice versa) and getting the opposite effect.</p>
<p>Hence it is likely only practical when you have a very finite number of table rows and those rows have a static height making it easy to calculate the total height required.</p>
<p>Just being pedantic here when the question asked about a window but I think you meant to ask about a scrollview – which is what Paul answered anyway.  I&#39;ll crawl back under my rock now.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, as Doug has rightly (as always! ;)) pointed out, because a tableView is effectively an enhanced scrollView, you should never put it on a scrollView. You may be able to set the <code>moving</code> property of <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;latest&#x2F;Titanium.UI.TableView-object">Ti.UI.TableView</a> to false to make it static, however, which would resolve this limitation.</p>
