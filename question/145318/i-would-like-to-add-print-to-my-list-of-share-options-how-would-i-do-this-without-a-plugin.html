<p>As stated above I would like to set up print functionality to my app, I am aware of some SDK&#x2F;Downloadable content to achieve this, however I am a novice developer and would prefer to work with the code to gain experience. Can any one point me in the right direction?</p>

							<p>Hi Matthew</p>
<p>There is a module available in the marketplace that provides support for <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;769?642033827">AirPint</a>.  There is example code provided and it works like a charm.</p>

										<p><p>Hi</p>
<p>Quick tip: Please comment on answers - helps people work out threads in the future.</p>
<p>I provided a link to the module in the answer &quot;…AirPint.&quot;</p>
<p>You are going to need a module for it as I have not found any other way to achieve this without one as there is currently no native support built into Titanium.  The only other way is to build it yourself in XCODE - but it will still be a module you pass back.</p>

										<p><p>Sorry not yet, version 3 is around the corner which is moving things to a more layered&#x2F;code separation approach using Alloy as a focus.  This will help us all code faster and more reliable, we are still allowed to make really stupid errors though - I like those.</p>
<p>Once this is done I think the focus may well be on more features for both platforms  However they do have a thriving after market module solution that aims to plug specific holes and increase the popularity of the platform - so it may well remain a module.</p>
<p>The modules do provide lots of extra functionality that are very simple to add, my current favourite is <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;783?1458534497">TV Out</a> (AirPlay).</p>

							<p>Many thanks Malcolm,<br>Whats the name of the module that provides the support? its surprisingly difficult to find good examples that dont require some form of module&#x2F;SDK&#x2F;download of any kind.</p>
