			<h1>Ti Studio on Mac OS X Lion Failed to install SVN connectors</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m preparing for a new mobile project (iOS &#x2F; Droid) and thought I would get my Ti Studio on the Mac up to snuff.  I checked the boards, got the latest android SDK installed and the latest release of Ti Studio and begain adding my plugins.  </p>
<p>I use SVN for source control and the SVN connectors failed to load with an error:</p>
<p><code>!ENTRY org.eclipse.team.svn.core.svnnature 4 0 2012-03-29 22:18:00.858
!MESSAGE SVN: &amp;#39;0x00000230: Get Repository Folder Children&amp;#39; operation finished with error
!SUBENTRY 1 org.eclipse.team.svn.core.svnnature 4 0 2012-03-29 22:18:00.858
!MESSAGE Get repository folder children operation failed.
!STACK 0 
org.eclipse.team.svn.core.operation.UnreportableException: Selected SVN connector library is not available or cannot be loaded.</code></p>
<p>So I retried the operation, and it thinks it is already installed.</p>
<p><code>!ENTRY org.eclipse.team.svn.core.svnnature 4 0 2012-03-29 21:55:36.064
!MESSAGE Problems occurred while performing installation: Operation details
!STACK 1

    at org.eclipse.jface.operation.ModalContext$ModalContextThread.run(ModalContext.java:121)
Contains: Cannot complete the request.  See the error log for details.
Contains: &amp;quot;Subversive SVN Connectors&amp;quot; will be ignored because it is already installed.
Contains: &amp;quot;SVNKit 1.3.5 Implementation (Optional)&amp;quot;</code></p>
<p>So the question now is how do I cleanly get rid of it all and start over?  Is everything selv contained in &#x2F;Applications&#x2F;Titanium Sudio or are there things dropped in System&#x2F;Library etc?</p>
<p>Thanks, </p>
<p>Joe</p>

							<div><p>Well, I did just dump the workspace and &#x2F;Applications&#x2F;Titanium Studio - however I still can&#39;t install the SVN connectors.  They appear to load and then restart Titanium, however after the restart I am prompted to &quot;Select Subversive Connectors&quot; again and then it fails because it is &quot;Already installed&quot;</p>
<p>When I try to create a repository location I get this error:</p>
<p><code>SVN: &amp;#39;0x00400006: Validate Repository Location&amp;#39; operation finished with error: Selected SVN connector library is not available or cannot be loaded.
If you selected native JavaHL connector, please check if binaries are available or install and select pure Java Subversion connector from the plug-in connectors update site.
If connectors already installed then you can change the selected one at: Window-&amp;gt;Preferences-&amp;gt;Team-&amp;gt;SVN-&amp;gt;SVN Connector.

<p>Under Prefs =&gt; Team = &gt; SVN =&gt; SVN Connectors there is nothing available in the dropdown box.</p>

							<div><p>Ok, still no joy.  I got the latest build of the Subversive SVNKit, Connector and Plugin from Polarion directly.  I&#39;ve dropped those JAR files into &#x2F;Applications&#x2F;Titanium Studio&#x2F;Plugins however they don&#39;t seem to be recognized.  How do I register those plugins with TiStudio?</p>

							<div><p>This definitely seems to be a problem with Ti studio and the SVNKit plug-in…not the underlying OS.  I&#39;ve just completed wiping my mac and re-installing everything CLEAN (including Lion Internet Recovery) and I have exactly the same behavior.</p>
<p>OS X 10.7.3 with all latest updates<br>Xcode 4.2.1 with iOS SDKs<br>Android-SDK r17 (Installed to &#x2F;Applications&#x2F;android-sdk-macosx)<br>Relevant Android tools and environments installed using Android System Manager</p>
<p>All of that appears sane…then I take the following steps:</p>
<p>Help =&gt; Install New Software.<br>Select the Eclipse (Helios) repo<br>Search for SVN<br>Install the &quot;Subversive SVN Team Provider&quot; and restart when prompted.<br>After restart, select the &quot;SVN Repo Browsing&quot; perspective<br>When prompted to select a connector I choose &quot;SVNKit 1.3.5 Connector&quot; and restart when prompted.</p>
<p>After restart I am prompted to select a connector again.  It shows as installed from Help =&gt; Install New Software =&gt; Show installed software… however Ti Studio =&gt; Prefs =&gt; Team =&gt; Connectors has nothing in the drop down list.</p>

<p>I finally fixed it for anyone else having a similar problem…</p>
<p>Believe it or not it was my firewall content filter. Apparently ClearOS was blocking some critical component from downloading at the edge of my network (maybe that unsigned .jar?).</p>
<p>The boggling thing is that the installs never failed or threw an error about missing components - it just didn&#39;t install them and carried on about its happy way. I&#39;m not sure what was missing, but after uninstalling the SVNKit components and then disabling the content filter I was able to install SVNKit again and now it works.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
