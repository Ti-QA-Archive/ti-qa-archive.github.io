			<h1>Waking an app freezes/crashes</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve only noticed this with Titanium built apps; I open the app and then close it using the home button (so it&#39;s still running in the background) when I come back to it after a few minutes later the app is not responsive. </p>
<p>If you wait a little, it eventually comes back or if you get a little click happy on the tabs while it&#39;s froze it then crashes completely.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

							<div><p>We&#39;re seeing the same thing - except in a simple implementation - seems to be a variant of the &#39;blank screen&#39; problem and it only happens when you leave an app with Home instead of Back.  </p>
<p>Home seems to put the app in background but in a more runnable state because no splash screen is shown on return.  </p>
<p>Back seems to unwind more of the state so that the splash screen shows on return.</p>
<p>I&#39;m also wondering whether this is (OMG) hardware-related.  We&#39;re only seeing this happen on certain phones, and particularly on one phone that has a pretty small memory.</p>

							<p>Hi Craig,<br>I had the same issue and solved by setting analytics to false from tiap.xml. You will be surprised but that is the reason of application getting frozen on wakeup etc. Go to tiap.xml &gt; look for &lt;analytics&gt; &gt; set it to false &gt; clean the project and compile again. Voila, your app is finally acting like native one!</p>

							<p>Hi, thank you for your comments.</p>
<p>After posting this, I&#39;ve been unable to get it to crash to obtain a log (think they call that sods law) however the freezing of the app after bringing it to life from  running in the background is still present.</p>
<p>After testing on a few different iPhones, the results are quite sporadic and I can&#39;t pin it down to a particular device. </p>
<p>As there&#39;s been no reports by any end users, I will try disabling the analytic&#39;s as per Oleg&#39;s comment and resubmit during the next app update as the issue does seem to be on published apps rather than apps in development.</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
