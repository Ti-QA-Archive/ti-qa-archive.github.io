			<h1>Can&#39;t rearrange order of children in ScrollView...?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi folks - I&#39;ve been trying to change the display order of child views in a parent horizontal ScrollView &quot;groupView&quot; using zIndex. I can see that the zIndex values change, but the visible order does not. Consider this function:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">sortIntent</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span>{</span> 
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (groupView.<span class="hljs-built_in">children</span>.length &gt; <span class="hljs-number">1</span>) {
        Ti.API.info('sortIntent has been requested: will sort ' + groupView.<span class="hljs-built_in">children</span>.length + <span class="hljs-string">" groups on Intent"</span>);
        <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (s=<span class="hljs-number">0</span>; s&lt;groupView.<span class="hljs-built_in">children</span>.length; s++) {
            groupView.<span class="hljs-built_in">children</span>[s].setZIndex(groupView.<span class="hljs-built_in">children</span>[s].sortIntentsCount);
            Ti.API.info('Child ' + s + ' zIndex set to ' + groupView.<span class="hljs-built_in">children</span>[s].zIndex);
        };
    };
};
</code></pre><p>The zIndex values are set according to a property &quot;sortIntentsCount&quot; which is set at instantiation of the child view. The API INFO output confirms that the values are changing:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">INFO] :   sortIntent has been requested: will sort <span class="hljs-number">3</span> groups on Intent
[INFO] :   Child <span class="hljs-number">0</span> zIndex <span class="hljs-built_in">set</span> to <span class="hljs-number">17</span>
[INFO] :   Child <span class="hljs-number">1</span> zIndex <span class="hljs-built_in">set</span> to <span class="hljs-number">0</span>
[INFO] :   Child <span class="hljs-number">2</span> zIndex <span class="hljs-built_in">set</span> to <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
</code></pre><p>Although the zIndex values change for each child, the visual order of the horizontally-displayed views does not. I&#39;m stumped. Help appreciated as I&#39;m up against something of a deadline here…</p>
<p>Thanks and best to all,</p>
<p>Mike</p>

							<p>I think you might have a fundamental misunderstanding about the zIndex – it basically dictates how the views stack up in the third dimension (along a vector running perpendicular to the screen – imagine a line from the screen to your eye – which views are &quot;on top&quot; of the other views).</p>
<p>I think you&#39;re going to just have to remove the views from the ScrollView and re-add them in the order you want (I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re using layout = &#39;horizontal&#39; rather than explicit x,y coordinates).</p>
<p>This might result in some visual artifacts (the area where the ScrollView was will momentarily be empty, and it&#39;s possible you will see the individual child views &quot;pop&quot; into place as they are re-added.</p>
<p>If you want to make this look seamless to the user, you might want to create a new ScrollView with all new child views, add the new scrollview, and then remove the old scrollview.</p>

										<p><p>I thought I had read some documentation to the effect that in a scrollView the zIndex controls the 2D positioning…? No? Seems ugly to have to recreate the entire child set just to perform a sort, but if that&#39;s the only way, well, it&#39;s the only way ;-)</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ve never heard of that.  If your ScrollView&#39;s layout is &#39;horizontal&#39;, the items will be laid out side-by-side in the order that you add them to the view.  It&#39;s <em>possible</em> (never tested) that if they have zIndex values <em>when you add them</em>, you can alter the left-to-right order.  But I am a bit skeptical about that.</p>
<p>If you have documentation to point to, I&#39;d be interested to see it.</p>
<p>BTW – sorry if I made too many assumptions about your understanding of zIndex.  We get all levels of technical experience on this board, and sometimes you have to start at the very beginning!</p>

							<p>Hi Jason :-)</p>
<p>Can&#39;t remember where I thought I read that. I&#39;m going to assume I was incorrect and try to reconstruct the child structure, per your suggestion. Struggling a little trying to figure out how to sort a 2D array in JS at the moment…it&#39;s always something! ;-)</p>

										<p><p>And…done! :-)</p>
<p>Used an array of objects instead, made reinstantiating the objects in the new order much easier. Works nicely! Thanks for the help.</p>
