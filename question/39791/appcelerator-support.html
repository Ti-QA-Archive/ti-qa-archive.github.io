			<p>i&#39;m now a premium customer and i&#39;d like to share my experience here. i must say that it&#39;s simply great. it might not be the same for you, but i&#39;m earning quite some money by doing mobile projects at the moment, cause i&#39;m not selling them on my own but doing it as a 3rd party developer. for me the premium account is perfect, as appcelerator support is doing a great work, and almost immediatly answered to my support requests today.</p>
<p>i&#39;m in no way affiliated to appcelerator beside being a paying customer, but i can already say that the price for the premium account is worth its money for sure. if you can afford it, you should really consider it!</p>

							<p>If you have an app making enough money to afford it, priority bug fixes alone make it worth the subscription cost. I have been a premium subscriber for a bit over a month now, and their support has been very good. </p>

							<p>I will add my praise, too, for premium support.  Responses have been fast and thorough, even when taking 4 or 5 iterations.  We&#39;ve had three Ti bugs addressed within 24-48 hours. Great staff to work with!</p>

							<p>I think more flexible pricing has to happen. I would guess that a lot of the initial audience for Titanium Mobile will be individual developers or small teams. They will be reluctant to part with the monthly charge until they can show some profits based on applications created using Titanium, yet they may not get there without Premium support. </p>

										<p><p>exactly. i guess they need to explain their business modell in deeper detail to their customers. if you are a 3rd party developer and not selling the app on your own, the price for the premium account will pay within hours</p>

							<p>I have tried premium support and it is as they say excellent. However I am one of those small single developers that just cannot afford the high costs of the entry level plan.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong I am not looking for cheap support but maybe a limited plan for less money, x amount of incidents per month for x amount and even a per incident charge. The more incidents you buy the cheaper it gets.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t want to see 1 incident for $70 and two for $140, there should be a curve to the pricing that encourages people to purchase more and move up the scale towards the unlimited option as their finances allow.</p>
<p>I just feel a the moment it excludes SO MANY people from getting ANY support at all and I don&#39;t think that is a good thing.</p>

							<p>I have to agree with Christian. I&#39;m a premium support customer and the responsiveness of the Titanium team has been fantastic. I&#39;m really enjoying the platform and remain excited about its future.</p>
