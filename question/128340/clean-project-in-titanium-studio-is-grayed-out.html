			<p>….on 2 of my 4 apps, including kitchensink. I have deployed and redeployed many times to both simulator and device on all 4 apps. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve searched the Q&amp;A and can&#39;t find any similar issues that have happened to anyone previously. Is there some sort of configuration file I need to inspect?</p>
<p>I know I&#39;m going to feel silly when someone reminds me what needs to be done, but I&#39;m ready to feel silly because I&#39;ve been trying to figure this out for a while now.</p>
<p>My titanium build is 1.0.6.201110251616</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

							<p>If the clean button is greyed out and you check the project properties and notice there are no builders then maybe adding the below to your .project file will resolve as it did for me</p>

							<p>I deleted kitchensink and re-imported. That took care of it not showing up in the clean list. The other app that wasn&#39;t showing up is a homemade app I created. I deleted it and then re-created a new project with the same name. Prior to doing this, I preserved my app.js by moving it temporarily to another location. After creating the new project with the same name, I moved my original app.js that I copied to a another location, back in to my resources folder. If you don&#39;t do this moving of app.js, it gets overwritten. All other files are maintained even after the creation of the new project. It now shows up in the apps available for cleaning.</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve seen this behavior also. I have more than 30 projects in my workspace, but this only occurs with two or three of them. I have to manually clean build folder.</p>
<p>Note that on Clean list only open projects are visible, so ensure your projects are open.</p>

										<p><p>Javier - I&#39;ve made sure all 4 apps are &quot;opened&quot; and not just displayed. I wonder if I should try copying their respective workspaces somewhere else temporarily, deleting them, and then copy them back over. Or, exporting them, deleting them, and then importing them. This is interesting behavior. I&#39;m trying to think of what might be common to the 2 apps to not show up in the Clean list if&#x2F;when I want to &quot;clean all&quot;.</p>
