			<p>This is not a question.It is a tribute to some great developer who has helped us so much community and is first one to reach 100000 points in the community.I think probably he was the first one to answer my question and he explained everything in so detail that it looked to me like i have hired a tutor at 100$&#x2F;hr :).I just want to thank him</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>Thanks to all those whose questions helped me learn so much, you will be surprised how much I have learnt whilst helping out those who I could - some of you stumped me.</p>
<p>A big thank you to everyone that comes and helps out here, this is where I came to learn when I started, so this is where I came to give back.</p>
<p>This is a great platform and the community really gives back in lots of ways - the Q&amp;A is just one of the many ways.  I have the great pleasure of knowing many of the biggest names who give back in many of those ways.</p>
<p>Those of you who have experienced some of my quirks will know that I ask that answers are not provided when they should be comments - but I figured I would do it just this once ;-)</p>
<p>Keep this going, keep helping, keep reading and keep getting better - Have Fun.</p>
