										<p><p>Thanks for your answer. Basically I am looking for crash report on application level. I know I can do this with putting try  catch on all of the file but is there any other way to handle to application wide.<br>Thanks again for suggestion, this will definitely will help.</p>

										<p><p>not that I&#39;m aware of.<br>I know what you mean, but IMHO wouldn&#39;t it be better for you to know what method made it crash instead of having an unreadable memory exception crash log referring to Kroll and such? I had customers sending me crash logs and I couldn&#39;t get anything out of them.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, I like to know which method crashed but I have dozens of files and was thinking better one place to put try catch which can handle all error occurs at one place application level like while in development Titanium give RED SCREEN error message.<br>I do like to to upvote your answer but there is no option to upvote next to vote count :(.</p>

										<p><p>Red screen? not if it&#39;s in deployment mode.

That means that your code is doing something wrong (like calling undefined methods or handling null objects).</p>

										<p><p>Not strictly true. V8 produces a red application error screen (not quite the same as the Ti one) even in production mode when it can&#39;t interpret a js file that fails at runtime</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>If this is for the Android as you have indicated the Google Play Store already provides full crash report information where possible including any comments the user had when the app crash report was submitted.  This can then be read within the Google Play Console and often includes type of device and which version the app was on when the crash occurred.</p>
<p>If you are also trying to get this to show crash reports prior to pushing the app live then consider checking out the Google Play store beta and alpha testing modes that help you manage the process.</p>
<p>You do not need any additional libraries to achieve your goal.  However I do like Albertos suggestion which can be great for specific; section testing, fail over and logic monitoring which is as important as hard crash testing.</p>

										<p><p>It is for iPhone os as well. I am aware of the reporting but anyhow I didn&#39;t receive any although user reporting me directly about crash so thought may be logical crash. </p>
<p>Since app I am working is for limited users only so Alberto&#39;s solution fit for me.</p>

							<p>Prior putting the app in the play store (or after), you may consider using <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;25939#!overview">ACRApper module</a> to collect and send stack and logcat uppon the crash.</p>
