			<h1>Save music path from the music library</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m making an iPhone app that lets users select a song from their music library, save the one they selected, and play it later when they open up the app.</p>
<p>It seems like I have to save the path to the music file the user has selected, but the documentation and the Kitchensink app do not cover such usage.</p>
<p>It looks like openMusicLibrary() function returns the media object with meta data, but not the path to the file.</p>
<p>Any idea?</p>

							<p>I was able to figure this out and have a functional version implemented with Titanium Mobile 1.6.</p>
<p>I had to write a module in objective-c that returns the asset&#39;s url. I also wrote a module that plays a given url (the one included in Titanium doesn&#39;t work with iPop library url). I did this a long time ago, so I don&#39;t remember much of it, but you basically have to make a new music player module using AVPlayer API (not AudioPlayer as it won&#39;t be able to read URL returned from iPod library).</p>
<p>I hope you guys are able to figure this out.</p>
