			<p>I have a function which downloads a pdf file and displays it in intents. Since there seems to be no way to save this to a &quot;My Downloads&quot; or &quot;Downloads&quot; folder on applications, I am afraid that the users wont realize they are accumulating pdf data in their &quot;Misc&quot; storage system, which cannot be opened to view specific files through settings. So, how can I detect that the user has stopped viewing the PDF (ie, they hit the back button and the intenet PDF viewer closes). Here is my code:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var f = Ti.Filesystem.getFile(Ti.Filesystem.externalStorageDirectory, <span class="hljs-keyword">name</span>);
f.<span class="hljs-built_in">write</span>(res); // <span class="hljs-built_in">write</span> to the <span class="hljs-keyword">file</span>
    try {
        var pdf = Ti.Filesystem.getFile(Ti.Filesystem.getExternalStorageDirectory()+<span class="hljs-keyword">name</span>);
        Ti.Android.currentActivity.startActivity(Ti.Android.createIntent({
            <span class="hljs-keyword">action</span>: Ti.Android.ACTION_VIEW,
            <span class="hljs-keyword">type</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'application/pdf'</span>,
            <span class="hljs-type">data</span>: pdf.getNativePath()
         }));
    }
</code></pre>

							<p>Gabriel,</p>
<p>I have done similar things, but I clean up when I load the next PDF. So, instead of trying to figure out when the user might have returned to the app and delete the PDF, I delete the PDF when I load the next one. This has two benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the user downloads a PDF, then views it, it is already in my directory. If the user decides to view again, I can check to see if it is already on the device and present it again, instead of re-downloading it. It acts as a &#39;last file&#39; cache.</li>
<li>If it is a new file, then I delete the files in the directory before I start downloading the new file that was requested. This way, your folder doesn&#39;t balloon in size, only the last file is there.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can extend this to keep the last x files as well, giving yourself a built in cache without it ever filling up.</p>
<p>Ray</p>

										<p><p>I am currently doing number one, but it does not detect the last file opened. I actually really like what I have, where if the person clicks on an existing PDF it is instant, however, the user will have as many unique files in the Misc folder that they have clicked on. I think I can do your idea however and have one last cached file. I think I can add it to my existing check for a new file. Thanks a lot.</p>

										<p><p>Are you using deleteDirectory may I ask? I dynamically generate PDF names, so I would need to either iterate on my new file function or delete the contents of the directory, as of now it looks as though it is impossible to iterate through a directory.</p>

										<p><p>You can iterate a directory. Check <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;95501&#x2F;how-to-retrieve-list-of-files-in-a-directory-and-print-it-with-titanium-desktop">this out</a>. I currently keep an array of files I am creating on the fly, then I can use array.shift to remove and array.push to add to the items in the queue. It makes my &#39;cache&#39; adjustable. ie. I can array.shift until the length is 10 or 8 or 5… gives a little bit of flexibility without having to read the contents of the folder every time.</p>
