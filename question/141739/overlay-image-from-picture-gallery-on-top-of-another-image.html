			<p>Hi,<br>I&#39;m new to Titanium (coming from Objective-C) and wondered if it&#39;s possible to select an image from the picture gallery and then place this selected image on top of another image?  Do you just use two image views and set the top image to opaque?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Steve</p>

							<p>It is basically that simple based on the information you provided, can you be more specific about the images?</p>

										<p><p>Hi,<br>The image that needs overlaying will either come from picture gallery, camera or instagram (user of app selects this). This picture I then want to be over-layed on top of another picture - so I&#39;m guessing I just use two imageviews, set the top imageview to be opaque (can you do this?). I would also like the picture to be able to be resized by the user (cropped) so it fits on top of the back picture fine. Think of the back picture as being a bedroom wall, the user selects a picture (a poster for example of their favorite band) and this picture is then placed on top of the wall picture, but this picture can be resized by the user - how is it possible to allow user to resize the picture? Sorry, two questions here now!<br>Regards, Steve</p>
