			<h1>How to make input box with datalist like HTML5 in Titanium?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, I am trying to make a select input box like the following picture:<br><img src="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uitutorial.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2013&#x2F;08&#x2F;select-chosen-demo.png" alt="Select Box"></p>
<p>Basically it is a input box with some predefined datalist. As user input, the dropdown list will be filtered. However, it is still different from picker since it gives the user power to go beyond this list. (Yes, the list is more like a suggestion or short-cut if it matches something in the list)  Imagine gmail app for example.</p>
<p>Basically, I have 2 ideas that might work:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Using listview and textField as it&#39;s &quot;search bar&quot;. Setting the textField on change event to be changing the searchText of listview can indeed help me with filtering. <strong>However, the drawback of this method is listview will fill the whole area and it&#39;s height cannot be changed dynamically even when the data is being filtered</strong>…I haven&#39;t yet find a method tell me how much results matches the criteria in the listview, so I think I might give up this idea.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If abandoning listview, then I believe I can make a container view set to be Ti.UI.SIZE with vertical layout and fill it will a bunch of smaller view rows(just look like listview). It seems feasible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>However, the actual biggest challenge I am facing is how should I position the hint view when there is other UI items below that textField</strong>. I only want it pop-up when the textField is focused and it should cover whatever that was originally there without pushing the original view downward. I don&#39;t know whether there is absolute positioning to a certain view and it is possible in Titanium.</p>
<p>I really need some inspiration and appreciate any thoughts or possibilities:)</p>

<p>By the way, I wonder how Titanium will calculate the screen height in that case? Say, if I have a full screen of items, when the softKeyboard pop-up, will it become scrollable so the area under keyboard won&#39;t be covered? I do have some view encountered this problem, I wonder if I set something wrong. Thanks:)</p>

							<p>I made a little commonJS module that complete the function I mentioned using the second approach. It have some deficit with Android but works with iOS.</p>
