			<h1>Enhanced Titanium Developer (IRONti Developer)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>As an experiment I put together an enhanced version of the Titanium Developer app (called IRONti Developer, pronounced &quot;iron tie&quot;, to avoid user confusion). It supports CoffeeScript, includes a source code editor, and turns off some of the network features to make it less distracting.</p>
<p>A version for Macs can be found here:  http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;bD5SEI   </p>
<p>The zip file contains the enhanced developer app and a sample CoffeeScript Titanium app. Take a look at the README file and then simply try it out to see if you like it (at least conceptually). I recommend that you already have the official Titanium Developer installed. IRONti Developer is not a full replacement for the official Titanium Developer (it hasn&#39;t been tested in that way and it might need a few enhancements to properly work due to its database and other magic).</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this is not an official Appcelerator app because I&#39;m not employed by Appcelerator or connected to them in any way.</p>

							<div><p>Here is a video that shows how to create a sample iphone app with the IRONti Developer app. The new app is built with the code that comes from the sample CoffeeScript app. Note that you can&#39;t simply import that sample app because Titanium Developer needs extra directories and files in the build folder it generates. Don&#39;t forget to mirror the file tree structure between the IronCoffee and Resources folders. All CoffeeScript files must be placed in the IronCoffee folder. The first project you&#39;ll create in IRONti Developer will not show up in the project list right away. Simply close the app and then restarted. Take a look at the README file for more details.</p>
<p>The video quality is not great because I&#39;m not an expert with screen casts:  http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;aM8ow0<br>This video link will be taken down eventually, but a YouTube version ( http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=zpHYFzQmo8A ) will still be there. The only problem with the YouTube version is that YouTube degraded the vedio quality even further…</p>
<p>A bit warning to people who haven&#39;t experienced this enough. Titanium desktop apps and the Titanium Developer tend to get stuck (especially on startups), so you have to do &quot;Force Quit&quot;. The IRONti Developer app has the same &quot;feature&quot; :-) This happens more when your system doesn&#39;t have enough memory.</p>

							<p>I for one would love to see CoffeeScript integrated as a first-class language in Titanium.</p>
<p>BTW, thanks for giving us a little credit for our CoffeeScript code…</p>

										<p><p>Mobile apps in IRONti Developer are created in the exact same way mobile apps are created in the official Titanium Developer. I&#39;ll post a video that shows the IRONti Developer features and how a project with CoffeeScript is created.</p>

										<p><p>If the project type list constains only &#39;desktop&#39; then it might something to do with the Iphone and Android SDK detection. I remember having to reconfigure at least one of those SDK paths. I&#39;ll have to look into this. When did you install your Titanium Developer?</p>

							<p>I assumed that people would already be familiar with the coffeescript sample I mentioned in my other recent post a few days ago, so I wasn&#39;t explicit about the origins of the sample coffeescript code. This is actually the reason I used it, so people would already be familiar with it. Just like with the original Titanium Developer code I claim no ownership to it.</p>
