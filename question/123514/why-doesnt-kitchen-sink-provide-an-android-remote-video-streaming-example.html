			<h1>why doesn&#39;t kitchen sink provide an android remote video streaming example?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;m revisiting Titanium after about 1 year to se if I can get all of the features I need in an app supported on both iOS and Android using Titanium.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve downloaded and installed Titanium Studio (with SDK 1.7.2) - I need to be able to implement video streaming in my app (live streaming) - I was able to add the remote stream in the kitchen sink app and it works fine in iOS. Why doesn&#39;t the kitchen sink have &#39;any&#39; examples of remote video streaming working?</p>
<p>This is a deal-breaker for me :-( I&#39;ve scoured the Q&amp;A board with no definitive answers anywhwere?</p>
<p>Does someone have a revised kitchen sink remote streaming code that handles both iOS and Android and works on both.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,<br>Sway</p>

							<div><p>Just curious but if you have implemented it in KitchenSink and works OK on IOS what is to stop you testing the same code on Android? </p>
<p>How can not having example code here possibly be a &#39;deal breaker&#39;?</p>

							<div><p>these things usually workout better if you provide sample code you have written and then explain the issues you are having. KitchenSink was meant to be an application it just demonstrates specific API functionality</p>

							<div><p>I believe it will stream on Android but you will need to set up a streaming server. I think &quot;wowza&quot; was one that we tried a while back.</p>
