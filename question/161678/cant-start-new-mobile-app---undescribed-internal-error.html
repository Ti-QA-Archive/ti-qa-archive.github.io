			<h1>Can&#39;t start new Mobile App - undescribed &#34;internal error&#34;</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello everybody. I guess the title tells it all: when I try to start a new project, as described in the Quick Start tutorial, it simply pops up an error saying &quot;Internal error&quot; and a nice but somewhat messed up ASCII logo version of the Alloy logo. (I guess someone in the Titanium team had an Amiga a few decades ago.) The project is created, but apparently missing a few elements and doesn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>In fact I am just curious why this thing didn&#39;t work. After running into heaps of such unexplained errors in Titanium I already decided to ditch it as an unreliable product, just like I trashed Intel XDK before. I am too busy to research forums for every single step I take. So, is there an official explanation what this &quot;internal error&quot; could mean?</p>

							<div><p>Since you have decided to &quot;ditch it&quot;, why ask for help? If you really DO want help then start with asking a question with the information the forums suggest when you click on the ask question button…. Otherwise, go away!</p>

							<div><p>You provide no details, platform, version, android version… No code…. And you expect someone to have an answer for you? There are thousands of published apps developed with appcelerator and over 500,000 developer downloads. So your assertion &quot;After running into heaps of such unexplained errors in Titanium I already decided to ditch it as an unreliable product&quot; is wrong. I have published multiple apps personally and use the product every day to make a living…. So, if you ask a good question, you will likely get a helpful answer.</p>

							<p>Windows 7 64 bit, platform Android, Titanium version is what you can download right now (I uninstalled it already so I can&#39;t check). I couldn&#39;t even get to trying anything on my Android phone because this thing didn&#39;t even create a project.</p>
