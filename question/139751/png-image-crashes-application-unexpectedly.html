			<h1>PNG image crashes application unexpectedly</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am working with android development at the moment and have been having some wierd issues with animations.</p>
<p>I have been creating animations for my application and everything has been going fine.  I have been drawing images in GIMP and exporting the PNG images to my images directory in titanium, then assigning the images as the backgroundImage property in my view that is being animated.  All was going well until my application unexpectedly crashed.</p>
<p>The old images I made in GIMP and exported to my project still work fine, but now if I create an image in GIMP the same way as before and export it into my project, then assign that new image as my backgroundImage property then my application quits with a &#39;unfortunately your program has stopped&#39;</p>
<p>I thought maybe this was a memory issue, but I downloaded images from the internet and put them into my project folder and they all work just fine.  I have tried exporting my images from GIMP as jpg, png, bmp, gif and nothing.  I also tried the same process in paint, but that doesn&#39;t work either.</p>
<p>Here is my working code:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var view3 = Ti.UI.createView({
            <span class="hljs-string">backgroundImage :</span> <span class="hljs-string">'/images/animation1.png'</span>,
            <span class="hljs-string">height :</span> <span class="hljs-string">'45%'</span>,
            <span class="hljs-string">width :</span> <span class="hljs-string">'50%'</span>,
<span class="hljs-label">            right:</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span>,
<span class="hljs-label">            top:</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span>,
            <span class="hljs-string">opacity :</span> <span class="hljs-number">0.0</span>
        });
</code></pre><p>and here is my broken code:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var view3 = Ti.UI.createView({
            <span class="hljs-string">backgroundImage :</span>  <span class="hljs-string">'/images/animation2.png'</span>,
            <span class="hljs-string">height :</span> <span class="hljs-string">'45%'</span>,
            <span class="hljs-string">width :</span> <span class="hljs-string">'50%'</span>,
<span class="hljs-label">            right:</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span>,
<span class="hljs-label">            top:</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span>,
            <span class="hljs-string">opacity :</span> <span class="hljs-number">0.0</span>
        });
</code></pre><p>where animation1.png was created last week and animation2.png was created today.  I can open all of these images in numerous photo viewer applications and they open and appear fine.  I tried exporting different pixel sizes and everything.  This is causing quite a headache, any ideas?</p>

							<p>Are these PNGs animated?? Or do you mean you&#39;re using Titanium&#39;s method of animating images? </p>
<p>This is possibly down to Titanium&#39;s png &quot;crusher&quot; which attempts to reduce the size of the images in apps.</p>

										<p><p>OK. I see.  Try sending&#x2F;uploading us a copy of the PNG which breaks and we can see if converting it using another app (eg: PShop) will fix this.</p>

										<p><p>It seems that adding text to my image file <em>was</em> breaking the application for some reason, but now everything seems to be working again.  Very odd…</p>

										<p><p>I figured it out!<br>You can&#39;t use 000000 html black as a background color in your image file, titanium doesn&#39;t like that for some reason.  You can use this color as text color, but not as the background of the image.  I did notice a proprietary three digit color notation in titanium instead of standard html 6 digit color codes.  This only crashes on android for some reason, possibly a bug?</p>
