							<p>You failed to mention what platform(s) you are targeting, so we don&#39;t even know if this is a desktop or mobile app, etc.  It is a good idea to add tags with the platform(s) you want, SDK levels desired, etc.  I&#39;ll assume here you are wanting to do this in a mobile project, and have it work in both iOS and android.</p>
<p>Are you wanting to embed a video file to get installed along with your app?  Unless it is a very short duration, that will really mushroom the size of your app.  You may want to consider instead instead having your app download the video file(s) after the app is installed.</p>
<p>If you really want to include a video, put it in your project Resources folder (or a subfolder of it).  However, if over 5MB, some file extensions are not included.  I&#39;ve seen suggestions to rename a resource to *.mp3, but perhaps all media files over 5MB are included and will not need to do that.</p>
<p>In regards to whether appcelerator will play h.264, appcelerator is just loading the platform&#39;s native video player.  So it should come down to if the device supports it, not if appcelerator has support for it.</p>
