			<p>Hey guys, following case</p>
<p>i am creating a abc Scrolllist, using my own abc slider, for better handling. Thats working without any problem, so when i am click on a letter - &quot;D&quot; for example, i&#39;ve got an event fired which tell me &quot;D clicked&quot; :-P</p>
<p>My problem is the list itself. I have to build it, like this:</p>
<p>At the beginning it pulls 20 Entrys from the server, if the user scrolls down, of course, it loads more entrys and so on. (no problem)<br>If the user jumps to (let&#39;s say &quot;d&quot; again), it loads 20 entrys from &quot;D&quot; and than you can scroll down, it loads more entrys and so on (works great)</p>
<p>Problem: When jumped to &quot;d&quot; and scrolling up, it should load the &quot;above&quot; entrys automaticly. So my main problem at the moment is, how detecting scrolling up, stop list from scrolling even more, load previous entrys, and than again.</p>
<p>So my first Question is, if anybody did realizise a list like that and maybe have one or two hints, how to solve this the best way. (Maybe using the list Component introduced  by 3.1? )</p>
<p>(Just wanna share some thoughts)</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Your biggest problem is the way you are trying to use a custom index bar to determine the next amount of entries.</p>
<p>I suspect you are creating a custom version because you have so many entries - showing them all at once would be too many for a sensible table and&#x2F;or amount of data required from the server in a single request.  If this is the case then you have too many entries and having a linear table is NOT the correct plan or UI for the user.</p>
<p>If you are using an index bar, there is an assumption that the table contains all elements that can be accessed and selecting an entry from the index will simply re-position the row offset to match the row index for that index bar entry,</p>
<p>You will also not be able to back fill the previous letters efficiently as you will have to retrieve based on direction, letter and not be able to take into account existing entries that you may end up duplicating over the top (in reality adding duplicate rows).  </p>
<p>If you have so many entries that you require the use to press a custom index bar, then you should switch the UI to something else, for example;</p>
<ul>
<li>having a letter grid that is pressed before the table appears (slides in from right), now you have a drill down effect already in place.</li>
<li>Using a search box to all live drill downs as letters are typed, each letter call the next 10-15 that matches the current search phrase, once the search button is presses your table now ONLY shows entries starting with the typed phrase - which automatically limits the search.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are expected UI designs.  If you have truly created a new way of doing something that is better than all other things (at least for this case) then you should move away from existing UI, this is not it though.  The UX for the person interacting will be unexpected and jagged at best.</p>
<p>If you truly must proceed with this layout, then;</p>
<ul>
<li>Detect the scroll direction by using a cache of the last scroll Y position, compare with the current scroll Y position top give you direction (re-cache current to last) and keep repeating.</li>
<li>Keep and index count of how many items were retrieved per letter and when this number becomes zero for any letter do not bother getting any new entries when you go past this letter again.</li>
</ul>
<p>I can foresee all the issues you are going to encounter if you proceed with this UI&#x2F;UX, I wish you luck and a LOT of patience as you try to resolve them all.</p>

										<p><p>The greatest problem is, i have no idea how to insert the special &quot;places&quot; to the list at which the user just have to scroll up  a bit and it loads the previuos entrys from the server. really confusing</p>
