							<p>First App, First Enterprise Distribution.  I think I was able to get figured out today.  Correct me if I am wrong, this is what I did.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I created a Distribution Profile, that I need to send the users.  The can drag this file onto the iTunes icon to install</p>
</li>
<li><p>Then the users can drag the distribution dir into iTunes and it will install the app on the next sync.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I was able to install the app on the iPhones in my dept via the iPhone Configuration Utility Tool.</p>
<p>Please, let me know if there is an easier way.  I have to get this app(after it&#39;s tested) to all my users.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help or advice.</p>

							<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>Have you done any enterprise distributions prior, or will this be your first time?  (Using Apple&#39;s tooling, I mean - of course this would be your first time using Titanium).</p>

							<p>Hello, </p>
<p>any progression on this matter? </p>
<p>Kevin, i&#39;m about to do this the first time. Hi agree with Mark, he&#39;s solution it&#39;s not the most easy process from the user point of view. Is there an easiest way (1 click way) of doing the distribution? </p>
<p>Thanks. </p>

							<p>See my answer to a similar question about ad-hoc distribution <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;88651&#x2F;developingdistributing-inhouse-apps">here</a>.  The same procedure applies to Enterprise, except of course you don&#39;t have to mess with adding UDIDs to the distribution profile.  You can achieve one click updates downloaded directly from your own server.  The initial install can be done by visiting a web page in Sarari (or by an email link).  In my apps, I also put a link in my About box letting them pull a version upgrade at any time with a single click.</p>
<p>In order to distribute over the air, the devices must be at OS 4.x.</p>

										<p><p>Are there any updates on this query regarding using Titanium for developing apps for an Enterprise client? it would be great to know if anyone has or is doing this as I am fast approaching the transition from supplying an app using AD Hoc distribution to needing to swap to my clients Enterprise setup. Can this be done without the need to hand over the source and build environment? ( i.e. do I just need to obtain their WWDR cert, an App ID and profile from them). I am quite willing to document these steps fully for others if I can pull it all together.</p>

										<p><p>There is a way to build an app for a client that has an &quot;Enterprise&quot; credentials without requiring them to send you their Apple ID, cert, profile etc.  Install the [Apperian EASE module] (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;4838) and it will allow you to publish with your ad-hoc credentials, and then the customer can re-sign the app from the EASE account with enterprise credentials. Apperian EASE has a built-in signing server.</p>
