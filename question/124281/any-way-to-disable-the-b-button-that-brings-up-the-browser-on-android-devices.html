			<h1>Any way to disable the [B] button that brings up the Browser on Android Devices?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I wrote a Proof of Delivery App that transmits signatures back to our mysql server. Problem is when the driver gives the Android Tablet to the customer to sign, the customer accidentally puts their finger on that [B] button and it loads up the browser so they don&#39;t know what to do and they have to give the Tablet back to the driver and the driver hits the Back Button to go back to my program. It is not a huge deal but it is a nuisance. Since there is an event listener for the other buttons like the BACK, CAMERA, SEARCH, VOLUME UP, VOLUME DOWN (see code below) surely there is one for the Browser Button; if not there should be one. Thanks everyone!!!</p>

});

										<p><p>Thank You. Yes I will be more careful next time. If you could edit or delete a post that you yourself made then I could have fixed me answering my own question before you were ever aware of it but unfortunately this forum lacks that functionality. Actually the link does work. It appears that you are probably using Internet Explorer and this forum does not always work correctly with links when using IE. To prove this you can a) simply right click the CLICK HERE text above, and choose copy shortcut and paste that into another tab. You will see the page pulls up properly. b) Use Firefox and you can click the link and it will also pull up properly. Yes I mean the device you show in your picture. I&#39;m not 100% convinced that this button is device specific because I have seen that same button on other Android Devices. Sure on other devices that button may not appear as a [B], but other devices do indeed have a button you can tap to open the default browser. For example, the camera button on this device may look different on other devices especially if the other device is made by a different company. That does not mean the button is device specific though. You raise a good point &amp; I will look into making a module if need be. In the mean time I&#39;m going to explore other possibilities. Thanks for your input.</p>

<p>Would you be careful not to answer your own questions?  It makes the conversation difficult for others to follow. Thanks. :)</p>
<p>The link to the image does not work. You mean this device, don&#39;t you?<br><img src="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tigerdirectandroid.com&#x2F;android&#x2F;&#x2F;2011&#x2F;06&#x2F;Coby-Kyros-MID7024.jpg" alt="screenshot"></p>
<p>The button is device-specific, and there is no way to determine whether the same code would work for equivalent buttons across different devices, without some research. Certainly, the button is not in the Android hardware guidelines, which you can view in the PDFs <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.co.uk&#x2F;search?q=Android+Compatibility+Definition">here</a>.</p>
<p>My advice would be to develop a module to provide this functionality. If you are unable to do this yourself, you are welcome to contact our Sales team via our <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;contact-us&#x2F;">Contact Us</a> page (see the email address on the right hand side).</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

										<p><p>Hi Clint</p>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. Yes, we totally agree with the lack of editing facilities in this Q&amp;A. We will correct this in time, although there are other things taking priority at present. </p>
<p>Cheers</p>
