							<p>You should be able to change the &lt;name&gt; tag in your tiapp.xml as you stated didn&#39;t work.  Did you perform a clean build after renaming the name tag in the tiapp.xml?  I just tried it on a sample app, and it worked.</p>
<p>What Ti SDK are you running?</p>

										<p><p>Ok, that seemed to throw me a whole load of errors so I edited the [CFBundleDisplayName] in xcode and then built through there which was a pain but worked.</p>
<p>Hmm maybe ill look at that again tomorrow but CFBundleDisplayName &amp; CFBundleName are both populated I&#39;m guessing from the tiapp.xml &lt;name&gt; tag. I assumed this was the problem as I thought CFBundleName appeared to be needed to be unedited? But I could well be wrong.</p>
<p>Thanks Paul.<br>Dave</p>

							<p>Hi<br>The answer Paul gave should be correct but you also need to take into account;</p>
<ul>
<li>Close the simulator and use <strong>project</strong> &gt; <strong>clean</strong> and select you project.</li>
<li>you appear to have created a custom plist, if you have and only to achieve this, back it up and remove it before the first step</li>
<li>If your custom plist is used for a good reason I would consider re-creating (with your changes) it after the first step but back it up and delete it before you run the first step - this may cause a naming conflict</li>
</ul>
