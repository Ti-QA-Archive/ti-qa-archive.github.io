			<h1>Check for updates every night</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am working on an app, that needs to run some code every night. It basically calls an api and checks for updates, and acts accordingly on the response. </p>
<p>I have no issue writing the code, and it works perfectly when called manually with the app in the foreground, but I need the app to do this automatically every night.</p>
<p>Can someone please point me in the right direction? Background services only run for a few minutes on iOS, so I can not rely on those.</p>

							<p>Its very simple, and even it doesn&#39;t require the firing of background service, firstly what you need to do is to store the last updated date and time whenever updation is taking place, secondly on the application resume event just check when application was lat updated, and if its haven&#39;t updated for that day call the update service or right the application update logic in the resume event. As application resume event is fires when either application is launched from background or if application is opened for the first time,</p>
<p>So  all your conditions will get handle, if you implement in this way. Hope this will give you some approach to resolve your problem.</p>

							<p>I actually already do that, but I need the app to update, even if the user doesnt log in for several days or weeks. I am thinking about setting up push notifications, and making the callback my check for updates script. Then, I can just send a push every night to trigger the update. I have never used pushed notifications, so if there are any major flaws or drawbacks to this idea, please let me know so I dont waste my time.</p>
