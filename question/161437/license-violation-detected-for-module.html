			<h1>License violation detected for module</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>We are receiving this when running the app on a device (simulator works fine):</p>
<p>&quot;License violation detected. Unlicensed module(s) detected.  You must be a subscriber to use one or more of the modules included with this project.. Please contact Appcelerator Support.&quot;</p>
<p>The module in question is com.logicallabs.inappproducts</p>
<p>We have purchased it in the market. And it is working fine in the other app we have. But in this second one we&#39;re building it is not working… we are using the same studio login.</p>
<p>What could be causing this?</p>

							<p>what usually fixes it for me is to change the <code>guid</code> inside the tiapp.xml . Just change a char or a number, and it should go back to normal.</p>

										<p><p>We tried creating a new fresh project, empty template with a new guid. Only including the module and it does still cause the license violation. So changing guid does not seem to help.</p>

										<p><p>don&#39;t answer your own question with other details. Comment your original question.</p>
<p>The cloud icon I think it should be the fact that it&#39;s cloud enabled ..?</p>

										<p><p>We have apps that are cloud enabled and show the titanium icon and not the cloud icon. But some apps show that cloud icon instead… specifically this one that does not work with the module in question…</p>
