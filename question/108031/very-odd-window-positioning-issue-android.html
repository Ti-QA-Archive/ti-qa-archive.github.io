			<h1>Very odd window positioning issue (Android)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ll try to keep things simple:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>My app has a tab group.  In some cases it opens a new window (call it Info window).  From there a button opens &quot;more info&quot; which is designed to look like a popup (it has some padding and a border).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Testing on API 1.6 everything works fine for me.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Testing on API 2.2.1 the more info &quot;popup&quot; is located relative to the info window views not the overall screen (and thus is basically positioned out of view).</p>
</li>
<li><p>If I alter the code to remove the tab group and just have it open the info window directly things work again.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So as far as I can tell there seems to be some issue with the combination of the tab group + opening the window + 2.2.1.  I&#39;m pretty much out of ideas.</p>
<p>Here is the code to open the &quot;more info&quot; window:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">borderSpace </span>= <span class="hljs-number">40</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
<span class="hljs-label">var</span> w = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
<span class="hljs-label">    height:</span>styles.ui.platformHeight-<span class="hljs-keyword">borderSpace,
</span><span class="hljs-label">    width:</span>styles.ui.platformWidth-<span class="hljs-keyword">borderSpace,
</span><span class="hljs-label">    backgroundColor:</span><span class="hljs-string">'white'</span>,
<span class="hljs-label">    borderWidth:</span><span class="hljs-number">3</span>,
<span class="hljs-label">    borderColor:</span><span class="hljs-string">'#336699'</span>,
<span class="hljs-label">    left:</span><span class="hljs-keyword">borderSpace/2,
</span><span class="hljs-label">    right:</span><span class="hljs-keyword">borderSpace/2,
</span><span class="hljs-label">    top:</span><span class="hljs-keyword">borderSpace/2,
</span><span class="hljs-label">    bottom:</span><span class="hljs-keyword">borderSpace/2,
</span><span class="hljs-label">    layout:</span><span class="hljs-string">'vertical'</span>
})<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
<span class="hljs-label">w.open</span>({animate:true})<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>UPDATE:<br>Originally I was opening the Info window using <code>Titanium.UI.currentTab.open(newwin,{animated:true});</code> this was opening the window over the entire screen (e.g. covering the tabs) - which I liked.  However my more info window placement issue goes away if I change that code to <code>newwin.open({animated:true});</code>.  However, now both the info and more info windows are located within the tabs (not preferable but if its the right way I&#39;ll deal).</p>
<p>All in all I think I need some guidance on how to properly &quot;stack&quot; windows.</p>

<p>What is 2.2.1? I&#39;ve never heard of it. What is styles.ui?</p>

							<div><p>I updated the question with more info.  To your questions styles.ui is just a helper class of mine (modeled after the ui helper class in tweetanium).  2.2.1 should actually be APIs 2.2 - my eyes deceived me.</p>

							<p>After doing a lot of playing around, I&#39;m pretty stumped and think this may be a defect.  What is the appropriate way to submit a bug?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve posted a full copy of a sample app that has this same issue.  </p>

										<p><p>Wow, this is driving me nuts.  I can&#39;t figure out what in my code is different from the KS example.  In KS if you follow the Base UI -&gt; Windows Standalone -&gt; Open Plain its pretty much exactly what I want.  Tab group -&gt; open window -&gt; another open window.  Yet if you look at the pastie link it doesn&#39;t work!</p>

							<p>After an entire day of experimenting it appears that this issue is related to ONE LINE of code <code>win.layout=&amp;#39;vertical&amp;#39;;</code>.  If I remove that the issue goes away.  I must assume this is a bug and not intended behavior.</p>
<p>What is the proper way to submit a bug?</p>

										<p><p>There is indeed a proper way to submit a bug, and the first rule of it is not to assume  you have found a bug simply because you cannot get something to work.</p>
<p>You need to create a usecase, and post it here for others to test and confirm on their systems. The code above is not a usecase, because it does not allows someone to paste it into a default app and for it to run without modification. If you want to read more about use-cases, see <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.appcelerator.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;contribute.html#creating_good_use-cases">Creating Good Use-cases</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the time you should post proper usecases to the Q&amp;A also.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks.  Paul, is the code I pasted in the pastie URL (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;1522179) not a good use case, that code is pretty much runnable by cutting and pasting the code into the proper files.</p>
