			<h1>App crashes an Android because of confliciting names</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p><strong>Ti SDK 3.4.1, Alloy 1.5.1</strong></p>
<p>I have several modules residing in the <code>app&amp;#x2F;lib</code> directory. One named <code>form.js</code> and another named <code>filter.js</code>. </p>
<p>It took me hours to find out the cause why my app didnt load these properly on Android. Apparently when i <code>require()</code> them in my code, another module gets used which seems to be part of the default framework. So these names are &#39;reserved&#39;.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any more of these names I should know of?</strong> I previously had issues with <code>database.js</code> and I think there are more that should not be used as a name.</p>
<p>I really dislike this setup (and the overal function of <code>require()</code>, in that it looks in several different directories)</p>
<p>I&#39;m thinking of using a fix which basically adds subdirectory, so all my modules are in <code>app&amp;#x2F;lib&amp;#x2F;unconflictingname&amp;#x2F;**</code> but this means I have to edit all my <code>require()</code> statements to prepend this directory (and it looks very unfriendly)</p>

							<p>This is going to be true for pretty much any language. As a seasoned developer, I can tell you, you want to stay away from naming files with generic terms. &quot;form.js&quot;? Try &quot;SignupForm.js&quot; or something that can tell another developer, without having to dive into the code, exactly what the file does.</p>

										<p><p>Aint it kinda odd that things are somehow put in the same namespace? I decided to go with renaming my files, but it makes no sense that random filenames are conflicting when they are residing in your <code>app&amp;#x2F;lib</code> directory. I would call it a bug because I dont think it should be intended that all these files are seemingly compiled into the same directory</p>
