			<p>I have spent the last two weeks installing and setting up Titanmium and watching numerous videos on this site.</p>
<p>I am confused about a few issue and was hoping I could get some answers to enable me to proceed with my training…</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Is there a document which describes the development timeline of Titanium since it was originally launched, I have found references to Titanium Mobile &amp; Desktop, Titanium Studio, Titanium CLI and Alloy and am trying to understand how (and when) the difference components fit together and how the product has developed over time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>All the Titanium training I have seen so far doesn&#39;t seem to mention the Alloy Framework [I have seen the videos from Codestrong2012 when Alloy was &quot;launched&quot; but no step by step training]. If I am learning to build Apps in Titanium from scratch now [April 2013] would it be better to start with the original framework or should I start with Alloy ? Which is better for beginners  ? Will Alloy become the default way of coding within Titanium in the future ?  Are they any videos that show how to create Apps using Alloy ? [or maybe I have totally misunderstood how it all works]</p>
</li>
<li><p>The CLI - I have seen references to this across numerous videos - am struggling to understand whether this is something I need to know about - why would I want to use the command line when I can doing everything I need to within Titanium Studio ? </p>
</li>
<li><p>This Q&amp;A Section - whenever I search for answers here most of the search results show up Q&amp;A&#39;s from 1-2 years ago - is there a different way of searching or maybe there is somewhere else I should be looking for answers, such as a Google Group ?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Apologies if I have posted this in wrong place or I have missed something obvious.</p>
<p>Cheers<br>David</p>

							<div><p>Personally, I would start with the regular method.  Alloy seems nice, but for a beginner I think you&#39;re way over your head starting there.  To be honest, I dont know if I&#39;ll ever switch, the old method works fine, and will continue to be supported.</p>
<p>Also, the search functionality SUCKS.  Your best bet is to google &quot;appcelerator your question&quot;</p>

							<p>1: Not that I know of but here is a short explanation of each:</p>
<ul>
<li>Titanium Mobile: The SDK that lets you build mobile apps</li>
<li>Titanium Desktop: This no longer exists, its now supported by the community and not appcelerator, the name has changed to TideSDK</li>
<li>Titanium Studio: The IDE&#x2F;Code Editor built by appcelerator with tools to make Titanium development &quot;easier&quot; this is not needed to develop Titanium apps though, you can use any text editor</li>
<li>Titanium CLI: a command line tool to compile Titanium mobile apps, use this if you want to write code outside of titanium studio</li>
<li>Alloy: A framework built by Appcelerator to make Titanium development easier, it&#39;s a framework so it does not replace Titanium, it simply provides guidelines.</li>
</ul>
<p>2: There is no way to fully answer this without simply voicing opinions, me and my team are not fans of Alloy, many people live and die by it. Alloy will never replace non alloy development, but some features might bleed between the core and the Alloy framework.</p>
<p>3: Studio is an editor + tools + a UI for the CLI, if you want to use studio, there is no real reason at the moment to &quot;learn&quot;. If you have an editor you would rather use over studio, then learning the CLI would be a good thing.</p>
<p>4: The Q&amp;A sorts by relevance to your search not by date.</p>

							<p>I can speak for #2…</p>
<p>Almost everything you&#39;ve asked regarding Alloy can be ascertained from the list of resources found here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;148610&#x2F;alloy-kitchen-sink-documentation-samples">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;148610&#x2F;alloy-kitchen-sink-documentation-samples</a></p>
<p>In terms of its direction, Alloy is not meant to replace traditional Titanium development. It is a framework <em>for</em> Titanium development. It provides a standardized MVC structure, declarative UI via XML, styling, widgets, data adapters, compile-time optimizations, and a whole bunch of other stuff to make Titanium development faster and more performant, scalable, and maintainable. But if you don&#39;t like the approach, there&#39;s nothing binding you to use it, you can use as much or as little as you like (or none). That said, we use it for just about everything now at Appcelerator, both for apps developed internally and those for customers. It is in fact being integrated into the training curriculum. And if I can find a spare minute or two I probably should do a screencast or two. Though I think some might already exist if you search hard enough on google from the community developers.</p>

										<p><p>As far as whether if its for beginners or not, just take a stab at the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Alloy_Quick_Start">quick start</a>, which is mentioned in that initial link i posted, and determine fro yourself if it suits you.</p>

										<p><p>I think everything has been properly answered.  My 2 cents are that I have been working for the past months in a strategy for bringing VERY BASIC content for new developers.  You can look at Appcelerator&#39;s <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;appcelerator">Youtube Channel</a> and <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;appcelerator">Vimeo Channel</a>, where we are posting short (sub 5 min) videos on how to get started with Alloy.</p>
<p>As for Titanium Classic vs Alloy, it really depends of what your background is.  If you are a web developer who has been using the HTML + CSS paradigm, then Alloy is your best bet.  However, in the end, Titanium is Titanium, so you&#39;ll end up learning both, and using Alloy as an abstraction layer to make it easier to write.</p>
