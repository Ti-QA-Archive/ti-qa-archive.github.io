			<h1>Close windows in tab (revert to default window)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi All,<br>This one is driving me mad, i have noticed others have asked before and failed to get a definitive answer.</p>
<p>I will explain the issue through an example:<br>The user clicks on a tab defined in the TabGroup i.e. &quot;Home&quot; which points to &quot;window1.js&quot;. They then click on a button within &quot;window1.js&quot; which takes them too &quot;window2.js&quot;. The user then clicks on the tab again &quot;Home&quot;, this action closes &quot;window2.js&quot; and reverts back to the default window &quot;window1.js&quot;. Note: This is not exactly the situation but i hope you get the idea!</p>
<p>I want to do this action programmatically. </p>
<p>The first thing i thought was to fire the same action on the tab that the user does when it is clicked i.e.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">tab</span>.fireEvent(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>);
</code></pre><p>But nothing is simple, oh no - that would be too easy. </p>
<p>Other ways i have tried:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adding events to each window which i need to close and triggering them i.e. waterfall</li>
<li>Adding all windows to global array and looping through and closing</li>
<li>Firing all events on tab and tabgroup</li>
<li>setting active tab</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks in advance for any advice, much appreciated :)</p>

							<p>Thank you for your answer, infact i wanted to create a navigation group in the first place to manage the windows. I tried to implement a button bar, but had issues dissabling&#x2F;enabling buttons as and when the windows were needed. Maybe i should look into that method again.</p>
<p>For the looping process i had something like this (not syntactically correct, but you will get the idea):</p>
<p>app.js</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">myWindowArray = []


customEvent (addWindow(<span class="hljs-keyword">e</span>){
   myWindowArray.push(<span class="hljs-keyword">e</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">window</span>)
}

customEvent (reset(){
  <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> i = 0; i &lt; myWindowArray.length; i ++){
      myWindowArray[i].<span class="hljs-keyword">close</span>();
  }
});
</code></pre><p>window1.js</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">win</span> = currentwindow;
fireEvent('addWindow', {<span class="hljs-keyword">window</span>:<span class="hljs-keyword">win</span>});
</code></pre><p>window2.js</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var win = currentwindow<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
fireEvent<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-quoted">'addWindow</span>', {window<span class="hljs-keyword">:win</span>})</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
fireEvent<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-quoted">'reset</span>')</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>problem was you cant objects such as windows through custom events in this fashion</p>

							<p>If i understand what you are trying to do, then the proper apple human interface guidline would be to have a navigation group inside of the tab that would manage the windows.</p>
<p>I think it might just be easier to implement your solution that way instead of trying to roll your own.</p>
<p>However… if you insist on rolling your own solution, then I would recommend creating your own stack of windows and looping through and closing windows as needed based on the event.</p>
<p>You said you tried that approach? Can I suggest you post the code you tried so the community might be able to give you feedback on something more concrete?</p>
