			<h1>Use dropbox or box.net to backup user settings?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a simple utility application and I was thinking about letting users backup and restore there backups to the cloud. This would also allow them to sync between different devices or new phones. I was thinking I could easily use a new dropbox account or a box.net account to store these files (most likely xml and less than 500 kb). </p>
<p>Has anyone tried this before or any issues that I am not thinking of? Im thinking it would be simpler (and cheaper) than AWS or ACS. Look forward to hearing any ideas..</p>

										<p><p>Aaron, I watched the forging titanium video and it seems the box module still opens the webpage to allow the user to login. Do you know if its even possible to do a &#39;silent login&#39; so that on application start I would login with my credentials?</p>

										<p><p>So I went ahead and added a silentLogin function to the box.net module along with a getAccessToken function. Worked like a charm! Thanks again for the help guys!</p>

										<p><p>It looks like both of those modules only prompt the user to login to there own account which wouldnt work. I did find this code by Aaron Saunders which looks to be a POST API js library and should do the trick for dropbox.</p>

										<p><p>I signed up for the box.net account when they were offering free 50 gigs and have never used it. I figured that would be more than enough storage, for now at least. Plus is it really any different than AWS or ACS? I would have full access to those also and they are both &#39;cloud storage&#39;.</p>

							<p>Dropbox &#x2F; Box.net accounts are for end users. I think it&#39;s a safe bet that it is against their Terms Of Service to resell their service (online storage), which is basically what you&#39;re proposing. You&#39;ll need to use something like S3, ACS or Parse.net.</p>

							<p>Dude you are inviting a world of hurt. Bad security, ToS violation.</p>
<p>Use the API and let the users use their own box.net&#x2F;dropbox accounts.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, this is still an option I was just trying to make it as easy as possible for the end user. Them just clicking &#39;backup&#39; or &#39;restore&#39; is alot easier then making them select a backup solution (dropbox or box.net) then making them sign in&#x2F;register then backing up.</p>
