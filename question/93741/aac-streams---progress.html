			<p>Since asking this question several months ago others have also stated they wish to be able to play Shoutcast style aac format streams. However the current TI AudioPlayer API is unable to oblige.</p>
<p>We then learned that John McKnight had solved the problem (to do with file extensions) and included it in his own build of the 1.5.0 SDK. At the time it I didn&#39;t try to download it for various reasons but it did seem odd that this wasn&#39;t being rolled into the general 1.5.0 or 1.5.1 release and it still hasn&#39;t from what I can tell.</p>
<p>Maybe John can build a player &#39;module&#39; using his fix? I&#39;m sure some would be willing to pay something towards his work. The inability to play a radio station&#39;s main stream is really crippling my app building right now as customers - certainly in the UK - expect it to able to play the aac format.</p>

							<p>I have put an app together with Titanium that streams an AAC shoutcast using the following:</p>
<h2 id="for-ios">for iOS</h2>
<p>Use a videoPlayer and not audioPlayer:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var streamer = Ti.Media.createVideoPlayer({
                url : 'http://<span class="hljs-number">198.144.148.12</span>:8000/'
            })<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
            streamer.play()<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><h2 id="for-android">for Android</h2>
<p>audioPlayer or videoPlayer do not support AAC at all so I developed the following module:</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;5728</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Trevor - since my question of two years ago (time flies) I&#39;ve got AAC working in iOS by hacking the Objective-C class so it uses an extension as a &#39;hint&#39; for the format. That worked - but in my latest effort I just used the VideoPlayer as per your example which was easier and saved messing with the Objective-C class for each build. Originally the Video Player could not be used as it could not be hidden.<br>For Android - I&#39;ll have a look at your module, but wonder about the question of 3rd party licensing of the AAC codec as in here http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vialicensing.com&#x2F;licensing&#x2F;aac-fees.aspx</p>

										<p><p>Hi Patrick, </p>
<p>The module uses it&#39;s own codec decoder so AAC licensing may be required dependant on device and use. Typically if the module is used without publishing the app then no license is required. I have updated the Marketplace listing to state this. Either way the module still provides the functionality that is not supported elsewhere so hopefully it will help anyone wanting to stream AAC with the intention of having the right licensing in place.</p>

										<p><p>The module is still available https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;5762.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can search on the Marketplace for &quot;Android Audio Streamer&quot;.</p>
