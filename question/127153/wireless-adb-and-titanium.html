			<h1>Wireless ADB and Titanium</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>I am not able to get my device drivers installed &#x2F; working correctly on my machine, so I have had to resort to wireless adb.</p>
<p>Titanium recognizes my wireless adb device when it starts to build, but after it gets ready to start doing stuff on the device it says [ERROR] device not found (not exactly copied, but its in red and says something 99% to that).</p>
<p>Is there a fix for this issue?   I can&#39;t push anything to the device, not even a blank new project in Titanium Studio.  Kitchen Sink as well.</p>
<p>I am trying to &quot;Install on Android Device&quot;   I have Android 2.3.3 installed on the device, and it&#39;s connected via adb connect xxx.xx.xx.xxx:5555 wireless adb using app &quot;ADBWireless&quot;.</p>
<p>Thank you so much!</p>
<p>Nathan</p>

							<p>And just to reiterate, it says it found 1 adb device &#x2F; emulator, it then does some copying and jarsigner stuff, then displays the ugly red message, and says &lt;terminated&gt; Application Install.  </p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated, so I can capture the full power of Titanium Studio.</p>

							<p>You&#39;re going to have to install it directly from adb. If you have a mac you open terminal. Go to the android directory that has adb (platform-tools or tools) and input <code>adb install -r yourbuiddirectory&amp;#x2F;android&amp;#x2F;bin&amp;#x2F;app.apk</code></p>

							<p>James,</p>
<p>I was afraid you&#39;d say that, I&#39;m so used to Titanium holding my hand haha. Thank you for letting me know.   So I can manually build the APK using Titanium, and then just push to the device..</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to leave this issue up in case Titanium gets wind of it and can look into it. Wireless ADB is the way to go when USB drivers are full of fail!</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>
<p>Nathan</p>

							<p>It&#39;s not a Titanium issues as it&#39;s more of an adb issue. When it links to Development tools, it seems to lose the ability to install on a wireless connection. It does that in eclipse and intelli j as well. Not sure what the solution would be though.</p>

							<p>yeah i ran into this problem as well. the reason titanium returns 0 devices is because of the &quot;-d&quot; in front of install. the -d makes the adb only return devices plugged in through usb. this is incase the machine has emulator(s) running.</p>
<p>i have tried turning the -d off, but it is probably deeper then i am willing to dive. it would really be nice to be be able to switch this off in future titanium versions. </p>
<p>i have tried manually pushing the apk through adb but it always says &quot;file not found&quot;.</p>

							<p>It certainly doesn&#39;t help that builder.py forces you to use device arguments. I got my build system working by modifying builder.py to allow for no device args instead of defaulting on -d, -e, and -s.</p>
<p>Just search around for &#39;-d&#39;, &#39;-s&#39;, and &#39;-e&#39; removing any case where it&#39;s just defaulting, then remove self.device_args from any calls if it is set to None.</p>
<p>Also note that adbWireless doesn&#39;t work when your device goes to sleep so keep it awake during the build and run and it will work.</p>
