										<p><p>You appear to have found the deployments section now which is good.  Now we need to work through the disabled options.</p>
<p>Titanium itself is a SDK that works with the platforms you mentioned.  You need to install support for those so titanium can see them.  This means downloading and configuring the target platforms SDKs themselves.  Good news titanium helps you do this.</p>
<p>Before we get there I suspect the lack of iPhone&#x2F;iPad means you are using either windows or Linux as your development machine.  If this is true then you will NOT be able to develop for iOS as apple development requires the use of Xcode in the background which is only available on the mac.  There is also a licence restriction by apple only allowing dev via a mac, but as Xcode cannot be run without one it is hard to break the licence.</p>
<p>You can learn all about what you need in the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Titanium_Compatibility_Matrix">compatability matrix</a>.</p>
<p>To install the other platform SDKs you wish to work with;</p>
<ul>
<li>in studio, select the home tab</li>
<li>choose the <strong>getting started</strong> option</li>
<li>click your platform choice</li>
<li>choose the setup option that appears to the right</li>
<li>follow the instructions</li>
</ul>
<p>When you have completed the process this page will confirm that and your new platform choice will appear as you have now found it.</p>

										<p><p>One VERY important note.</p>
<p>You are using Windows, however you can ONLY create iOS apps of any sort using a mac as the desktop OS.  This is a restriction enforced by Apple due to two reasons;</p>
<ul>
<li>xcode is used behind the scenes to compile the app and to push apps to the AppStore - this is ONLY available on OSX</li>
<li>Apple ONLY allows development to be done on a mac for iOS apps, which given the first point is mute as it is not actually possible to compile without XCODE for OSX</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find out more about this in the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Titanium_Compatibility_Matrix">Compatibility Matrix</a>.</p>

										<p><p>I am going to have a think and chat to some smarter people about the UI issue.</p>
<p>As to iOS development there is no way round it - you have to dev on a desktop and xcode is a necessary part (even if it was not the licence is) and this only runs on a Mac.</p>
<p>Cheapest entry point is a Mac Mini - which works perfectly BTW for this - office full of them.</p>

Does not make sense to me that I would need to sign-up (no docs to that effect) and under  For Titanium Users there is a guide that shows pages I am not seeing on the Dashboard.</p>

							<p>Maybe I don&#39;t understand - I tried what you suggested and I see Alloy and Classic  -but-  I don&#39;t see how to config and run as Android -or- iOS for iPad…  The QuickStart shows a Dashboard page with a Getting Started tab which leads to another page with a Configure tab and buttons for Android &amp; iOS…  Where are those pages -or- where are docs for the current system install??</p>

<p>You could also change configuration of your deployment targets selecting &quot;Run Configurations&quot;:<br><img src="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;s21.postimg.org&#x2F;flh4ycvqf&#x2F;image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Then find your project and you can change the Android SDK version and screen configuration for this particular run<br><img src="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;s15.postimg.org&#x2F;9865wtygb&#x2F;image.png" alt=""></p>
<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;speakerdeck.com&#x2F;ricardoalcocer&#x2F;develop-your-first-mobile-app-for-ios-and-android">This slide deck</a> has a very basic walk-thru on how to get started once your SDKs are properly configured.  Remember that Titanium requires the native SDKs to be installed in order to compile, test and package.  If your targets are grayed out, that means that Studio is not finding where your native SDKs are installed.  To make sure, you can go to Studio&#39;s preferences and make sure that the SDK locations are right:</p>
