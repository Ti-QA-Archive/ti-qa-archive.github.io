		<section>
			<p>I have searched for the past week through the Q&amp;A, through the wiki documentation, Google and tried different variations of code and I cannot find out why I cannot parse this XML. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>I&#39;ve touched the tiapp.xml by deleting and replacing the character, removing the build files, resaved the project and forced a rebuild.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I&#39;ve typed my XML as a string in a variable.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tried on different computers, OS 10.6.6, Windows 7, Windows XP and re-downloaded Titanium and Android Emulator</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And I still get the same TypeError: Cannot call method &quot;parseString&quot; of undefined. So I guess this means my XML is undefined? I know the XML is found and loaded, because the file.exists() = true and when I run the xml through file.read().text it will output the entire XML through Ti.API.info.</p>
<p>I&#39;m seriously pulling my hair out and I don&#39;t want to go to another platform because I&#39;ve already spent so much time learning this one and I enjoy Titanium!</p>
<p>Please help! </p>
<p>My app.js is: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;1716385 </p>
<p>My XML is: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;1694832 </p>
<p>My API.info: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;1716395 </p>
<p>Mobile Platform: Android, running latest SDK Emulator and HTC Evo<br>Titanium 1.2.2 with Mobile SDK: 1.6.1<br>Titanium Android SDK: API&#39;s 2.2</p>
<p>Thank you and I really appreciate your help with this.</p>

							<p>I spent a few hours trying to find the cause, and I am perplexed.  I can confirm the code works as-is under iOS, but not android.  It is like the compiler does not recognize the XML module must be included in the build.</p>
<p>In the end, I came up with a temporary work-around you can use until somebody can give a better explanation.  Edit the file at </p>
<p><code>C:\ProgramData\Titanium\mobilesdk\win32\1.6.1\android\dependency.json</code></p>
<p>and change line 28 to include the xml module like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    <span class="hljs-string">"required"</span>: [<span class="hljs-string">"analytics"</span>,<span class="hljs-string">"android"</span>,<span class="hljs-string">"ui"</span>,<span class="hljs-string">"json"</span>,<span class="hljs-string">"locale"</span>,<span class="hljs-string">"xml"</span>],
</code></pre><p>then force a full rebuild of your project (by clicking Save Changes on the Edit tab).</p>
<p>Your project should now work.  However, every project you do will now have the XML module support added, even if it does not need it.  Reapply this edit for each SDK level you use, or if you pick up the continuous builds, until this gets fixed in some future build.</p>
<p>If you want to know how I came to conclusion, read on.  If not, just stop now.</p>
<p>I tried various SDK levels with android, and it works up through 1.4.3 but starting with 1.5.0 where appcelerator optimized the android builds to only include referenced modules, it fails.</p>
<p>So I looked at the 1.6.0 kitchen sink and saw xml_dom.js uses it.  However, then I could not find where xml_dom.js is ever called.  So I modified it&#39;s Resources&#x2F;main_windows&#x2F;platform.js to add it as an option just after xml_rss.js</p>
<p>Upon recompiling kitchen sink, it could use Ti.XML.parseString(), so I added your code block to it and it worked as expected.</p>
<p>I then copied part of xml_dom.js to your project, and parseString() failed again.  So then I copied all of xml_dom.js into your project, and it still failed.</p>
<p>So somehow, compiling the full kitchen sink includes something that triggers the android build optimizations to include Ti.XML module support but just using Ti.XML.parseString() is not enough.  Neither is including everything in xml_dom.js</p>
<p>So I theorized that something else in the full kitchen sink project is triggering the inclusion on Ti.XML support, so I did text searches against all the resource *.js files.   Only xml_dom.js references Ti.XML, but suds.js referenced Titanium.XML.parseString() once.  So I tried using the full Titanium.XML.parseString() in your project (even though it should not matter) and it still failed.</p>
<p>Bottom line is I can&#39;t find any reason for kitchen sink xml_dom.js to work when compiled within the kitchen sink app, and the same code placed in another project to fail with your same undefined message for Ti.XML.parseString().</p>
<p>I am certain it is due to lack of inclusion of the Ti.XML module during compilation.  I just don&#39;t know how to force that to happen, other then stepping back to 1.4.3 prior to the optimizations of what gets included during android builds.</p>
<p>I then tried examining the phython stuff in the SDK folder I listed above, and builder.py and bindings.py seem to be where the magic is happening (or not) but I don&#39;t know phyton and had to just guess at what it is doing.  That lead me to dependency.json where an experiment lead to the above hack for forcing XML support to get included.</p>
<p>But this is just that – very much a hack and I still have no clue why a full build of the 1.6.x kitchen sink will get XML support included but not your project!!</p>

										<p><p>BTW, I read everything you said and that is very weird. Am I supposed to import the function into my app if I wanted to use the parseString? I&#39;m coming from Flash, and you had to import classes as you would in JS.</p>

										<p><p>Doug! SUCCESS!! It all worked! I can parse and get data from the XML now! Should this be considered a bug? It seems everyone is getting their XML data remotely vs local storage from an SDCard. Reason why i&#39;m doing it like this, I want the user to load the XML file via the SDCard and the app will update.</p>

										<p><p>Are you doing this on an iphone or android?  As I explained in my post, it works right on iOS but on android appears to only work until 1.4.3 even when I tried Titanium.XML.parseString() instead of Ti.</p>
<p>Starting with SDK 1.5.0, appcelerator attempts to optimize the size of the android *.apk by only including those modules it thinks are referenced (iOS already did this prior to 1.5.0) and it seems to not detect the XML module is needed.</p>
<p>What is strange is that the 1.6.0 kitchen sink suds.js references Titanium.XML.parseString() and does work, yet the references to Ti.XML.parseString() in KS&#39;s xml_dom.js do not work when used outside of KS.</p>
<p>I realize that is consistent with your assertion using Titanium.XML instead of Ti.XML works, but I have retried it here using the full Titanium namespace and it still fails for me at 1.6.1 and 1.7.0.</p>
<p>What SDK level are you using?</p>
