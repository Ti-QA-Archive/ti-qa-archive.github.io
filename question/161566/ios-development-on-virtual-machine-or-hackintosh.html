			<h1>IOS development on virtual machine (or hackintosh)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;d like to collect feedbacks about developing IOS apps on non-apple machines. I usually work on Windows (.NET) or linux (node.js) and app developent isn&#39;t my core business. Thus, I&#39;d rather save the economical effort of buying a macbook.</p>
<p>I&#39;m planning to start using alternative ways such as virtualbox or hackintosh (yes, that&#39;s kinda illegal due to Apple&#39;s policies), but I couldn&#39;t find anything related to titanium development.</p>
<p>If you experienced any issue, drowback, or maybe advantages of using macosx in a virtualbox&#x2F;hackintosh for titanium development, please share it with me (and the community, of course).</p>
<p>thaks a lot</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The short answer is no.</p>
<p>The longer answer is; </p>
<p>The ability to run virtual machines running OSX on windows is limited at best and simply unworkable (at this level) at worst.</p>
<p>The OSX licence does not allow you to run it on anything other than a Mac device (think Apple created only), this also means running on a &quot;hackintosh&quot; is also prohibited.</p>
<p>This does not mean it cannot be done on a hackintosh - but it does mean that you may very well have issues in the future with certificates even if you are happy to ignore the licence issues.  The reason I state this is certificates are created based on hardware and the hardware is not from Apple so at some point (not sure if already) this will cause problems.</p>
<p>XCODE also has licence restrictions so that it can only be run on an Apple computer running a suitably licensed OSX.</p>
<p>You could rent a virtual could based mac - although the costs for full time development very quickly become prohibitive.  <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macincloud.com&#x2F;">Mac in Cloud </a> is one such example.</p>
<p>So the only real and sensible solution is to own an actual Apple Mac.  I understand cost is a factor and a large factor but not all Macs are expensive any more.  You have more than one avenue to explore in sourcing an inexpensive Mac.</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy a reconditioned Mac from Apple - they come with the same warranty and are usually around 20-25% cheaper than normal</li>
<li>Buy a previous generation from eBay, you do not need the latest Mac just something that can take Mountain Lion at least and ideally suitable from Mavericks (which is a lot of macs for the last few years)</li>
<li>Think MacMini - the smallest desktop and still the best price to performance value of ALL the macs - it is not the fastest of all the Macs but it is more than fast enough to do any and all development - I have an office full of them doing all development on them.  The current model is £500&#x2F;$599 much cheaper than all other macs and you can add your own keyboard, mouse etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this helps answer your question.</p>
