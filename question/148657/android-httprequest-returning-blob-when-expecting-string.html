			<h1>Android HttpRequest returning Blob when expecting string</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have an app which has been running successfully under iOS for some time.  Included in that app are a number of HTTPClient requests (GET and POST) that handle interactions with the server.</p>
<p>The first of these (A GET) requests data from the server.  We can see that the request is being posted successfully and that a result is being returned.</p>
<p>The onLoad event is being fired from the HTTPClient.  When running under IOS the responseData returned is a long string containing XML.</p>
<p>In Android, however, the responseData is not a string but a BLOB.  if we attempt to grab the contents of the BLOB with responseData.text we only get a truncated string with the number of bytes at the end.  This string is about 100 characters in length.  <code>ResponseData.length</code> is reporting 15,000 bytes.</p>
<p>We have tried using Stream and Buffer to create a version of the string from the Blob, however we just keep getting the same truncated result. the script we are using is below:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var blobStream = Ti.Stream.createStream({<span class="hljs-string">mode:</span> Ti.Stream.MODE_READ , <span class="hljs-string">source:</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.responseData})
var newBuffer = Ti.createBuffer({<span class="hljs-string">length:</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.responseData.length, <span class="hljs-string">type:</span> Ti.Codec.CHARSET_UTF8})
<span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> (blobStream.read(newBuffer) &gt; <span class="hljs-number">0</span>)
{
};
blobStream.close()
</code></pre><p>Can someone explain how to either:<br>Get responseData to return a string rather than a Blob<br>or<br>Read the Blob so that we can get the full string rather than just the truncated string.</p>

							<p>Sorry this isn&#39;t directly answering your question, merely pointing you in a different direction.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve seen a similar response before but the issue was not an iOS &#x2F; Android problem but a data problem. This occurs when an unknown character is passed through the HTTPClient, in our case via JSON. The characters that caused issues for us were the £ sign and various french characters, although i&#39;m sure many others also cause this.</p>
<p>Could this be your actual issue?</p>
<p>The only way we found around it was to url encrypt &#x2F; decrypt the data</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>As you have not provided any <strong>httpClient</strong> related code or a link to the data, the best I can offer is a question that might help provide your answer.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Why are you not using <strong>this.responseXML</strong> instead of <strong>this.responseData</strong> when you say you are working with XML data?&quot;</em></p>
<p>It would seem more logical to work with the response designed to handle such responses.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Network.HTTPClient-property-responseXML">responseXML</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If this does not work, provide your <strong>httpClient</strong> routine so I can take a look.</p>

										<p><p>It seems I should have placed my response in a comment to your comment, sorry about that.  Just putting the information in the correct place.</p>
<p>The code that we are using can be summarised (some code not relevant to this issue has been removed) as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.HttpClient = Ti.Network.createHTTPClient();

        <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.HttpClient.onload = <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.onSuccess
        <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.HttpClient.onerror = <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.onAbort
        <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.HttpClient.autoEncodeUrl = <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.HttpClient.onreadystatechange = <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.onReadyStateChange
        <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.HttpClient.timeout = <span class="hljs-number">20000</span>

    <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.HttpClient.open(<span class="hljs-string">"GET"</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.Location, <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>)
        <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.HttpClient.send()
</code></pre><p>As you can see this is fairly standard code.  As I have stated before this routine works perfectly in iOS, it is only when running under Android that we start having issues.</p>

							<p>Interesting perspective in terms of strange characters as the code we are sending includes Italian translations and I don&#39;t think it is encoded.  However I have tried with something very simple like the google search page and that has had the same issue.</p>
<p>To resolve the issue of not suppling code this is a paraphrased example of the code we are using.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    <span class="hljs-comment">//Dummy location to test whether this works</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.Location = <span class="hljs-string">"http://www.google.com"</span>

    <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.HttpClient = Ti.Network.createHTTPClient();

        <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.HttpClient.onload = <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.onSuccess
        <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.HttpClient.onerror = <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.onAbort
        <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.HttpClient.autoEncodeUrl = <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.HttpClient.onreadystatechange = <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.onReadyStateChange
        <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.HttpClient.timeout = <span class="hljs-number">20000</span>

    <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.HttpClient.open(<span class="hljs-string">"GET"</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.Location, <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>)
        <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.HttpClient.send()
</code></pre><p>I have not provided the onLoad event because the issue occurs as soon as the onLoad is fired.  In this event rresponseData is a Blob.</p>

										<p><p>As you will see from the code that was supplied in the original description, the code in the link you ssupplied has already been attempted.  </p>
<p>Although it does not generate any errors when it is run it still only provides the truncated text rather than the full text</p>

							<p>Although I have not gotten an answer to the question how do you read a string from a BLOB I have found out how to not worry about the BLOB in the first place.</p>
<p>Reading the documentation I realise that there are three forms of the response from HttpClient:</p>
<p>responseData - Blob<br>responseXML - xml<br>responseText - text</p>
<p>The first two were giving me issues and so we have moved to responseText and that is now working.</p>

										<p><p>I am surprised that you think you did not get any answers - you had several, my own asked you to try something specific - had you tried that and had you come back with your results and even your <strong>this.onSuccess</strong> method you would have had an answer the same day.  But you gave insufficient code to help diagnose the problem and did not respond to questions.</p>
<p>BTW I told you to go and look at the different response types, particularly the XML as that was most likely the answer - given you had not done that and your still have not provided the actual code that processes the response it is very difficult for the community to assist you further.  So at least I got you that far even if you decided not to test it when I asked and the come back with results.</p>
<p>No problem, hopefully next time the community can help you out.</p>

										<p><p>WOW, I am not sure that this is particularly necessary.  </p>
<p>I did not get an answer as to how to get an string from a Blob although I got very valuable responses (including yours) that helped me find the right answer.</p>
<p>We did look at response.xml but because of the way our XML is transported to us from the server (over which we have not control) this solution would not work for us.  I specifically asked for how to get a string response because we have to trim it before converting it to XML and so responseXML would not work.</p>
<p>So lets be clear.  The community did help it just did not answer the question of how to get a string out of a blob.  The solution we ended up was to ignore the blob.  I have no problem with the contribution that was provided.</p>

										<p><p>I was not moaning - just pointing things out on how to get more out of the Q&amp;A the next time.  I knew your answer had very little to do with the specifics of your question as I had been there before - as you ended up finding out.  People who have been here for a while (us older wearier people) know when they need to provide an answer to the <strong>problem</strong> rather than an answer to the <strong>question</strong> - which was the case here.</p>
<p>I should have been clearer in my first question a few days back.  But I was waiting for a response to that question to then move to the next step.</p>
<p>But the good news is you have sorted it - and that is what we all wanted.  Cheers.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, thanks for your help and sorry for not coming back with an instant response.  I understand the issue about questions and answers often the first question is &quot;what is the question that I should be asking&quot; and often the answer to any issue is the answer to this first question.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help. It was appreciated</p>
