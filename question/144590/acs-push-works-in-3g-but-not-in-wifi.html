			<h1>ACS Push works in 3G but not in Wifi</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m building an Android app that uses ACS Push Notifications. The notifications arrive without problem when I&#39;m in a 3G network. But if I&#39;m over Wifi (a Wifi connection that works perfectly for all apps, including the one I&#39;m building), the push notifications don&#39;t arrive. They only arrive once I switch back the phone to 3G.</p>
<p>A similar issue was reported a few months back:  http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;139916&#x2F;acs-push-android-switch-to-3g-to-wlan—mqtt-stops-working </p>
<p>I&#39;m using ti.cloud 2.3.0 and ti.cloudpush 2.0.7</p>

							<div><p>Yes, this is a previous problem reported on Ti.CloudPush 2.0.5, but we have fixed this by latest CloudPush module 2.0.7. Could you please make a double check on your cloudpush version? If still failed, could you please send log (&#x2F;sdcard&#x2F;cocoafish&#x2F;log&#x2F;*) into plv@appcelerator.com for a further investigation?</p>

							<div><p>Hi Paul thanks for looking into this, I&#39;ve sent you the log to your email. I did double check the version and it&#39;s 2.0.7, this is what I have in tiapp.xml at least:<br>&lt;modules&gt;<br>        &lt;module platform=&quot;commonjs&quot; version=&quot;2.3.0&quot;&gt;ti.cloud&lt;&#x2F;module&gt;<br>        &lt;module platform=&quot;android&quot; version=&quot;2.0.7&quot;&gt;ti.cloudpush&lt;&#x2F;module&gt;<br>    &lt;&#x2F;modules&gt;</p>

<p>Hrm, that is interesting if true.</p>

										<p><p>It works fine on my wifi when I subscribe to the push using wifi.. it fails when I subscribe using 3G and then switch to wifi. Could it be that when I subscribe under wifi it grabs a different port than when it switches to wifi from 3G?</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m thinking maybe a different device id&#x2F;token.</p>
<p>That might be worth testing. Popup an alert with the token you get back when registering the device on 3g and on wifi see if they match.</p>

										<p><p>Oh having changing device tokens would be really bad. Maybe that explains why the notifications stop arriving after a few hours from the subscription (another issue which I&#39;ll get into once this one is solved). Will check and let you know</p>

										<p><p>Ok I&#39;m glad to announce that the device token does NOT change when I switch to wifi. The push notif arrive on 3G, then they don&#39;t in wifi, but luckily it&#39;s not a device token change. Will check in a few hours to see if it changes over time, as that would certainly explain the other issue I&#39;m having (notifications stopping arriving after a few hours).</p>

										<p><p>ok, that is VERY good news.</p>
<p>So to sum up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tokens are the same for 3g and wifi subscriptions on the same device</li>
<li>Device subscribed on 3g  does not receive pushes when on wifi only</li>
<li>Device subscribed on wifi does not receive pushes when on 3g only</li>
</ul>
<p>Correct.</p>
