			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am porting an iPhone app to Android platform and I am facing challenges at every step of the way. To start with - </p>
<p>UI Window features - there is no &quot;titleControl&quot; feature in Android. How can I add this or set the UI design for the tabs in Android?<br>Tabs end up on the top of the screen by default in Android.<br>The Videoplayer does not work in Android.<br>The window eventlisteners dont work in Android app.</p>
<p>Can anyone help with any of this? This is only the tip of the iceberg. I am trying to find solutions to a lot more. I have done a lot of research already to no avail.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Sri</p>

							<p>I&#39;m in the same boat as you with all the same issues.  My app worked great on Iphone terrible on Android.  It seems you can&#39;t do anything to move the tabs to the bottom on Android.  The Eventlisteners issue I found was solved by not layering views, you have to put views that you want to catch events directly on the window with no views on top of it or under it.  As far as the titleControl, are you talking about the title in the NavBar? if so there is no NavBar for Android unless you create your own.  My video player still doesn&#39;t work, not sure what to do there, my mapView is trashed and My app crashes all the time.  </p>
<p>It would be helpful if Appcelerator offered an overview of all the pitfalls that occur when you make that switch to Android with your code developed on IOS.  Hopefully this helps a little, I&#39;m still trying to work out what seems to be an endless list of bugs and it&#39;s pretty scary.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your answers!  Its good to know there are others who also have such problems. </p>
<p>Yes, I am talking about the titleControl for the tabs.<br>EventListeners - no views. All I am doing is in app.js - creating some tabs, and then creating and opening a &quot;loading&quot; window. Closing the window from itself - Ti.UI.currentWindow.close();. I have the eventlistener in app.js that never gets triggered. It works perfectly in iOS.</p>
<p>I just found this link - http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pasamio.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;07&#x2F;02&#x2F;a-few-months-with-titanium-appcelerator&#x2F; that talks about the differences. Havent finished reading it, but am hoping it will give me some direction.</p>
<p>If you know anything more, appreciate if you can please post here!</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Sri</p>
