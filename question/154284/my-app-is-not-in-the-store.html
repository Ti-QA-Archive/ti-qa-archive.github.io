							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Given your use of the phrase &quot;Read to sale&quot; I am going to assume that you are talking about the iOS AppStore.</p>
<p>Inside your iTunes Connect entry for your app there should be a link called <strong>View in App Store</strong>, that should give you access to the app directly.</p>
<p>Make sure you have agreed to any outstanding contracts (been at least one since iOS7), this can hold things up.</p>

										<p><p>If I try this on my iPhone it tells me that it is not available in the UK store but is available in the USA store - I tried swapping stores but it still fails to load the app suggesting that the app is not actually available.</p>
<p>I can only assume that there is still an issue with the app setting or a contract not yet accepted.</p>
