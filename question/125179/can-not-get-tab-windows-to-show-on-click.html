			<h1>Can not get tab windows to show on click</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Here is my app.js file.  This is my first Titanium project, so be kind ;)</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;Qz4yZX8J</p>
<p>So everything compiles and runs in the simulator, however, after you login with the fb mashup, it will show the tab bar, but none of the tab will open their window.  If I change the window property to {modal:true}, they open, but I do not like the behavior.  Can I use a view instead of a window?  Is there a better approach then the one I took in the code?</p>
<p>Thank you for your help!</p>

							<div><p>Just a note, checking for a facebook login every 10 seconds is a bad idea.<br>I am also a bit confused by what you are trying to do, you open the app and get the user to connect to facebook. Then you have other windows they need to be able to navigate to? If that&#39;s the case you should have a single window for the start then sub windows and using navigationgroup to control it.</p>

							<div><p>Thanks for the tips. I appreciate the feedback.</p>
<p>How would you ensure that the user remains logged into the app (fb will be acting as a &quot;sso&quot; for the app?</p>
<p>Also, does tabgroup not provide the same (or similar) experience as navigationgroup?  I was hoping to use the tabbar to navigate across 4 windows, win1, win2, win3, win4.</p>
<p>Thank you again, any and all suggestions are greatly appreciated.</p>

							<div><p>Before performing your function that requires login, check there.</p>
<p>Steven is right, regularly polling Facebook for login condition is a nasty overhead.</p>

							<div><p>Ok, can do.  I&#39;ll have to close all windows on logout and add the additional logic for other areas of the app, easy enough.  (although its not polling facebook, its checking the variable if FB is logged in, neither here nor there, I can do it without the polling.</p>
<p>Any suggestions on the Tabs&#x2F;Navigation.  This is where I am getting stumped for some reason.  I have followed the examples exactly, and can&#39;t seem to get the windows to display on tab click, unless modal is set to true.</p>
<p>ideas?</p>
