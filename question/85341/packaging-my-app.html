			<h1>Packaging My App</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m ready to package my app. I&#39;ve done everything according to the video on vimeo, however when I go to package it, everything seems like it&#39;s going properly, but then it opens up xcode and no zip file is created. It doesn&#39;t give me any sort of error that I can see.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any clue as to what&#39;s going wrong?</p>

							<p>Are you referring to the *.ipa file?  I think some people get that built automatically, but I don&#39;t and I don&#39;t know why.</p>
<p>But here is how I create the *.ipa file:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build the app using the distribution build mode of Titantium</li>
<li>Navigate to the project&#39;s build &gt; iPhone &gt; Release-iphonesos folder</li>
<li>If there is a *.ipa file as some get, just use it.</li>
<li>Otherwise create a new folder at that level called Payload</li>
<li>Move the project.app folder to inside the Payload folder</li>
<li>Zip the Payload folder</li>
<li>Rename project.zip to project.ipa</li>
</ul>

							<p>Thanks for the reply. Would it be too much trouble to ask for a link to that page on Apple&#39;s website? I am not familiar with xcode at all, and don&#39;t know how to package a project once I have it opened up. I built it, but it still isn&#39;t packaged.</p>

							<p>I used to have packaging issues, but currently am not.  It does &quot;just work&quot; for me.  However, it is temperamental at times, and I think it&#39;s in Xcode and all of the certificate chains.  I have had to re-provision the device a few times from Apple.</p>
<p>Here is what I&#39;d suggest you check:  open Xcode, with your iPhone attached, and check to make sure that everything looks good: the device had a green status circle beside it, and all provisioning profiles are installed and not expired.  No warning triangles anywhere.</p>
<p>I just successfully uploaded another app to the store last night, and to package it all I did was:</p>
<ul>
<li>load project in Titanium</li>
<li>on the distribute tab, click package button</li>
<li>open Xcode organizer</li>
<li>wait for quite a long time</li>
<li>watch as the new version appeared in Xcode under archived applications</li>
<li>click the app, verify, and upload to itunes connect from Xcode</li>
</ul>

							<p>Packaging in Titanium is crap.  You need to open the xcode project file (in the resources&#x2F;build&#x2F;iphone directory) and then use the instructions on Apples website.</p>
