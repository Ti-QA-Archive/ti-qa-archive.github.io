			<h1>Alloy Beginner&#39;s Questions</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I would like to ask a couple of questions on Alloy since I am a beginner.</p>
<p>I tried <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Alloy">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Alloy</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;alloy&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;alloy&#x2F;</a> but they are not much..</p>
<p>First of all, I want to make an alloy app which has a tabgroup and when it opens it uses another controller to show the first tab than index.js (kind of like using URL property of window in non-alloy apps). I have no idea how to do this and no example from github&#x2F;alloy helped me on that.</p>
<p>Also, I want to integrate SQLite in my app but I searched in the web and I couldn&#39;t find a helpful example in alloy that uses SQLite. Can anyone give me something for a starter? (some code would be helpful if anybody could provide).</p>
<p>I hope someone can help me since documentation of alloy is really not good at all.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

										<p><p>As I stated above I tried <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;alloy&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;alloy&#x2F;</a> and by that I mean the WHOLE repo.</p>
<p>You want to say that these alloy examples are enough? There are hardly 50 examples in there and most of them are like &#39;how to build a tableview&#39;. Correct me if I am wrong but aren&#39;t they too few?</p>
<p>Furthermore, I have been trying to create a custom property for a view (which was easily done by none-alloy programming) and I can&#39;t figure out how to do it anywhere so I am going to try experimenting till I get it done (if it is possible).</p>
<p>Last but not least, I am trying to integrate SQLite in my code but I only found a couple of examples in the alloy repo and they were not helpful enough to understand it.</p>

If that is too few, what number would you consider to be enough? </p>
<p>Adding a custom property to a view is performed the same as with non-Alloy development. The only difference is in how you reference the elements from the markup.</p>
<h3 id="index-xml">index.xml</h3>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">Alloy</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">&lt;!-- add a custom property right in markup --&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">Window</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">id</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"win"</span>/ <span class="hljs-attribute">customProperty</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"123"</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">Alloy</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><h3 id="index-js">index.js</h3>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// add a custom property from the controller</span>
$.win.anotherCustomProperty = <span class="hljs-string">'hi there'</span>;
</code></pre><p>As for sqlite integration, that is by far the most covered adapter in the test apps. Every example in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;alloy&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;test&#x2F;apps&#x2F;models">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;alloy&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;test&#x2F;apps&#x2F;models</a> with the exception of &quot;properties&quot; and &quot;binding_no_persistence&quot; uses the sql adapter in varying ways. This leaves you with 9 different tests apps, including the more complete &quot;todo&quot; app, to learn how to use the built in sqlite integration. Your exact use case may not be accounted for, but surely this gives enough <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Alloy_Models">documentation</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;alloy&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;test&#x2F;apps&#x2F;models">samples</a> to get you going.</p>

										<p><p>Tony,</p>
<p>Thanks for the help. I will mark this answer as Best since you took the time to give me some details on custom properties.</p>
<p>BUT..</p>
<p>-&quot;Well there&#39;s the 50 or so examples in the repo and the Alloy Framework docs should be extremely helpful. If that is too few, what number would you consider to be enough?&quot;</p>
<p>-If KitchenSink which is just a sample of titaniums functionality abilities and it has more than 4x cases and more than 5x files than alloy and more inline (comments) documentation than alloy&#39;s examples, (especially since alloy is harder to get to know since it is a combination of xml and tss and js) then it is totally NOT enough..</p>
<p>+</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Alloy_Framework">Alloy_Framework docs</a> helps a bit but sometimes during development you see that there are things that are not sufficiently explained even there.</p>
<p>By the way,  I can see that you used slash here: </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">&lt;Window <span class="hljs-property">id</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"win"</span>/ customProperty=<span class="hljs-string">"123"</span>&gt;
</code></pre><p>before the declaration of customProperty. Is it a typo or you need to close your window before adding the property? For example, if you want to add a label and you have to use &lt;&#x2F;Label&gt; tag to close it, how are you going to add this customProperty?</p>
<p>And finally, I am confused with this ids and classes. Can I create a label (for example) inside a controller and give it an ID which I will then use in my TSS to style it?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot in advance.</p>

										<p><p>@Michael Massalas I appreciate the feedback and I am certain @Tony does also, I guess there really can never be too many examples, so you are correct on that point, but sometimes it is difficult to get the perfect example for every individual use case and that is what the forum is for.</p>
<p>Also I am personally lurking around all alloy related issues since I am working on a book on the topic and looking to see what people are asking and where they are getting stuck so that the content in the book is relevant and helpful.</p>
<p>I am saying this to say, please keep asking well formed detailed questions, it helps all of us.</p>

										<p><p>I am going to give you enough feedback since I have a lot of projects to do this year using titanium and I was asked to do so in alloy.</p>
<p>Please, though, try answering some of my posts a little bit more detailed. (E.g. in the comment above I asked 2 questions that I am sure you will find easy to answer..).</p>
<p>Thanks in advance..</p>
