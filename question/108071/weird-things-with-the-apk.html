			<h1>Weird things with the apk</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>So, I finished off my first titanium app for android, using 1.5.1. I tried &quot;run on the device&quot; and everything looked well (as well as I expoected as a Titanium rookie at least ;)</p>
<p>I created a keystore and everything and went through the steps for generating a signed apk. All nice, but then I tried to put that apk on a real phone and weird stuff happened.</p>
<p>First of all, it always start with forcing a restart. Always, on every phone I tried.</p>
<p>Then, on samsung, it showed the splashscreen, vibrated, and dropped out never to be started again.</p>
<p>On HTC it forced a restart, it showed the splashscreen, and then the menu. But none of the labels were UTF-8, instead it was weird little symbols? (all my sourcefiles are UTF-8?)</p>
<p>So .. if anyone could give me hints about were to start digging, please advice me.</p>
<p>Why does it force a restart?<br>Why isn&#39;t it showing UTF-8 in the labels with swedish å,ä,�� signs?<br>And why does it refuse to use the icon I gave it when building an .apk?</p>
<p>Is the manifest corrupted someway perhaps? Little do I know..</p>
<p>Regards</p>

							<p>Your issue seems opposite of an issue I was having.  I&#39;m not sure how UTF-8 characters are handled.  </p>
<p>Here&#39;s a thread you might want to check. </p>

										<p><p>Thanks for helping George but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the problem. The files are in UTF8 encoding, and it works well in the emulator or if I choose to &quot;run on device&quot;. It&#39;s when I build and sign the project as an .apk that the resulting project is trashed and behave like this.</p>

							<p>I have exact the same issues, all äöü Charactors work fine on emulator and on the device. But if I install an .apk file via download or Androif Market all special Characters are showed as 2 weird charactors. </p>
<p>I tried 1.5.1 and 1.6 latest nightly build.</p>
<p>Any new suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks Christoph</p>
