			<p>I&#39;d like to offer a free version of my app with iAds and then offer another one for $.99 without iAds.</p>
<p>How would you deploy this? Is this is what the Appstore toolkit does?</p>
<p>New territory for me here so looking for someone who&#39;s done this and took the path of least resistance.</p>

							<p>I would offer the app for free with the ads, then within the app put a subscription button that sells a subscription trough apple store.</p>
<p>When the app starts I will check in my server if the user has subscribed and if yes hide the ads.</p>

							<p>I would prefer to have a &quot;Lite&quot; and &quot;Full&quot; version, but that&#39;s just me. It&#39;d be much eaiser than checking for subscriptions and setting that all up.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Lite (Free) version - iAds
Full (<span class="hljs-variable">$0</span>.<span class="hljs-number">99</span>) version - No iAds
</code></pre><p>But that&#39;s just me and how I would do it, and plan to do it in the near future with one of my apps.</p>

										<p><p>If I went this route, would I change one line of code commenting out my advertising call and then re-submit with all my same certs, appid etc. or do I need to create a NEW appid, cert etc. and submit two separate projects?</p>

										<p><p>I do this with all my apps, and have to setup a new app ID and submit 2<br>separate apps, one free and one paid.  Mine use push notifications, so they all need their own<br>app ID for that purpose, but I think you still need 2 separate app ids, so they will both show up separately in the app store.</p>
