		<section>
			<p>I needed my build.log file, but it cannot be found, anywhere.<br>I noticed none of my projects actually have a build.log. One project does have a build.log, but that file came from another computer, on which it was installed. Over a year ago.</p>
<p>How Can I enable outputting this file again?</p>

<p>Missing from your question are a number of important pieces of information. I suggest you take a look at the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Using+Questions+and+Answers">Using Questions and Answers</a> article, specifically the Q&amp;A Question Checklist.  The missing information is critical to reproducing problems in a test environment and often indicates other factors that cause the undesirable outcome you are experiencing.</p>

							<div><p>Well.. it is all versions of all sdk&#39;s since I a year. So, what is there to include as versions.</p>
<p>it is Titanium Studio, as per tags. And it about iOS, as per tags too.</p>

							<div><p>So what your basically saying is that it doesn&#39;t matter what hardware you using, or the os, or the version of studio.</p>
<p>Because its all to do with the SDK&#39;s.</p>
<p>If you new the problem, how come you asked the question…</p>
<p>No the log file is under help-&gt; studio -&gt; view log file</p>
<p>But I am only guessing as to which log file your after.</p>

							<div><p>I am after &#39;build.log&#39; which should be in the build directory. Is it so hard to read my question and tags?</p>
<p>It is about iOS, so hardware is Mac. But since iOS is in the tags, you could&#39;ve concluded that.</p>
<p>What I didn&#39;t tell: osx 10.8. I have no build.log in any project, in the last year, since it is nowhere to be found.</p>

							<div><p>I really honestly don&#39;t know what else to give you guys. I found no setup on my machine working, for the past year. There are no &#39;build.log&#39; files. I answered all of your questions even in the initial question and tags. </p>
<p>I point out, that your question is answered up there, and you keep downvoting me and accusing me of stuff. I answered everything I can think of. There is no specific setup that is or isn&#39;t working.</p>

							<p>As of Titanium 3.0, Titanium has a new CLI that no longer generates the build.log file. The build.log mostly contained the output from the xcodebuild process. Now that the CLI outputs the complete xcodebuild output, there really is no urgent need for a build.log file.</p>
<p>You can see the full output by setting the log level to &quot;trace&quot;. This can be done in Titanium Studio from the console pane&#39;s log level menu (on the right side). Otherwise you can set it via the CLI by running:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">ti config <span class="hljs-keyword">cli</span>.logLevel <span class="hljs-literal">trace</span>
</code></pre><p>Now, with that said, I&#39;d like to add file logging back to the CLI. This is mostly for support reasons. If you have a problem, you can just copy the build.log into a gist and share the link. But being this isn&#39;t a huge priority compared to some of the other issues, it probably won&#39;t happen anytime soon.</p>

							<p>This is not an SDK issue, it is a Studio issue.. You did give us the fact your on MAc, and eventually the OS version, but not the version of Studio. It is a simple thing, provide all the information… Even if you don&#39;t think it is relevant.</p>
<p>A good guide is</p>
<p>Your Hardware ..<br>The OS version.<br>Version of Studio.<br>What SDK or SDK&#39;s<br>What device your building for.<br>What version of the OS of the device.. Especially if its Android.<br>If its a coding issue, the relevant code and if its lots paste bin it.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t expect people to look at the tags .. their supposed to be for searching, and previous experience shows that people use them badly.</p>
<p>Have a short title which preferable means something.</p>
<p>Explain in detail what the problem is..</p>
<p>You have done some of this, but not all….</p>
<p>And as it happens this appears to be a bug, the build log works fine for Android, but not IOS.</p>
<p>As such you need to raise a jira …</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;secure&#x2F;Dashboard.jspa</p>
