			<h1>addClass / removeClass</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello all,<br>I am facing this problem:</p>
<p>if I do</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable">$.</span>removeClass(<span class="hljs-variable">$.</span>debugInfos, <span class="hljs-string">'hidden'</span>);
</code></pre><p>when the application is in the boot process (still showing the splash screen) the app crashes few moments later with a nullpointer exception. It does not crash instantly (next few lines of code are being executed…), but when the view is about to be shown on the device.</p>
<p>I had to:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">setTimeout(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>)</span>{
    $.removeClass($.debugInfos, <span class="hljs-string">'hidden'</span>);
}.bind(<span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>), <span class="hljs-number">5000</span>);
</code></pre><p>which works and does not crash the application.</p>
<p>As you can see this is very bad, since the 5seconds delay is totally picked up (might be enough on one device, not enough on other…)</p>
<p>It seems to me as you simply cannot removeClass until the app if fully booted.</p>
<p>This is happening on android, 3.2.3.GA and does not happen if you only addClass…</p>
<p>(the .hidden class is a simple: { visible: false })</p>
<p>Thanks for your hints…</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The answer to this is - do not removeClass of a view that has been added to an XML view during load.</p>
<p>If you are using the removeClass at the start - stop doing that and change the properties of the to match the combination.</p>

										<p><p>Clearly this appears to be related to some form of debugging - find a different way.</p>
<p>When Alloy 1.4 is released (not yet) you will be able to add a clause in the XML markup to solve this for you.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">View</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">id</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"Alloy.Globals.isDebug"</span>&gt;</span>
  <span class="hljs-comment">&lt;!-- Only shows if true --&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">View</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>Then in <strong>alloy.js</strong>;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-constant">Alloy.Globals.isDebug</span> = <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>;
</code></pre><p>But again - this is NOT yet available until Alloy 1.4 is released in a month or two.</p>

										<p><p>don&#39;t be fooled by the the &quot;debugInfos&quot; id.<br>This is just an id…<br>and your answers seem to validate what actually seems a bug to me.</p>
<p>your solution is just a different form of workaround…<br>and I don&#39;t see any reason why i should not removeClass on a XML generated view.</p>
<p>I am positive this is a bug, and possibly should be filed as such, unless I find any info in the manual about such limitation.</p>
<p>Besides, since it&#39;s just a matter of timing (same code works fine when application is fully booted and view is placed in the window), I am even more positive that should be fixed.</p>

										<p><p>I try not to be fooled - on a daily basis I am always looking out for times when people are trying to fool me.</p>
<p>But given your id example was <strong>debugInfos</strong> who would of thought the issue was not related to <strong>debug</strong>?</p>
<p>My issue is not if it is a bug or is not a bug - it is more - why would you possibly remove a class of something that has yet to even appear on start-up?</p>
<p>If your intention is to remove properties from something before they have even been seen without.  As there appears to be no logically determination as to if the class (properties) should be removed - then again - just incorporate them.</p>
<p>My conclusion was that removing a class during the creation of the view may cause problems - this may be a bug or not - you choose, but still a very strange process.</p>
<p>It is like saying I am creating a car with 4 wheels, just before I take it on the road I rip off one of those wheels, why not just make a 3 wheel car?</p>

										<p><p>The code is being called after</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">$.mainWindow.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span><span class="hljs-literal">()</span>;
</code></pre><p>So, unless we found a fantastic multithreading, I suppose open(); is called and finished when I do a removeClass().</p>
<p>This means, to me, that $.myObjectId has already been opened, since it is a child of mainWindow.</p>
<hr>
<p>That given, suppose this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (user.isAdmin) {
    <span class="hljs-variable">$.</span>removeClass(<span class="hljs-variable">$.</span>adminPanel, <span class="hljs-string">'hidden'</span>);

    <span class="hljs-variable">$.</span>removeClass(<span class="hljs-variable">$.</span>userPanel, <span class="hljs-string">'hidden'</span>);

										<p><p>I am still mystified;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use <strong>show()</strong> and <strong>hide()</strong> - designed for this exact task.</p>
<p>or </p>
</li>
<li><p>Use <strong>addClass</strong>, always better to have positive conditional code;</p>
</li>

<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (user.isAdmin) {

} <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
    $.addClass($.userPanel, <span class="hljs-string">'show'</span>);
}
</code></pre><p>By all means create a jira ticket, I have no wish to stop you - but ignoring built in methods and coding using a negative code structure is limiting and leads to problems going forward.</p>
<p>Chances are you will ignore everything I have said - but you asked - I answered, not as if I do not have any credence here; </p>

<p>This does not mean I am always correct, but it does mean that you should not dismiss me so quickly, unless you are always correct of course.</p>

										<p><p>Agreed - nothing in the documentation that would show that this is something not to do.</p>
<p>I am however in the progress of finding out why this would happen.  When&#x2F;if I get a response I will update you - I do not like open questions that this has raised.</p>

										<p><p>I have been chatting with Tony Lukasavage (he built Alloy) and he has asked if you can create a ticket on jira with a very simple quick test case that can be used by anyone to paste into a shell test app to see it fail.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;">jira.appcelerator.org</a> ticket.</li>
</ul>
<p>Paste back the ticket URL here and I will pass it on so he will then review the ticket personally.  Having chatted through the process with him - he confirms that it should not have an issue - this is why he needs a good but simple test case to review.</p>
