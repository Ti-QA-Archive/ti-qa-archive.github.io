			<h1>Fresh Titanium Install won&#39;t run a fresh HelloWorld app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am running a fresh install of Xcode 3.2.5 and iOS SDK 4.2.  Creating a basic hello world app in cocoa works and runs correctly there.</p>
<p>Then I downloaded and installed titanium and I am having a few problems.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In titanium, if I go to build and run in the iphone emulator.  The SDK selector on that page always says &quot;loading…&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When trying to run a completely fresh hello world app the logs builds and then launches the iphone simulator and then immediately launches and then closes the app without it ever appearing on the screen.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When opening and building the same project in xcode I recieve two build errors.</p>
<p>&quot;Run custom shell script &#39;Run Script&#39;&quot;<br>AND<br>&quot;Duplicate symbol _main in Resources&#x2F;libTitanium.a(main.o)&quot;</p>
<p>Can anyone shed some light as to why I am seeing these errors with every titanium project (even brand new fresh apps with no code in them)?  And perhaps how I can solve the problem?</p>
<p>It seems a bit odd that a clean install of the SDK and a clean install of titanium yields so many errors off the bat.</p>

							<div><p>I can open the prereq.py file in xcode to see its contents, is that what you mean?  I&#39;m not sure if there is someway of running that particular file.  Or if you just wanted me to copy&#x2F;paste here what that file contains.</p>

							<p>I seemed to have fixed my problem by updating Titanium to the latest version 1.5.1 and then making sure i switch all projects to using that version.</p>
<p>After doing that I can build and run in the simulator.</p>
