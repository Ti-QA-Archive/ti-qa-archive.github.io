			<h1>8.1 Source Code and debugging for android froyo 2.2</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>We recently completed an app using the old 8.1 source (3dmotionapps.com). Because of how 8.1 was formatted it worked well for what we wanted to accomplish.</p>
<p>However, we&#39;re having probs with 2.2 not loading up the ti java&#39;s.</p>
<p>Does anyone out there have a copy of the win32 8.1 sdk source code (use to be up on github).</p>
<p>We&#39;ve put 100&#39;s of hours of work into the app and want to ensure that it works OK on 2.2.</p>
<p>Also, we&#39;ll be glad to share our findings with anyone else out there with 8.1 apps in the android market.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Michael</p>

							<p>I think I&#39;m just about there on this fix.</p>
<p>In ti.all, it looks like the reference to &quot;native&quot; is the problem (as you mentioned Don) for only certain 2.2 builds – depending on the rom (works fine in emulator).  </p>
<p>I&#39;ve imported the source into Eclipse and have been able to successfully export a working titanium.jar</p>
<p>Question:<br>I see there is also a titanium-map.jar – which seems to be just about identical with titanium.jar - and no separate src seems to exist for it.  Are both libs loaded at startup?  They both contain the ti.all which appears to be the problem.  Can I use the same file for both without any probs?</p>
<p>Thanks again Don.  You&#39;ve been a big help. </p>
