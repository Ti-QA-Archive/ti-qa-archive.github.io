			<h1>Custom Buttons in addition to a TabGroup</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Im sure this has been addressed before, in fact I found a similar post to it, but it was almost 3 years old. Im building an app that has a tab group with 5 tabs at the bottom.  on the main window I have 4 buttons and need for them to act just as the tabs at the bottom do.  For example, button one will take you to the same page&#x2F;window as tab two, etc..</p>
<p>The reason Im posting this is because last week I found a great post on how to best code this to avoid overlap, but have searched now for almost 2 hours and cannot find it. Can anyone point me to where I learn how to code the buttons so that when clicked they go to the same windows that the tabs do.  I should also ask this- should the buttons be in a customized navigation menu?  I saw a post that states that so have to ask.</p>
<p>Im building this app for iPhone, iPad, and Android.  I have learned Xcode (Objective-C) and know some JavaScript, and am hoping to fall in love with Appcelerator Titanium too.  So far its been a great experience, but Im definitely an Appcelerator newbie.</p>
<p>Any help, or point in the right direction would be sincerely appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you,<br>John</p>

							<p>All you have to do is add an event listener to the click event of the button that calls the TabGroup method <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.1&#x2F;index.html#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.UI.TabGroup-method-setActiveTab">setActiveTab</a>.  This is how your code would look (assume the TabGroup is named tabGroup):</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> button = Titanium.UI.createButton({
   title: <span class="hljs-string">'Hello'</span>,
   top: <span class="hljs-number">10</span>,
   width: <span class="hljs-number">100</span>,
   height: <span class="hljs-number">50</span>
});
button.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Set the active tab here, its 0-indexed, so this will set the tab to the first tab</span>
    tabGroup.setActiveTab(<span class="hljs-number">0</span>);
});
</code></pre><p>I&#39;m not entirely sure what your use case is but this is the basic code to change the active tab with a button.</p>

							<p>Josiah thank you!  I have the Event Listener in based on the documentation, but was stuck on the internal nav.  I really appreciate you finding my post, as it had dropped back a couple pages, and helping me out.  I will give it a shot and jump back here if for some reason it is not working like I need it to.  I have to just say, for whoever happens to read this, but this forum is so much nicer than the Apple forum as far as the kindness and willingness to help. I got the point with Xcode where I would jump out to external forums for help because the guys typically answering the questions on the Apple forum tend to be rude and treat the newbies like they are experts asking newbie questions.  Once again, my post was several pages back by now Im sure and I thank you for jumping in and providing me some assistance.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>John</p>

							<p>Also, just so I follow the proper etiquette, can I ask you another question unrelated to my first or do I need to start a new thread?  I got slammed on the Apple forum for that.  Thank you!</p>

							<p>OK so that did not do it.  Im going to post the code here, with the addition that I made based on your suggestion.  Let me also review my question just in case i missed something.  Yes its called &quot;tabGroup&quot; and there are 5 tabs at the bottom.  On the main page I have 4 buttons, the first to lead to tab2(window, page, etc..2) , the second to lead to tab3 and so on.  Basically, my client just wants the buttons as a second option to the tabs.  So here is the code on the main page, &quot;app.js&quot;- this is the first part of the code and I included it to show where it links over to a second page, &quot;photos.js&quot; where I have the buttons coded with their event listeners.</p>
<p>First part of &quot;app.js&quot;:</p>
<p>Titanium.UI.setBackgroundColor (&#39;#fff&#39;);</p>
<p>var tabGroup = Titanium.UI.createTabGroup();<br>.<br>var win1 = Titanium.UI.createWindow({</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-string">title:</span> <span class="hljs-string">'Preschool Daily App'</span>,
<span class="hljs-string">backgroundImage:</span> <span class="hljs-string">'images/homeScreen2.png'</span>,
<span class="hljs-string">url:</span> <span class="hljs-string">'photos.js'</span>
</code></pre><p>});</p>
<p>var tab1 = Titanium.UI.createTab ({<br>    icon:&#39;images&#x2F;house.png&#39;,<br>    title:&#39;PDA Main&#39;,<br>    window:win1<br>});</p>
<p>First part of &quot;photos.js&quot; to show all of the code for the first button, including your suggestion:</p>
<p>var win = Ti.UI.currentWindow;</p>
<p>var label1 = Titanium.UI.createLabel({<br>    color:&#39;#000&#39;,<br>    text:&#39;New Window&#39;,<br>    font:{fontSize:20, fontFamily:&#39;Helvetica Newe&#39;},<br>    textAlign:&#39;center&#39;,<br>    width:&#39;auto&#39;<br>});</p>
<p>var button = Ti.UI.createButton({<br>    backgroundImage:&#39;button1.png&#39;,<br>    title: &#39;Daily Reports&#39;,<br>    top: 3,<br>    width: 190,<br>    height:45</p>
<p>});</p>
<p>button.addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;, function(e)<br>        {</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">        tabGroup.setActiveTab(<span class="hljs-number">0</span>);

        <span class="hljs-regexp">//</span>});
        <span class="hljs-regexp">//new</span>Win.myvar - <span class="hljs-string">"This is my var text"</span>;

        <span class="hljs-regexp">//</span><span class="hljs-constant">Titanium.UI.</span>currentTab.open(newWin,{<span class="hljs-symbol">animation:</span><span class="hljs-keyword">true</span>});
</code></pre><p>});</p>
<p>I created this from a tutorial I watched and the tutorial had the Event Listener just put &quot;You clicked the button&quot; and that still appears down in the console.  However, clicking the button does not take them to page 2&#x2F; tab 2.  Have I provided enough information for you to understand where I am going wrong?</p>
<p>Most appreciated,<br>John</p>

										<p><p>It looks like tabGroup is not in the scope of photos.js, therefore inaccessible.  As a quick fix, just make tabGroup a variable of each window.  Like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> win1 = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
    title: <span class="hljs-string">'Preschool Daily App'</span>,
    backgroundImage: <span class="hljs-string">'images/homeScreen2.png'</span>,
    url: <span class="hljs-string">'photos.js'</span>
});
// <span class="hljs-keyword">Do</span> this <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> each window
win1.tabGroup = tabGroup;
</code></pre><p>Then change the button code to : </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">button.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{
        win.tabGroup.setActiveTab(<span class="hljs-number">0</span>);
});
</code></pre><p>Also if you use the styling when your posting it will make your code easier for everyone to read.</p>
