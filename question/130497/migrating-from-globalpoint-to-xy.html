			<h1>Migrating from GlobalPoint to X,Y</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a drag script that works great (based on TiDrop), except it uses globalPoint. In Ti 1.8, globalPoint is now deprecated. So I was looking at switching to the new event.x and event.y.  In my code, there is really no logic difference between using globalPoint and using e.x,e.y. I just calculate the difference between the starting point and the new point and then add this different to my view&#39;s location.</p>
<p>The problem is that where globalPoint dragged very smoothly, using e.x,e.y has a very &quot;jumpy&quot; look and the view does not keep up with the pointer position. It&#39;s almost like it takes e.x,e.y a short amount of time to update itself to the new position where globalPoint could update itself very quickly.</p>
<p>Has anyone else seen this happen?</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the hint. I calculated my own globalPoint based on another view that was not being dragged. This solution isn&#39;t really scalable, but it at least works for this instance.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Matt,</p>
<p>can you maybe give an example how you managed to fix or implement the TiDrop.js in Android. I&#39;ve tried several solutions with globalPoint and container&#x2F;parentviews but didnt work out sofar. </p>
<p>Found this true googling and it might help future visits! Thanks in advance!</p>
