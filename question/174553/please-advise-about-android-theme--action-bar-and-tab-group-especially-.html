							<p>Hi</p>
<p>You have a lot of questions there, I will do my best to answer them all.  But in order for you to appreciate what you can do and how - you have to actually start using the system.</p>
<p>You created two different lists, although not that easy to read I will try and keep the answers to the same points.</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<ol>
<li>Can the app comply with Android guidelines - yes certainly.</li>
<li>Compatible with 2.x the minimum supported is 2.3</li>
<li>You can have Action Bar and Tab Group</li>
<li>Need apps to look consistent between 2.x, 4.x and 5.x<ul>
<li>You currently fake it for the ActionBar on 2.x - most do (including me)</li>
<li>As 5.x does not exist it is impossible to say what changes if any will occur on the UI.  ActionBar was introduced in 3.x and refined in 4.x, so there is no telling what will happen in 5.x</li>
<li>You can take advantage of Android themes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can give up pre-Android 4.x - many have, this reduces problems, not only in the UI</li>
</ol>
<p>Confusions</p>
<ol>
<li>Difference between AppCompat and Holo?<ul>
<li>Holo and related themes are designed for Android 4.x</li>
<li>AppCompat is not so much a theme, more a way to gain the ActionBar available in 4.x</li>
<li>So they are not equal enough to compare</li>
<li>Yes AppCompat is supported from Ti SDK 3.3</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How will the AppCompat affect your app<ul>
<li>Chances are very little, but of cuorse you will need to do some work to allow for it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Which Ti Studio should you start with?<ul>
<li>Start with the current GA, currently 3.2.3</li>
<li>There are many more things you have to code beyond the ActionBar - start on something and learn the platform</li>
<li>Stability is better when you are learning, if there is a problem - is it yours or the beta SDK?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Which theme should you choice?<ul>
<li>Your choice it is a visual thing, so either choose a pre-created one or customise a them for yourself</li>
<li>Read this - <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;adampaxton.com&#x2F;alloy-action-jackson-an-android-action-bar-demo-app-for-appcelerator-titanium.aspx">Action Jackson</a></li>
<li>Themes do not make an app more or less compatible - they change the appearance </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Suggestions </p>
<ol>
<li>Download the Ti SDK and start learning, why wait.  Unless your app is just an ActionBar, you have lots to create within your app</li>
<li>Review Android apps for guidance<ul>
<li>Notice how most new ones have the same framework UI, but different colour schemes</li>
<li>NOT all android apps are identical</li>
<li>NOT all android apps are good - in fact most are really bad</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Design yours to follow the UI<ul>
<li>But learn to make it different at the same time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learn from Googles Android apps<ul>
<li>There are loads</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Understand that handling multiple aspect ratios, screen densities and scaled images will affect your development time much more than ActionBar will</li>
<li>Create lots of test apps<ul>
<li>Give each a purpose and over come the issues</li>
<li>Learn to write tight code</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Follow <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tidev.io&#x2F;">tidev.io</a> all the cool kids are.</li>
</ol>
