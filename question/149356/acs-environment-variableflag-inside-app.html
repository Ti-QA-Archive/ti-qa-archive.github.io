			<h1>ACS Environment Variable/Flag Inside App</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey,</p>
<p>Is there a way to know which ACS environment (dev or production) the app is currently working with? We have an ACL ID hardcoded into the app which means that the app only works in one of the environments … and we are looking for a variable which indicates which cloud environment the app is interacting with, so that we can set the value of the ACL ID variable based on that…</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Stoyan the development side work only till that when your app is not on the stores and you have not generated the signed apk or distributed ipa and before that development works so i dont think there is any need to determine that</p>

										<p><p>Muhammad, I am aware of what you said. I don&#39;t think you fully understand <em>why</em> I need to know if the variable exists. </p>
<p>Currently I have to build two versions of the app in order to be able to do both testing and the production version of the app out of the same version of my codebase. This is because the production acl_id is hardcoded into the production version of the app and the dev acl_id is hardcoded into the dev version of the app. </p>
<p>I am asking whether I can setup a flag which detects which cloud environment the app is interacting with so that I can export both the production and dev versions of the app out of the same version&#x2F;commit&#x2F;branch of the repo.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
