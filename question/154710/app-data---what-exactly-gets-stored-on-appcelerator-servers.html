			<h1>App Data - What exactly gets stored on Appcelerator servers?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I now realize that when creating a project with Titanium Studio the project name is stored on Appcelerator&#39;s server in My Apps. I just discovered this.<br>This is not an issue for my projects. But I&#39;m considering using Titanium to build projects for my employer and would like some more information on what exactly gets put on Appcelerator&#39;s server.</p>
<p>I know I can turn on and off Analytics and some other features but what I&#39;m asking is it only the name of my project that is stored? Does the code get stored, I know I don&#39;t see it in my Apps but I didn&#39;t realize that the project name was even referenced? Is there a way to turn this off?</p>
<p>As I said this is not an issue for my personal projects but my employer is very restrictive when it comes to IP protection, and I can see some future clients being a little skiddish about even the project name being published on a server I have no control over, if anyone can share some info on this I&#39;d appreciate it.</p>
<p>Thank you<br>Keith</p>

							<p>Well, you could always user something like wireShark to sniff the traffic from your app and see what is being sent out</p>
