			<h1>Trouble loading the RC for 1.6.0</h1>

		<section>
			<p>I have repeatedly tried to get this to load properly, and each time I run into some difficulties with permissions.  </p>
<p>On my system I have content in both the &#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium and ~&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium.  I&#39;m assuming, though the instructions weren&#39;t explicit, that the zip file goes in the system level directory (the first one mentioned).  This is a bit of a problem, seeing that trying to get it to execute causes terrible permission issues.</p>
<p>Using the curl -L command mentioned in the announcement does not work either, as it just floods the terminal with gibberish and beeps the speaker annoyingly.  Did anyone really try install, or did we just assume it would work? (I&#39;m sure it did work for someone, just kidding!)</p>
<p>In any case, if anyone has gotten this installed on MAC OSX, I&#39;d appreciate how you did it.  Perhaps my own system isn&#39;t set properly.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>I just downloaded the file, then unzipped it and copied it to the appropriate directory as specified in the instructions. I did not use the curl command.</p>

										<p><p>Actually, the instructions say to download the zip file to the appropriate directory, THEN unzip it.</p>

										<p><p>Aaron – I don&#39;t know how you did this.  I downloaded this into a directory and unzipped, but the resultant file structure is nothing like what&#39;s in my current &#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium.</p>
<p>It extracts to:  mobilesdk&#x2F;osx&#x2F;1.6.0.RC1&#x2F;&lt;a LOT OF FILES&gt;</p>
<p>None of that exists in my Titanium directory now.  Further more you can&#39;t copy these to the &#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium because that is a protected directory.  Yes, I could use the terminal to copy and SUDO, but what goes where?</p>
<p>This was VERY poorly documented in the original posting and won&#39;t work as written, so maybe we need some more detailed instructions.</p>
