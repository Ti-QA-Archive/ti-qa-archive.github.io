							<div><p>It&#39;s possible, but you do have to be careful. Mobile Web is designed to be UI compliant with iOS and Android, and it achieves this by carefully managing the DOM elements. If you use any of the UI parts of jQuery&#x2F;Dojo&#x2F;etc, it can cause lots of things to break.</p>
<p>If the library in question is in CommonJS or AMD format, you can simply require() the library and use it. I would recommend creating a Mobile Web module to prevent breaking your code&#39;s compatibility with Android and iOS.</p>

<p>From there, simply reference the .js files in your html files using the like you would in a regular web page.</p>

										<p><p>I believe the OP was referring to the Mobile Web target, not android, which makes this question much trickier.</p>

										<p><p>Unfortunately we don&#39;t have any documentation on that yet. After doing some digging, I also learned that there are some bugs in 2.0.1 that prevent modules from working. Unfortunately you will have to wait for 2.1 or switch to using nightly builds.</p>
<p>You can always use a webview that shows native HTML+jQuery code inside of it. </p>
<p>Honestly, jQuery and toolkits like it are not a good fit with titanium. What do you want to use them for?</p>

										<p><p>Webview is not really an option because i want to build a 100% browser based app not a native wrapped one(for native i d simply deploy  to android&#x2F;ios). The reason i asked is because the HTML5 output do not look pretty good right now  compare to Sencha and the like. I m sure you guyz will improve going into the future. Also as a web app  i was expecting to be able to use any king of JS library.</p>

										<p><p>Sorry, the UI is too tightly controlled&#x2F;heavyweight to use 3rd party libraries to style it. If you used jQuery or a similar library to change the styling of a mobile web app, then you will probably break the app. We do have plans to give mobile web a <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-8196">makeover</a> and to introduce the capability to define your own theme.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t really position Titanium Mobile Web as a generic web app for doing typical web things, but rather as a peer of Titanium Mobile on Android and iOS. Our goal is to provide as close to 100% compatibility with those platforms as possible. In order to achieve this goal, we were forced to make the decision to make Ti mobile web apps a closed environment that has total control over its contents. You can use 3rd party libraries to implement functionality that doesn&#39;t exist in the Ti API, but you cannot use 3rd party libraries to augment existing functionality.</p>

										<p><p>Thx for the clarification Bryan. Will be monitoring MobileWeb to see how it the UI evolves. Great job you guyz are doing. Keep it up.</p>
