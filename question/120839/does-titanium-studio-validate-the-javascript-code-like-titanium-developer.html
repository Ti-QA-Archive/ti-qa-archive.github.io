			<p>I&#39;m using Titanium Studio RC1 with the nightly updates and I don&#39;t see any messages in the console about javascript syntax errors.  When I was using Titanium Developer, I would get messages all the time if I forgot to add a comma or a semi-colon.</p>
<p>Am I missing a setting in Titanium Studio to enable javascript validation?</p>

<p>There is no need to launch an app in order to correct validation errors - they should be listed in the &quot;Problems&quot; view of Titanium Studio. If this is not the case for you, ensure that the correct validators are enabled in Preferences &#x2F; Titanium Studio &#x2F; Validation &#x2F; JavaScript. Note that I have both the Mozilla and JSLint enabled in mine, but you may prefer a different combination.</p>
<p>When you launch your app, ensure that the &quot;Console&quot; view is visible. You may need to use the Console selector drop-down list tool to view the output you are interested in:</p>

<p>Hope this helps</p>

										<p><p>David, once you have enabled the validators, close your project, open it, refresh the root of the project (right-click project in Project Explorer &#x2F; Refresh) , and then reindex (right-click project in Project Explorer, and choose Indexing &#x2F; Rebuild Index) .</p>
<p>Ensure that the &quot;Problems&quot; view is visible.</p>
<p>Let me know if that resolves it.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>After selecting the JSLint validator, it automatically checks the validation when you OPEN A JS FILE within titanium studio, not when you run the project… This is a different concept than Titanium Developer, which would validate the JS code when you RUN the project.</p>
<p>Now that I can see the validation errors, I&#39;m getting a bunch of &quot;&#39;mb&#39; is not defined&quot; in app.js.  The first line of app.js includes another JS file that defines the &#39;mb&#39; object. I know that app.js can see the objects defined in the included file when the app is compiled, so is this a limitation of JSLint?  FYI, I didn&#39;t see that error when I used Titanium Developer.</p>

										<p><p>Hey David. Did you ever figure out how to get JSLint to recognize that the functions were included in another file included at the top of the page? Hoping to get rid of some of these warnings that are plaguing me. Thanks</p>

										<p><p>No, my app uses parasitic inheritance, like the Tweetanium app and JSLint gets all bent out of shape with my inherited objects. I have reverted back to using TextMate as my editor, because I just don&#39;t feel that Titanium Studio is ready for primetime.</p>

							<p>This might also help:<br>After configuring JSLint as already described in the above answers you can fix the not defined global variables errors in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Filter out the errors using a regular expression in the Preferences &gt; Validation section (there is a screen shot above).</p>
</li>
<li><p>The bad thing about the first way is that it will still get to the point where it will say &quot;Too Many Errors&quot; because it is only the editor filtering the JSLint responses. The better way is to put the following comment in the beginning of your file to tell JSLint to ignore them.<br><code>&amp;#x2F;*global $$,Ti,Titanium,my_global_1,mb,etc*&amp;#x2F;</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I have done that to make it usable. Hope that helps.</p>

							<p>Paul,<br>I found the Javascript validation setting that you mentioned. It originally only had Mozilla checked.  You can see below, I now have JSLint selected and I still don&#39;t see any javascript validation errors in the Problems window or the console…</p>
<p>Am I missing something else?</p>
