			<h1>Best method for a custom tabbar?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m in the process of creating a custom tabgroup, but I&#39;m just wondering what the best way about it would be?</p>
<p>Would the best way to be to create a view in one window and all windows are actually views? or should I create each window as I normally would but in each have a standalone tabgroup?</p>
<p>So… 1 window, 1 custom tabgroup, multiple views within<br>Or… 5 windows, 5 custom tabgroups (created with views)</p>
<p>Unless I&#39;ve missed something and there is much simpler way?</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

							<p>As usual the answer &quot;depends&quot;.  Will you need any of the Ti.UI.Window events or behaviours that you wouldn&#39;t get with views (eg &#39;Open&#39; &#x2F; &#39;Close&#39; events, ability for full screen etc). If so, go with a stack of windows, else i&#39;ve found views fine to use and am pretty sure they are a little less heavy-weight than a Window.</p>

							<p>The way I customise it, is to have a menu module which I then require into each window. Can be used on views or windows and using commonJS only loads once into memory..</p>
<p>So I have a view with each button in specific size and just display it and all event handlers are incorporated.</p>
<p>If you have a system which can open any window at any time then it is probably bets to close the previous window and do not keep the stack as it wild rain memory very quickly especially if you are using tableviews etc.</p>
<p>The issue you then hit is with the back functionality but a module to which keeps track of which window was open (Not the window ref) then opens it when required resolves this..</p>
