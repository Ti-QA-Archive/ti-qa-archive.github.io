			<h1>Going from Android to iPhone</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Since I only have a Windows box (right now) I built my first app on Android.  I&#39;m happy to say its being successfully used on the Android Market (see: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;ZBGLz if interested).  I&#39;m going to be getting a Mac soon but wanted to get a head start preparing my app for iPhone.  Any recommendations?  What things should I look out for in my app?  Besides basic functionality are there other aspects that might make the app not get accepted by Apple?</p>
<p>Any thoughts&#x2F;comments&#x2F;suggestions are greatly appreciated.</p>

							<p>You will be amazed simply how excellent and wonderful the iPhone simulator works compared to the Android emulator. Using the sluggish Android emulator it was somewhat a relief to test on the real device.</p>
<p>The iPhone, especially the 3G is slower than the simulator, so it is important to test on your phone frequently.</p>
<p>One piece of advice which i have never seen written somewhere, is to get yourself an iPhone and start using it. There are considerable differences in the user interface with no menus, or back button on the iPhone.</p>
<p>I have never used iPhone before starting to develop to it, and I did many mistakes thinking Android in the beginning. iPhone users are familiar with their device, and adding Android lookalike functionality is not the way to go i feel.</p>
<p>And also, be prepared to have Titanium pointing out a massive amount of Javascript errors on your iPhone project on the Mac, compared to a Android project on a PC.</p>
<p>Why it is like this, I really cant explain, but I believe the compiler to objective C for iPhone needs more correct Javascript than the Javascript to Java compiler for Android.</p>
<p>There are also quite a few differences between iPhone and Android, so expect to check if your code run on Android and have different code quite a few times if you develop one project for both platforms.</p>
<p>Beeing an Android user for years, I tend to like iPhone more and more… and developing for iPhone I also find easier.</p>
<p>Well this is my 5 cents of opinions anyway,</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>
<p>Harald</p>

										<p><p>You will ned OSX 10.6.xx (Snow Leopard) for installing the iOS SDK.<br>And yes, very important, you need a Intel Based Mac, and not the G4 og G5 cpu driven ones.</p>
<p>I use a rather old MacBook Pro running with a 2Ghz Inter Core Duo with 2GB 667mhz ram. Works rather well for me, even if the Mac is a couple of years old :-)</p>
