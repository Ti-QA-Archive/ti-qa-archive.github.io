			<h1>Android application will not run</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m at my wits end. I had a new project that was working fine when all of the sudden I&#39;m getting this error and the project will no longer run: </p>
<p>[ERROR] Failed installing com.company.project: pkg: &#x2F;data&#x2F;local&#x2F;tmp&#x2F;app.apk.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve combed the Q&amp;A for a solution but none of the suggestions I found have helped. I tried creating a new project without any modifications and got the same error. I deleted all AVD&#39;s, I&#39;ve re-installed all the packages in the Android Manager, I&#39;ve started AVD&#39;s manually and wiped the user data, I deleted things in the Titanium build directory (as per one of the suggestions), and touched the tiapp.xml to perform a full build, but nothing is working. I don&#39;t understand how it can be working one minute and not the next. Nothing, literally nothing, was touched. I&#39;m using the latest Android SDK as of this post (Revision 10). I&#39;m working with Titanium Developer v1.2.2 and Mobile v1.7 on Windows 7.</p>
<p>I like the concept of Titanium and would very much like to base our Mobile development on it so if anyone can help me figure out what is going on I&#39;d really appreciate it.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, Dan. I did see this and made sure that I followed everything to the letter. As I mentioned, it was working for a while before it suddenly stopped so I assume that the environment was setup correctly.</p>
