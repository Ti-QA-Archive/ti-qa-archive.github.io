			<p>I am willing to pay for the premium support if the team will close this ticket</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32239&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;54-cant-find-sdk-on-snow-leopard</p>
<p>I have been unable to use Titanium for over 2 weeks now, for some reason it doesn&#39;t seem to be working on Snow Leopard. The SDK select box always stays at &quot;loading…&quot;. I was able to workaround it by launching on –debug mode and manually (via DOM selection) changing the value of &quot;loading…&quot; to &quot;3.1&quot; (or any SDK version)</p>
<p>I am desperate here…</p>
<p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>Issues solved by the help of the Titanium team, apparently the Titanium Developer didn&#39;t like my name to have accents :) (also some tweeks in a python file)</p>

							<p>Paul, after looking at that ticket I ran into the same problem when I upgraded from 1.0 to the 1.1 SDK (and then 1.1.1 and 1.1.2), also running on snow leopard. Hopefully what I did to fix it could help you in the interim:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, even though I would get that &quot;unknown or unsupported SDK version&quot; error, the simulator would still pop up, but the app would fail to load. Clicking the home button on the sim and then clicking the app icon to manually start it seemed to have &quot;located&quot; the sdk, and on subsequent builds that error message was removed. It would come back if I changed the TI SDK I was using though.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Second, what fixed it permanently for me was trashing the 1.1.2 folder in Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx and just using 1.0 for a while (which never gave me the problems). I didn&#39;t re-download 1.1.2 through TI like it wanted me to, and all was fine. At one point, I also completely uninstalled Titanium and re-downloaded it, allowing it to install 1.0, and then doing nothing further. This worked as well.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Since 1.2.1, I&#39;ve had no issues with this error message, so perhaps doing a clean install and upgrading to that will work. I&#39;ve found that testing your app just once on one of the problem SDKs (1.1.1 and 1.1.2 for me) will spoil it until I did a full re-install or managed to get the first workaround above to work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this helps and please let me know if there is anything I can make clearer, as it sounds like we&#39;ve had very similar experiences.</p>

							<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply, unfortunally I have tried that already (although I don&#39;t have Mobile SDK 1.0, if you know where I could find it it would be great) I even formated my mac CLEAN and installed just the iphone SDK and Titatnium and I am still getting the &quot;loading…&quot; error.</p>
<p>(To be fair, it wasnt THAT clean, since MobileMe dropped in all my preferences, maybe something is seriously corrupted? something besides trashing the folder on &quot;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&quot; which I already tried… are there files somewhere else?)</p>

							<p>Hi Raul,</p>
<p>When I uninstall, I delete:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium</li>
<li>&#x2F;Users&#x2F;~USER&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium</li>
<li>&#x2F;Applications&#x2F;Titanium Developer.app</li>
</ul>
<p>Re-downloading TI has always given me 1.0 initially (they may have changed this recently though), but if you need it I could certainly zip it up and give you the link, just let me know. I kept a copy because it has always been the one mobile SDK that&#39;s never given me problems.</p>

							<p>No problem, I&#39;m not sure if this is allowed on these forums but here&#39;s a link to the 1.0.0 mobile sdk (please let me know if I&#39;m violating any terms and I can take this down immediately):</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.dropbox.com&#x2F;u&#x2F;417761&#x2F;1.0.0.zip</p>
<p>I hope it helps.</p>

							<p>Andrew,</p>
<p>Thank you but nothing worked… I still wonder if paying for the support will get this dreadful issue fixed… or at least NOTICED :S that issue on lighthouse has been sitting untouched (not even reviewed) for a long time</p>
