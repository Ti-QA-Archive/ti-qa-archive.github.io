			<p>Hi all ,</p>
<p>My app got rejected bcoz apple said that there are some private API&#39;s.<br>I was just using FLYING VIEWS module which i bought it from the MARKET PLACE.</p>
<p>Here is the description they have sent .</p>
<p>We found that your app uses one or more non-public APIs, which is not in compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines. The use of non-public APIs is not permissible because it can lead to a poor user experience should these APIs change. </p>
<p>We found the following non-public API&#x2F;s in your app:</p>
<p>gridView:heightForHeaderInSection:<br>gridView:numberOfRowsInSection:<br>gridView:viewForHeaderInSection:<br>numberOfSectionsInGridView:</p>
<p>If you have defined methods in your source code with the same names as the above-mentioned APIs, we suggest altering your method names so that they no longer collide with Apple&#39;s private APIs to avoid your application being flagged in future submissions.</p>
<p>Please suggest me some way ….</p>

							<p>Try to contact the devs if you got their Mail and ask if they were using such methods. Seems that you have to remove the Module. :&#x2F;</p>
