			<h1>Titanium difficult to use over a network</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m really struggling with this. I&#39;ve been developing apps locally with no problems. Now I try and store all files on a network drive that gets backed up. Yet Titanium seems to hate it! It&#39;s so slow in building and testing etc, as well as sometimes not even updating files in the file tree.</p>
<p>Is this common? Does Titanium just not like network workspaces? The only way I&#39;m getting around it is working locally, then at the end of the day copy &amp; paste all files  to the network. Next day, copy &amp; paste all files from the network to local.</p>
<p>This seems a bit of a pain. Any reason why it&#39;s so painful working over a network?</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

							<div><p>However you proceed, you might want to create a Dropbox account and copy your code into that (assuming it&#39;s not particularly sensitive). Whatever OS you&#39;re using, it would be easy to set it up to do this automatically.</p>
<p>(I don&#39;t recommend using the same directory for local work as you use for Dropbox, because the Dropbox process has the ability to delete any local files without warning. It&#39;s never done it to me, but they could introduce a bug that causes that to happen. Better safe than sorry.)</p>

							<p>I would personally use a SC system (SVN, GIT) and commit my working copy back into a branch of the repo at regular intervals.  The advantage is that you work entirely locally and when you commit you only transmit the &quot;diff&quot; of the changes so is much faster then performing all your I-O off a network share or manually backing up your entire project to one.</p>

										<p><p>Source control management is definitely the way to go, as it not only backs up your code, but tracks changes&#x2F;versioning.  Also helps with working in teams.  Git is already integrated with Titanium Studio as well.</p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t quite get it. So the best way is to send off all the code to some online service? What if I want it backed up by my usual network backup? Does Titanium use GitHub? or something else? I click &#39;initialize git&#39; and nothing happens apart from the files all turn red in the file tree.</p>

										<p><p>You can host your own SCM but to benefit from getting automatic backups you need to put this on a server (or another PC - just not your local machine).  Github can provide you with an internet based hosting environment. I believe you may need to pay to get your own &quot;private&quot; repo (but I may be wrong). SVN is free and is supported on most platforms.</p>

										<p><p>As Nick mentioned, you can also host your own SCM inside your network.  Think of it like your corporate email server: Everybody&#39;s mailboxes get backed up from the email server, not from their local pc.  They then pull email locally from the server.  </p>
<p>Any corporate environment that is doing software&#x2F;web development of any kind will be using a SCM, and that may be internally or externally hosted. Externally hosted SCM, such as github or <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;109440&#x2F;best-git-repository-hosting-for-a-commercial-project">others</a> are popular for independent developers because it reduces the work involved in managing the SCM.  If you have IT staff to handle infrastructure support, it might be better to look at internal hosting.</p>
