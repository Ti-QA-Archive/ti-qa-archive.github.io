			<h1>V8 and tableView rowData</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m doing something wrong, but when I try to run my Android application with V8 (tried several nightly builds) I get a crash, when trying to access a tableview&#39;s event&#39;s rowData properties.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    controller.categoryView.tableView.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{
    controller.blockTableClick = <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>;
    controller.loadSelection({
        categoryId : e.rowData.id,
        name : e.rowData.name
    });
 });
</code></pre><p>I use the code above which works fine with rhino, but with v8 I have e.rowData.id and e.rowData.name undefined.</p>
<p>Is rowData somehow not supported any longer? Is there some other way to go about this now? Does anyone else have that problem?</p>

							<p>Yes, I also noticed &quot;e.rowData&quot; is &quot;undefined&quot;, but you can use &quot;e.row&quot; in the same manner.</p>

										<p><p>There are more things, to quote myself: Now I&#39;m fixing those things, but from what I can see for now &quot;require&quot; doesn&#39;t work (UPDATE: needs &quot;absolute path&quot; prefix, require(&quot;test&quot;) does not work, require(&quot;&#x2F;test&quot;) works), Ti.JSON is undefined (only JSON is available), Titanium components &quot;toString&quot; method produces different (more standardized?) strings, window&#39;s &quot;hide&quot; method doesn&#39;t exists (for heavyweight windows) and so on.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re developing on Windows machine, you can&#39;t even compile.</p>
<p>Also, stability is currently big issue for me since my app brakes often when compiled with V8. </p>
<p>I&#39;ll be waiting for some time to test with V8, no point at this time since it&#39;s not ready for development.<br>Although I have to say that I love the speed, V8 is awesome in speed therms.</p>
<p>If you find some more things that does not work, please post them here. Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>it is really helpful to use version numbers when discussing the nightly build since they are… nightly and what works and what doesn&#39;t work in each build will change.</p>

										<p><p>@Aaron: Sorry, but as I said, I tried a lot of builds over the past weeks and I always had that problem - I did not note down all the version numbers, but here&#39;s the last one I tried: 1.8.0.1.v20111205011857</p>

										<p><p>@Ivan: Thanks for the info! Yes, I do have another problem - namely that I cannot see any resolution specific images (Resources&#x2F;android&#x2F;images&#x2F;res-…) And before anyone asks - yes, that too happens in all the nightly builds I&#39;ve tried so far, the latest one in the comment above.</p>
<p>Otherwise I see my app crashing right on startup for several devices which is sad, because it concerns exactly the slower devices on which I would have liked to see the performance improvements with V8, but I just don&#39;t get to that point.</p>
<p>Do you know if there is some place where V8 is discussed - like things that you need to be aware of when coding (like the rowData vs row thing). It&#39;s so frustrating when things just don&#39;t work and crash for no apparent reason and I don&#39;t even know if that is due to V8 still being a work in progress or if you could actually solve it yourself by modifying the code.</p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t know any place to discuss about V8, I gave initiative to start something <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;127048&#x2F;changes-in-18">similar</a> but didn&#39;t find any interest. You can check what is currently worked on in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB">JIRA</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, it&#39;s hard to tell the reason why app crashes, sometimes code modification solves the issue, sometimes app just brakes for no reason  (same app works fine when compiled with 1.7.*). I guess we&#39;ll have to wait until V8 is more stable and complete.</p>

										<p><p>I hate appcelerator so bad. Why the f@#€!!k rowData changed to row? I lost so much time to rewrite current code. Totally no respect to developers. I will never use appcelerator for development anymore. I&#39;m in trap because I started developing using appcelerator. Too much advertisement and totally bullshit. Sorry folks but I can&#39;t be silent anymore..</p>

							<p>I just spent a couple of hours also wondering why this had stopped working! </p>
<p>I found that rowData would work as usual if the named property I wanted to use was added within the createTableviewRow properties. </p>
<p>Trying to add a property to the row after the fact, made the e.rowData undefined.</p>
