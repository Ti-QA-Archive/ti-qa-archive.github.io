			<h1>Where is the JAVA for my app?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Pardon my noobness here.  Maybe I&#39;ve missed it, but I&#39;ve spent all evening trying to figure out how to put the finishing touches on my Android app by editing the project in Eclipse.  I have one bug that I can fix if I can get into that code (can&#39;t fix it in Titanium for some reason).</p>
<p>Where is the code?  I&#39;ve looked all through the BUILD -&gt; ANDROID folders and have not found the source files.  I found a series of .class files, but the few .java files I found had only a few lines and none of my code.</p>
<p>I really get the impression that the Android side of Titanium doesn&#39;t get the attention the iPhone side does.  </p>

							<p>What code are you expecting to find? It&#39;s Javascript. There are 3 generated sources files for your project that are used to bootstrap you into Titanium. The rest of the source is on github. Android ships jars in the mobilesdk not source. There is documentation in the Programming guides section for getting the tools installed and there is one for module developers that talks about working in Eclipse.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the reply Don.  Sorry if my lack of understanding is glaring.  5 weeks ago I had never written a single line of code.  I&#39;m a video guy, not a programmer, so this is a steep learning curve for me.</p>
<p>I&#39;m having an issue with the Android version of my app.  I exhausted myself trying to solve it through Titanium and didn&#39;t get an answer here, so I asked someone I know who writes Android apps how to do it.  I was hoping to be able to tweak the Android build to get this new small piece of code in.</p>
<p>Am I doing this the most difficult way possible?</p>

										<p><p>Can you describe what you want to accomplish? Most titanium developers never use Eclipse for Android or  XCode directly.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m trying to work around the bug in Titanium for Android that allows a TextArea to be editable.  My app just came out on the iPhone and this is the only glitch in the Android version that is preventing me from putting this in the Market.  </p>
<p>I see all the .class files.  I would think there would be coresponding .java files too.</p>

							<p>You can get source files from github:<br>git clone http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_mobile.git<br>(git should be installed first)</p>
<p>Now you will find all the sources of Titanium. If you want to build, you need to enter the following command:<br>scons</p>
<p>If you have all the SDK-s, and building environment installed, it should compile and make new sdk in the dist folder. You should extract it on the Titanium&#39;s folder. Now you will get version 1.4.1 of the SDK. I&#39;ve only tried this on OS-X.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m not a strong enough programmer to make changes to the Titanium code itself.  5 weeks ago I had never written any code.  I&#39;m comfortable enough with what I&#39;ve written to be able to modify it outside of Titanium, but I&#39;m trying to discover where I find the files that will allow me to do that.</p>
