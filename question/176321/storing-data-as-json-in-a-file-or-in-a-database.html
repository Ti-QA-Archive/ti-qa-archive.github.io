			<h1>Storing data as JSON in a file or in a database.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey! I&#39;m building an app where I need to store some data fetched from a remote web service. I had planned on storing as json instead of in a sqlite database, but I&#39;m just wondering if this is a good thing to do? There&#39;s no real reason to it other than because I much prefer json to working with slow, ugly databases. I&#39;m now questioning myself whether that&#39;s a legitimate reason to pick json over sql.</p>
<p>I&#39;d like to know if anyone else prefers json to sql and whether it&#39;s actually stupid idea or not to dismiss using a database just because i like json when a database might actually be better suited.</p>
<p>The data is probably what you would expect to see in a database, rows of info relating to something, where rows can relate also to each other. Not a lot of data at all, probably at most 20 rows in around 5 tables.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<div><p>It depends:<br>JSON seems to be ieasy to implement, but this format costs you a lot of cpu time to parse.  I think JSON objects &gt; 100 kB must be parsed and import into sqlite. It is only useful if the JSOn is an rray (collection). If not (map&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;hash) you need an index.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Good news it is your choice.  That doesn&#39;t make it any easier does it?  But this is what I mean.</p>
<ul>
<li>JSON<ul>
<li>Great for storing simple to complex data without having to modify any underlying structure when things change</li>
<li>Can read written to a file and even a sqlite column if you wish - we will come back to that later *</li>
<li>Really easy to visualise, copy and paste from a console entry in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pro.jsonlint.com&#x2F;">pro.jsonlint.com</a> and validate - really easy to see the traversal of values</li>
<li>If stored in the file system with one json object per file then not ideal for searching many records</li>
<li>If stored in the file system with all data inside a single json object then provided memory is not an issue - not a problem - but again searching large sets of data is a problem</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SQLite<ul>
<li>(I love sqlite BTW)</li>
<li>You have to define all columns required for the largest field requirements even if some fields are rarely used</li>
<li>Searching is excellent and especially on large rows - would not go without it.</li>
<li>More common for storing data</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Models&#x2F;Collection<ul>
<li>Easy to program</li>
<li>No need to understand underlying storage type (just a setting) </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your specific need; not many rows and few tables, I would go JSON - you like it and are happy with it, it meets the needs and the structure needs to translation from the API unless you want it to change.</p>
<p>(*) I said I would come back to something - this is it.  </p>
<p> If you have large numbers of data with an unknown and probably changing column count then there is a hybrid solution that requires NO changes to existing tech.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply create a normal sqlite database and define ONLY the columns that you will use in a where clause - these will never change obviously as they are need in the filtering.</li>
<li>But then add a single extra column &quot;data&quot; is as good a name as any other and stringify the json inside that.</li>
<li>During retrieval, parse the JSON.</li>
</ul>
<p>You get the speed of traditional databases and the benefit of a very simplified NoSQL column.</p>
<p>But as I said, you only need JSON.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Malcolm, a very informative answer. It does seem either would suit well.</p>
<p>Models&#x2F;collection sounds intriguing. I thought a model was just for retrieving&#x2F;manipulating data, not actually storing it? I thought, for example, a model would sit between a controller and a database, not take the place of a database?</p>

										<p><p>You are welcome.  I would still go JSON for this.</p>
<p>Models are deceptively more capable than first seen. and by setting the adapter can be automatically hooked to different storage types.  Quick example from the docs;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">exports.definition = {
    config: {
        <span class="hljs-string">"columns"</span>: {
            <span class="hljs-string">"title"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"String"</span>,
            <span class="hljs-string">"author"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"String"</span>
        },
        <span class="hljs-string">"defaults"</span>: {
            <span class="hljs-string">"title"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"-"</span>,
            <span class="hljs-string">"author"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"-"</span>
        },
        <span class="hljs-string">"adapter"</span>: {
            <span class="hljs-string">"type"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"sql"</span>,
            <span class="hljs-string">"collection_name"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"books"</span>
        }
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Note the adapter entry.  Not something you need for this, but when you want to have a poke around;</p>

										<p><p>Thanks again. All very interesting! I&#39;m just wondering, should I plan to be using Alloy models with json? I&#39;m not entirely sure if using it with an adapter of localstorage is what I&#39;m supposed to do?</p>

										<p><p>No stay with JSON, perfectly suited to this amount of data.  The models stuff is more - take a look later as this might help a future thing.</p>
