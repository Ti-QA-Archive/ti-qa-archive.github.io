		<section>
			<p>Am using 3.2.2 sdk, Alloy and Android Emulator. I came across some Financial Calculator and is it possible to include an <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;elvis-epx&#x2F;Andro12C">external Android Calculator</a> into my application. What is the procedure to include an external project, as a widget or a module?. Any idea whether its possible or not or I could follow some steps to make this possible??</p>

							<div><p>Thank you Malcolm. But there are some js and java files so I dont have any idea on it. So I need some idea that what way we have to process it to make it work with Titanium. It also runs with Rhino engine compliance.. So having a thought that it should work with Titanium.</p>

							<p>If you want to receive help DO NOT send emails to QA members asking them to reply. </p>
<p>You waited what? 4 hours? We all are around the globe, some of us are still sleeping so at least you could think that you need to wait at least 24 hours before sending your spam around.</p>
<p>If nobody answers it means they don&#39;t know, or don&#39;t have the time to reply. So a DevLink email won&#39;t help.</p>
<p>-1 for this</p>
