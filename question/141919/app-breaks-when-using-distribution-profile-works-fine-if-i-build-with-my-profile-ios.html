			<h1>App breaks when using distribution profile, works fine if I build with my profile. iOS</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p><strong>Application type:</strong> mobile<br><strong>Titanium SDK:</strong> 2.1.2 (08&#x2F;24&#x2F;12 14:46 ed7f777)<br><strong>Platform &amp; version:</strong> iOS 4.2.1 +<br><strong>Device:</strong> iOS device (any)<br><strong>Host Operating System:</strong> OSX 10.7<br><strong>Titanium Studio:</strong> Latest</p>
<p>I&#39;m lost for where to look next. Code works perfectly when I use the emulator, and when I deploy to my personal device. If I use the distribution method VIA testflight or creating an IPA file with xcode the code doesn&#39;t work correctly. What could be going on here?</p>

<li>no error messages referenced</li>

<p>Missing from your question are a number of important pieces of information. I suggest you take a look at the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Using+Questions+and+Answers">Using Questions and Answers</a> article, specifically the Q&amp;A Question Checklist.  The missing information is critical to reproducing problems in a test environment and often indicates other factors that cause the undesirable outcome you are experiencing.</p>

<p>There are no errors. It just doesn&#39;t work. Like it just gives up. doesn&#39;t try, doesn&#39;t error, no log entries, no console output, doesn&#39;t do anything. What more would you like? I&#39;m not asking you to debug my code. I&#39;m asking what I should be looking at next.</p>
<p>The instructions say to go to Help -&gt; About which doesn&#39;t exist. Latest is the latest. On the Mac it&#39;s Titanium Studio &gt; About Titanium Studio (Titanium Studio, build: 2.1.2.201208301612)</p>

<p>Certain areas. Since there&#39;s no indication of failure what do I look for If I can&#39;t get anything back?</p>

							<p>Try to do the next:</p>
<p>Connect your device to the computer, open Xcode , Window menu -&gt; Organizer.<br>You should see your device listed here, in the right side. Click on console and try to see what the device is saying when the app starts, it should say why it dies.</p>
<p>Usually the app dies on device despite working on emulator when you are trying to access some resources not there yet. The device is slower than the simulator, so it takes time to create a webview for example.<br>If you try to access the webview before it actually available sometimes it might crash, depending on how you coded the app :)</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s where I&#39;m at now. There&#39;s no console output at all when it fails. I just got done marking every whitespace line with a numbered debug message. It stopped working without error after a conditional that makes use of regexes.</p>

										<p><p>Regex? </p>
<p>Have a look on how you are doing this regex, use all the comas and semicolumns needed.<br>I had this issue a while ago and we lost few days because of this  (me and the team I make part of) - was a semicolumn.<br>So basically the code around the regex needs to be as valid as possible (u might want to use jslint or something).</p>

										<p><p>It&#39;s also failing somewhere in the web services call without giving anything in console. What&#39;s the difference between deploying to &#39;iOS Device&#39; through titanium  and then deploying adhoc and everything is broke. When I deploy to iOS Device (my phone) under my dev profile, everything work perfectly.</p>

										<p><p>Mmm, I understood that is working only on emulator, not on device, sorry</p>
<p>Try an older SDK, just by curiosity, maybe the latest one has something broke with the adhoc stuff.</p>

										<p><p>They are both being deployed to a device through different methods.  Why it doesn&#39;t make sense that one would break and the other would be just fine. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve commented out the Regexes for now and the other typo that seemed to work.</p>

										<p><p>The distribution process is minifying the js. At this point if your code is not very well done -  no offense please, I told you I had it myself - the compiler might remove or add semicolumns in the very wrong place, with this result :)</p>

<p>Try to jslint your code, u&#39;ll get more, like extra comas for example :)</p>
