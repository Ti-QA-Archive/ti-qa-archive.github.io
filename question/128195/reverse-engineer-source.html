			<p>I&#39;m planning an app in which the user will enter their credit card details.<br>To simplify and speed up future purchases, I&#39;m thinking about storing the credit card details on the phone. How secure is this? Can someone jailbreak and reverse engineer the app and access credit card details?<br>Should a db be used? Or Titanium.App.Properties.setString() ?<br>Or is there a better way of doing this?</p>
<p>Will Apple even allow this? Bypassing their in-app purchase-feature?</p>
<p>The app will be available both on the iOS and Android. </p>
<p>(I know… I can use the in-app purchasing-feature, but Apple takes 30%)</p>

							<p>I would advise against it. For many reasons that you listed in your post. </p>
<ul>
<li>Storing user payment information in a database (or setting) could be easily exposed. This in not a Titanium specific issue. An Objective-C or Java application would be faces with the same problem.</li>
<li>Apple <strong>will not</strong> approve an application that has an in-app purchase mechanism that is does not go through official channel. As you mentioned, Apple wants it 30% and will prevent any developer to bypass this system.</li>
</ul>
<p>My best advice would be to use Paypal or the official apple Store in-app purchase (using a module)</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks! The answer was not was what I was hoping for, but it is indeed an answer.<br>But lets say that I build a shop using i.e. Magento (magentocommerce.com). And all I do is build an app that loads a page (myshop.com). With shopping cart etc, using a mobile theme. When the user checks out, the user enters credit card credentials. Do you think that Apple would allow this setup?</p>

										<p><p>Adis, if all you want to do is to display a webview pointing to a website. Why bother developing an application at all?</p>
<p>Maybe I&#39;m missing something.</p>

							<p>Regardless of Apple approval guidelines, storing credit card information in a mobile app is a VERY bad idea.  At the very least you need to use as strong of encryption as possible.  For iOS, you would want to use the iOS Keychain (for example, see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;listing?q=keychain">here</a>).</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t understand the PCI legal requirements on credit card data security, you REALLY don&#39;t want to be trying to store data anywhere – let alone a mobile device.  And if you did understand the PCI requirements and potential legal liabilities for data breeches, I don&#39;t think you&#39;d be asking this question in the first place.</p>
