			<h1>Should I be removing all event listeners on a window close event to prevent memory leaks?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a number of event listeners on each page of my app.  I noticed that you must call the $.destroy method on an window close event if you have created some binding on the page to prevent memory leaks.  Should I always be removing all of my event listeners on a window close to prevent memory leaks?</p>

							<p>The answer to this isn&#39;t a Yes or a No.</p>
<p>To explain, firstly if you have added any global listeners i.e. Geolocation, media, etc. Then yes you definitely need to remove these as they are global and will not be removed on closing the window.</p>
<p>If you have listeners on buttons or other UI objects, then these should be removed automatically upon closing the window, so you don&#39;t have to remove them. However by removing them you will speed up the process of garbage collection and guarantee the listeners are all gone.</p>
<p>It would depend on how many listeners you have defined and how you defined them, to if you should remove them manually on closing the window.</p>
<p>I personally prefer to remove all event listeners, but that is my choice not an absolute requirement.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>T.</p>

							<p>There is only one thing you need to know here and that is -</p>
<p>Any elements when they are destroyed, all event listeners associated with them are automatically destroyed too.<br>So, what you are trying to do is indeed wastage of system resources and bad practice of coding.</p>
<p>However, when you are working on a tabbed app, make sure you remove all the added tabs before you finally close the tabgroup or else any events listener associated with the tabs (not windows) may persist thereby causing a serious case of memory leakage.</p>

										<p><p>If your app is terminated by the system or you manually force close it, under that case all the memory associated with your app will get release , otherwise, the <code>tabGroup.close()</code> will never release any memory unless you remove all the added tabs before closing the tabgroup unlike windows.</p>
