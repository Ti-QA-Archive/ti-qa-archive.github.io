			<h1>Brand new MacBook - Titanium fails to install</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,<br>I just bought a brand new MacBook Pro (2011 model), downloaded Titanium through Safari, and it will not install.</p>
<p>It just stops and says &quot;Some files failed to download properly. Cannot continue&quot;<br>It is not an issue with my network, I am directly connected to the internet - no proxies required etc. I had been using Titanium on OS X in a Virtual Machine and things were fine.</p>
<p>Fresh clean OS X 10.6.6 install from the CD that was shipped with it by Apple. I need a fix ASAP -_-<br>The URL from the debug output looks weird, &quot;osver=10.7.1&quot;… It is 10.6.6</p>
<p>Here is the output from Console.app<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;private&#x2F;lotywashutqbehzzzqeozg</p>
<p>Please help, wasted 2 grand on this thing just for Titanium -_-</p>

							<div><p>I think this might be problems over at the appcelerator website.  I am experiencing similar errors on Windows 7 (specifically http 404 errors), but they are intermittent.  If I just keep re-trying the installer, it eventually works.</p>

							<p>Yes I have this too. I just installed a clean install Snow Leopard and d&#x2F;l all SDK&#39;s . </p>
<p>Titanium doesn&#39;t seem to have enough admin rights. I tried to execute the application with sudo but this didn&#39;t help either. So now I&#39;m stuck just as you. </p>
<p>Please update if you have fixed it. I will do so too.</p>

							<p>Also crashes for me with the same error.</p>
<p>If I open Titanium from terminal, I see the error message &quot;LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -10810&quot;.</p>
<p>The description for the error code is also helpful: &quot;An unknown error has occurred&quot;</p>

							<p>I eventually managed to get it working simply by running it repeatedly. After like 20 executions, it downloaded the first file, then failed for second file, but ran it over and over and over until it eventually worked too.</p>
<p>So it is a problem with Appcelerator&#39;s web server. Just keep retrying and it&#39;ll eventually work.</p>
