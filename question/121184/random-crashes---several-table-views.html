			<h1>Random Crashes - several table views</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Ok, so i am a bit lost on how to debug this as it is totally random.</p>
<p>Titanium 1.7, iPhone SDK 4.3</p>
<p>I have an app with 5 tabs in a tabgroup.<br>All except the first have a table on them.</p>
<p>Two of these tabs are populated from a previously downloaded xml file.<br>All have child views.</p>
<p>The table rows have unique className.</p>
<p>No errors are output to the log (even in debug).<br>Memory seems to be ok.</p>
<p>Sometimes it will crash when you click the 2nd tab, sometimes you get through many clicks on different tabs before it crashes, but it crashes every time at some point.</p>
<p>I have a common function to read the XML files and a common function to create the table rows. There are no global variables.</p>
<p>The only thing common to the crashes are that i am using a custom view instead of the tabbar and calling tabGroup.setActiveTab then in the focus event i read the XML file and create the table rows before using setData to populate the tables in the tab.</p>
<p>Can anyone give me a clue about where to start debugging this. I could post some code but which code?</p>
<p>It seems to be something to do with reading the XML file for a second time.. is there an issue with closing a file handle?</p>
<p>Or setting the active tab.</p>
<p>Thoughts, suggestions,</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jez</p>

							<p>I had issues like this where the app just crashed.</p>
<p>What I found was that if you assign an event listener to the app Ti.App.addEventListener(&#39;…&#39;, action). then remove this event and add it again you get the sort of random crashes you are getting.</p>
<p>Not saying this is the issue but is maybe a first place to look.</p>
<p>T….</p>

										<p><p>Thanks,<br>I don&#39;t remove eventlisteners as i have found it is buggy.<br>Following your advice i have now taken out more of the event listeners there were but it still crashes alot.</p>
<p>I think it is something to do with reading the xml file. Or more specifically re-reading the XML file.</p>
<p>I am going to try reading the XML file and putting it in a database, to make sure i only read the XML file once.<br>If that solves it, then there is definitely an issue with reading XML files and releasing them again.</p>

							<p>Ok, so i seem to have fixed it…<br>The change i have made is to;-</p>
<p>Download the 2 xml files from a call in my app.js and loads the info into a database on device.</p>
<p>Then all pages that use the data use it from the db.</p>
<p>No longer are the xml files saved atall, no longer are they being read.</p>
<p>I definitely think this was down to re-reading an xml file as when i had done the main xml file and still was getting the small xml file, there was less crashes but it still happened.</p>
<p>I would like to log a ticket for this as it is on the second reading of a downloaded and locally stored XML file that this fails. But it is not so easy to reproduce, so in general i will now download XML data into a local DB and call it from there.</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestions.</p>
