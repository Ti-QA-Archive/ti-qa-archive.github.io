			<p>Hey, I was wondering what the next step is if a question isn&#39;t getting answered in the Q&amp;A. Not trying to be ungrateful, b&#x2F;c I&#39;ve gotten <strong>GREAT</strong> help here, but it&#39;s looking like Q&amp;A just isn&#39;t going to work <em>this</em> time around :)</p>
<p>Although it seems a bit of overkill for one question I&#39;ve looked at the Ti subscription plans (I&#39;m totally willing to pay for this answer if that&#39;s the recommended course of action), but just not sure if that is necessary just yet.</p>
<p>Any ideas? Thx!</p>

							<p>Great question. I&#39;m also curious to see what options are available. I&#39;d love to see a per incident tech support plan. Often questions go unanswered that are related to bugs in Titanium.  Are these bugs only going to get fixed if paying customers complain? I need to get an app in the app store and make some money before I can swing $2500 for support. </p>

							<p>Not going to happen.  Hopefully you&#39;ll get assistance from some of the more advanced users, but the Appcelerator folks in general don&#39;t venture down this way, and if they do its rare. </p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t think it complete accurate to call it rare.  Two of the top 10 &quot;experts&quot; listed in the sidebar are Appcelerator employees, and the point system is based on participation in the Q&amp;A.  Granted, I think it used to be more than two of them but that can be attributed to general growth and more users active in the Q&amp;A.  And truth be told, I think I&#39;d rather have folks like Don and Kevin spending their time making the product better, then answering questions here.</p>
<p>That said, I am in total agreement with the concept of having per incident support plan as Oliver suggests.  I can&#39;t justify the $2500 yet either.</p>

							<p>I know this dosnt help too much. But i like everybody else on this is struggleing to learn this languages. Granted there support system is lacking so i created a wiki for this And everything that i learn so far will be in that page.</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.ei-n.org&#x2F;index.php?title=Mobile&#x2F;Main_Page</p>
<p>i invite anybody who knows what they know to contribute to it. it&#39;s all free and open so you can just add as you please. i know by having some kind of community archive will build our knowledge faster.</p>

							<p>I wouldn&#39;t mind the lack of support too much if the documentation was actually useful and had examples. Digging through the kitchen sink app isn&#39;t how I want to develop. So far there has been MUCH hair pulling to<br>get this show on the road. It shouldn&#39;t be this difficult.</p>

							<p>I can empathize, there is a sharp learning curve when you&#39;re just getting started because there are so many &quot;gotchas&quot; and bugs. I compare it to banging your head against a brick wall, as things that should work don&#39;t… Yet once you do get things working it is very gratifying and is (usually) worth the extra headaches to maintain one code base to support multiple platforms. That being said, if my brother didn&#39;t work for Appcelerator and was there to help when I was first learning it then I probably would have given up on the platform.</p>

							<p>What is your question? Or where is the page with your question…</p>
<p>Since I can no longer justify the $200 a month plan I&#39;ll be around the Q&#x2F;A section more often now. I&#39;ve been working with Appcelerator for a while so I may be able to help.</p>

										<p><p>Hey John, it&#39;s <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;118778&#x2F;trying-to-save-external-file-in-apps-filesystem#question">here</a>. I&#39;m working on compiling a single file version with all the necessary code that i can post for debugging. Hope to have it up after work. Need to test the single file on device before posting and have to do it from home. Much thanks for the interest.</p>
