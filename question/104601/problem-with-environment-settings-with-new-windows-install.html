			<h1>Problem with Environment Settings with new Windows install</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all</p>
<p>I installed Andriod SDK Tools and Titanium Dev 1.2.2 today on a Windows box. I&#39;m trying to import the Kitchen Sink project but when I try to enter my Android SDK Environment Settings I get the following error:</p>
<p><code>Couldn&amp;#39;t find adb.exe or android.bat in your SDK&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;tools&amp;quot; directory. You may need to install a newer version of SDK tools.</code></p>
<p>On looking, adb.exe is in the &#39;\platform-tools\&#39; directory, and android.bat is in the &#39;\tools\&#39; directory. So, everything is present, if not exactly where the error message states.</p>
<p>Some system&#x2F;install info:</p>
<p><strong>The SDK install is here:</strong><br>C:\Program Files\Android\android-sdk-windows</p>
<p><strong>Environment Variables path:</strong><br>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_23\bin</p>
<p>Android SDK is a brand new install and up to date (i beleive) so does anyone have any advice please?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance<br>Ian</p>

<p>Follow the instructions at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;installing_on_windows.html#workaround_for_a_missing_%3Ctt%3Eadb%3C&#x2F;tt%3E">Workaround for a missing adb</a></p>
<p>If it still doesn&#39;t work, create a gist of the diagnostics output, as described in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;installing_on_windows.html#install_diagnostics_for_windows">Install Diagnostics for Windows</a>.</p>

<p>As you are on WinXP and there is no mklink command, just copy the files in to your tools directory, as explained at the end of that section in the link I posted:</p>
<p>&quot;If, for some reason, you cannot create a symbolic link, you can simply copy adb.exe and AdbWinApi.dll to the tools directory. Bear in mind that, unlike the symbolic link method, you will need to repeat this process whenever you install a package that applies an update to either of these files.&quot;</p>

<p>I am not sure whether there is a tool that ships with WinXP to create symbolic links, but copying the files over is a perfectly adequate solution. Just remember to copy them over again, if you update the platform-tools package in the future.</p>

<p>Would you mind closing this post, so that others can easily find the solution in future?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>Ian, try not to answer your own posts - it makes it difficult for people to follow the conversation, and also means you won&#39;t be able to close the question when it is resolved.</p>

							<p>For now I&#39;ve just copied adb.exe into the &quot;tools&quot; directory, as per the answer page, and Titanium is happy. </p>
<p>However, I will do the proper symbolic link though as soon as I can get XP to play properly.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>OK, Ian, that&#39;s good.</p>
<p>Again, would you try not to answer your own questions? As you can see, you cannot mark this question as &quot;best&quot;, and hence it won&#39;t be easy for others to find your solution in future. The preferred approach is for you to post this information as a comment to the closest answer from another user, and then mark that answer as best to close it. See <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;contribute.html#participating_in_the_q&amp;a">Participating in the Q&amp;A</a> which explains this in more detail.</p>

										<p><p>Hi</p>
<p>Sure, I&#39;ll have a closer look at the Q&amp;A guidelines. Have participated in many other tech forum threads and was feeding back as in the usual style, but I&#39;ll follow your &#39;Best&#39; marking protocol. Thanks again</p>
