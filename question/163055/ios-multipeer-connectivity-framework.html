			<h1>iOS Multipeer Connectivity Framework</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am looking to support direct peer-to-peer communication on iPad 2&#39;s.</p>
<p>I am aware of current solutions for communicating between devices; but built-in Bonjour support requires use of a WiFi router, and modules that enable communication using Bluetooth require Bluetooth 4.0 (LE) support, which the iPad 2 does not have.</p>
<p>I&#39;m also aware of a Game Kit module available on the marketplace but am concerned as these APIs have been deprecated in iOS 7 and I believe developers generally found the framework buggy.</p>
<p>Best suited would be the use of Apple&#39;s new Multipeer Connectivity Framework available in iOS 7. Is there any future road-map for support of this framework in Titanium?</p>

							<p>Hi Paul, I think we discussed that this was in development by Logical Labs via email a couple months ago but thought to let others know here also, we recently published our <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;8365">Multipeer Module</a> in the Appcelerator Marketplace. This module adds to our entire portfolio of connectivity, specifically Bluetooth, Titanium modules but this module is unique from the others in that Multipeer can not only communicate over Bluetooth but also WiFi based on whichever is available. </p>
<p>One thing to note is that Apple uses BT Classic for the Bluetooth communication in Multipeer, not Bluetooth LE (BLE) which means that it should be compatible with older devices that do not support BLE. It also means you can do things such as streaming and file transfers which BLE does not handle very well. The module has a working example and is fully documented and supported by Logical Labs. You can now find the documentation for all of our modules on our website also http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.logicallabs.com&#x2F;documentation</p>
