			<p>Hi, </p>
<p>We are encountering an issue with our App and we are having trouble pinpointing the issue.</p>
<p>The biggest problem we have is that we can&#39;t reproduce the problem but we are receiving regular complaints about the issue from various users on various android devices. </p>
<p>The symptoms are:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">- They receive a push notification
- They tap <span class="hljs-function_start"><span class="hljs-keyword">on</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> notification
- <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> App appears <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> open <span class="hljs-keyword">but</span> doesn't actually load... <span class="hljs-keyword">it</span> just gets stuck <span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> a single blank window <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> a header
</code></pre><p>It seems to not matter wether the app is in the background or closed when they tap on the notification. Users are saying that notifications used to work but they now no longer work at all… so its not just a one off issue.</p>
<p>We were made aware from looking in developer forums that it could be related to the new Android Webview that was included in 5.0. As a test we were able to get the issue to occur only once using the following steps:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">-<span class="ruby"> <span class="hljs-constant">Install</span> the web view update
</span>-<span class="ruby"> <span class="hljs-constant">Install</span> the app from the play store
</span>-<span class="ruby"> close the app
</span>-<span class="ruby"> disable the web view
</span>-<span class="ruby"> send a push notification
</span>-<span class="ruby"> tap on the push notification
</span>-<span class="ruby"> a single blank window appears with a header (app title <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> app logo) but no content
</span>-<span class="ruby"> also worth noting that no load screen appears</span>
</code></pre><p>After this happens once, we cannot get the issue to occur again without reseting the phone to factory settings and repeating these steps. Our users, however suggest that this issue is occur every time they receive a push. This test was done on an Samsung Galaxy S5. The same test on a Nexus 5 caused different issues. On this phone, after tapping a notification.</p>
<p>We are using Urbanairship to send our push notifications.</p>
<p>Application type: mobile<br>Titanium SDK: 3.2.3 (We are not able to update at this point in time)<br>Platform &amp; version: Android<br>Device: multiple… we have had reports from Samsung S3, S4, S5, S6, HTCs and Sony Xperia<br>Host Operating System: Multiple, we have had reports on 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 5.0, 5.1<br>Titanium Studio: The app was last built with (Titanium Studio, build: 3.4.1.201410281727)</p>
<p>We are looking into updating to Appcelluerator Studio and the latest titanium SDK but there are multiple modules we are using that don’t support the latest SDKs. Also, because we can’t reproduce the issue our selves, we cannot test to see if updating the SDK actually fixed the problem. What we really want to know is has anyone else experience similar issues, and what was the problem? how can it be reproduced?</p>
