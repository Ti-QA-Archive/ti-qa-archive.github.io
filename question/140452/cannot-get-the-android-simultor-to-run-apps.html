							<p>I don&#39;t know what you mean by &quot;load its menu&quot;, but the rest of your message suggests that you were able to install the app onto your android device.  </p>
<p>You will find the app in the &quot;app drawer&quot; (not your launcher screen).  You have to go to applications (each phone is different, but there&#39;s usually an icon on the launcher screen that takes you to the app drawer, where <em>all</em> apps are listed.</p>
<p>If you got the message that the app was successfully installed, it will be there.</p>

							<p>When i say &quot;load its menu&quot; i mean the phone comes up showing &quot;Contacts&quot;,Camera, Settings…etc etc. Also the android that is being launched has some keypad on the side. Am i able to change this android launcher to a galaxy tab or a phone?</p>

										<p><p>OK – your terminology is confusing.  You are talking about the emulator.  When you call it a &quot;phone&quot;, I&#39;m thinking you have a physical device.</p>
<p>So it sounds like you&#39;ve got the emulator launched, but your app is not starting.  You&#39;ll need to look in the console in Ti Studio to look for clues as to the problem.  Possibly a timeout.</p>
<p>I have seen situations where the android emulator is so slow to start that my app won&#39;t launch.  Sometimes, when that happens, just stopping and starting the debug session in Studio will get the app started up.</p>
<p>I have also seen situations where my app won&#39;t start in the emulator if I have a physical android device connected via USB.  Then I stop the debug, disconnect the device, and start the debug again.</p>
<p>The android emulator is really slow and is horrible to work with, through no fault of the Titanium team.  I use it only when absolutely necessary (when something is broken on android that works on iOS, I have no choice but to run a debug session in the android emulator).  But for general testing, a real android device is MUCH faster.  If you don&#39;t have one, get one.  They&#39;re not expensive, and you can&#39;t build an android app without one.</p>
