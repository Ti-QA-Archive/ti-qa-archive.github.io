			<h1>Is there a way to obtain the same behaviour of AnyDensity=False</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all,<br>I developed an android app that work like a charm on Tablets and Phone with:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">supports-screens</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">android:anyDensity</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"false"</span>/&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>The resulting UI is the same in ANY device.</p>
<p>But now I&#39;m going to distribute thee app to Apple devices too, and i have found no settings to do this in iOS, I&#39;m right?</p>
<p>So after surfing like 300 posts the only solution that i found is to use the &#39;dp&#39; as default unit.<br>After change my app to the new measure unit the result is not as expected.<br>The resulting UI dont keep the SAME aspect and proportions in all devices.</p>
<p>So i think that the last way to do thi is to use percentages.</p>
<p>Anyone know a method to do what I want WITHOUT using percentages?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I have been staring at this question for a while trying to work out the best way to say something without offending, so now I am hoping you are a smart person who can take some constructive criticism.</p>
<ul>
<li>All devices that are different - are different, hoping to escape that fact is unfair to the users with those devices and fails to show that you care by ignoring that fact.</li>
</ul>
<p>Percentages are a cop out and have very few good reasons for usage in a modern app other than providing things like a simple break up of space into columns or rows.</p>
<p>How can you reasonably think that a device with dimensions of 240x320 should scale up correctly to 1080x1920?  Graphics need to reflect the difference and you should consider layout changes somewhere between these points of change.</p>
<p>You can simplify layouts using DP as a unit of measurement and by understanding that things should be changed as you go.  You can learn more from these previous questions;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;148337&#x2F;how-to-achieve-same-layout-for-android-and-iphone-using-titanium#answer-256884">How to achieve same layout for Android and iPhone using Titanium</a></li>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;149743&#x2F;images-in-android#answer-258910">images in Android</a> (also iOS)</li>
</ul>
<p>I understand that doing things the easy way - is - well easy, but easy is not always the best way.  Devices owners choose their apps based on several factors, one is the look of the app and the attention to detail that the designers and developers put into the work.</p>
<p>So if a one size fits all app suits your audience - that is fine, but otherwise you should spend the time making your app work with consideration with multiple device dimensions and aspect ratios.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Thanks for this answer.</p>
<p>But let me introduce a little more infos:</p>
<p>I developed a simple <strong>portrait only</strong> app that contains a TabGroup and very fews views, buttons e tables.</p>
<p>The current version on the Android Market is going very well right now: Installed 800 times (9 reviews all 5 stars ).</p>
<p>I personally tested and <strong>used few days</strong> the App on these devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>LG Optimus One: resolution of 480 x 320</li>
<li>Galaxy S3: resolution of 1920 x 1080</li>
<li>Galaxy Tab 7.7: resolution of 1280 x 800</li>
</ul>
<p>And on an emulator with a QVGA resolution ( 240 x 320 ), the same that you mentioned.</p>
<p>The UI worked very well on all this cases without any relevant problems.</p>
<p>How can you see by yourself in these screenshots of an Galaxy S3 and a Emulator Device with 240 x 320 in resolution:</p>
