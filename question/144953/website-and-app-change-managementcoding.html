			<p>Hi all</p>
<p>I may be mistaken, but does appcelerator work in that you can take your EXISTING website code (with or<br>without making some small modifications) and just put it in appcelerator and it will create the app version,<br>OR is it basically having to re-write all or most of your code again.  </p>
<p>Here&#39;s what I am trying to understand, our site is mostly database driven, and I am aware that assuming you have the same fields&#x2F;connecting to the same DB, that if I update something in the database it will appear on both the site and app, but I&#39;m trying to understand how everything else that is NON-database driven would<br>work.</p>
<p>Our team has spent about 5 months developing our app with appcelerator (not done yet) and i&#39;m concerned that we are possibly not doing things in the most efficient way, and also concerned that every time we make changes on our site that it seems we have to make all those changes again on the app</p>
<p>Perhaps we are doing the right way, but want to get some insight, and&#x2F;or suggestions.</p>

							<p>Think this is a valid question, might be a bit late in dev to be asking though, but some thoughts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is your goal a mobile version of your website?</li>
</ul>
<p>If this is your goal, then make the best darn mobile version of your app possible.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is your goal a mobile app?</li>
</ul>
<p>As an app user, I do NOT want to see a website in a frame (nor does Apple, who will often not pass your app through to the store).  I want a native experience when on my device. I don&#39;t want HTML buttons, I want native iOS buttons, and native Android buttons and native Blackberry buttons.</p>
<p>I want local audio, I want cached data, I want a rich experience.</p>
<p>Taking a look at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;52734106">Fred Spencer&#39;s Codestrong 2012 session on UI&#x2F;UX</a> on vimeo.</p>
<p>Also, take a look at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;52661030">Don and Ben&#39;s keynote on Web vs App</a> also available on vimeo (the microsoft bashing was a bit excessive, and got old fast, but the content was good otherwise.)</p>

<p>No, you can&#39;t cut and paste your website into Titanium (or phonegap, of buzz, or anything else) and make an app that will show your users that you actually care about them</p>
<p>(yes, you make an app full of webviews, but <em>show em the love</em>)</p>

										<p><p>Hi Stephen–thanks for your comments.  Our goal is to have a mobile app, so a customer has 2 options–at a desktop they can use our website, on the go, they can use our app.</p>
<p>what do you mean by this exactly &quot;(yes, you make an app full of webviews, but show em the love)&quot;</p>
<p>Also from an app dev side, does 5 months seem reasonable?  I know it varies depending on the level ofcomplexity, but we have a marketplace that let&#39;s consumers buy&#x2F;sell between eachother- its currently web based, but bringing it to mobile (the same functionality as our website)</p>

										<p><p>Some of our project have been a few days, others 10 months.</p>
<p>On android, you could load html pages from your website into webviews in Appcelerator, basically just framing your existing site in what appears to be a slightly native form.  This will not pass evaluation by Apple for failing to serve enough native functionality.</p>
