			<h1>Push Notification? a mirage for me!</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello to all guys.</p>
<p>It is clear, my huge problem is the push notifications.<br>Implement these blessed push notifications in my app is becoming something really impossible.</p>
<p>There are 1000 services that offer a service for Push Notifications: Those of Appcelerator, Urban Airship, Appoxee, Parse etc etc</p>
<p>I had tried those of Urban Airship (following this guide: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Push+Notifications+with+Urban+Airship), I thought I finally got there (during the state of the development notifications - using the device token - worked, but when I entered the state of Production notifications did not work)</p>
<p>Each service offers for notifications 200,000 types of notifications, a pain for me …</p>
<p>I want something simple, very simple indeed ….<br>The user starts the app, enable push notifications, and after that can receive notifications. I do not want to send notifications to a certain group of users, send notifications at a certain time, send notifications programmed etc etc, I would just send it to all users who have activated notifications the same message … a simple thing but it seems almost impossible to achieve.</p>
<p>Now I ask you … Which service should I use to have a basic service of Push Notification? (send the same message to all users)</p>
<p>Thank you very much, and I hope that with your experience can give me a hand</p>

							<p>For me it worked easily with Urban Airship. But because of the costs I consider switching to pushswoosh. They have modules, examples and good service.</p>

										<p><p>I started doing some tests with pushswoosh.</p>
<p>but I have to ask you something ….</p>
<p>If I install the app on my device with a profile development , push notifications are working properly.<br>As if I install the app with a profile AD HOC , push notifications do not work</p>
<p>This means that the profile AD HOC is considered already in PRODUCTION?</p>

										<p><p>Yes. The guide is good. And yes: As soon as you use ADHoc you are in production mode. Same with Urban Airship. By the way: I had several questions to pushswoosh. There was a great service with direct and quick mail support. At Urban Airship I tried the same before and only got a rude response that I should get a paying customer before asking… And no support for Titanium…</p>
