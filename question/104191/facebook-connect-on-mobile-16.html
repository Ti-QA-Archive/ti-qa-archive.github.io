			<p>Hi</p>
<p>I&#39;ve just upgraded my Titanium Mobile SDK version to 1.6.<br>I noticed the facebook connect button only opens a facebook page in Safari.<br>Does anybody experiences the same problems and knows how to fix it?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot!</p>
<p>Felix</p>

							<p>Last night I found the new facebook module doc and 1.6 nightly build. After getting it setup my app would launch and I would click on the FB Login button.</p>
<p>In Simulator:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Web page opens, facebook says I&#39;ve already authenticated, tells me to click &quot;Okay&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>After clicking &quot;Okay&quot; I essentially get a 404 error. Page could not be displayed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Resend, resend, resend data. Nothing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Instead of refreshing&#x2F;resending I try to just go to the address and it loads with an error. Essentially, this is just saying there is something wrong when submitting data. Not the page itself. The address is http:&#x2F;&#x2F;facebook.com&#x2F;connect&#x2F;uiserver.php</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>On device with FB installed:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Click login</p>
</li>
<li><p>App-switch to Facebook</p>
</li>
<li><p>I click &quot;Okay&quot; button to authenticate FB app + iphone app</p>
</li>
<li><p>Modal window closes and FB App sits there. It does not redirect me back to my app.</p>
</li>
</ol>

										<p><p>Download latest build. Clear build&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;build&#x2F; directory. In tiapp.xml make sure &quot;&lt;property name=&quot;ti.facebook.appid&quot;&gt;241558718502&lt;&#x2F;property&gt;&quot; is in the highest level (such as after: &lt;guid&gt;&lt;&#x2F;guid&gt;).

							<p>I have a similar problem. I upgraded to 1.6.0 and adapted my code to match the new API, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(Titanium<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>Facebook<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>isLoggedIn()==<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>)
<span class="hljs-attribute">...</span>
</code></pre><p>is now:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">if</span><span class="hljs-params">(Titanium.Facebook.loggedIn)</span></span>
...
</code></pre><p>When pressing the &quot;Connect&quot; button my Facebook-App opens showing a login-screen (where is this nice popup-window I know from 1.5?). After logging in and pressing a small &quot;OK&quot; button, the main menu of my Facebook app appears. Hmm…</p>
<p>Going back to my application, the &quot;Login&quot; button is still active and <strong>Titanium.Facebook.loggedIn</strong> still returns <strong>False</strong>.</p>

And the ugg boots sale is not inexpensive. Finding Cheap UGG Boots can appear almost hopeless to the regular person.ugg boots on sale The chances are,ugg boots unless you&#39;ve a lot of expendable cash, you aren&#39;t ready or prepared to pay for a boot that costs more than an entire new outfit.</p>
<p>How Do You Find These great cheap ugg boots at cheap prices?</p>
<p>There are literally many hundreds of websites out there that will offer you a low cost cheap uggs. Be cautious, nonetheless. If the cost sounds fantastic, it probably is. Very much like the cheap knock-offs of purses and watches sold on the streets of New York City, imitation uggs sale are all over. And, to you, that might not matter. If it&#39;s not the brand, but the appearance of the trademark that is essential to you, proceed and by an imitation. Unless you live in NYC or California, chances are no one will know anyway.</p>
