			<h1>Nested bundles are not supported in iOS apps</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have two existing apps in the iTunes store (one for iPhone and one for iPad). I had to make some critical code changes this week to the way the json returned from our servers is parsed because, since a server upgrade this weekend, the apps have been rendered useless. I made the changes to both the iPhone app and the iPad app. I was using Titanium sdk 3.4 and iOS sdk 8.1. Submission went well on the iPhone app. It uploaded and processed correctly. With the iPad app, it built fine, passed validation through Xcode 6.1 and successfully submitted. However, about 5 minutes after it was submitted I got an email from the iTunes store stating that the bundle was invalid due to nested bundles not being supported in iOS apps. I&#39;ve had no luck searching online for a solution for this, so I&#39;m wondering if anyone else has experienced this. The only module I&#39;m using in it is the Ti.maps module, otherwise, the code is pretty straightforward. It does have one call out to a yahoo api for geolocation, so i don&#39;t know if that has anything to do with it. The weird thing is the code for the app that got rejected is virtually the same as the code for the app that was accepted. Does anyone have any idea of where&#x2F;what I should be looking at to get this resolved? I&#39;ve removed extraneous files from the build and don&#39;t see any additional executables in it, but i keep getting that same notification when i submit.</p>
