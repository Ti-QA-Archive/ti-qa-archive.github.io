			<h1>The Disappearing View</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m amusing myself with the title, but it&#39;s not really accurate. The view never appears at all. One of the concepts I&#39;ve really struggled with trying to build a Titanium app is the idea that I have to explicitly declare the dimensions of nearly <em>everything</em>. In this case, I have a window which I&#39;d like to include a header and a scrollable body. The header shows up nicely, but when I define the body like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> body = Ti.UI.createScrollView({ 
  backgroundColor:<span class="hljs-string">'#000'</span>,
  backgroundImage: <span class="hljs-string">'/images/body.png'</span>,
  borderColor: <span class="hljs-string">'#f00'</span>,
  bottom: <span class="hljs-number">0</span>,
  layout: <span class="hljs-string">'vertical'</span>,
  left: <span class="hljs-number">0</span>,
  right: <span class="hljs-number">0</span>,
  top: <span class="hljs-number">0</span>,
});
</code></pre><p>It doesn&#39;t appear. Nothing. On the other hand, if I replace the top, right, bottom and left properties with <code>height: &amp;#39;auto&amp;#39;</code>, the the body appears, but it&#39;s height becomes that of its content so it still doesn&#39;t scroll.</p>
<p>Can someone help me understand why?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>The solution I have to this is to set the height of the scrollable View to be what I need. If I need it full screen use the height off the current window.</p>
<p>Then set contentHeight: auto.</p>
<p>A scrollable container needs to have its height otherwise it will keep expanding to the height of the content and go off the window. If the height isn&#39;t set it will have a height of 0 until components are added to it.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, Trevor. What I need it to do, though, is take up the rest of the viewport (height of viewport minus height of a header graphic). I had hoped that setting the top&#x2F;bottom properties would cover that, but it doesn&#39;t.</p>

										<p><p>Then that is your height of the container. setit as that. you can calculate the height of an object during creation based on other heights as long as the container your using for the height has been created.</p>
<p>Oh also set width…</p>
