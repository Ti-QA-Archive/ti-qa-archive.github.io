							<p>Hi</p>
<p>You are fighting several problems here ;</p>
<ul>
<li>Android TextArea always shows the <em>Return</em> key as the TextArea is expected to have more than one line - so relabelling the <em>Return</em> (which has a specific action) to that of another action - would only visually change the meaning of the button and not the action itself.</li>
<li>The iOS Return key can act differently when used in combination of the <em>suppressReturn</em> property.  As a developer you are able to choose if the iOS TextArea <em>return</em> key acts as an action key or as a return key.</li>
<li>The visual style of Android Keyboards depends on; the version of Android and if any skin has been added to by the device manufacture. (Technical point only - not directly related to this issue)</li>
<li>Most importantly - there is a long standing failure to update the documentation in Titanium for this, directly related to TextArea;<ul>
<li><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-14615">TIMOB-14615</a></li>
<li><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-13871">TIMOB-13871</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So in summary the <em>Actino Button</em> (return key) can act as;</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS = return key OR action button using one of the available RETURNKEY constants</li>
<li>Android = return key only</li>
</ul>
<p>The documentation needs to be up to date to reflect this.  To confirm in my own mind I have tried Android; 2.3.7, 4.4 &amp; 5.0 as well as iOS 7 &amp; 8.  Each using TextField and TextArea.</p>
<p>The TextField can have any of the documented RETURNKEY constants applied to both Android and iOS.</p>

										<p><p>So I guess there is no real solution other than using a textfield which can&#39;t be multiline.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a long time iOS user so I don&#39;t have a deep knowlegde of how Android users behave around form inputs - e.g. will they know to press the devices back button to hide the keyboard?</p>
<p>Thanks for a very comprehensive answer!</p>

										<p><p>Yeah, Android users are more than comfortable (read trained) in using the back button to dismiss the keyboard when displayed as it performs that action when the keyboard is displayed.  Newer version of Android actually change the back button icon from pointing left (back) to down (dismiss) when the keyboard is shown.</p>

										<p><p>Good to know. Our first Android app is just about finished so we are quite excited&#x2F;terrified to see what is going to happen in terms of customer feedback.</p>

										<p><p>Here is the best knowledge you will ever get to handle what happens once you have launched an app into iOS AND Android stores.</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS users are generally grateful for things and take a few knocks to be publicly disappointed so much they feel the need to comment on the app store.</li>
<li>Android users are a different breed (not all obviously) but they take everything personally and think despite your attempts to potentially enrich their lives with whatever the goal of your app is - you are the worst person on the planet</li>
</ul>
<p>That seems over the the top - but trust me and then read some comments for other apps.</p>
<p>The good news is though; provided you respond to criticism positively directly as responses to their play store comments and correct their assertions when wrong, ask for more details about their device if you require it and update them if a new version fixes a problem THEY were having - they calm down to a level where they can and very often do change their review.</p>
<p>Short but true story;</p>
<p>Released an app that gives a certain deserving sector of the UK workers lots and lots of free stuff and discounts.  You HAVE to be one of those deserving people to use the app and you have to prove your suitability with government based documentation.</p>
<p>We released the iOS version and waited for the review period - took a week and then was released into the store.  We aimed to release the Android version that same day as it was already for the official launch.  However.at the last moment an issue was found and we started to fix it, once corrected we noticed something else with certain Android devices - which we later found was a permissions thing.  This took around 3 days.  We released the Android version.  Those nice deserving people complained that we should have released the Android version first - how dare we favour iOS over Android.  There were device compatibility (there will ALWAYS be) as there are so many variations of devices in all sorts of form factors with all sorts of Android versions and manufacturers custom OS skinning.  The vast majority of these were fixed within a few weeks.</p>
<p>This app is on more than 150k devices now.  The iOS rating has always been 4.7 and higher.  The Android rating was at one time 1, later got as high as 2 (keep in mind exact same app).  With the careful follow ups mentioned previously by one of the team and quick updates this is now 4.6.</p>
<p>The take away from this - even the best job you will do will be seen by a loud group of Android users as something bad.  But once calmed down they regain a sense of normality.  So expect some bad reviews, even if they are not deserved - keep doing what you are doing and all will be good.</p>
<p>If you manage to put an app out to a large number of Android users and do not get an early significant loud negative group - you are better than me.</p>

										<p><p>Yeah, I think you are right about your experiences. I have read some reviews on the Play Store on other apps and yes people are generally the way you describe it. To our advantage (I hope) is that our target group is women 25+. Our iOS version has about 95% women and the same is to be expected on Android.</p>
<p>Looking back was there any difference between feedback from your male and female users?</p>

										<p><p>In the case of this specific app I mentioned the skew due to the sector it benefited was mostly men.  That might have played a part as the general rules would suggest of male vs female.  </p>
<p>It is more about Android user rather than a Male of Female Android user.  Consider adding a feature within the app that is easy to spot and easy to use that allows the user to provide direct feedback to you of issues and suggestions.  This has been shown to drive a conversation rather than Play Store comment rant.  Once you have their feedback - work with it appropriately and then seek a comment.  An initially unhappy user who is transformed into a happy one is a positive one.</p>
