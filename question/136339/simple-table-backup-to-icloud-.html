			<h1>&#34;Simple&#34; table backup to iCloud ?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve looked all over the documentation but can&#39;t seem to find anything regarding iCloud backup support (iOS).</p>
<p>In my app I have a couple of SQLite tables that really need to be backedup along with the app via the user&#39;s iTunes and&#x2F;or iCloud. The tables contain text and integers only and the data is put there by the user.<br>Each user may put several hundred rows in the tables over time, maybe even thousands.</p>
<p>Since this setting exists</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">db.<span class="hljs-type">file</span>.setRemoteBackup(<span class="hljs-constant">false</span>);
</code></pre><p>I figure there are some backup possibilities? =)</p>
<p>I don&#39;t need a great backend for my app, I just want to make sure the users don&#39;t loose their<br>data if their iPhone break or get stolen.</p>
<p>Is there an easy way of just telling the app to backup my tables when the user backups his&#x2F;her iPhone to iCloud or iTunes? Note that there is no need to backup WHILE USING the app at this point.</p>
<p>If there is a good answer anywhere already, please point me in the right direction. =)</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>There was another Q&amp;A thread recently that addressed the reason why an app was rejected by Apple. Within that thread there seemed to be some good generic information about using iCloud for storing data&#x2F;tables&#x2F;etc and what is and what is not acceptable. There are some useful code ideas there for storing to different parts of the app&#39;s file system.</p>
<p>I apologize in advance if you don&#39;t feel like it addresses your question, but I wanted to pass it along anyway.</p>

							<p>A couple months late, but if you just need to backup if your users lost their phones, iOS has those data backed up by default, given that the user restores their old data to the new phone.</p>
<p>If you want to sync data across iDevices, then you&#39;re out of luck. Ti doesn&#39;t support iCloud (probably never will). You&#39;ll have to either deploy your own web service, or use <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;cloud">Ti.cloud</a>. Neither are as smooth and seamless as iCloud, since both ways will require your user to create some sort of account.</p>
