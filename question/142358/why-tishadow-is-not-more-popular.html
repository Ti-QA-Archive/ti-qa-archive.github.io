			<h1>Why TiShadow is not more popular?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to deploy a full app with TiShadow. I haven&#39;t got it to work yet, and I&#39;m not finding much information about it. My question, before spending my time with this &quot;tool&quot; is:  If it seems to be so Useful, why I have the impression that the people out there is not using it?</p>

							<div><p>I agree, not much info about it, despite it&#39;s really a huge improvement in the dev process!<br>Thank you David!<br>Is there a way to use the &quot;TiShadow Express&quot; mode even inside Titanium Studio (run&amp;debug from the IDE)?</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve been using TiShadow for some time and I really cannot understand that.</p>
<p>If you need to ask something about TiShadow, you can ask on Github, David is usually very quick with his replies and I can jump in if I know something.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Ivan. I&#39;ve already had a look at some conversations in github between you, guys :)     He seems to be very kind.</p>
<p>I respect your opinion in Titanium Development and so now  I know I&#39;m in the right way…I&#39;ll ask David if I need something, and probably I can give some useful feedback.</p>
