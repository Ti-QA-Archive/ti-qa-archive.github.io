			<h1>Preventing multiple click events being processed</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>SDK 3.0, Android only 2.3+, tested on two devices.</p>
<p>I have an app which uses a table view as a main menu, opening up other windows on selection of an option. I found that it&#39;s quite easy to tap a couple of options, or even the same option twice before the new window appears, resulting in multiple windows being opened. This is not limited to tableviews, it also appears happens on any click event.</p>
<p>So, I&#39;ve implemented it such that when the &#39;click&#39; event is processed, the first thing it does is to remove the listener. So far I&#39;ve only done this for the main menu, and before I go through the rest of the app and do something similar I wondered if there was anything obvious I&#39;m missing. Surely this kind of thing shouldn&#39;t be necessary? Although, that said, if you run the Codestrong app the same thing happens - you can select a second option from the dashboard, before the first window has appeared!</p>

							<p>It would be easier to provide a Guard mechanism to prevent actioning repeated clicks rather than going through the hastle of removing and adding the event listeners. You could, for example, just disable the button to prevent it receiving clicks, or have a variable that is set to  e.g <code>clicked = true</code> to prevent a tableview click.</p>
<p>Also, it can sometimes mean you are performing too much startup code in the new window that means it is taking too longer to render before the user gets impatient and clicks again. General rule of thumb for responsive apps is to delay code execution until as late as possible.</p>

										<p><p>Oh, and another idea would be to add a transparent full screen view to the current window (perhaps with a progress indicator) that you remove in the new window. This will cover the active view and prevent further clicks</p>

										<p><p>I have not used it yet (but it&#39;s in my pipeline) but Jason Priebe has built an eventt hrottling mechanism in his <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jpriebe&#x2F;TitanUp">TitanUp library</a> that&#39;s supposed to do exactly what Nick described.</p>
<p>Might be an intresting input for you.  I agree with Nick that the remove&#x2F;add the listener is bothersome.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Nick. I did start by having an optionSelected flag but it seemed that the occasional duplicate event still got through, removing the listener proved more reliable, although that could just be a coding issue.</p>
<p>I hear what you&#39;re saying with the &#39;too much startup code&#39; but there&#39;s generally nothing much in there, except for one option which I can&#39;t easily avoid.</p>
<p>Hmmm, a transparent view I like, assuming it would appear quickly enough! (I&#39;m currently adding a progress indicator in the status bar)</p>

										<p><p>Throttling and Debouncing are also good techniques. Check out this <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;benalman.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin&#x2F;">library</a> . It does NOT require jQuery</p>

										<p><p>Good point about debouncing. If you already use underscore js in your project, I believe it also support debouncing. In my case, it will save me load another library …</p>

										<p><p>So it is ! :-). More info <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;underscorejs.org&#x2F;#debounce">here</a>. Alloy already adds a reference to underscore as well, so win win !</p>

							<p>Hi Nigel, after click on first table View, just put a <strong>Black transparent View with loading indicator or some animation if it takes time</strong></p>
