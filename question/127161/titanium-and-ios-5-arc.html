XCODE 4.2 and iOS 5 have now been officially released.</strong></p>
<p>Will Titanium-generated iOS code (and compilation) use the new XCode auto reference counting? It is a iOS 5 SDK compile-time feature that is supposed to work on iOS 4.x devices. I think that would solve the leaking problem so many people complain about on Titanium - that would make Titanium a safer bet to me.</p>

<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-5909</p>
<p>sometimes Ti can leak… migrating to ARC is the way to go, although it is not a priority right now…</p>
<p>maybe Apple enforces ARC in the future… the same way that they disallowed direct memory mapping on iOS… :)</p>

							<p>In a way Titanium does not really benefit from ARC because ARC is just a compile time helper. It really to save the coder from having to remember to retain&#x2F;release. As all the Titanium code is generated it should be releasing and retaining properly already. The only reason ARC would be useful to Titanium is if Titanium was leaky.</p>

										<p><p>Down voted as factually incorrect. The very reason ARC came into being is humans (coders) make mistakes. Of course appcelerator would benefit from ARC, it is based on Objective-C code that is not generated. In case the generated statement was about the javascript. The JS is NOT converted into ObjC, but rather a hybrid interpreted model at runtime. Then there are the native modules to think of too. So all in all ARC would be a great idea.</p>
