			<h1>How do I upload a message to both a users own facebook profile AND the company&#39;s facebook page in the same action?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Dear All.<br>I am quite new to app development, but have some web development experience. I want to upload the final content generated from the user interaction with my app to the the user&#39;s own facebook profile - which is working fine, but I would like the same message to be posted on the company&#39;s wall as well. Can I do that in the same event - and how? It would be best if the user didn&#39;t have to click two buttons, but could do it all in one click. Can I write several app id&#39;s and the app automatically posts to the associated pages? Or how is this done?<br>Thanks in advance!<br>Dearest Louise</p>

							<p>This mostly depends on the user. You can only post to where your user is authenticated. Users authenticate as their personal profile and not as their company page. So unless they have their personal wall posts sync to their company page, you&#39;re not going to be able to do exactly what you want to do.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Anthony and thanks for your reply! I think I wasn&#39;t clear in my description above, what I want to do is posting the same message to the user&#39;s profile and also to the company&#39;s wall for whom I am making the app. In other words; I am making an app for an exhibition and we would like the user, when finishing the exhibition, to upload a message to both their own profile and the exhibition fanpage. Is that possible?<br>Thanks again for your time and help (and sorry for my poor description)!<br>Dearest Louise</p>
