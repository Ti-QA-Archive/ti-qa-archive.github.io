			<h1>Code Sign error - doesn&#39;t match any valid certificate</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I got this code sign, cert, provisioning stuff all working 2 days ago but then I had to add another person to the provisioning profile, and that broke everything. I re-did my certs, redid dev profile, redid dist profile. Re-created project in Titanium. All the certs and profiles show VALID in keychain store and Xcode. Everything looks good. All old certs and provisioning profiles deleted from keychain and Xcode. All re-created. Yet whenever I try to compile my app in Titanium to target iOS device, I get this error:</p>
<p>&quot;Code Sign error: The identity &#39;iPhone Developer: [dev name] (W39T693USJ)&#39; doesn&#39;t match any valid certificate&#x2F;private key pair in the default keychain&quot;</p>
<p>This makes no sense. Please help.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m not sure who &quot;they&quot; refers to. It&#39;s all me. I did submit a CSR with the correct credentials, that&#39;s why my certs and profiles all show as Valid in keychain and xcode. And everything shows valid on apple developer site.</p>
<p>How do I delete Developer profile from within TI Studio? The way I had attempted this before was to delete my project and create a new project. Then when I try to build to device, it asks me to upload my .mobileprovision file, which I did. Shouldn&#39;t this be sufficient? Is there something else I need to do?</p>

										<p><p>Yes…I&#39;ll try it when I&#39;m back at my mac. But I had checked all this stuff numerous times and everything shows correct in xcode and keychain. I believe the problem is somehow in Ti not looking at the right stuff, or holding on to an old profile or cert or something. How can I clean out&#x2F;fix the Ti side?</p>

							<p>Look, go to your keychain, –&gt; go to the KEYS section, and see if you have certificates under your name? If your name appears there without the certificates there will be a problem with signing.</p>

							<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I know this is a slightly old post but I am dying over here trying to figure this out and I cannot find anyone with a very precise answer.  I am getting a Distribution Profile does not match any valid, non-expired cert error when trying to compile for iTunesConnect.  The dev one works fine no prob. Can anyone give the exact steps with the exact order and what the heck I may be missing here?  This seems to be a very very common issue for first timers compiling the app for distribution.  I have seen lots of posts, but every answer is always left with check your keys or unanswered.  I am in the same boat ZeroGravPro was… I have started the process over many times and xCode says every cert is valid, I have both the dev and distribution certs installed.  All of my keys look correct and no old ones are left in the list.  I have the dev and distribution provisioning profiles installed into xCode.</p>
<p>ZeroGravPro how did you get it to work? Or did you? Did Nick Milner&#39;s suggestion on cleaning out Ti Studio&#39;s certs work and what were those exact steps. </p>
<p>I definitely feel like it is an issue with Ti reading old certs, but can&#39;t seem to get it to refresh or remove them from my original mess up.  I have read a post that says do a clean build, and not to use a the drop downs but install the certs using the folder select (browse for file) option, but their is no folder select in the newer version of Ti Studio that I can find.  And I have also made sure login was my default keychain.</p>
<p>So like I said, I&#39;m completely lost on what to look for next.  Any help is appreciated. Thanks.</p>
<p>P.S. I can post screenshots if needed tomorrow when I get to work, and if a mod feels like this needs to be a new thread, please feel free to move this post, but I feel it directly ties to the issues above. Thanks again.</p>

										<p><p>Just FYI for anyone that runs into this problem, my certs were valid as I expected.  I ended up compiling for distribution inside of xCode.  Ti was trying to use the development cert for distribution.  So the first thing that needed to change was the build settings for the project, change both of the release targets to the correct distribution certs.  I also noticed it messed up my app icons, so I had to add those files into my resources folder and then add those to the info.plist file.  Then under each project target (iphone, ipad, universal) make sure your new icon files are listed… (I named my icons, iphone-icon.png and ipad-icon.png just in case you were wondering).  Next make sure you have iOS device selected from the schema.  Once that is ready select Archive from the Product menu at the top.  When that completes go to the organizer (if no errors occur), select the Archives tab (I think this happened automatically, I can&#39;t really remember I was too excited I got that far), and select Validate. </p>
<p>Type in your iTunesConnect info, and pray to the gods (well at least that Apple won&#39;t reject you).  If it validates submit it and you&#39;re just in a waiting game.  If you get the error that no valid app was found on iTunesConnect, make sure you have set up you app on there, and the biggest kicker, make sure you click the &quot;Ready to Upload Binary&quot; button.</p>

							<p>Creating certificates that will give you the private&#x2F;public keys has to be done correctly. I will post later the exact steps to follow, but a lot of people have had this problem. </p>
<p>In all fairness, I have to admit the way Ti handles development is quite enjoyable indeed.</p>
