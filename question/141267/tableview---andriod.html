							<p>Hi Steven</p>
<p>I think part of the problem is that Android tables are slower than iOS and as there are so many different types of Android hardware is it easy to generalise.</p>
<p>There are techniques to make the experience faster for the user, but at the end of the day until the underlying tables are improved at an operating system level there is only so much Appcelerator can do.</p>
<p>For example; only show as many rows as are required at that time, use staggered, lazy or request methods to add to the table.  Only use custom row layout is actually required.  Make use of the property <code>className</code> if you are not already.  Filter results, drill down results, if you are using images only use an image view if the standard <code>leftImage</code> cannot solve the problem.  Provide default images for any view you use so the table can lazy load better.</p>
<p>Also what hardware are you testing on?  I have a few tests Android devices and get different results, I should expect my htc desire S is faster than my htc wildfire, so I should also expect my wildfire to be slower - seems logical but not all phones are equal.  My Nexus 7 is faster than both of those, but my iPhone is faster than all of them.  And none of those observations are using Titanium code - using the common apps - like; twitter, facebook, imdb etc.</p>

							<p>How many rows are you trying to display?  I don&#39;t have any problems with it on android, but I only display about 25 rows at a time, and I use pagination to break up longer lists.  Not only is it faster, but it is a better user experience.</p>

										<p><p>I am testing on Galaxy Ace. As I add more rows the performance does seem to go down. I find that Andriod is not all bad, as it detects errors in the iPhone version I have built, but their are alot of negavtives on andriod compared to iPhones. e.g. maps are a disaster on android. Nearly every thing breaks, or is just badly implemented. Might just switch to web views to handle this on android. But doing my best to make do with these road blocks, but I will get there.</p>
