			<h1>Trying to figure out the basics of Titanium Studio</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>We downloaded titanium appcelerator studio (1.8), and can create a project and run it (iPad simulator) but we can not get the Kitchen Sink iPad app to import properly or debug.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I unzip the file in the workspace then select import exiting project into workspace, it seems to do its thing, and no files appear in the App Explorer.  (The folder is there at the same level as the pre-existing new app)</p>
</li>
<li><p>I import it from git (copying the link) and it appears, with all the files, but won&#39;t run or debug (I get an error requester saying it can&#39;t launch because there are no existing launches - whatever that means, not exactly intuitive)</p>
</li>
<li><p>I tried to open kitchen sink as a new project, and same error.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I tried using the Project Explorer with Working sets, and that showed no files either.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>How is one supposed to do any of these things, and in what way is this easier than Xcode?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

							<div><p>When you imported from disk, did you try &quot;Import &gt; Existing Titanium Project..&quot; Also, when you tried to run, did you press the little Run or Debug icons in the App Explorer? Perhaps a screenshot will help?</p>

							<p>I apologize that the forum software hasn&#39;t made this any easier. here&#39;s what works for me, just as a point of reference.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;KitchenSinkiPad&#x2F;downloads as .zip</li>
<li>Extract the .zip file</li>
<li>Import &gt; Import Existing Titanium Project (though Existing Projects into Workspace seems to work too)</li>
<li>Press the debug or run button in the bar <em>inside</em> Project Explorer or App Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Two scenarios to try:</p>
<p>For no files, have you tried right-clicking on the project in Project Explorer? If you right click on the project, see properties, and find the location on disk, are the files there?</p>
<p>For &quot;No existing launches&quot;, are you clicking the run button in the main toolbar and not the one inside App Explorer or Project Explorer? The project&#x2F;app explorer run buttons automatically set up default launch configurations for you.</p>
<p>If you&#39;d like to post an image, most people post them to some external site like http:&#x2F;&#x2F;skitch.com&#x2F; and link them in that way.</p>

										<p><p>I managed to get it to work by selecting Titanium -&gt; import Titanium Project, though General -&gt; Import Existing Projects did not work.  I still don&#39;t know why.</p>
<p>As far as the No Existing Launches issue was concerned, yes, that is true, I was launching from the main toolbar like I do with all my existing eclipse projects in Java, I did not realize there was another.</p>
<p>So in any event I got this to work, and I appreciate your rapid response.</p>

							<p>OK, I am about to give up on this.  I typed an answer and it disappeared for no apparent reason.  Let me try again.</p>
<p>I tried &quot;import project into workspace&quot;, as I said.  Selected the folder resulting from unzipping the downloaded file.  It seemed to import, but nothing appears in the App Explorer (though the drop down shows the Kitchen Sink project name).  I switch to Project Explorer, and the folder appears, but the only thing in it is &quot;Connections&quot; whatever that is supposed to do for me.</p>
<p>I&#39;d add the screenshots I took, but the &quot;markup syntax&quot; does not provide any useful instructions on how to post an image.  </p>
<p>So far, I am encouraged to go back to coding in objective c and&#x2F;or java.</p>
