<p>For in app purchase you have to use the module.Here are their links</p>
<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;776?1351655587">Android in app</a></p>
<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;794?1640111306">Ios in app</a></p>

							<p>Thanks Muhammad! Will start cracking on that.<br>Do you have any example in the AppStore &#x2F; Google Play you could point me to? It&#39;s always nice to see live case studies. Cheers</p>

										<p><p>Juliet first of all instead of making the whole new answer try to comment in the area and a quiz google search would give you 100 of links on that</p>
<p>thanks</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the heads-up re-posting. With regards to quiz google search, i am sorry to disagree but I have not been able to find Quizz apps developed with Titanium through a Google Search. This kind of information is not generally available and that&#39;s why I thought someone for the Titanium community might be able to help.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, I aprreciate that. At this stage, we are trying to assess what can be done with the different tools available in the market. That&#39;s why it would help to see concrete examples. I&#39;m not asking for code at this point: just finished Apps I could download on my device to see how effective Titanium is in designing quizz apps. Do you think that would be possible? Just one or two examples would help. Cheers</p>
