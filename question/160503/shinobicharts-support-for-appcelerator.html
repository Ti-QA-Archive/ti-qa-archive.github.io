			<h1>ShinobiCharts support for Appcelerator</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I&#39;m a member of the ShinobiCharts development team, and we&#39;ve just released a proof of concept iOS module. We&#39;re looking to gauge the level of demand there is for this kind of product, and whether the module which we&#39;ve produced fits in with the expectations of Titanium developers.</p>
<p>The benefit you get from the module is the same level of performance and feel as with native apps. If you&#39;re looking to integrate charting into your app, please feel free to download the module and give it a go. You can find it on our ShinobiLabs page (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.shinobicontrols.com&#x2F;shinobilabs&#x2F;). We&#39;re very keen to get feedback from Titanium developers on how you find the module to use.</p>
<p>At the moment, we&#39;ve only produced an iOS module. Another thing we&#39;d be interesting in getting feedback on is how much interest there would be in an Android module. At the moment, our iOS and Android charts products have quite a different API. Our iOS module pretty much stays true to the iOS API. If we were to follow the same approach with an Android module, this would mean that our two modules would have a different API to each other. Would most developers be happy with this? Or would most people expect a single API which is more platform agnostic?</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Dan</p>

							<div><p>For me no Android &amp; cross platform compatibility means we can&#39;t use it.</p>
<p>But there is a need for a good charting module for IOS and Android.</p>

							<div><p>We really need a good charting module that covers iOS and Android. It wouldn&#39;t be that big a deal if APIs were different as long as the output was as efficient and had all the same capabilities</p>
