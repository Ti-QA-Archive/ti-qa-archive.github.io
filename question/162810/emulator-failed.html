							<p>Clean your project, double-check that Android is properly configured (scroll to bottom of Dashboard). If that doesn&#39;t work, try creating a new blank project and running it.</p>

										<p><p>The emulator is really a poor tool, not that this helps you resolve your problem. Depending on what code you changed, the emulator sometimes stalls for no apparent reason with that error. Usually, closing the emulator and relaunching the app again fixed the issue for me. A tedious process at best, I know.</p>
<p>I got so frustrated with the emulator, that I just bought the cheapest android device I could find so I wouldn&#39;t have to deal with it anymore. Saves me a lot of headache although that may not be an option for you. Just mentioning it.</p>
