			<h1>HTTPClient with UTF-8 but £ sign refuses to work</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all, hoping that someone can shed some light on this.</p>
<p>I am creating an HTTPClient call to load a JSON string. I set the content type and charset as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">theClient = Ti.Network.createHTTPClient();
theClient.open(<span class="hljs-string">'GET'</span>, url);
theClient.setRequestHeader(<span class="hljs-string">'Content-Type'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'application/json; charset=utf-8;'</span>);
theClient.send();

theClient.onload = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span>  
</span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> theText = <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.responseText;
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> theData = <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.responseData;
}
</code></pre><p>This works fine for most calls but if the JSON contains any unusual characters, mainly the £ sign, the responseText just returns &#39;null&#39;.</p>
<p>I can only assume that this is because it doesn&#39;t understand the character, maybe i&#39;m not setting the charset correctly?</p>
<p>Any thoughts or longshots are welcome as i&#39;ve tried everything i can think of :-) </p>
<p>As an aside…strangely the responseData returns an array of undefined variables corresponding to the number of characters in the expected response. For example if the response was simply &#39;hello£&#39; the responseText would be null and the responseData would be an array of 6 variables all of which are undefined.</p>
<p>Thanks for any thoughts</p>
<p>Martyn</p>

							<div><p>How you testing the data returned?  Have you tried using Fiddler2 or just inspecting the values in Ti Studio?  Do you control the web service?  Does it return &#39;hello&#39; properly if you remove the £ character?  Does the header returned also say it is a application&#x2F;json; charset=utf-8;?</p>

							<div><p>Thanks for the comment, I have full control over the webservice and it returns the correct info in all cases, including the £ signs. The issue is that as this gets loaded into titanium it gets confused. The json works fine as this is a production app and the issue has been an oversight that has just occured.</p>

							<p>Hi Martyn</p>
<p>You will need to encode any characters that fall outside the common ASCII table into Unicode equivalents.  Consider pretty much anything in the top half of the ASCII table 128-255 as something you should encode.</p>
<p>Examples;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-label">POUND</span> = £ <span class="hljs-keyword">becomes </span>\u00a3
<span class="hljs-label">HALF</span> = ½ <span class="hljs-keyword">becomes </span>\u00bd
<span class="hljs-label">QUARTER</span> = ¼ <span class="hljs-keyword">becomes </span>\u00bc
</code></pre><p>Used in your JSON or strings inside your code;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-string">"\u00a310.50"</span> = <span class="hljs-string">"£10.50"</span>
</code></pre><p>Somewhat of a pain but once you build a filter the problem goes away.  Just remember to use the Unicode hex values and not ASCII versions.</p>

										<p><p>thanks Malcolm i think this is exactly what i need. I have toyed with encodeuri &#x2F; decoderui which would also work but as this app is already in production it would cause issues with current verisons. From what i see this solution is backward compatible.</p>
