			<h1>Install Error When Building For iPhone</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>–This issue has been solved; see below for the solution–</p>
<p>I&#39;ve installed all of the proper certificates, provisioning profiles, etc. as well as cleared my build&#x2F;iphone folder and for some reason, my app keeps giving me an install error when trying to do on-device development in Titanium (the emulator works fine though). It detects all of the required certificates and profiles fine and it built everything fine one time, and then after I changed some files (non-critical files in the app) and now I can&#39;t build at all.</p>
<p>It happens within 5-10 seconds after I click allow for the codesign prompt. I&#39;d really appreciate anybody&#39;s help with this issue. I know it sounds drastic but I&#39;ve already wiped my hard drive twice to fix this and I&#39;ve followed the instructions in the setup guide to the dot.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

							<p>Hey everyone, </p>
<p>After hours of fail I have found a solution (in my instance anyways, i hope it saves someone else the same pain).</p>
<p>I verified all required certificates were valid and present, then installed the &#39;Kitchen Sink&#39; app onto my phone.</p>
<p>To my surprise, this worked, installed just fine. </p>
<p>Then performed a full iPhone sync with iTunes.</p>
<p>Launch your app in the emulator, close, then run on device, your app should now load into iTunes and sync.</p>
<p>No idea why it worked, but hope it&#39;s useful for someone.</p>
<p>I gotta say i love the platform, but flaky is definitely the word!</p>

							<p>XCode&#39;s Base SDK is set to iPhone Simulator 4.0 and it builds fine- no errors. But Titanium doesn&#39;t build it and gives that install error right after the codesign prompt. Here&#39;s the complete XCode build log, with my app name and username taken out: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;c5a6eb0720771f8000ff</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help.</p>

							<p>I found the solution! Try checking all of the PNG&#39;s in the app. For me, the default.png (my splash screen file) somehow got saved in a weird, almost-corrupted way after I edited it in Photoshop and the app then couldn&#39;t compile it properly because of that.</p>
<p>I would suggest trying to open any photo files you have in your app from your computer, and if you see any direct error (Photoshop told me there was an unknown error and it couldn&#39;t open the image at all), delete the file and re-create it. That solved it for me!</p>

										<p><p>I haven&#39;t actually solved it yet, but I found a fix-around: I still build it via Titanium Developer, but when it gives me the &quot;Install Error&quot; I open my Xcode, go to the Organizer, go to my Device, go to the &quot;Applications&quot; part and click the little black &quot;+&quot;.</p>
<p>From there, I browse to the build&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;build&#x2F;release-iphoneos&#x2F; folder of my Application and open the &quot;.app&quot; file, and it imports it directly to whichever device I have selected.</p>
<p>Might be longer than just using Titanium, but it&#39;s better than having hours and hours of problems as I get &quot;Install Errors&quot; :P</p>

										<p><p>I was having the vague &quot;Install Error&quot;, usually when that happens I just build directly from Xcode. But this time it didn&#39;t work. I read your answer above and thought, &quot;no way, it can&#39;t be that simple!&quot;. Then I actually read the error info in Xcode, and voila! Corrupt PNG file! Awesome! Thanks for posting this!</p>

							<p>I too get this error.</p>
<p>What i would like is a more meaningful error message. Install error is fairly useless and gives you no idea where to start debugging it.</p>
<p>I have the correct appid and provisioning profile.<br>I went to organiser in xcode and there was no provisioning profile for this app on my phone, so titanium had not put it there. Therefore this error was way before the device stuff somewhere in the signing chaos that is apps and itunes&#x2F;provisioning profile.</p>
<p>It would be great to get this fixed, but in the meantime could we have a clue about what is actually happening?</p>
