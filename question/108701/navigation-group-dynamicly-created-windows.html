			<h1>Navigation Group, Dynamicly created windows</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have an issue with the navGroup. Im trying to make a document browser. That part is okay, but I also want to let the user create own folders and navigate it. Now thats not that easy to achieve.</p>
<p>All the database stuff is good and done. Using path and folder name it works like a charm, but how do I create a new window for each folder the user creates ?</p>
<p>Say, for example I add a folder named Foo in path &#x2F;. Creating 1 extra window is not a problem, but when the user starts creating &#x2F;Foo&#x2F;Bar&#x2F;Foh&#x2F;Soh I got a problem. I really dont want to create foo.js, bar.js and so on. </p>
<p>I need a way to dynamicly create new navgroup-windows. Any chance ?</p>

							<p>I might suggest that you not use the navigationGroup, first it does not work on android, secondly i think it might get a little unwieldily.</p>
<p>how about just using a tableview and keeping track of the depth, you can create &quot;bread-crumbs&quot; like some websites do that allow the user to navigate back up the folder list</p>

							<p>Not a bad idea, but how do I keep track of the depth ? Just throwing in a &quot;parent&quot; and &quot;next&quot; variable in the table ? Are there any predefined functions or variables to use ? Using setData() this might just work, uh ?</p>
<p>Anyhow, how do I go about creating more depth for each newly added folder ?</p>
