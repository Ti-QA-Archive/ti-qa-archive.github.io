		<section>
			<p>Needing to use the Titanium Volumeslider for an existing app and finding no 64-bit version I thought I&#39;d have a crack at downloading it from GitHub and rebuilding the module in Xcode using instructions from elsewhere in this forum. I remembered to change the path in the titanium.xcconfig to point to the version of the Titanium SDK I am using and to ask Xcode to update the project to the recommended settings. So far so good.</p>
<p>But on building I immediately get an error that TiViewProxy.h isn&#39;t found. Yet it is located at 3.5.0.GA&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;include&#x2F; as set in titanium.xcconfig. I did notice that since the Titanium Volumeslider module was last updated in 2011 that the former folder &#39;TiCore&#39; being pointed to in titanium.xcconfig is now called &#39;JavaScriptCore&#39; so have changed my titanium.xcconfig accordingly. Yet the Xcode build still fails.</p>
<p>Has anybody seen able to successfully build the Titanium Volumeslider module or can give me tips for doing so? It would be a great help.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
<p>Mac OS X 10.10.2 Titanium SDK 3.5.0.GA</p>

<p>No guarantees that it works. Its a 4 year old repo. Even its author abandoned it (or it was just written so gosh darn well it never needed updating).</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Stephen - I&#39;ll give it a go later (it&#39;s too early on Sunday morning here in the UK to think straight right now!)<br>As I said in my question I was surprised that the module still worked up until now too. It&#39;s a handy one as it links in with the device volume controls and I&#39;m not aware that can be done within Ti otherwise.</p>
