							<div><p>I have the same issue and this is the second time in a row that an upgrade has caused problems. I accepted the prompt to upgrade to 1.4.1.1 (from 1.4.1) and when I try to launch projects in the simulator it just gets to a certain point and stops without launching the simulator. I deleted the projects from Titanium Developer and imported them again but they still wouldn&#39;t launch. Switched the projects to use 1.4.1 again and now they will launch in the simulator. So how do I get my projects to use the latest upgrades and prevent this from happening in the future?</p>
<p>I&#39;m just learning how to develop for the iPhone and this is really frustrating. I gotta say that when I was evaluating Titanium vs Phonegap and Sencha the one knock that came up was Titanium Developer and how flakey it is. I&#39;m not giving up on your product yet but please tell me what I&#39;m doing wrong.</p>

							<div><p>Update to my comment in case a noob like me is having this issue. I resolved it by going into the build-&gt;iphone directory in my projects and deleting the contents. Don&#39;t delete the iphone folder just the contents in that folder. Then launch your project in Ti Developer. It will rebuild and it should open the simulator.</p>

							<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t have any issues after upgrading to 1.4.1.1.  I was having an issue installing the app on phone using 1.4.1.  Usually I clear the build files in build&#x2F;iphone directory when ever I upgrade the sdk.</p>
<p>Did you try that?</p>

										<p><p>Removed the build but same issue. I had this issue a while back.</p>
<p>I have deleted teh project and imported it again.<br>I have download my Provision from apple and selected the new one</p>
<p>I think I could do with removing everything and starting from scratch. Is it easy to remove everything and start over?</p>

							<p>Are you using the same Mac?  If not,  you need to export the developer&#x2F;distribution certificate&#39;s private key from the key chain of the old mac  and install it on the current one.  </p>
