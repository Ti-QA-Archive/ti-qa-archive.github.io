			<h1>How do Local Notifications work?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>i waited very long for local Notification to be included in 1.5.<br>Now that 1.5 is released i find it very hard to get any information on local Notifications.</p>
<ul>
<li>i searched Q&amp;A</li>
<li>i checked Kitchen Sink</li>
<li>i checked API Docs</li>
</ul>
<p>Local Notification are scheduled by</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Titanium<span class="hljs-class">.App</span><span class="hljs-class">.iOS</span><span class="hljs-class">.scheduleLocalNotification</span>
</code></pre><p>using following example, i get no errors and Notification should happen in 2 Minutes (The Alert confirms my timing).</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var <span class="hljs-built_in">now</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">Date</span>();
<span class="hljs-built_in">now</span>.setMinutes(<span class="hljs-built_in">now</span>.getMinutes() + <span class="hljs-number">2</span>);
alert(<span class="hljs-built_in">now</span>);

Titanium.App.iOS.scheduleLocalNotification({
alertBody:<span class="hljs-string">"Are you sure ?"</span>,
alertAction:<span class="hljs-string">"Launch!"</span>,
userInfo:{<span class="hljs-string">"Hello"</span>:<span class="hljs-string">"World"</span>},
<span class="hljs-built_in">date</span>:<span class="hljs-built_in">now</span>
});
</code></pre><p>Well, after 2 minutes running on device or Simulator nothing happens.<br>I checked this with 1.5.1 and nightly 1.5.2.<br>I was expecting a nice popup Box.</p>

							<p>Not sure what the problem is but the sample in Kitchen Sink works fine.<br>Did you try the exact same code ?</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in">var</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">date</span> = <span class="hljs-literal">new</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">Date</span>();

    alertBody:<span class="hljs-string">"Kitchen Sink was put in background"</span>,
    alertAction:<span class="hljs-string">"Re-Launch!"</span>,
    userInfo:{<span class="hljs-string">"hello"</span>:<span class="hljs-string">"world"</span>},
    sound:<span class="hljs-string">"pop.caf"</span>,
    <span class="hljs-built_in">date</span>:<span class="hljs-literal">new</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">Date</span>(<span class="hljs-literal">new</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">Date</span>()<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>getTime() + <span class="hljs-number">3000</span>) <span class="hljs-comment">// 3 seconds after backgrounding</span>
});
</code></pre><p>Is you code included in a javascript file (bg.js) called in background service using the code below ?</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    var <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">service</span> = <span class="hljs-title">Ti</span>.App.iOS.registerBackgroundService(</span>{
        url:'bg.js'
        });
</code></pre><p>My problem is that I can&#39;t manage to call a function instead of having the alert message (but that&#39;s a different issue).</p>

										<p><p>No, i am not using any backgroundService Code. My understanding of Local Notifications based on IOS SDK is that after you schedule a Notification, IOS takes care of the Rest. So, the Notification should happen even when the App is closed and not running in background.</p>

							<p>I need to cancel a specific Notification which was already scheduled.</p>
<p>The API Docs show &quot;Titanium.App.iOS.cancelLocalNotification - cancel a specific local notification&quot;.<br>How does this work? Is there a way to retrieve scheduled Notifications and cancel a specific for example by ID?</p>
<p>IOS SDK does have this function.</p>

										<p><p>I think I found a workaround. When I close the application (using background service), I cancel all notification using         <code>Ti.App.iOS.cancelAllLocalNotifications();</code><br>Then, I get all the objects for which I need to set a notification, and create new notifications for each of them. That seems to works correctly.</p>

							<p>I don&#39;t see the local notifications either. I am setting the time correctly. The application is then put in the background. I don&#39;t see any notifications when the time comes.</p>
<p>I have implemented a local notification on the android using a native module and that works like a charm. I am wondering if I should do the same for iPhone instead of using Titanium&#39;s undocumented and untested API.</p>

							<p>In Kitchen Sink, there is some code at the end of app.js to call the background service.<br>Then there is a bg.js file which calls the Notification.</p>
<p>one question: before raising a notification, do you do any other checks ? I mean do you call any other function before raising an alert or increase the badges ? I don&#39;t get where to include some code before deciding if I need to raise a notification.</p>

							<p>I also have a question regarding local notifications.</p>
<p>I managed to have my notifications fire whatever the state of the application but I want to fire an event when the user slides and the app opens after a notification occurs.</p>
<p>But for now my app just opens and that&#39;s all, how I can catch this action?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>I am still having difficulties with this. I can&#39;t get the any alert to popup with the exact code posted above in the simulator or on the device. I suspect it&#39;s an issue with the timezone. Can anyone help?</p>
