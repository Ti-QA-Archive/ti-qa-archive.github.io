			<h1>Desktop Packaging - No space left on device</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am just about to release my desktop system and I got this message: </p>
<p>&quot;Packaging failed with message: No space left on device&quot;. </p>
<p>I have not change any code from the last time I packaged the app. I also created an entirely new project with no code and got the same message when packaging. Any help to fixing this would be appreciated.</p>

							<div><p>Thanks Sean for the ticket insight. My understanding is that if you complile on the specific platform then you can grabe the runtime from the dist directory in build. This only works with that particular platform though. So to deploy on 3 platforms you have to have the three operating systems with the source on each of them along with titanium. I also think that the runtime is unfortunately without the installer. So there is no license agreement phase. If someone has more insight please put in your comments. Thanks.</p>
