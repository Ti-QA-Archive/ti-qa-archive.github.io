			<h1>Titanium Support for Facebook Style Side Navigation</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi there…can anyone tell me if Titanium has a control &#x2F; support for the new side navigation that has become popular with the new generation of apps such as Facebook, which has the three bars at the top, that open the side navigation, that slides in &#x2F; out of view?  Twitter also uses this to provide levels of navigation as the user traverses through tweets&#x2F;users.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help&#x2F;guidance.</p>
<p>Chris</p>

							<p>Thank you so much for the quick answer…so this isn&#39;t built in support I am assuming, but needs to be added via a plugin?</p>

										<p><p>Not built in. But then, one huge advantage of Titanium is the ease with which it can be extended.</p>

										<p><p>This is not a native ui element that is made available by the OS, it is something that someone built. So the support is that you are able to build it yourself.</p>

							<p>Hey Christopher,</p>
<p>Maybe this will help put you on the right path. </p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;3894108</p>
<p>Its an example of how to do it, so you&#39;ll want to tailor it to your needs. Works for iOS. for android, went a different route and I use a view which comes in, as oppossed to the window sliding over. hope this helps</p>
