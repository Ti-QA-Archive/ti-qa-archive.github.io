			<h1>IOS Multiple Build and Deploy Issue</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am not sure if this problem is directly related to Titanium or not. I am having an issue where I am constantly having to rebuild my iOS projects to get them to replace the app that is on my test phone. My normal routine is to delete the app off of the phone, delete the app out of iTunes, and then build the project. I always save my changes before building and I also have the auto save changes when building checked. Almost 99% of the time I have to rebuild the app again to make the changed app sync over to the phone. Has anyone else experienced this issue? Or does anyone know of a secret iOS trick that I am not aware of?</p>

							<div><p>the latest version of iTunes has been popping up more dialogs for me when building directly to device than I ever remember in the past.</p>
<p>I also tend to push out over adHoc via testflight which offers roll back to previous builds without actually need to change code and roll back.</p>

							<p>I using Titanium Studio, build: 3.0.1.201212181159 on OS X 10.8.2 with iTunes 11.0.1. It is now to the point where I don&#39;t have to delete the app out of iTunes every time. Now I just have to build and deploy my project twice before I see the changes occur on the device. Has anyone else had this experience? I know my mac is up to date with all of the current updates.</p>

							<p>Sorry for the late reply. Yes, I have to build the project twice to see the change on the iPhone everytime I make a change. It&#39;s gotten to the point to where I have built in an alert that pops up at the beginning of my app so that I know what build number I am on. Very strange issue. The only thing that seems to work is that after two builds the changes are always there. The studio and app work great, it&#39;s just an inconvenience to build and deploy twice.</p>
