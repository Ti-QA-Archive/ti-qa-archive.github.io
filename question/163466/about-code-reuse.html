			<h1>About Code Reuse</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Dear Appceleator,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve noticed that the code reuse in Appcelerator platform is about 60% to 90%. I&#39;d like to know, what can be done with the 10% to 40% of the code that is not reused. Do we have to code in a native languaje?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>
<p>Carlos Diaz</p>

							<p><code>What factors make the code, not to be reused in 100%?</code></p>
<p>Let&#39;s stop and think about this a little bit.  You have an iphone and you have a nexus5.  You want a buttonbar on your iphone, but the nexus5 doesnt support this component.  How are you going to reuse your code? You cant.  So for THAT element, you have some seperate ti code for a different ui look&#x2F;feel for android.</p>
<p>No, you do not HAVE to know the underlying native language, provided you stay within what the sdk offers.  If you stray, want extended additional features, hardware support, etc, you can extend titanium through native modules.</p>
<p>Now, as for you numbers.</p>
<p>Pathetically poor programmers get worse reuse than quality programmers.  In our shop, we are pushing 95-100% reuse of non-ui code.  Our UI code is pushing 80%.  The other 20% comes from native android&#x2F;ios look and feel.</p>

										<p><p>I wonder if the question goes in a slightly different direction if so - here is a supplement to maybe answer that.</p>
<p>If you have read that re-use is 60-90% but have not yet actually started using the platform fully you might think that it means the remaining 10%-40% is not using Titanium.</p>
<p>Everything you write inside a Titanium app is JavaScript with the Titanium API and optionally the Alloy framework.  When it says 60-90% of the code is re-usable  it means that you do not have to write different code for each platform to achieve the same end result.</p>
<p>However as Stephen points out the differences between iOS and Android (for example) mean that the two platforms do not always have equivalent elements.  They both have table views, buttons, switches, views and labels for example.  However Android has an ActionBar that iOS does not, iOS has popovers and buttons bars that Android does not.</p>
<p>This is where the remaining 10-90% comes in.  Sometimes the Titanium API to call each thing even when they are the same basic object may have more or less properties than the other.  They may not visually look or act exactly the same either.</p>
<p>This is cross platform developments - and not as some think a unified solution that only supports common objects and tries to fake those that are not native on each.</p>
<p>As Stephen says you can always dive into custom module creation to leverage platform specific features that may not be available within the Titanium API - but that is your choice, but not required unless you want to.</p>

<ol>
<li>What factors make the code, not to be reused in 100%?</li>
<li>What do I have to do with the 10% to 40% of the code that is not reused. Do I have to know each native languaje (iOS, Android, Windows, etc) to program that parts?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

										<p><p>-1 as this should have been a comment not an answer and is about a 40% repeat of the original question.  Need to work on your code reuse.</p>
