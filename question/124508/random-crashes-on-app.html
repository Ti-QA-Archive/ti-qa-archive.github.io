			<h1>Random Crashes on App</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello, I&#39;ve built a pretty substantial app for iOS using Titanium. It consists of a tab group with five sections and involved pulling a lot of data from HTTP requests as well as taking pictures and uploading them to Flickr. I have everything working smoothly and even have a nice custom design across the entire thing. However the app will sometimes randomly crash after navigating several windows (or especially when the device is locked for awhile). </p>
<p>In simulator, it crashes with a null error and putting printouts after majors steps seems to show that the most troublesome processes (like pulling and parsing an XML document into a table view) crash at different points every time. I feel it must be a memory, variable scope, or HTTP request problem but since everything works most of the time I&#39;m fairly stumped.</p>
<p>I guess the most useful thing would be any suggestions for good program design&#x2F;structure, performance optimization and performance tracking tools that work with Appcelerator&#x2F;XCode.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m printing the available memory to the window title every second and it&#39;s showing anywhere between 15-36mb free memory until it decides to randomly crash, sometimes with input, sometimes without (input as in, interaction with the app).</p>
<p>This is worrying. There&#39;s no legitimate reason for it to happen, there&#39;s no special processing going on, the screen is sitting idle and it crashes randomly.</p>
<p>I&#39;m looking at a broken system effectively, what sort of solution can there be for this? I&#39;ve tried all the memory pool freeing techniques but little is showing to help.</p>

							<p>Is anyone from Appcelerator seeing this thread, can you please comment on it, or better, resolve this random crashing? It&#39;s an issue I am witnessing with a variety of different code bases - all unique to each other!</p>

										<p><p>If it is crashing in the simulator:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the Console App (should be in the utilities folder) and browse to the Diagnostic And Usage Information&#x2F;User Diagnostic report</li>
<li>Find the thread that crashed</li>

										<p><p>Thanks for that, would you like me to post the entire crash log (at least one of them anyway).. Anything I need to remove or conceal? This application is under NDA so it&#39;s important that nothing identifiable is usable in the log. Can you advise what you need from it please? Thanks very much for the help</p>

<p>I am curious to see if this contains anything that I have seem before or not.</p>
