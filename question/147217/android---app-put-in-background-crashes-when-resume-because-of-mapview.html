			<h1>Android - App put in background crashes when resume because of MapView</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My app is using a single simple mapview. When the app is put in background, resuming it causes crashes and the stacktrace is showing the usual message &quot;only one mapview in android&quot;.<br>On others app, I have no pb with the mapview and all.</p>
<p>I will try to listen to the different events but I&#39;m not understanding why that happens.</p>
<p>Any ideas ? Thanks !</p>

							<div><p>Thanks, but the code isn&#39;t really what I wanted, I just was asking if anyone has issues like this or if I was missing a concept.<br>the code is basically a commonjs module instanciating a window, with the map that has annotations, that&#39;s all (really simple).</p>

							<p>Hi Florent,</p>
<p>As per the message  &quot;only one mapview in android&quot;, I feel you are trying to create another instance of mapView when the app come to foreground. In android only 1 instance of mapview is possible per application. Hence, you need to remove previous instance of mapView before having a new 1.</p>

										<p><p>Hi !<br>Thank for replying. I already know that on Android you can&#39;t have more than one map at a time, that&#39;s why i said &quot;the usual message&quot;.<br>I was more asking if it was a concept i was missing (like when the app is put in the background, maps are memory flushed?) but this don&#39;&#39;t happen in any other app i&#39;ve been doing.<br>Thank you !</p>
