							<p>You cannot directly use classes from a JAR file inside a Titanium application. Titanium relies on JavaScript, so it makes sense that Java classes contained in your JAR file won&#39;t work.</p>
<p>That being said, there <strong>is</strong> a way to use native Java classes inside a Titanium application. You can achieve that by developing a native extension module. But doing so requires deep knowledge of the Titanium platform as well as the native platform itself.</p>
<p>So, to sum up, you need to code your functionality using JavaScript if you want it in your app.</p>

										<p><p>I just saw one of similar questions which were asked before. You have given the same ans there too. I came to know that you have to include it in the lib&#x2F;  in the module. Right now im just learning how to develop apps and use modules and my instructor asked me to do this, so checking out how to get it done.</p>

										<p><p>Now i have one more question. I have copied the jar file into the lib&#x2F; folder in some module and then built the module for some particular app. Now how do I call some specific method from some X class in the jar file?<br>I have searched online forums and that suggested me to import package and all. But here if i use import it shows Syntax error:unexpected reserved word. What to do?</p>
