							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Yes it was, the automatic system that would alert Appcelerator to the issue unfortunately failed.</p>
<p>The problem also affected the Q&amp;A and main site.  Having just woken up and spotted the site down - a quick tweet to Appcelerator and they were on it.  Less than 10 minutes later everything was back up.</p>
<p>A quick tweet next time to @appcelerator works wonderfully.</p>

										<p><p>As you know the Q&amp;A is for help solving a problem or determining where the problem might be.  In this case the problem was unfortunately with the servers at Appcelerator.  Coincidently there was a scheduled update last night.</p>
<p>The reason I am saying tweet is that there is nothing that the Q&amp;A can do in this situation - beyond our control - we have no access to those servers.</p>
<p>Do you consider this question answered - at least as much as it is possible?</p>

										<p><p>Excellent.</p>
<p>Quick tip; next time - please do not create a new answer when your contribution is actually a comment - it confuses things in the future when trying to work out relevance, simply add a comment to the answer it is related to, or if the additional information is a follow up to the question or general information then add it as a comment to your own question at the top.  You are NOT being told off.</p>

										<p><p>I also created a tweet to AppC, but currently, Login doesn&#39;t work. I think it&#39;s better to stick to twitter concerning this issue.</p>
