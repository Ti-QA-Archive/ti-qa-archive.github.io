			<h1>XML - createHTTPCLient  and tracing connection issues</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am having a very strange issue, I am looking for a way to trace what is going on so I can figure this out.  Here is the issue.</p>
<p>I am attempting to access an XML document, retrieve it and parse the information ! Easy enough.  Our site has two separate environments TEST and PROD.  when I run the code and attempt to connect to the TEST instance, everything works as planned.  However when trying against our PROD system I get an error and can not connect to the server.  To be specific, using:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">directoryXHR.onerror = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span></span>{
    alert(<span class="hljs-string">'STATUS: '</span> + <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.status);
}
</code></pre><p>returns: 0;</p>
<p>The XML on each server is identical, with no differences and trying to access ANYTHING on the PROD server results in not being able to connect.  The two URL&#39;s I am trying to use are.</p>
<p>TEST:<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;test.server.com:1234&#x2F;test&#x2F;xml.file?api=test</p>
<p>PROD:<br>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;test.nicholls.edu:4567&#x2F;PROD&#x2F;xml.file?api=prod</p>
<p>So the only differences are the fact that PROD is using https and a different port. So I investigated this issue, I changed test to use SSL and the same port and I was able to connect just fine.  So at that point I checked firewalls and everything to rule out all issues.  This happens when testing on both the device and the simulators.  I also verified that I can hit these sites from a web browser, when accessed from a web browser there is NO issues connecting to either the TEST or PROD file.  I did a HTTP Header trace and nothing is different between the two sites.  I can connect from a web browser on my OS. but I can not make the connection from the program.</p>
<p>Now I am at a severe roadblock.  Any Ideas what might be going on or how I might get a more detailed trace of the problem???</p>

							<p>I cant reach ether URL, and you have not provided any code sample so its hard to answer your question, but my guess would be some odd server issue</p>

							<p>Well links and names were changed to protect the innocent lol, but its the same structure.  The code is exactly the same for connecting to either all I am doing is changing the URL.  It works for the test Link and not for the Prod link.  I also just for kicks tried accessing the URL from mobile safari and BOTH sites gave me the XML file.  Very strange.  Just really wondering if there is a more detailed way to trace what is going on?</p>

										<p><p>0 - so it appears as if it is not connecting to the server.  I get the same code even if I try to pull down another page from the server.</p>

										<p><p>sorry, but this issue is just too specific to your exact case, I would double check my url for typos, but other then that I am forced to guess it is somehow the server</p>
