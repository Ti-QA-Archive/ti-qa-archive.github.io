			<h1>Ho wto reset the getArguments() value</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am using the Ti.App.getArguments() on the &quot;resumed&quot; Event Listener to retrieve data from an Custom URL handler.</p>
<p>It Works perfectly but once I got the data from the getArguments() I want to reset the data in the Arguments.</p>
<p>Is there anyway to reset the getArguments() value?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>Not that I have found.  What I now do is save the value when the app first launches, and during the pause event.  If the value is the same during the resumed event, I treat it as if the user resumed the application as opposed to another launch from the browser or other application.</p>
<p>This is not accurate, but I have not figured out a way to determine whether the resumed event is due to a user resume or a custom URL launch that repeats the same URL string as the previous launch.  For my purposes, it will come close enough for government work.</p>
<p>YMMV.</p>

										<p><p>Exactly Doug, that&#39;s is what I am doing. The better way would be to reset the arguments, which I don&#39;t know how to do. But what you mentioned is kinda the solution I have implemented.</p>

							<p>So following your logic you could than append an additional random variable to your external website with the url schema which would tell your app that a new call has been made:</p>
<p>e.g. setting a random string value at the end of your url schema by using since unix epoch;</p>
<p>myapp:&#x2F;&#x2F;?r=RANDOM_STRING_HERE</p>
<p>This ofcourse would still leave the addressbook calls (e.g.) to your app unnoticeable, because they can&#39;t have a dynamic changing variable appended. </p>

										<p><p>Assuming you control the caller, that can help keep each launch due to a custom URL unique.  If you then saw the same value as last time, you could conclude the &quot;resumed&quot; event was due to a user bringing the application back to the foreground.  Not a bad idea – provided you control the callers or can convince the callers to add a random string.</p>
