			<h1>How to develop a totally free commercial app with appcelerator and other questions related</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I&#39;m totally new to appcelerator and wanted to know everything about licensing before I start.<br>I have no money so I can&#39;t think about paying a penny nowadays and I don&#39;t want any surprise later. Maybe I can start paying a license after, but not now.</p>
<p>That said here are my questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I&#39;ve read this in Q&amp;A: &quot;Development that happens under the “App Explore” product (i.e., the free version). Usage of the Appcelerator platform (Titanium Mobile SDK, Titanium Studio, Analytics and Cloud Services) at this level is permitted for all applications, both commercial and free, with no financial obligation to Appcelerator.&quot; So… if i download and install Titanium Studio and i don&#39;t use Analytics or Cloud services (considering the limits that are edstablished for the use of these two features in the pricing page) will I still have any kind of financial obligation to Appcelerator?</p>
</li>
<li><p>My app needs push notifications so… is there any way to implement them in my app other than the appcelerator cloud service? I’ve read a couple of posts about this and I guess it’s possible, but, will this again bring me any financial obligation with appcelerator?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks in advance for your time.</p>

							<p>You&#39;ve answered your own question both in the post in which you asked it and the first answer that you gave. Which reminds me, please use the comment system when commenting on your own question unless you&#39;ve found the answer to your original question and are posting it. </p>
<p>That said, the answer is given in the post that you&#39;ve quoted. If you&#39;re dev remains under the App Explore, in your case no analytics and no cloud services, then you are using the free product. </p>
<p>As for push notifications, there are a number of services that allow you to implement push notifications, a couple of those services have modules in our Marketplace, very few services offer x-platform push, and all of them will charge you for any usage of the service over the free trial. The services that have modules in the Marketplace are UrbanAirship and Parse. If you want to send push notifications completely free, you&#39;ll have to roll your own solution using something like EasyAPNS. Of course, this isn&#39;t totally free either as you&#39;ll need the server to have to develop what you need yourself. Check them out, and find what works best for your needs. Regardless of which of these other solutions you decide to go with, they do not come with a financial obligation to Appcelerator, they will come with the financial obligation to whichever service you decide to use.</p>

							<p>Why am i getting negative votes?</p>
<p>Is it so obvious that there isn&#39;t a way to develop such an application with appcelerator for free or it&#39;s just totally the opposite?</p>
<p>I posted this mainly because i read this other post:<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;142516&#x2F;warning-licensing-of-titanium-chaotic-and-unclear-how-to-avoid-extortionate-fees</p>
