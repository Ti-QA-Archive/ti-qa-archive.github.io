			<h1>App badge not updating on push notification</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>While testing push notifications I&#39;ve found that badge property which seems to be properly included in the push notification, does not update the app badge icon.  The value is an integer value.  I&#39;ve also made sure when calling registerForPushNotifications that Ti.Network.NOTIFICATION_TYPE_BADGE is included in the types array.  Lastly I&#39;ve confirmed in the Settings -&gt; Notifications that the app has Badge App Icon on.</p>
<p>Any advice on what I might be missing when receiving the push notification that the app badge is not updated?  Here&#39;s the raw data displayed from the callback.</p>
<p>{alert:&quot;Alert message&quot;, &quot;sound&quot;:&quot;default&quot;, &quot;badge&quot;:6,&quot;aps&quot;:{&quot;badge&quot;:6,&quot;sound&quot;:&quot;default&quot;,&quot;alert&quot;:&quot;Alert message&quot;}}</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>You may be experiencing the same thing I did a while back.  You are including a badge value but it does not show - at least &quot;some&quot; times it does not show.</p>
<p>For me the issue turned out to be something simple; the badge would automatically be set, but only if the app was in the background.</p>
<p>If you are app is in the foreground then your code is handling the push notification alert thus you are handling the call back where you receive the badge value and YOU are required to set the badge.</p>
<p>As I understand it - as the app is in the foreground when the push notification is received - you may have set the badge due to other events.  If the push notification also set the badge - they may very well be different.  So it leaves it to you to decide if you should set the badge the value in the push notification object.</p>
<p>An example when this would be seen, in an email app you have new emails - the badge shows how many emails there are unopened.  You get two new emails and a push to tell you there are two new emails, but you had already seen there were new emails before the push made it to you and already read them - the badge now says nothing - but an automatic push badge would set it back to 2 - but this way you can tell it not to.</p>
<p>As you have shown you have access to the badge data in the object, so you simply set your apps badge to that value - something like this;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">Ti</span><span class="hljs-class">.UI</span><span class="hljs-class">.iPhone</span><span class="hljs-class">.setAppBadge</span>(<span class="hljs-tag">push</span><span class="hljs-class">.badge</span>);
</code></pre>

										<p><p>Thanks for the idea that the badge won&#39;t display while the app is in the foreground, unfortunately that&#39;s not the issue in my case.  As I noticed that the push callback get&#39;s called immediately, if the app is open.  All my tests are with the app not running.</p>
