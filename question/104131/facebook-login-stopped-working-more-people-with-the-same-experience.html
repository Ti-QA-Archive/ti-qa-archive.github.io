			<p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>I love appcelerator and us it for a Iphone app which connects to Facebook. </p>
<p>I run Ti.version.1.5.1 against an old 3.1.3 iOS SDK, and had a working Facebook connect &#x2F; login button (Titanium.Facebook.XXX) button. I implemented this Facebook connect part over a month ago and had it running without any problems, it was really cool to see it working, sharing stuff on my wall. Yeaj! </p>
<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>However now I find that my FBlogin is not working anymore, and I didn&#39;t change anything about this specific code, nor the iOS SDK, nor the Ti.version (1.5.1) . </p>
<p>Visually it looks like the Connect menu pop&#39;s up, shows the loading indicator (depending on which Ti.version) and closes again. (At that point the Ti.Facebook.createLoginButton fires a &#39;Cancel&#39; event)</p>
<p>I reckon it has something todo with recent API changes on the Facebook side (around 7 januari 2011). However while debugging I noticed that FBlogin kept on working in Kitchensink, even after rebuilding it.</p>
<p>Here is my all to regular code snippet, which used to work:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">fbButton = Titanium.Facebook.createLoginButton({
        <span class="hljs-string">'apikey'</span>:<span class="hljs-string">'&lt;APP ID&gt;'</span>,
        <span class="hljs-string">'sessionProxy'</span>:<span class="hljs-string">'&lt;SESSION PROXY&gt;'</span>
    });
</code></pre><p>I also tried it with the less secure method, which obviously also used to work.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> fbButton = Titanium.Facebook.createLoginButton({ 
    <span class="hljs-string">'style'</span>:<span class="hljs-string">'normal'</span>, 
    <span class="hljs-string">'apikey'</span>:<span class="hljs-string">'&lt;APP ID&gt;'</span>, 
    <span class="hljs-string">'secret'</span>:<span class="hljs-string">'&lt;API SECRET&gt;'</span>
});
</code></pre><p>Just mentioning this again: both methods worked like 1 month ago or so. </p>
<p><strong>What did I do to debug:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tried switching to the Kitchensink API credentials: did not work</li>
<li>Rebuild the Kitchensink App: FBlogin does still work</li>
<li>Changed the Kitchensink fbcredentials to my app and another rebuild: FBlogin <em>does</em> work (!)</li>
<li>Created an empty new project (with the regular default files) in Titanium with my app&#39;s FBcredentials only running the FBloginbutton: did <em>not</em> work</li>
<li>Changed credentials in this empty project to Kitchensink&#39;s FBcredentials: did <em>not</em> work either</li>
<li>Deleted the APPDIR&#x2F;build&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;build&#x2F;* contents as well for almost everything</li>
</ul>
<p>In short: pretty weird. In the old Kitchen Sink it keeps on working.</p>
<p><strong>My questions</strong></p>
<p>Would be great if you have any experiences here, or tips on how to debug more… </p>
<p>The FBlogin &#x2F; Titanium Developer App doesnt return any clues in the logfield. (even on &#39;INFO&#39; level it doesnt return any information)</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you have any tips on further debugging or maybe had the same experience?</li>
<li>Are there any logs written on the backside by Titanium</li>
<li>I&#39;m on mac, do you have a tip on good network monitoring software, to get some clues on what&#39;s happening between the Iphone Simulator and Facebook site?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks very much in advance,<br>Would love to finish this app. and show it to you all!</p>
<p>Greetings from Amsterdam, Roeland</p>

							<p>One relevant question. Does your app &quot;disconnects&quot; from facebook after sometime when running? I&#39;ve noticed that if I keep it running the login button is in &quot;connected mode&quot; but if I kill it and run it after a few hours the login button is in &quot;connect with facebook mode&quot;. I&#39;m using my the fb session proxy taken off the web and changed only appkey related info. I&#39;ve tested KitchenSink on my device (running 4.1) along my own app and I see that it doesn&#39;t disconnect (or at least takes longer - currently monitoring how long). Any ideas? </p>

										<p><p>Well I think that is the correct behaviour: FB.login button would trigger a check to see if you are currently connected, or did previously connect with this appsecret and gave the permissions. </p>
<p>If you in that case, would &#39;kill it&#39; as you mention I don&#39;t see what you mean. Logging out or just killing the application? Killing the app would still give you upon restart and a render of an FBlogin button the &#39;Logged in&#39; state.</p>
<p>As I mention in my other comment, it suddenly worked again. Now its very flakey, sometimes it works, sometimes it takes ages. And the webview for facebook&#39;s share to wall misses the CSS of facebook.</p>
