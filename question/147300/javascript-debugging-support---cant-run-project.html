			<h1>Javascript debugging support - can&#39;t run project</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I just upgraded my Studio and project to latest TI, and now whenever I try to run my project, I get the error message that Firefox can&#39;t be found, needed for debugging support. I just downloaded firefox but Ti still can&#39;t find it. I don&#39;t know Mac too well. How to I find out the installation location so I can tell Ti? And I&#39;m disturbed that my app won&#39;t even launch in the simulator now. After this message it just quits. Before the upgraded it worked fine.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Easier when you know how - so lets see if I can show you.</p>
<p>There are two main ways - either should sort you out.</p>
<p><strong>Global</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Select the <strong>Dashboard</strong> tab in Titanium Studio (should be large panel on right)</li>
<li>Select <strong>Get Started</strong> button (with a wrench icon - should be under your name)</li>
<li>Select <strong>Mobile Web</strong></li>
<li>Click <strong>here</strong> (middle of panel)</li>
<li>You should have a list of one or more browsers - first one being <strong>default system web browser</strong></li>
<li>If **Firefox is not listed<ul>
<li>choose <strong>new</strong></li>
<li>Enter <strong>Firefox</strong> in <strong>Name</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Browse</strong></li>
<li>Locate <strong>Firefox</strong> in the <strong>Applications</strong> folder (select <strong>applications</strong> on left and then look for <strong>FireFox</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>FireFox</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Open</strong></li>
<li>Leave <strong>Parameters</strong> blank</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If <strong>Firefox</strong> is listed - choose <strong>Edit</strong><ul>
<li>Use <strong>Browse</strong> to confirm it points to the right place</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong> (in the Edit box)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tick <strong>Firefox</strong></li>
<li>Choose <strong>OK</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Per App</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Select your project in <strong>project explorer</strong></li>
<li>Press the <strong>run</strong> icon from the top (green circled white play button with yellow folder)</li>
<li>Select <strong>Run Configurations</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong> Web Browser</strong> form the list on the left (at or close to the bottom)</li>
<li>If the triangle is pointing right - click it</li>
<li>Select <strong>Firefox</strong></li>
<li>Confirm <strong>Firefox</strong> is shown in <strong>browser executable</strong> </li>
<li>If not use the <strong>Browse</strong> and find it in the same way as shown previously</li>
<li>Select <strong>Apply</strong></li>
<li>Choose <strong>Close</strong> to dismiss window, or</li>
<li>Choose <strong>Run</strong> to dismiss the window and run the app in Firefox.</li>
</ul>
<p>That should do you - I think I got all the steps right.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, I&#39;ll try that as soon as I get back to my mac. But I am confused, because my app is an iPad app – so it has nothing to do with the browser, right? I was careless not to mention that in my original post. Does that fact change your answer? Many thanks.</p>

										<p><p>I read your question - where you said &quot;Firefox can&#39;t be found, needed for debugging support&quot;, thus I have provided you with the means to get Firefox support.  The statement &quot;..won&#39;t even launch in the simulator now.&quot; appeared to be a throw away follow up.</p>
<p>If you are having problems getting the simulator to work - then yes we need to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>As Titanium support Android, iPhone&#x2F;iPad, blackberry and Mobile web (which uses Firefox) and your tags mentioned &quot;firefox&quot; &amp; &quot;mac&quot; but no mention if iPad or iOS - I naturally went done the &quot;mobile web&quot; and &quot;browser&quot; route.</p>
<p>Do not worry - it happens.</p>
<p>Whilst my walk-through x 2 above may not seem relevant now, do them anyway - so we can rules that out and then report back.  We can go from there.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, and sorry. It&#39;s the error message about firefox javascript debugger that is derailing the simulator from loading. After dismissing that message, everything just exits. It&#39;s so puzzling that TI wouldn&#39;t allow me to just skip javascript debugger and launch the simulator. Seems that should be a common scenario. Anyway, I&#39;ll try as soon as I get back to my mac.</p>

										<p><p>I figured it out. Somehow TI lost all configs for my project and assumed it was web. Once I re-set it up as an iPad project, all was good again. I have no idea why this happened.</p>
<p>@Malcolm: Thanks much for your thoughtful answer.</p>
