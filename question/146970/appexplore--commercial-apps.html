			<h1>AppExplore &amp; Commercial apps</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I guess many of you building your first applications or learning the technology have stumbled upon this. After careful reading on Appcelerator site I cannot find one single official statement that says that I can build commercial apps with AppExplore package</p>
<p>Can someone who has first hand information clarify this topic?</p>
<p>Regards,<br>Mario</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>To make it as clear as possible - because I do understand where you are coming from.</p>
<h1 id="yes-">YES…</h1>
<p>…you can create commercial apps with AppExplore</p>
<p>You do have to pay for any optional elements like ACS (cloud) usage over the current limits or custom modules or enhanced tech support (beyond the Q&amp;A), training, conferences and so on.</p>
<p>But if you create an app, put it in the store safe in the knowledge - no-one is coming is going to come after you for any money.</p>

										<p><p>@Thierry. As you can see that is only a proposal license agreement it is not the final license, more over it is not published on Appcelerator.com sitte. For me this is a good starting point but useless.</p>

<p>For others that follow this thread Mario found the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;legal&#x2F;appexplore-agreement">licence agreement</a> which should answer most questions.</p>

							<p>Hi Malcolm,</p>
<p>You are wrong, I am a pretty new developer to Appcelerator therefore I was not aware of these discussion. Don&#39;t you think that to make things absolutely crisp clear it would make sense that this license agreement was finally included in the Appceleratoe website? </p>
<p>For me having to dig through forums, q&amp;a boards to find a &quot;proposal license agreement&quot; is CRAP, come on! it is not even the final agreement. </p>
<p>If I am going to invest in a product (time and money) I need to know upfront what to expect and what I need to pay to use the tool.</p>
<p>Anyway thanks for your clarification.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>Mario</p>

										<p><p>A few things, and for those who read this afterwards know that Mario did realise this statement was wrong.</p>
<p>You say I am wrong; yet I stated the situation as it is - which is correct.  I stated I understood where you are coming from which is why I made it a clear simple answer.  You can have a different opinion but as I say I stated the fact.</p>
<p>You have been quick to put down something and not trust the answers of old experts and that is fine but ALL CAPS swearing is rarely met with love here.</p>
<p>Whilst it may have been hard to find the statement there is nothing to the contrary so you did not need to come down so negatively and certainly not so quick. </p>
<p>You are welcome here to the community, you will be treated well and answers will be given, some right, some wrong but most of the time you will end up with a solution from some very dedicated people giving their free time and effort.</p>
<p>So move on from the last few comments and start coding - the system is great and I as well as thousands and thousands of other have created great apps.</p>

										<p><p>Quick tip; please comment on answers rather than create a whole new answer which is really a comment - it makes it harder in the future to work out threads if answers scores change or other answers are added. (You are not being told off)</p>

										<p><p>Malcolm. Please accept my apologizes, not my intention to put down anyone. It was just my frustration with Appcelerator sales team which came out very quickly as they have not been able to give me a clear answer.</p>
