			<p>Hi all,<br>I&#39;ve recently downloaded Titanium, so I&#39;m very new to this framework, please don&#39;t blame me for &#39;stupid&#39; questions.<br>I&#39;ve installed on both Windows XP and Vista with the same problems.<br>1) The adb.exe command (Android tools) has been moved; I&#39;ve just copied it from &#39;platform-tools&#39; to &#39;tools&#39;, and now Titanium seems to be happy with it.</p>
<p>2) I&#39;ve downloaded and imported KichenSick, but when I try to run it into the Android emulator, I&#39;m unable to see the application while the emulator seems to work fine.</p>
<p>3) At this point, as suggest in the blog, I&#39;ve defined a simple, empty, application; but the same problem arises.</p>
<p>I&#39;m pretty sure I made a mistake somewhere, but I can not find it. Could you be so kind to point me in the correct direction ?<br>Thank you.<br>Fulvio</p>

<p>I can help you with this, but please let&#39;s deal with only one system at a time.</p>
<p>First, though, out of interest, which system showed the error, &quot;Error generating R.java from manifest&quot;?</p>
<p>So, let&#39;s leave XP for now, and concentrate on <strong>troubleshooting Vista</strong>. Be aware, however, that Vista is not officially supported by Titanium, as the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Titanium+Compatibility+Matrix#TitaniumCompatibilityMatrix-OperatingSystem">Compatibility Matrix</a> shows. Anyway, we will try…</p>
<p>Please follow the instructions at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Installing+on+Windows+7#InstallingonWindows7-InstallDiagnosticsforWindows">Install Diagnostics for Windows</a>. Copy the output and paste it to your preferred <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;">pastebin</a> service, and paste the link to it here. It&#39;s important that you do not modify it <strong>in any way</strong>, as this could mask problems with your configuration. Do <strong>NOT</strong> paste the actual code here! This is because the system will change the formatting.</p>
<p>Also, please create and share a screenshot of your android installed packages, using something like <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;imageshack.us&#x2F;">ImageShack</a></p>
<p>State your OS, and the processor and RAM installed to your system.</p>
<p>Lastly, run the command <code>systeminfo</code> at the commandline and share it in a pastebin.</p>
<p>Then I will help you further.</p>

										<p><p>Hello Paul<br>thank you for the suggestions.<br>I&#39;ve just saved all the outputs to the following link<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;hNb5R0n2</p>
<p>The Vista system (32 bit) runs inside VirtualBox on an Ubuntu 64 bit.<br>Vista &#39;sees&#39; two processors and 1Gb RAM<br>The reason why I&#39;ve tried on XP was because Vista is not supported and to avoid that the problem was related to the virtualization platform; but the problem is the same (which is really strange)<br>Regards<br>Fulvio</p>

										<p><p>OK, mostly your configuration seems OK, but you will need 1GB of contiguous memory to work with Titanium SDK 1.6.X+, so only 1GB of total memory will not be enough.</p>
<p>Also, please would you post a screenshot of your Android packages, as requested before.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>XP runs with 2Gb RAM on a physical machine (2 processors) and the problem is the same. By the way, about the android packages installation snapshot, do you need the list of directories ?<br>Cheers<br>Fulvio</p>

										<p><p>Fulvio, please - let&#39;s just stick to Vista at the moment. :)</p>
<p>Please raise the memory to 2GB for the Vista system.</p>
<p>I just need a screenshot of all your android packages installed, displayed by the Android AVD and Package Manager.</p>
<p>I won&#39;t be available until tomorrow, but if you provide this information I will help you further then.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>Ok, I&#39;ve taken a couple of snapshots. You may want to have a look at the following links :<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;img291.imageshack.us&#x2F;i&#x2F;androidinstalledpackage.jpg&#x2F;<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;img852.imageshack.us&#x2F;i&#x2F;androidinstalledpackage.jpg&#x2F;</p>
<p>I hope this is what you&#39;re looking for.<br>Please let me know if I can provide any further information.<br>In the meantime I&#39;ll try to increase the RAMn as you suggested.</p>
<p>Cheers<br>Fulvio</p>

										<p><p>Last note for this evening… With 2Gb RAM the problem is unchanged. Sorry<br>Perhaps the mistake is the &#39;tools&#39; directory of Android distribution where I copied missing adb.exe and libs.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have any of the enhanced Google APIs SDKs installed. These are described in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Getting+Started+with+Titanium#GettingStartedwithTitanium-PreparingforAndroiddevelopment">Preparing for Android development</a>. Without them, the KS will not work.  Hence, make sure your installed package list looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;img823.imageshack.us&#x2F;img823&#x2F;601&#x2F;screenshot221d.png" alt="screenshot"></p>
<p>Then delete all existing AVDs, restart Titanium Developer, ensure you have &quot;APIs 2.2&quot; selected on the &quot;Run Emulator&quot; screen, and then launch your app.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>Dear Paul, I did what you&#39;ve suggested, but nothing has changed yet.<br>Please find the snapshot at http:&#x2F;&#x2F;img268.imageshack.us&#x2F;i&#x2F;sdkupdated.jpg and<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;img29.imageshack.us&#x2F;i&#x2F;aniumconsole.jpg&#x2F;<br>I will check the whole installation again and, perhaps, I will start again from scratch.<br>I&#39;ll keep you informed.

<p>Please do not start again from scratch, as this will mean that we will have to start the troubleshooting process from scratch.  :&#x2F;</p>

<p>Your installed Android packages look fine. I still have a suspicion that it may be a memory issue. See the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Titanium+Compatibility+Matrix#TitaniumCompatibilityMatrix-TitaniumSDKMinimumMemory">Titanium SDK Minimum Memory</a> section of the Titanium Compatibility Matrix for an explanation. Are you able to raise the memory of your vista system to 3GB, just to make sure?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>Dear Paul, sorry for the delay.<br>I read about the amount of memory required by Titanium, and 1Gb is the minimun.<br>I already made a run with 2 Gb with no effect.<br>I believe that in case of memory shortage an error message shuld be seen.<br>In any case, just to be sure, I&#39;ve increased the memory at the maximum I can<br>in the virtualization. While the host machine has 4Gb of memory I cannot go further<br>2.8Gb.<br>Please find the link to the images about the memory configuration and usage<br>during the test.</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;img839.imageshack.us&#x2F;i&#x2F;mem1u.jpg&#x2F;</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;img263.imageshack.us&#x2F;i&#x2F;mem2b.jpg&#x2F;</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;img14.imageshack.us&#x2F;i&#x2F;mem3i.jpg&#x2F;</p>
<p>As you can see the Windows&#39; Task Manager shows about 1Gb<br>of used memory.<br>I wish to remind you that, in parallel, I run also the same installation and test<br>on a phisical XP box with 2Gb.</p>
<p>Am I the only one having problems with Titanium on Windows ?</p>
<p>Thanks<br>Fulvio</p>
