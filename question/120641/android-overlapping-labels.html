			<h1>Android: Overlapping labels</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a view with two labels inside of it. The two labels slightly overlap. The one on top has a zIndex one step higher than the one below it.</p>
<p>I had massive issues getting the one on top to even show (see this http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;120617&#x2F;android-some-elements-not-showing-until-you-change-them) but finally got it to show by changing the text after the window open event fires.</p>
<p>Anyway… but now the one on top is appearing below the other. Neither has a backgroundColor or backgroundImage set… nor does the view they are in for that matter. But the part of the top one that overlaps is blanked out as if the one below had a backgroundColor. If anything I think it should be the other way around, since the top one has a higher zIndex.</p>
<p>I tried setting the backgroundColor to transparent and the backgroundImage to none and that doesn&#39;t work either.</p>
<p>If this is relevant, there is a background Image set on a view below all of them, which is what appears to be showing.</p>
<p>Can labels not overlap on Android?</p>

<p>I regret to say that you will never get quality answers unless you create quality questions. In either of your tickets, you have not stated any of the information that is necessary in order for someone to help you. Hence, please provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Titanium SDK version you are using</li>
<li>the Android version you are using</li>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Contributing+to+Titanium#ContributingtoTitanium-CreatingGoodUsecases">a usecase</a> so that others can reproduce your issue</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have found a bug, then let&#39;s work together and get it properly-reported. However, I urge you to read <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Contributing+to+Titanium#ContributingtoTitanium-ParticipatingintheQ%26A">Participating in the Q&amp;A</a> before you create any more questions here.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<div><p>I would certainly love to provide the code; however, since my code is all wrapped up in the custom MVC framework… it&#39;s really anything but a simple copy&#x2F;paste here it is. I&#39;ll try to &quot;unravel&quot; my code and create some use cases, but with already spending hours trying to figure out how to work around these Android bugs really don&#39;t want to spend hours more to try to reproduce what I&#39;m having in a sterile environment (sans MVC layers).</p>
<p>As a developer realize that makes it difficult to debug… but frankly my primary reason in posting is not to report bugs. From what I&#39;ve seen it doesn&#39;t matter very much since I see so many Android bugs that I am encountering that others report in Q&amp;As over a YEAR ago and still aren&#39;t fixed. It doesn&#39;t give me much confidence that they will be fixed any time soon… so I am posting here (along with a ton of others since most Q&amp;A posts are about poor Android support) to try to find work arounds from others who have been there. </p>
<p>Sorry to be pissy… I love Appcelerator (when it works), but I am frustrated to see it advertised as supporting Android well as of Ti 1.6 and then seeing 1.7 RC still dozens of major issues reported a year ago.</p>
<p>And for what it&#39;s worth…. Ti SDK 1.6, Android 2.2, phone= HTC G2</p>
<p>I want to support you all and I&#39;m sure you hate me for being vocal about this. I want to become an Appcelerator advocate, paying customer, member of this community, code contributor, and huge supporter for years to come. But I&#39;d love to see some sort of acknowledgement that Android support is still incomplete and some sort of commitment to get them fixed ASAP so that we can feel confident developing app franchises on top of this platform. Getting Android support right should be far more important than getting on Blackberry, Win Phone 7, or even mobile. Can we hear that acknowledgement and commitment?</p>

							<p>My suggestion is to wrap a label with a view. That&#39;s the safest way to add labels.</p>

<p>A label <strong>is</strong> a view so, unless there is a bug (which would need to be reported), you should be able to layer labels without using an additional view.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>Not in all cases, but sometime I got something weird when using 2 labels in a view. Both in Android and iPhone. </p>
<p>Maybe i left something, I&#39;ll give it a try later. Thank you for the insight.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Didats, I hope my response was not discouraging.</p>
<p>What I meant was, this is not the intended behavior and so we should establish a simple usecase in order to prove whether a bug exists, and raise a ticket if necessary.</p>
<p>I hope you know what I mean. :)</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
