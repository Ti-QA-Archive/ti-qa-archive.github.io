			<h1>Alloy File Manger / Download Manager widget</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey folks. I am trying to track down a widget or module that enables an app to download and manage files (as well as open the files in other apps). I think the development is a bit beyond my skill set and I&#39;m hoping there something out there I can leverage. I haven&#39;t seen anything from my searches so I thought I would ask here. Has anyone come across something like this or created something they&#39;d want to share. I&#39;m willing to pay for it if it&#39;s not open source. </p>
<p>Thanks for the help.</p>

							<div><p>Apple&#39;s Human Interface Guidelines state that they don&#39;t want apps that force users to deal with files. The iOS platform is not supposed to be file-centric, like most desktop operating systems. There&#39;s a chance if you did write such an app that Apple would reject it from the app store. That said, Dropbox, Google Drive, and a few others do that sort of thing. So, they do let some such apps through.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know of any widgets or modules that would do what you want.</p>

							<p>Hey Tim. Thanks for the response. I appreciate it. though i&#39;m a bit confused because there are dozens and dozens of file download apps in the app store. Most them just download files. My app does other stuff but can benefit from file downloads as well. Just search &quot;file downloads&quot; in the app store. </p>
<p>Hopefully someone out there in the titanium community has created some sort of widget they&#39;d want to share or sell. </p>
<p>thanks again, </p>
<p>Dave</p>

							<p>I&#39;m amazed that no one has created a module for Downloader&#x2F;File Manager. I keep looking and never find any. I&#39;d think many apps would benefit from that functionality.</p>
