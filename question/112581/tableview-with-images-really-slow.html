			<h1>Tableview with images really slow</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>It appears the TableView with images is really slow. It seems to load all the rows first and then scrolling is enabled. So if you have 25 rows the end users has to wait till all the rows are being loaded.</p>
<p>This has started to happen after 1.5.X. We were using unique ids(using same ids would make the row to disappear) for each row and it was blazingly fast.</p>
<p>Two issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why does it seem to load the rows that are not within the active view.</li>
<li>Why isnt the table scrollable till all the rows are loaded.</li>
</ul>
<p>This issue is also visible in tweetanium.</p>
<p>Anyone else face this problem?</p>
<p>We were hoping 1.6 RC1 would fix this issue, no such luck.</p>

							<p>Doing the YQL+Flickr Kitchen Sink sample, I also notice a decrease in performance over and above 1.5.1, particularly in <em>perceived</em> performance.   I&#39;ll be looking into this along with my colleagues.   Here are some videos of me trying it out in the Android 2.2 Emulator:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;screencast.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;doqlxmKRjn8">Test with 1.5.1</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;screencast.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;RmaTKwjA54ji">Test with 1.6.X</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some notes about these tests:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I cleared the image cache (on the sdcard) before running them.  The first time they&#39;re fetched from Flickr they then end up in the cache.  After that point, as we scroll, they&#39;re being fetched from the cache.  When they come from the cache, they come <em>synchronously</em>, since they&#39;re already on the device.  When they come over the wire, they come asynchronously.  What I&#39;m noticing is that although the time to open a stream and load a bitmap locally versus remotely will obviously be faster, the <em>perceived</em> performance may suffer because it&#39;s synchronous (i.e., the opening of the stream, decoding of the bytes into a Bitmap and then placing the bitmap into the imageview, … all that is blocking if its synchronous).</p>
</li>
<li><p>This test is maybe not the greatest example, because the images from Flickr can be 20 or 30 k.  If you&#39;re putting 20-30k images in each row of a table – and those images are all from different sources – well that&#39;s probably going to suffer a bit.  That&#39;s because it&#39;s not so much the opening of a stream in and of itself that causes a stutter, but, rather, if a new memory allocation is required because of the <em>size</em> of the stream, then you&#39;ll definitely get a stutter.  The cardinal rule of &quot;smooth scrolling&quot; is: don&#39;t do anything that causes a new memory allocation.  That being said, I&#39;ve noticed some inefficiencies in our image loading (cache or otherwise) that might anyway cause a stutter, and I&#39;ll be looking primarily into that.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some other notes about caching and stuff, just for your interest and edification:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Our cache is not an &quot;image cache&quot;, per se, but an HTTP response cache (it&#39;s an implementation of java.net.ResponseCache).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Therefore its purpose is not to cache images in memory for quickest access, but rather simply to avoid multiple http downloads of the same, cache-able image.  In other words, if you have a table with 15 rows, each containing an ImageView showing the <strong>same</strong> image which is remote and fetched via http, the displaying of the first row would grab that image over the wire, whereas the displaying of the 2nd through 15th rows would grab it from the cache.  But each of those 2nd through 15th  rows still needs to open a stream and read the bitmap bytes – it&#39;s just that it in their case the fetching will be local rather than remote.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We&#39;ll be looking at <em>image caching</em> too, i.e., ways to cut down on opening streams and reading bytes, be they remote or local.  But nothing like that is slated for 1.6.0.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The recent tickets that I&#39;ve been working on (those 1.6.0 tickets someone mentioned above) are <em>not</em> performance-related.  They were to fix things that were absolutely broken in our http response cache implementation and in our ImageView.  They weren&#39;t related to TableView either (or only tangentially, in the sense that a TableView might use an ImageView).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Back to our http response cache: to take advantage of it (i.e., to avoid multiple downloads of the same image uri), you need to be sure the image is cacheable, i.e., the http response that sends the image is not sending &quot;Cache-Control: no-cache&quot; or something like that.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can &quot;watch&quot; images being downloaded to the cache.  From your OS&#39;s command line (terminal):</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="hljs">adb <span class="hljs-keyword">shell</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">cd</span> /sdcard/[your <span class="hljs-keyword">app</span>]/remote-image-cache
<span class="hljs-keyword">ls</span>
</code></pre><p>(The Android SDK&#39;s <code>platform-tools</code> folder will need to be in your PATH for <code>adb</code> to be accessed without a path.)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Feel free to delete files in that cache folder (<code>rm *</code>)  if you want to test having the images re-downloaded.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Of course once you&#39;re in that shell session and sitting in that folder, you can also use <code>ls -l</code> to see the size of the things being cached.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I can&#39;t promise right now that changes will be in time for 1.6.0 since I&#39;m not in a position to make that decision.   However I agree that this can&#39;t wait for 1.7.0, so if we miss 1.6.0 then we&#39;ll <em>probably</em> get a quick 1.6.1.  I emphasize <em>probably</em> because, again, I won&#39;t be the one making this decision.  I&#39;m just a lowly developer. ;)</p>

							<p>Looks like someone else has similar issues http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;110211&#x2F;tableview-performance-on-android</p>
<p>Can someone from the titanium mobile android team respond or look into this issue? Defeats the purpose of a native app with this kind of performance. Pls help.</p>

<p>I know for certain that the core team is looking into the issues with remote images, and the improvements are due in 1.6. See these <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32238-titanium-mobile&#x2F;tickets?q=tagged%3Aandroid+image+cache&amp;filter=">Android image cache tickets</a>.</p>

										<p><p>We are already running 1.6 RC1 - Not sure if the remaining fixes will address this issue. The scrolling problem still is an issue. Either ways we will try the continuous build tomorrow to see if there is any impact. Meanwhile I will ping @billdawson on twitter to see he has any insight on the same.</p>
<p>Kevin Whinery also mentioned that he was able to reproduce the issue on tweetanium as were we. Not sure if they nailed it as yet.</p>

<p>Yes, you are right; there is an outstanding ticket for this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32238-titanium-mobile&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;3004">#3004</a>, due for the 1.7.X release. Watch it to receive updates by email about its resolution.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

							<p>We&#39;re running 1.6RC1 w&#x2F;Android and having the same issue with images in a tableview.  When a row scrolls off the gui….when ya go back to it…it takes noticeable time for the image to repair – even though it was previously displayed.</p>
