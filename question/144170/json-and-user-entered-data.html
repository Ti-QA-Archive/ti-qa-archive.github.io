			<h1>JSON and User Entered Data</h1>

		<section>
			<p>I am creating a JSON file on a server that is downloaded by my app which for the most part works perfectly.  I am having lots of issues with parsing the JSON because of special characters in the user entered data.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>David</p>

							<p>How are you creating the JSON file on the server ?  Most languages will have a way of &#39;escaping&#39; the special characters so that they don&#39;t cause parsing problems.  You could also try adding a \ before the characters in question.</p>

										<p><p>I found a function called JSStringFormat which helped out.  The issue I have now is very strange.  My JSON object is about 5000 lines.  It validates properly at http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jsonlint.com&#x2F; but it errors when I try to parse it in my app.  Here is the weird part.  If I open the file and save it in titanium studio, it parses fine after that…  Once I rebuild the app, which downloads and replaces the JSON file, it will have parse errors again, until I open the file and save it.</p>
<p>Ideas?</p>

							<p>Sounds to me like there are some control characters still in your document.  Is the program that is creating the file adding carriage returns ?  Is the server linux ?  At a guess I bet that the program that creates the files is adding a carriage return&#x2F;line feed to the document.  To put it into jsonlint you must be opening it in an editor and using copy&#x2F;paste.  I bet the editor is converting the carriage returns&#x2F;line feed before you copy, as is Titanium studio when you save the file.</p>

										<p><p>I have figured out exactly what field is causing the issue.  It is a description field that is populated via text area on a website so there is no telling what type of characters the parser getting hung up on.  I am querying the database for the value and then putting it into my JSON text file on the webserver which is downloaded by my app.  I have 600 rows in this JSON text file and no way of knowing exactly what row and character is causing the issue.  All I have to do to get it to work is to open and save the document.  Can someone give me some guidance on what types of characters to search for?</p>

										<p><p>Finally figure it out.. It was a right single quote ascii char 146.  I dont understand why it was a problem but I found a string function for XML that converts the characters to HTML encoded versions and now it works fine.</p>
