			<h1>Where has &#39;Developer&#39; gone?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>After fighting with &#39;Studio&#39; for 2 days I want to give up and go back to &#39;Developer&#39;. Unfortunately part of my fight to get &#39;Studio&#39; working involved un-installing <em>everything</em> (including &#39;Developer&#39;) and re-installing as per the docs. (still will not run my production Android apps on win7 - that was a good use of my $400)<br>The download page no longer has &#39;Developer&#39;, only &#39;Studio&#39;.</p>
<p>Question:<br>Can someone point me to where I can download &#39;Titanium Developer&#39;?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>Could there be a way for someone to make Titanium Developer available to the community? I cloned the Git repository and managed to get it running. </p>
<p>But when I tried to create a distribution package, I got an error message:</p>
<p><img src="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;JeuvL.jpg" alt="This app was created by a different user."></p>
<p>I can understand <em>why</em> I get this message. But since Appecelerator won&#39;t be supporting it in the future, how can we work around this issue?</p>
<p>I can build it at will, but for someone who doesn&#39;t have Studio, he;s stuck between a rock and a hard place.</p>

							<p>I also ditched studio, never seen such a poor IDE implementation… Its like netbeans 5 years ago, but worse. I guess that was a rushed appcelerater project, after they bought aptana.</p>

										<p><p>I think you are incorrect sir. Netbeans 5 years ago was still much better then Studio (or any Eclipse based IDE for that matter)</p>
<p>:)</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
