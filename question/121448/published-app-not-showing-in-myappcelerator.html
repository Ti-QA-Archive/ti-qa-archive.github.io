			<h1>Published app not showing in my.appcelerator</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve got a published app in the app store with analytics enabled but it&#39;s not showing up in my list of apps, I&#39;m hoping someone from Appcelerator will, <em>for once</em>, read and reply to this question!</p>
<p>Is there a delay in apps showing up? How do I get an app to show up if it&#39;s not already there? </p>
<p>I don&#39;t see why analytics wouldn&#39;t start showing up with an ad-hoc build anyway.</p>
<p>GUID: <code>ba454126-9fb6-4d11-af32-533dffaa316f</code></p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Kelvin</p>

<p>The analytics issue is an unusual one. We have resolved it for you now, but are unclear about the reasons it occurred or whether any other users have experienced it before. Thank you for raising it; my team will be on the lookout for similar incidents, with a view to establishing the source and correcting it as soon as is possible.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Perhaps it might be worth telling users what they should do if they face a similar issue.</p>
<p>Then I can close this question.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

										<p><p>Kelvin,</p>
<p>The only app you have in your my.app account is marked as inactive and was built using a continuous build. If you built your app using a continuous build, that may be the reason for the analytics issue. Check your mobile sdk version and give me the name of the app when you can.</p>

							<p>The inactive app was used only when I was evaluating &amp; getting to grips with titanium.</p>
<p>About the app I&#39;m having issues with:</p>
<ul>
<li>built using mobile SDK 1.7.1</li>
<li>called <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunes.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;shiftingperspectives">Shifting Perspectives</a></li>
<li>GUID: <code>ba454126-9fb6-4d11-af32-533dffaa316f</code></li>
<li>Application ID: <code>uk.co.brightmachine.shiftingperspectives</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Is there any more information you need?</p>
<p><em>PS: When I go to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;my.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps I don&#39;t see any tabs, but if I got to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;my.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;all I do see the tabs</em></p>

							<p>Am I to assume that as things aren&#39;t working as you may expect that you can&#39;t be bothered to offer support?</p>
<p>Does your analytics product work at all? Or should I just stick to using Google Analytics?</p>
<p>Also, if you do pull your fingers out and figure out why this isn&#39;t showing up, will I be able to see the analytics of the last 7 days?</p>
