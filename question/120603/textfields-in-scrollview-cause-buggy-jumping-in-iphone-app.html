			<h1>TextFields in ScrollView cause buggy &#34;jumping&#34; in iPhone app?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve created a ScrollView, with a View in it, with multiple TextFields (and Labels) on it. When clicking on a field partially out of the screen (usually with a keyboard up, reducing the visible area) the view scrolls to make the field properly visible, however it seems to &quot;jump&quot; more than it needs to sometimes before scrolling to the correct position.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve replicated this with the KitchenSink demo, in the &quot;textfield_scrollview.js&quot; file, by changing the &quot;Top&quot; values so all 3 TextFields fit on the page (I wanted to make sure I wasn&#39;t using ScrollViews and Views incorrectly).</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a video of it, which will probably make more sense: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.screencast.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;gxXbKZhT3Bq">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.screencast.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;gxXbKZhT3Bq</a> (note half of the &quot;top&quot; TextField being momentarily visible when switching to the &quot;middle&quot; TextField from the &quot;bottom&quot; one).</p>
<p>Does anyone know if this is a bug in Titanium (two different &quot;scroll&quot; logics happening?), or the iPhone emulator? Will it do like this on the real device?</p>
<p>Any input would be greatly appreciated - thanks =)</p>

							<p>You&#39;re correct in the thought of two different scroll logics occurring at the same time. You see, you don&#39;t necessarily need to use a scroll view in order to make the contents of the entire window scroll. When the contents of the window extend beyond the bottom page border, the page will scroll automatically so long as you haven&#39;t set up the view to not scroll at all.</p>
<p>As far as the scroll view goes, think of it as like a textarea. You put it on a page to make a portion of the page contents scroll in its place, not to make the entire window scroll. An example would be, you want the top half of your page&#39;s content to scroll while the bottom half stays as static text.</p>
<p>Does that make sense&#x2F;answer your question?</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s what I was expecting though the view didn&#39;t seem to want to scroll on it&#39;s own - will give it another try, thanks! :)</p>

<p>I&#39;m STILL having this problem, and have even tried other people&#39;s code where they&#39;re doing the same thing I am - putting textfields in a scrollview - and the same thing happens… if you click on a field that not entirely on the page, the screen &quot;jumps&quot; (scrolls to the wrong place, then jumps to the correct place).</p>
<p>How do I make a view scrollable without using a ScrollView? I&#39;ve read through http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;latest&#x2F;Titanium.UI.View-object and can&#39;t see anything about &quot;scroll&quot;, or movement, etc…</p>
<p>I&#39;m making a form, that the user needs to be able to scroll up and down through, but without the jumping when the user selects a field :S Basically like this: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;120411&#x2F;contact-form-example (which also &quot;jumps&quot;)</p>

							<p>For what it&#39;s worth, rather than trying to make a form in a scrollview, I&#39;ve decided to use a WebView for the form (which scrolls properly), and use button that calls &quot;eval()&quot; on the form to get the form fields and values entered by the user - it&#39;s much easier to make forms this way, and for the most part can still specify which keyboard to used (based on the &quot;type&quot; values of the inputs).</p>
