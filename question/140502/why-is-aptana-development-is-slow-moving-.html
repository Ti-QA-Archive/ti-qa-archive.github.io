			<h1>Why is Aptana development is slow moving ?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I was a solid fan once for Aptana studio in my Rails 2.x days and I had really loved it as an Editor. For the past year and a half I was into different technologies and now landing back to Rails, well this time its version 3.2. When I thought of turning back to my favorite editor, I see it has lot open issues (around 1500+). They all are in the JIRA pipeline to be resolved.</p>
<p>Logically &amp; in layman&#39;s terms, this decides the image of Appcelerator as a company, and having 1500+ open issues on one of their own product&#x2F;editor is not nice. Please Appcelerator team, its high time to sort things out with Aptana and fast or bring it down totally.</p>
<p>Question: What is the rationale behind all this ?</p>

							<p>Thank you for your feedback. Two thoughts:</p>
<p>1) Open issues is not the same as open bugs. Many of the issues that people report are improvements or feature enhancements. I would actually be concerned if people weren&#39;t suggesting new items. Taking a brief look at other popular open source projects, many have large, vibrant bug databases.</p>
<p>2) For a reasonable amount of time the bug base was not being well managed, so there are still some amount of old, invalid or duplicate bugs still in the pile. We&#39;ve fixed more than 500 bugs this year alone on Aptana Studio, so we are actively bringing that number in line. Since being acquired by Appcelerator, we&#39;ve addressed over 2000 features, improvements and bugs across Titanium Studio and Aptana Studio, and we&#39;ve had monthly releases of both products.</p>
<p>All that said, we can&#39;t work on every issue with equal priority. Is there a bug in particular that you are interested in?</p>
