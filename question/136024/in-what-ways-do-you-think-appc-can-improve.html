			<h1>In what ways do you think AppC can improve?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello.</p>
<p>We (as community) have unique opportunity to make suggestions to AppC on what we would like to see improved. So, you can write your own opinions here and your suggestions could become reality some day.</p>
<p>What I mind the most is a lack of feedback and information from AppC towards whole community, but also to individuals who contribute in some manners.</p>
<p>I believe that we all want to know AppC&#39;s future development plans because we depend directly on them (OK, sometimes that can be business secret, but sometimes it is not). For example, removal of &quot;Ti.include&quot; in the future and leaning towards CommonJs standard should be announced officially and on right time so we can prepare. Some people here are developing really large apps and having information about AppC&#39;s long term future plans is very important.<br>Also, I believe that we (or at least the most talented people from community) can help AppC with future development plans and make future features more useful for all of us. Since we develops real world apps (and have real world problems), I believe that we know what things could be better or useful.</p>
<p>From my personal perspective, I miss feedback when I suggest something or report some bug (any feedback is better than none). For example, I reported this bug: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-5303">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-5303</a> and had no idea will it be resolved, when it will be resolved or how it will be resolved until it actually was resolved.<br>I also make suggestions like this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-7671">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-7671</a> and I would like to know if that idea is OK, could it be better, are there technical limitations that prevent that ticket to be implemented, etc. It doesn&#39;t have to be resolved, but I would appreciate technical discussion. Or just say it&#39;s stupid and mark it as invalid. :)</p>
<p>That&#39;s all from me (for now), you can make your own suggestions and hopefully something will come out of this. :)</p>
<p>Cheers, Ivan.</p>

							<p>Many good developers thinks that Q&amp;A section should be improved and this has been suggested multiple times in the past (see &quot;Most Votes&quot; section).</p>
<p>IMHO, information that is required in JIRA when opening a ticket should also be required when creating new question in Q&#x2F;A (that would be huge improvement). Boydlee suggested that there should be moderators that could close questions that are not asked in right way. David Bankier thinks that rewarding system is bad because people will give any answer just to collect some points. As I understand, it&#39;s important for AppC that they can see what are the most important issues in the community. Voting system is OK for that cause, but as David noted, that could be implemented in some other way, so people don&#39;t just give answers because Q&amp;A points and top expert list (points don&#39;t make you expert :) ).</p>

							<p>For me, the two main issues with Titanium Mobile are: documentation is often not complete or doesn&#39;t contemplate all the necessary details; often components&#x2F;APIs are not very stable or complete. The impression that I have is that AppC is growing fast, maybe too fast, and as a result it&#39;s investing in expanding &quot;horizontally&quot; rather than on improving what it has already. Personally I&#39;d prefer fewer features, but more dependable.</p>
<p>As a final note: command-line tools are poorly documented and&#x2F;or not very user-friendly, and building&#x2F;running&#x2F;deploying from CLI is essential in many production environments (continuous integration, automated build, …).</p>

										<p><p>Great answer. :)</p>
<p>IMO, documentation is getting better, but I also miss some things in it.</p>
<p>I would also prefer improvements of existing functionality over new features.</p>

										<p><p>Documentation has been a pain point for us and (as I hope you have seen) we are making a significant effort to improve it. That said, I would love to hear more details on how to further make it more useful. We are more than happy to hear your feedback and take action on it.</p>

										<p><p>In my opinion, KitchenSink should be rewritten so it uses CommonJs (and I know there is some work going on there), ForgingTitanium episodes should be updated (there are some errors in them, like usage of global variables in CommonJs implementation of NavigationController), there should be at least one non-trivial app that shows best practices, orientation handling, different screen sizes, etc.</p>
<p>I personally would like to have better documentation of Titanium core (overall architecture explained, third party tools, etc.). Yeah, devs can find bit by bit of information and slowly figure that by themselves, but it would be awesome if that was explained in one place so devs can easily figure out how Titanium functions and hopefully contribute with bug fixes and improvements.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ve seen that AppC is working on improving the documentation, and I highly appreciate this effort. It&#39;s also very valuable to me to see that there is a strong interest in getting a feedback from users.<br>So, getting to the point, I think the guides are well written (and very helpful). Yes, there are uncovered (or not thoroughly covered) areas, but it&#39;s only a matter of time I guess. On the other side, reference documentation for the APIs is more weak, albeit improving too.<br>I&#39;ll report a couple of random examples, just to explain what I mean.</p>
<p>As a first example, looking at http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.0&#x2F;index.html#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Database-method-install, last time I tried to install to external storage on android using Ti.Database.install and the method suggested I wasn&#39;t successful (but it was either 1.7.5 or 1.8.2, so it could be changed now): I ended up skipping altogether Ti.Database.install and using solely Ti.Filesystem.getFile, Titanium.createBuffer, and copying the file.</p>
<p>A different example: if you look at the documentation for Ti.API.addEventListener (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.0&#x2F;index.html#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.API) talks about a Callback&lt;Object&gt; callback, but it&#39;s not clear from this entry how this Callback object is called, with which parameters, etc. Yes, it&#39;s documented in the guides, but it&#39;s not immediately available here. Also, it&#39;s not made clear that a callback must positively not return any value, unless one is ready to see the sky falling…<br>I wrote this only to clarify what I meant, not to be hyper-critic.</p>
<p>Btw, thanks a lot for being here listening to us!</p>
<p>And as a final note: keep up the good work, Titanium Mobile rocks hard! :-)</p>

										<p><p>Ivan,<br>You are correct about KitchenSink. Overall expect to see more work around CommonJS in the future and we are also working on an app that over time will provide you with the items you mention above.  I really like your recommendation about the explanation of the Core. I ll discuss this with our documentation team.<br>Marco,<br>please do point specific areas that need more improvement&#x2F;sample code&#x2F;examples etc. We do have an existing roadmap in updating APIs but we need the community to help us with prioritizing. Regarding your 2nd item, I suppose you are asking for better connection between Guides and API Reference or adding more samples with the API reference?</p>
<p>thank you for the ideas.Please keep them coming</p>

										<p><p>About the 2nd item, it was only to indicate that there are areas which lack depth (Callback is not adequately documented, and it should be documented in the API Reference). Connection with the Guides is not a priority for me. Samples are nice to have but not fundamental, as long as the API docs are clear and complete.</p>
<p>Until now I&#39;ve not kept track of unclear spots, but from now on I&#39;ll do, as I notice those during my daily work, and I&#39;ll keep you posted. Be prepared :-)</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Marco. </p>
<p>We&#39;ve been really actively working on the API docs specifically for the last several releases, but there is still plenty of work to do. Feedback is really useful to us as it helps us focus our efforts on trouble spots, and also tells us when something is incorrect or confusing. </p>
<p>In the Ti.Database.install method, I thought the doc explicitly said that it installed the database to <em>internal</em> storage, and that if you wanted to install a DB to external storage on Android, you couldn&#39;t use Database.install. Perhaps I&#39;m missing the specific issue there.</p>
<p>Right now, the best way to give specific feedback is by filing bugs. I know this is a pain, but it helps keeping things from slipping through the cracks. </p>

							<p>I will say yes it needs a terrific makeover. As i come from iOS background and when I compare my development experience on both iOS and titanium.. there are time when titanium fails. Interface builder is the main issue.<br>Appcelerator should also make some low level API also that will make the development process more easy, more intuitive.</p>

							<p>Hey Guys,</p>
<p>Just wanted to introduce myself. My name is Mark Aronica and have recently taken on what we call the &quot;Customer Success&quot; group which includes the Consulting, Training, and Support organizations. As a result, systems such as Q&amp;A fall under my team. So I&#39;m very interested in monitoring this thread and hearing how we can continue to improve the experience for developers.</p>
<p>We&#39;re working hard on enhancing a number of the interface points with our community including Website, Q&amp;A, and other Support assets. So this is a timely discussion and know that I&#39;m documenting all suggestions and will be bringing them into the appropriate design discussions.</p>
<p>Thanks again for taking the time to contribute you&#39;re thoughts and feedback on how we can continue to improve your experience.</p>
<p>-Mark Aronica</p>
