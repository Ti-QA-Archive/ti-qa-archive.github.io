			<p>Hi everybody,</p>
<p>Sorry for this post, but i&#39;m new to titanium studio.</p>
<p>I have a problem, i would like to test my KitchenSink on my iPad in Ad Hoc mode. I went to the Apple Provisionning portal and here is what i did : </p>
<p>I created a new App ID named : com.brdcom.kitchensinkipad</p>
<p>Then, i went in &quot;Provisionning&quot; &#x2F; &quot;Distribution&quot; &#x2F; &quot;New Profile&quot; with Ad Hoc mode selected, with my App Id selected. I dowloaded it and installed it in XCode and i got the message &quot;Valid signing identity not found&quot;. As you can see there : </p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;img217.imageshack.us&#x2F;img217&#x2F;6581&#x2F;xcode.jpg</p>
<p>So i go in the KeyChain to see, and here is what i have : </p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;img85.imageshack.us&#x2F;img85&#x2F;1573&#x2F;certificats.jpg</p>
<p>So i think that the problem comes from the &quot; iPhone Distribution : BRD CONCEPT &quot; certificate who do not have a Key. What do i have to do? Get a new key? How do i get that. </p>
<p>The other think is that when i compile my project with titanium studio, i can install the app with the &quot;iOS Team Provisionning Profile&quot;, why?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot and sorry for my english i&#39;m french.</p>

							<p>Go into your developer portal and revoke ALL certificates and ALL provisioning profiles. We are going to be doing a clean re-certification.</p>
<p>After that&#39;s done, go into xcode and open up the &#39;Organizer&#39;.</p>
<p>Go to the &#39;Devices&#39; tab, and then the &#39;Provisioning Profiles&#39; section.</p>
<p>In the bottom right, click &#39;Refresh&#39;</p>
<p>After that, it will ask for a login and start working. As it goes, approve it creating and downloading certificates. It should automatically make a iOS Team Provisioning Profile for you. Xcode will do everything automatically; much easier than going into the Dev Site and risk messing up.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, for this you&#39;d need to delete them in keychain, and no, it will not remove it from the app store. I think you&#39;d just have to re-sign it at the next update. The page you&#39;ll want to use for the help you need is here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;ios&#x2F;#technotes&#x2F;tn2250&#x2F;_index.html</p>

							<p>At first I too struggled with deploying iOS apps from Titanium. I soon learned that there really wasn&#39;t any <em>Titanium</em> was doing &quot;wrong&quot; and that is was because I hadn&#39;t properly set up my Apple stuff.</p>
<p>I suggest you put Titanium Studio aside for a moment and get your Apple stuff working first. By that I mean, take a simple &quot;Hello World&quot;-type program and successfully deploy it using Xcode. Use the workflow information provided in Apple&#39;s developer site to download all the necessary keys, certs, profiles, etc. Then package up the app and deploy it. If you get stuck doing that, I suggest you look to Apples forums.</p>
<p>Once you have that working, using Titanium Studio will be much much easier. You will also &quot;know what right looks like&quot; and it will be easier to troubleshoot your TiS specific problems.</p>
<p>At this point, you best resources are Apple&#39;s site and their forums.</p>
<p>Once you got that working, we here can help you get that same Hello World app deployed via TiS.</p>

							<p>Ok so i have revoked all my certificates &amp; my profiles (in reality they still exist, i can&#39;t delete a profile after deleting the certificate).</p>
<p>Now Xcode created me a certificate named : &quot; iOS Team Provisioning Profile: * &quot; this is the certificate i need to use to sign Ad Hoc app? (beacause it actually work if i build with titanium and this profile, i can test my app on my dev iPad).</p>
<p>I won&#39;t have to create a provisionning profile on the website like com.mycompany.myapp with an App ID ?? </p>
<p>Thanks for the help.</p>
