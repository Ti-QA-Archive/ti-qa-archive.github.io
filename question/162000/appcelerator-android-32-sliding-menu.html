			<h1>Appcelerator Android 3.2 Sliding Menu</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I updated to SDK 3.2 for all the new features I need, and the best I can tell its impossible to have a facebook style slider with the new version.  I am really disappointed with this..</p>
<p>basically I open my menu window… then I open another window on top of it, and I used to move the old top window out of the way, and then I could see the menu on the left.  Now when I slide this new heavyweight out of the way all I see is black.  I saw another thread where I could set the opacity to .5 for example and I can of course see my menu below it… but I can&#39;t click it because its not moving the whole window out of the way.</p>
<p>I now need to completely re architect my project.  I spent a lot of time getting everything into alloy to have one codebase to find out that without using the old crappy window structure its impossible to have the same menu system with the new SDK.  Extremely disappointed.</p>
<p>If an appcelerator dev wants my project I can email it, its way to complex to post an example through these forums.</p>

							<div><p>Hi.  I&#39;d suggest to create a minimalist test case that each one of the community members can clone&#x2F;copy and experience exactly what you&#39;re describing.  This will make it easier for everyone to really understand the issue and potentially offer solutions or workarounds.</p>

							<p>For what it&#39;s worth, the -right- way of implementing a slide-in menu on Android is using Android&#39;s Navigation Layout, which comes pre-baked with the SDK <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;design&#x2F;patterns&#x2F;navigation-drawer.html">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;design&#x2F;patterns&#x2F;navigation-drawer.html</a>.  There&#39;s a Jira ticket for it <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-15910">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-15910</a>, and there&#39;s also a module at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;R1UwIq">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;R1UwIq</a> you can use today, so you can have a TRUE native Android slide-in menu.</p>

										<p><p>Your right they were all &#39;real&#39; answers…. I had already tried legacy windowing before asking the question and I probably should have put that in the first post. Enabling that functionality breaks tons of other graphics and layout related things, as shown in the below screenshots.  </p>
<p>No Legacy - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.dropboxusercontent.com&#x2F;u&#x2F;56846391&#x2F;no-legacy-pretty.png<br>Legacy enabled - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.dropboxusercontent.com&#x2F;u&#x2F;56846391&#x2F;legacy-rob-ford.png</p>
<p>This drawer functionality appears to be the only real way to make it work with Appcelerator new window structure which is fine.  But it shows the drawer functionality will be a requirement to make this work properly, as Appcelerator has acknowledged with that JIRA ticket.  That why I consider this a &#39;real&#39; answer.  Legacy Windowing is a bandaid &#x2F; hack if Appcelerator thinks this heavyweight only window is the way forward.</p>
<p>So while the other answers were &#39;real&#39; answers, they weren&#39;t the correct answer for long term sustainability.</p>

										<p><p>Ricardo,</p>
<p>   Been trying to load this thing for awhile and can;t figure out how.  Tried adding it as the doc&#39;s say in the project and the titanium studio levee and can&#39;t get either to work.  Any ideas what the steps to install it are, there isn&#39;t any documentation on how to load this module in the github repo.  Thanks!</p>

										<p><p>So you agree that is its impossible?  All of these need the old legacy window settings to work which I already can make mine do.  As far as I am concerned this is most likely the breaking point from not being able to use appcelerator any longer unless someone can release a patch shortly to fix functionality.</p>

<p>One using an alloy widget, one using dk.napp.drawer.</p>

										<p><p>This is only for Android.  iOS works fine still. and it works as expected with legacy windows… In Android the top window does slide over but its black under it… if you set the opacity you can see the window below it (even though it screws up the whole view)  but you can&#39;t click it because the top window still covers it.  Thanks for the response.  I wouldbe happy to share the project with appcelerator if it gets me to resolution.  Thanks!</p>

<p>&lt;property name=&quot;ti.android.useLegacyWindow&quot; type=&quot;bool&quot;&gt;true&lt;&#x2F;property&gt;</p>
<p>Enables or disables the legacy window behavior that a heavyweight window is created if any of the following properties are defined on creation: fullscreen, navBarHidden, modal, or windowSoftInputMode. By default, the legacy behavior is disabled, which means all the windows are heavyweight. (since 3.2.0)</p>

										<p><p>This is the exact problem.  It needs to work without using legacy windows.  just enabling this, severely messed up the visuals on almost all of my pages since the entire app was already re-build to be heavyweight only, minus the menu system.  I will post some screenshots of my login page with it turned off and it turned on.</p>
<p>My slider works fine with legacy turned on, the rest of my app looks like Kesha went on a 72 hours drinking binge with rob ford though.</p>
<p>I am specifically need ing to know how to do this without turning on legacywindowing… also it is inevitable appcelertor will eventually discontinue that feature and I will be in this problem in 6 months.  If I have to go rebuild the entire app again, then I might as well just do it native =&#x2F;</p>
