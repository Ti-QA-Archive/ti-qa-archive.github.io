			<h1>Detect undeclared variables in .js code in Titanium Studio</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Is there any way to force in Titanium Studio that all variables are declared with the &quot;var&quot; clause? Or, at least, that a warning alert us about we have created a global variable without explicity using the reserved &quot;var&quot; clause.</p>
<p>The goal is prevent mistakes creating undesired global variables. I&#39;m wondering if it could be done installing a plugin in Titanium Studio or setting a preference option that I unknow…..</p>
<p>For example, in Visual Basic you can use the code &quot;Option Explicit&quot;, and I heard sometime ago that you can use a plugin in Eclipse to do something similar with Eclipse and .js files</p>
<p>What I meant with &quot;global&quot; is global in the current context. I currently use in my code the CommonJS especification, and that avoid global JS variables by itself. But using undeclared variables could get to unexpedted errors in run-time.</p>
<p>This is an example I want to avoid:</p>
<p><code>inline code</code><br>var myWindow = Titanium.UI.createWindow();<br>var currentWindow;</p>
<p>currentwindow = myWindow;<br>&#x2F;&#x2F;After that code, we have a global variable &quot;currentwindow&quot; and a local variable &quot;currenWindow&quot; with an undefined value.<br><code>inline code</code></p>
<p>If that could be detected (or warned), we can review the code and realice that we have misspeled &quot;currenwindow&quot; variable.</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Short answer - no.</p>
<p>Titanium is a set of APIs&#x2F;extensions to JavaScript - so we follow the rules of JS.</p>
<p>JS has huge advantages by not requiring variables to be declared and variables themselves to have no defined types.  But the advantages bring the same problems you have mentioned.</p>
<p>But where you see negatives - I simply see the side effects of the advantages.  Plus it forces people to test their code often and make code modular as well as reducing as much as possible to small manageable chunks.</p>
<p>With Visual Basic, the option explicit is a hang over to the past, it was never required to start with (in fact never existed if you go far enough back) but in time it was added as an option and later became an expectation.  However these two languages are chalk and cheese, VB uses strongly typed variables (even var is a type of sorts) so option explicit enforces that rule.  As the rule does not exist for JS enforcement would mean that all the advantages would be lost.</p>
<p>You are already using CommonJS, so you know that small efficient code is the way to go, aim to make everything modular, define the scope of the methods and properties you are going to create before you start and then check them when you finish.  Test the code in isolation and then in the actual app.  Test the app often.  These all sound like obvious things, but I assure you most people ignore them - get carried away - try to &quot;save time&quot; or think their prototype is something that is now the real app.</p>
<p>I do not know how extensive your knowledge of JS is, or the Ti SDK, if you are using Alloy yet then also underscore and backbone, but there is much more to Ti&#x2F;JS than a few APIs and you will come to love and understand the flexibility of the language is its greatest strength.</p>

										<p><p>Hi, thank you for your quick &amp; exhaustive answer.</p>
<p>One of the collateral problems if that to test in Titatinum Studio targeting Android is a pain. I have followed (almost) all advises I found in Internet, but  it continues taking serveral minutes to deploy the new code to Android Simulator. </p>
<p>Relating all articles I&#39;ve read, It seems to be an Android SDK problem, and not a Titanium problem, but the fact is that is a pain to test targeting Android.</p>
<p>For that, a tool that allow me discover this &quot;typo&quot; mistakes would be great.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, android dev and particularly debugging is a pain.  However you can improve things a massively reduce the debug time by using Ti.Shadow which allows you to restart the app without restarting the emulator each time.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dbankier&#x2F;TiShadow">Ti.Shadow</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are lots of guides to show you how to get it installed if you are feeling stuck, the time to get used to it is more than made up for in the productivity gains.</p>
<p>This will give you the fast responsive means to find those painful typo issues.</p>
<p>This is not part of titanium but instead a community project, which will show you just how great the community can be.</p>
