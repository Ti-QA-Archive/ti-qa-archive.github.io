							<p>Actaully Goh its not up-to you it depends on the sever to assign the name maybe server you are uploading has a method to change the name.You have seen this kind of situation in many social sites etc so it really does not depend upon you</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>Just send a &quot;Name&quot; field in your POST, and then on the server side, if you&#39;re using something like PHP, you could just change the name when using &quot;move_uploaded_file&quot; from the temp file to the new one.</p>

										<p><p>Yes I had tried with the php program using the &quot;move_upload_file&quot; with the &quot;name:&quot; field, but it does not work on my Android device and my IOS device as well. I don&#39;t know why. </p>
<p>For IOS device, i can work around this problem by write the file to local filesystem with new filename, and then read and upload it server. </p>
<p>But this method does not work on Android. I only managed with write to android local filesystem (external Storage) with new filename but failed to upload to server with this new filename. I don&#39;t know why. Maybe I read the wrong directory?? Any advice is appreciated.</p>

							<p>Hi,Goh Ten Fatt</p>
<p>Simply my answer is its depends on server side not from your.</p>
<p>Because if you and your friend use same server. You upload one file the file name is <strong>movies.png</strong>.ok.</p>
<p>and than</p>
<p>Your friend upload some other file but its name same as your name <strong>movies.png</strong>. and if that both image are save at same place  at that time some problem occur so to remove that problem  this type of name is used <strong>Tixhr14578943.jpeg</strong>.</p>
<p>I think you understand.</p>
<p>Thanx.</p>
