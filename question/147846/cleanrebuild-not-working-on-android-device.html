			<p>I&#39;m running Titanium Studio, build: 3.0.1.201212181159, Titanium SDK v 3 with the Android SDK 2.2V8.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve seen several posts about cleaning and rebuilding the BUILD directory. I have cleaned and manually deleted the BUILD folder but now my app doesn&#39;t run on an Android Device. It seems like it does not perform the  Ti.Database.Install correctly. I get an error saying &quot;…no such table… when I issue the SELECT statement. This worked before I added another table to the DB. Everything works fine in the android emulator. I even did a &quot;reset to factory&quot; on the android and it still does not work. It seems like the BUILD directory is not getting built fully. Is there a way to update the BUILD directory manually or from the command line?</p>

							<div><p>More info … On the device when I &quot;clear data&quot; it looks like it tries to copy the database but it never finishes. The database should be about 724k but the size on the devices shows different number of like 20k, 60k, but never hundreds of k. Again on the emulator, the db is always 724k even after clearing data and running it again.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>It is less likely that the state of the build folder is affecting your app and more likely that you have either got one of the following issues;</p>
<ul>
<li>You have previously added one or more tables to the database since it was installed, this is why it works on the emulator and not the device.</li>
<li>You have a case problem with the table&#x2F;column names when on the device.  Consider checking the original database to make sure that for example a table name &quot;Test&quot; is not referenced in the code as &quot;test&quot; or &quot;TEST&quot;, all three are considered different.  The emulator and devices can handle this type case differently.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the build folder had stopped part way through you would end up with an app that would fail on more than a single table in the app.</p>
<p>Consider editing the database on your computer and reviewing the tables and columns match exactly as you are programming for.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the response Malcolm but neither case is true. I have &quot;cleared data&quot; and uninstalled on the emulator to ensure that I am using the new database on the emulator. I also can access the new table in the database on the emulator so I know the change is applied. BTW, Im doing a it.database.install instead do an it.database.open and then creating the table if that helps.</p>
<p> I also did not modify the table that errors on out on the device but the case is correct anyhow. Any other thoughts? Thanks for helping.</p>

							<p>I don&#39;t know why this problem happened but I figured out a way around it…</p>
<p>I used a sqlite database browser to export all my tables and data to .csv files. I then deleted all tables and then imported the CSV file to recreate the tables again. A clean is probably not a bad idea (I did so many I can&#39;t remember&#x2F;know which one fixed it or when to run it). After rebuilding the DB, I was able to install and run my app on an android device as well as them emulator. Hope this helps someone else.</p>
