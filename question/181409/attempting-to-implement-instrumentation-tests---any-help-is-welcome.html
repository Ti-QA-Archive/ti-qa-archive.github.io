			<h1>Attempting to implement instrumentation tests - any help is welcome!</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Type: Mobile<br>Titanium SDK: Titanium Command-Line Interface, CLI version 3.3.0, Titanium SDK version 3.2.3.GA<br>Platform: Android</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to find any kind of ability to do instrumentation testing for android through Titanium&#x2F;Appcelerator. I&#39;ve tried everything I could think of; building a native instrumentation test project in appcelerator, importing the appcelerator app into eclipse, changing the debug keystore, etc. The target package in the manifest is the correct package for the app, but at this point the furthest I can get is Appcelerator failing with either a &quot;Package signatures don&#39;t match&quot; error or a &quot;No instrumentation class for test package&quot; error. </p>
<p>At this point, I&#39;m willing to use non-native instrumentation, but after looking around I can&#39;t find anyone who is actually doing instrumentation testing, at least no one in the past 2 years. I know about SOASTA, but that&#39;s not instrumentation; that&#39;s record&#x2F;playback, which is not what I want.</p>
<p>So is there a way to get up to your elbows in the app with testing? Or am I limited to SOASTA and whatever I can do to dependency modules in Eclipse?</p>

							<p>This may or may not be what you&#39;re looking for, but hopefully it helps somebody.</p>
<p>My team is doing a deep dive into <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;appium.io&#x2F;">appium</a> with some success.  We&#39;ve been able to build a set of tests for our app that run on android and ios.   The appium server is compatible with Selenium WebDriver, so you can use any language that has webdriver bindings.  We&#39;re using Javascript and the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;admc&#x2F;wd">wd library</a>.</p>
<p>Authoring the tests is a bit tricky.  We have not found a way to put meaningful IDs or labels on our views, so we have to find all the views via an XPath-like mechanism.  This can be a bit fragile if you don&#39;t construct those xpath queries very carefully.  And since the xpaths use the native UI views (e.g. &quot;UIAWebView&quot; vs. &quot;android.webkit.WebView&quot;), finding the views is different on iOS and android. </p>
<p>Our plan is to take the tests we&#39;re developing and run them on a cloud-based testing platform, like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appthwack.com&#x2F;">AppThwack</a>.</p>

										<p><p>Good suggestion, I can look into that. I was hoping for something that would let me just use and run the native android Instrumentation framework, but after experimenting for a few days I don&#39;t think that&#39;s possible.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
