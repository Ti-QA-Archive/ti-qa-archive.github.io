			<h1>eventListener removed on Android when using jquerymobile for a hybrid app in alloy</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>The issue goes a bit deep, but I created a master test that is the main reason of all of my issues within this app:</p>
<p>I have an app that is supposed to work for both iOS and Android, in fact, the iOS version is already out in the market, but the Android version has given me a bunch of problems.</p>
<p>My index.js controler file includes many files, I end up with an index.html file which includes other files, including the filter.js file for example.</p>
<p>This filter.js file has one eventListener which is being fired from the app.js every 200 ms, so when I run the app, I&#39;m logging a text evertime the listener is triggered, in my case the word &quot;alive&quot; shows every 200 ms. I did this so I could see when this listener would stop working.</p>
<p>I noticed that whenever I would change from one page&#x2F;section to another one inside the app, the Android platform reloads the index.js controler file, meaning that all of the files that get initiated in the index.html are initiated again, this causes this test eventListener to get removed and then initiated again, but the fireEvent seems to loose it&#39;s reference.</p>
<p>The iOS version does not do this and I&#39;m trying to have the Android version behave like the iOS one, but there are a number of related issues with the listeners not working any more.</p>
<p>I thought it could be a cacheMode setting for Android, or possibly the jquerymobile version, none of this seemed to have been the issue, so I think there is a bug cause by a combination of these technologies.</p>
<p>If anyone has had experience with this and has an answer, it would be awesome!</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>Answering my own question with a piece of code:</p>
<p>$( &#39;body&#39; ).pagecontainer( &#39;change&#39;, &#39;#products&#39;, { transition: &#39;slide&#39;, changeHash: false  } );</p>
<p>Whenever a new page is called, I needed to include the changeHash: false property, this will not load new browser history entry, which seemed to be the reason why my listeners were being re-loaded and non-reachable.</p>
