			<h1>Take pictures from the App and get on my computer</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>In my last post I was wondering how to take pictures from my app(a shortcut to the camera), select this specific pictures(maybe rename them with a specific name start like title1, title2. so i can select directly from the code), and send to a default DropBox account, but as i saw that this isn&#39;t happening with dropbox mostly because every time that you use the DropBox in you app you must Login and I wanted all the pictures to go to the &quot;app account&quot;.My plan is: the user takes the picture(that&#39;s really the only work that i wanna the user to have) and somehow i select this specific pictures that he took while he was in my app and send to somewhere (DropBox,Amazon S3 or maybe cloud services, i really do not know wich one is better to use for my purpose) where i can login on the code so i can get the pictures in my computer.If anyone could help on how to do this, i really appreciated.</p>
<p>Note:the only thing that i want the users to do is to take the picture, all the rest I wanted to be intern, inside the code.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time</p>

							<p>Hello,</p>
<p>you can use a service like twitpic or use your own server with a small script with a form that receives the pictures. Check <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;KitchenSink">kitchensink</a> about how to upload files to a server. What you can do is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take the picture.</li>
<li>Once you get it, call the upload method in kitchensink </li>
<li>Get all them in one account. </li>
</ol>
<p>BTW, there is a FTP module in the Marketplace, if that is easier to solve your issue. </p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro</p>
