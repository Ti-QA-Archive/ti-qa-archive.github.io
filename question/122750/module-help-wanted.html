		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>We need to build a module and add it to an existing Appcelerator app. We have no experience in this area, and I&#39;d love to talk to someone that has. It would also be great to find someone that could work with us to build the module. If any of you have experience in this area and could help us code a module please let me know!</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>-Dan</p>

							<div><p>Adding to what Aaron said, take a look at Github for Appcelerator, there is some stuff there that has not completely made it to release yet but maybe with some extra interest &#x2F; investment you could help.</p>

							<div><p>I checked Github, there&#39;s nothing there that would help us from what I can see. Also, I should mention that we do have a budget for building this module. I&#39;ll be happy to forward the details to anyone that&#39;s interested in the work.</p>
