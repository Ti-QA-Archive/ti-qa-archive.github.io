			<h1>Obaining source code from already compiled app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Quick question, I wanted to know if it were possibly for anyone to get access to my source code that I used to build my iPhone app? Meaning… If I have already distributed my app on the App Store, can someone take that program and find the JS functions I have created and are using? I would not see how this is possible from considering I compiled this into a program already, but I am not sure…</p>
<p>Let me explain…</p>
<p>I have an app that I am saving a file to the Filesystem to. The string I am inputting into this file is an ID number that is being encrypted using Salt and And Algorithm that I created. I have the salt and algorithm both inside of my app.js file. I want to make sure nobody gains access to my decryption algorithm, if they do then I need to do things differently in my app, but it will mean eliminating functionality and I would prefer not to do that.</p>
<p>I appreciate any insight, thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Rob</p>

							<p>hello,</p>
<p>I have not sensed the breaking of security and even explain how it&#39;s done, but it&#39;s simple to get the source code of an application made by titanium, so do not go into details.</p>
<p>Just install the application on a jailbroken device, copy the application already installed to the mac&#x2F;pc open in an editor, it will be possible to find for each block of base64 js with their name, and decode.</p>
<p>With it will have the exact same files with the same code. Only no longer have comments in the js, which is removed in the build.</p>
<p>This apparent lack of security is the downside of having the advantage of creating applications in javascript. However it is possible to increase the security by using tools to obfuscate js.</p>

							<p>Actually getting source code from Android app is pretty easy, but for iOS the JS code is compiled so it&#39;s quite hard get the source.</p>

							<p>As far as I know, the JS code will be compiled to a real native iOS application. I don&#39;t know how much of this bytecode can be decompiled, but I don&#39;t think you can do this the easy way. Chances to recreate your original JS-code are around 0% but proof me wrong.</p>
