			<h1>Android back button always takes me to first window</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve been reading through the Q&amp;As, but I haven&#39;t seen a post with a similar problem.<br>The problem is as follows. I navigate through a window hierarchy.</p>
<p>win1 -&gt; win2(table) -&gt; win3(table) -&gt; win4 -&gt; win5</p>
<p>All windows are heavyweight windows and all windows listen to the back button on Android. However, no matter in what window I am, the back button will always take me back to win1 (except when I&#39;m in win1 - then it will close the application as it should).</p>
<p>How can that be? I only open windows, I never close them (intentionally). Is it possible that the back button is closing all my windows at once, with exception of the first one (does not make sense to me)?</p>

							<p>I can&#39;t reproduce your problem using heavyweight windows. The following code behaves as expected: It opens three windows. Pressing Android&#39;s hardware back button once closes the pink window first, pressing it again closes the yellow one, and pressing it a third time closes the blue one and exits the app.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> window1</span> = Ti.UI.createWindow({
    backgroundColor: <span class="hljs-string">"blue"</span>,
    exitOnClose: <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>,
    fullscreen: <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>
});
window1.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>();

<span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> window2</span> = Ti.UI.createWindow({
    backgroundColor: <span class="hljs-string">"yellow"</span>,
    fullscreen: <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>
});
window2.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>();

<span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> window3</span> = Ti.UI.createWindow({
    backgroundColor: <span class="hljs-string">"pink"</span>,
    fullscreen: <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>
});
window3.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>();
</code></pre><p>I can reproduce your problem using lightweight windows, though. Maybe you think your windows are heavyweight when in fact they are not.</p>

										<p><p>I use createWindow with tabBarHidden (I had also added all the other heavyweight properties, just for the sake of testing). If my assumption that this is enough to make a window heavyweight, please correct me. But I was also under the assumption that the back button wouldn&#39;t even work on a non-heavyweight window.</p>
<p>The transition from window 1 to window 2 seems to be fine (normal window transition animation).<br>The window 3 is opened as the result of a click on a row in a table. Here I notice a strange behavior. The current window seems to disappear and for a split second I have blank screen (or yellow on my Galaxy) and then the new window just pops in. All the following windows don&#39;t have the blank screen, but the window also just pops in without animation.</p>
<p>I also put in a close event listener (in win2 and win3) to see if my windows vanish at some point. When I press the back button on win4 or win5. I see a close event on win2 (but not for win3).</p>
<p>If I then walk up to win 4 or 5 again and press the back button again, I get 2 close events for win2. I can repeat this again and again and the number of caught close events for win2 will rise accordingly.</p>
<p>I suspect a very stupid mistake somewhere in the code, but I just don&#39;t know what to look for.</p>

										<p><p>Okay, so my assumption was wrong. tabBarHidden is not one of the properties that makes a window heavyweight. Either is was written incorrectly somewhere in the Q&amp;As or I got it mixed up in my head with navBarHidden (I thought both were valid). And even though I did try out other truly valid heavyweight properties, I obviously never did so in a consistent way throughout my windows to get a functioning setup.</p>
<p>I now use <code>fullscreen: false</code> on all my heavyweight windows consistently and it works.</p>
<p>So you were in fact right - I only thought my windows were heavyweight. Thanks!</p>

							<p>You said &quot;… and all windows listen to the back button on Android&quot;</p>
<p>Once you start hooking into the android:back event listener you have to manage window behavior yourself. You can do as Christian did, and let Android handle it for you. In other words, don&#39;t add the event listeners. Or, you&#39;re going to have to include the win.close() statements as appropriate in the handlers.</p>

										<p><p>Hi, I had both versions. Not including the event listeners myself for android:back and having them in there and calling a win.close on the window accordingly. There is no difference in behavior.</p>

							<p>to avoid parent window closing you could use modal:true when callind window.open</p>
