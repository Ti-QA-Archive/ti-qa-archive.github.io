			<h1>ACS Pricing Information</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Has anyone been able to get concrete pricing information on ACS for usage above what is provided for free?  I&#39;m working on a couple new apps and I am trying to decide between ACS, Parse.com, Urban Airship and PubNub.com for various pieces of the puzzle and before I spend the time and energy integrating API&#39;s, I want to know what the pricing will be.  I have information from all of the other vendors but can&#39;t get Appcelerator to provide their information.  I filled out online forms and sent email but never heard back so I called sales.  I spoke with someone in sales and the most concrete answer I could get was that he has seen the pricing graph relating to price as you increase API utilization and it&#39;s inline with Parse.com and other competitors.  When I asked for actual numbers he said an account exec would have to call me back.  No returned call and it&#39;s been a week since that phone call…  </p>
<p>I really like Appcelerator and ACS seems like a good product but they are sending mixed signals about pricing which makes me nervous.  Does anyone exceed the free tier limit?  Maybe that&#39;s the issue…</p>

<p>I was hoping that I would see a response from someone that has been given ACS pricing information or for someone at Appcelerator to reach out to us and give us some information but surprisingly neither has happened.  If you&#39;ve read this post and would like Appcelerator to be more transparent with ACS pricing above and beyond the free tier and for Appcelerator to be more responsive to sales inquiries, please vote for my main post.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Nick I saw that too but it doesn&#39;t talk about the pricing if you exceed the included free usage or am I just missing it?  My concern is that before I invest the time and money to build out an implementation based upon ACS, I need to know what the cost is going forward should the app become successful and the free tier allowances are not enough.</p>

										<p><p>Given that the same limits apply for Free-&gt;Enterprise, then I suspect you need to negociate on any overages</p>

										<p><p>Thanks!  I don&#39;t see any details on the rates charged above what&#39;s included free. I see this &quot;Additional increments are charged based upon the usage above your plan limit and will be billed at the end of the month.&quot;</p>
