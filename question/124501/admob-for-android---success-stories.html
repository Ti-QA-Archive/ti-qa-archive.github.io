			<h1>AdMob for Android - Success Stories?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,<br>I&#39;m very seriously considering an indie membership and one of the driving factors is the admob integration.  However I&#39;d like to confirm that the module works on Android?</p>
<p>Also can anyone confirm that they have it working?  I see lots of posts about issues; but then again most people only post if something doesn&#39;t work.</p>

							<p>I tried the paid admob setup, but it didn&#39;t fire an event when an add wasn&#39;t loading. (Which happens 1 - 25% of the time, depending on your settings.)</p>
<p>So, I ended up using the free IOS module for admob you can find on this forum by searching for jp.masuidrive.ti.admob.  If you search this forum, there is also a user written and free admob module for Android.  My next release of all my apps will also be on android, so I&#39;m looking into that module shortly.</p>
<p>(I little reading up on how to add modules to Titainium may be required, but I found the free IOS admob module very good and straight forward.)</p>
<p>I am a day away from the one month mark using Admob, and today I had an update of an app approved that uses iAds.  From what I&#39;ve read, iAds have a much lower fill rate (8 - 12%) but a MUCH higher payout per click.  We&#39;ll see in a few days if the one app I have approved with iAds does better now than it did with Admob only.  My setup has an internal ad, but on top of that I add an iAd, and if the iAd fails, I load an admob ad.  So, it&#39;s really 3 layers of adds, with iAd the top priority, then Admob, then my own ads.</p>
<p>I spent almost a week retooling my app to be in portrait only mode to use iAds, because from what I can tell Titanium doesn&#39;t support iAds in landscape.  This is an issue, as if a portrait ad is clicked while the device is in landscape, then the whole app orientation gets off, and your app ends up being stuck on a blank screen.  I REALLY hope Titanium will fully support iAds soon, but I can&#39;t get any response in this public Q&amp;A section.  (See this post:<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;124025&#x2F;urgent-iads-wont-work-in-landscape)</p>
<p>I hope that helps!</p>

							<p>I&#39;d love your feedback.  My situation is that my app runs on android and iphone and I&#39;m using the builtin iAd support pretty well, but getting $0 from my android app.  So I&#39;m really focused on support for android&#x2F;admob.</p>
