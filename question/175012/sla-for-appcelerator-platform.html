			<h1>SLA for Appcelerator Platform</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I understand that the Appcelerator Platform public cloud option offers a 99% availability SLA.   I could not find the details behind the SLA.  For example, if the SLA is not met during a particular month, is there a service credit?    Could you please refer me to the correct link to read about this?    Thank you.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Yes if the free service does not achieve 99% then you will be refunded exactly the same amount of money you paid for the free service equal to the level it failed to achieve.</p>
<p>So in detail; you use the free service and it only achieves 98% you are fully entitled to the 1% difference times the amount you spent.</p>
<ul>
<li>1% of £0.00&#x2F;$0.00&#x2F;€0.00 = £0.00&#x2F;$0.00&#x2F;€0.00</li>
</ul>
<p>If this sounds like a flippant answer it is because it is a flippant answer. You do not pay for the free services (as their name implies) so what refund are you hoping to get?</p>
<p>If you are talking specifically about Appcelerator studio (the paid branch) rather than Titanium studio (the free branch) then given the annual fees charged you will have a account handler to assist you with that information.  Also the paid account comes with telephone support amongst other things, which would mean you probably would not need this forum.</p>
<p>If you do not believe the free level will give you what you need talk to Appcelerator about swapping to the paid branch where you could request a specific sla.  You are also welcome to build your own back end as many do.  This is usually due to app infrastructures and companies already having their own Ali servers.</p>
<p>I do not work for Appcelerator, my opinions are my own.</p>
