			<p>Has anyone got the PayPal module for classic mode, as seems that the current module only works for US PayPal accounts, and we are in Australia.</p>
<p>And Classic mode API&#39;s are supported for other countries.</p>

							<div><p>Although I can&#39;t answer your question Steven (sorry) I too have had all kinds of problems with the PayPal module. Mainly to do with it throwing errors (sometimes) when adding up shopping cart items and it&#39;s inability to update the cart as displayed on the PayPal screen when deleting items and re-creating the button. All I can suggest is to contact marketplace-support@appcelerator.com. Given I too am not in the US (am UK based) I just hope once these glitches are sorted I can use it with UK PayPal accounts. We can&#39;t all be US based can we?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The PayPal module works for UK based accounts, although annoyingly it does not allow credit card payments without signing in.</p>
<p>PayPal appear to be making massive changes to the back end services that all appear to be US only availability right now.</p>
<p>My current solution is host the PayPal web page in a <strong>webView</strong>, not ideal but works, which is an important factor, I could use the module but lack of CC support is a big problem with the module.</p>
<p>I can only hope that <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com">stripe.com</a> speeds up it international rollout as it is the opposite of PayPal; it likes its customers, it&#39;s rates are reasonable, it does not lock you out of your account for stupid reasons, it likes developers, it provides many many ways of integrating it to your, site and app.</p>
<p>We will jump to <strong>stripe.com</strong> in a heart beat, which is the sentiment of so many respected developers and businesses.</p>
