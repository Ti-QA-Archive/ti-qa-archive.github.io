			<h1>My first Titanium app is up and approved!</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Good news, my first app is up, and you can see it here:<br><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunes.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;just-clean-jokes&#x2F;id379885430?mt=8&amp;uo=4">iTunes link</a></p>
<p>The interesting bits for fellow developers:</p>
<ul>
<li>compiled with Titanium mobilesdk 1.3.2 and XCode 3.2.3 (supports iOS 4).</li>
<li>although I used a wildcard app ID when I was debugging, I decided to try a specific app ID during packaging, I don&#39;t know if that is required but it worked for me.  So if my wildcard ID is ABCDEFG.*, then I used ABCDEFG.com.mycompany.myapp in final packaging.</li>
<li>although Titanium found all my certificates just fine, and created a package that looked OK to me, it would not upload to the app store, see <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;35291&#x2F;ios-4-upload">this question about entitlements.plist</a> and note that the answer by John Hass did not work for me.</li>
<li>my app name in Titanium does contain spaces, and this is not a problem.  Just the binary uploaded to Apple cannot contain a space.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that the Titanium team doesn&#39;t want us to need to open XCode, but I could not figure out any other way.  Your mileage may vary, and by the time mobilesdk 1.4.0 is released these instructions may be obsolete.  With all that, if you want to try my steps, here is what I had to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>develop and compile as normal with Titanium</li>
<li>close Titanium</li>
<li>open XCode and open up the PROJECT NAME.xcodeproj that was generated by Titanium</li>
<li>Click on project name, get info, and go to configurations tab</li>
<li>copy the Release configuration into a new Distribution configuration</li>
<li>click on build tab and switch to Distribution in the drop-down</li>
<li>under Architectures, Base SDK = iPhone Device 4.0</li>
<li>under Code Signing, Code Signing Identity = the distribution certificate</li>
<li>under Deployment, iPhone OS Deployment Target = iPhone OS 3.0</li>
<li>under User Defined, ensure TI_APPID is the full ABCDEFG.com.mycompany.myapp</li>
<li>finally under the Build menu, click Build and Archive</li>
<li>find the compiled application in the finder, and ZIP it up</li>
<li>remove spaces from the ZIP name</li>
<li>upload to itunesconnect</li>
</ul>
<p>It took 9 days from application submission until approval.</p>

							<p>Not that it&#39;s any of my business, but are you making decent money with your app?  And if so, what methods are you using to promote it?  I&#39;m waiting on approval for a totally different app</p>

										<p><p>Hi Josh, no, it isn&#39;t really that hot… but I attribute that to me not making a game (which seem to sell better) or appealing to a specialized market (there are a decent amount of free clean joke apps alrady).  I am not great at marketing, so I&#39;m not doing much.  Do a Google search for &quot;clean jokes&quot;, find my web site (4th link, Just Clean Jokes) and I have an app store button there. That&#39;s it.</p>
<p>My second app is selling much better (Wedding Jokes, Quotes and Toasts for speeches) due mainly to niche market appeal. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;prairiewest.net&#x2F;weddingjokes&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;prairiewest.net&#x2F;weddingjokes&#x2F;</a> same code base, different material.</p>
