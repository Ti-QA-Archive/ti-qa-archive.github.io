			<p>I am having a problem with a module bought from the marketplace. I am working on a mobile app with another person and for the past few weeks we have not had an issue. Until today, now when I run the app on my phone I get the alert message saying that the module is unlicensed, but for the other person working on it, there is no problem. Can someone enlighten me. I have tried some of the suggestions from other posts, but can&#39;t get it fixed</p>

							<p>The module licensing is all kind of crazy.  </p>
<p>You have an account, the module has a GUID, the project has a GUID.  The guids all have to match up on the Appcelerator side for a module to be able to run.</p>
<p>The very first thing I do when i have an issue like this is increase the GUID of the project by a single digit someplace, clean and rebuild.  Sometimes, the project while associated with your account, doesnt get associated with the purchased (could be free) module. Maybe the GUID for the project was generated before the module was purchased, etc.</p>
<p>If that does NOT work, email the marketplace support and have a tech look into it.</p>

							<p>Hey</p>
<p>I basiclly got the same issue with one &quot;Free&quot; app from the marketplace. What I did to make it work was just to remove the module from the project. Redownload it and install it again. </p>
<p>I hope it will help you aswell</p>

										<p><p>@Manjoi,</p>
<p>Yes I am logged in under the same account in Titanium studio and the market place. The module is listed on my products page. I am using a module called Android Audio Streamer from woohoo studios which we payed $10 for.</p>

										<p><p>Actually, I see this sentence in the module description.</p>
<p>####IMPORTANT NOTE : AAC licensing may be required to play AAC streams and files. Please ensure you understand any licensing implications before downloading this module.</p>
<p>Are you doing anything related to this?</p>

										<p><p>I am not sure. I know we are getting the stream from a legitimate source who must have licensing. I don&#39;t get why it has worked for so long and then all of a sudden it won&#39;t</p>
