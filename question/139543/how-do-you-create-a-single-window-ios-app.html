			<h1>How Do You Create a Single Window iOS App?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a single window app that I made that has worked on my phone and in the simulator. I have submitted 5 different versions of the code to apple and they have all been rejected saying the app never got past the loading screen. But they all worked for me.</p>
<p>I have tried hiding the navbar, I have tried the app.js opening a new main.js window, I have tried just creating a window in app.js and opening it. All of my solutions have worked on my phone and the simulator. I have no idea what is going on here and I can&#39;t just randomly submit the app to apple again. Its been 2 weeks between each review and like I said ive submitted it 5 times now.</p>
<p>I am in serious need of a working example of a single window app that has been approved by apple. How do I properly create the window and how do I add buttons&#x2F;fields to it?</p>
<p>Here is part of my current App.js made with SDK 1.8.2 for iPhone</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> win1 = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
    backgroundImage:<span class="hljs-string">'images/bg.png'</span>,
    navBarHidden: <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>,
    fullscreen:<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>,
    tabBarHidden:<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
});
win1.orientationModes = [Ti.UI.LANDSCAPE_RIGHT];

win1.open();

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> clearname = Titanium.UI.createButton({
    title : <span class="hljs-string">'Clear Name'</span>,
    width : <span class="hljs-number">70</span>,
    height: <span class="hljs-number">30</span>,
    top : <span class="hljs-number">30</span>,
    left : <span class="hljs-number">10</span>
});

clearname.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
    namefield.value = <span class="hljs-string">''</span>;
});


win1.add(clearall);
</code></pre><p>Below this code is more fields in this window and about 3,000 lines of code in several calculation functions.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you for your reply. Unfortunately there are no crash logs since the application is not crashing. For technical assistance, you may wish to consult with Developer Technical Support.&quot;</p>
<p>So I am totally in the dark on this. I am going to rebuild using 2.1.0GA and have analytics turned off and pray that it works.</p>

							<p>To start with, you should be using the latest released SDK which is 2.1.0.GA which resolves a false start bug.</p>
