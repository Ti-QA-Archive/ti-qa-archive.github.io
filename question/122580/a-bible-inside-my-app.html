			<h1>a bible inside my app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi. I want to have a bible inside my app. I know it would be easier to just connect to internet on a webview, but I &#39;d depend on the internet connection, and of course the aviability of it.<br>I want it to be inside my app, have pickers to select the book, chapter, verse and then load from this selection.</p>
<p>Is it possible?<br>Would it be to much info packet in the final app?<br>Which format should I use?<br>and most important: How would it be the best way to do it.</p>
<p>A lot of questions, but I can figure out how to accomplish it.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot.</p>

							<p>This is of course possible. This could possibly be quite large, but you&#39;d have to put it together to find out exactly how big it would be. I&#39;m not sure exactly what you mean by &#39;format&#39;, the bible is in text format, that would seem to be the only way it would be usable. The only way to know the best way to do something would be to do it. Load it into a database, create static local web pages, pull data from the web but load it into native views .. all viable Im sure, but the best way is the way that works best for you.</p>

										<p><p>Personally, I would lean towards the native view on this one. While a little more difficult than the webview, the feel and response of the native view opposed to the webview is more seeming of a bible application.</p>

							<p>I believe you can point the webview at a local HTML file stored on the device.  If so, just format in HTML and use anchor tags and the URL &#39;#&#39; to scroll to any location within the document.</p>
<p>I found a PDF version of the King James which is 2.4 MB, an HTML file might be a bit larger. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bookbindery.ca&#x2F;KJBIBLE.pdf">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bookbindery.ca&#x2F;KJBIBLE.pdf</a></p>

										<p><p>Since this is a Titanium forum and not a HTML&#x2F;Javascript forum I&#39;m not going to go into any detail. Check out <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3schools.com&#x2F;html&#x2F;html_links.asp">HTML Links</a> , specifically &quot;The name Attribute&quot;, and the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3schools.com&#x2F;jsref&#x2F;met_win_scrollto.asp">scrollTo</a> Javascript method.</p>
