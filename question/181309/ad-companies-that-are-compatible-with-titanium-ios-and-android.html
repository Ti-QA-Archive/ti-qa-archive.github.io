			<p>What is everyone using for serving ads whether its banner or interstitial that works with titanium? I started out with admob and revmob and then rev mob had issues when apple went to 64 bit. Currently I can only use the admob module for iPhone. When i try and run it on android it force closes with no real error and there may be permission issues i need to set in the xml for android but have found no real documentation on what to put in it. </p>
<p>I&#39;m looking to generate some revenue with ads but cannot seem to get anything working with android. Are there any success stories out there and what are you using?</p>

							<div><p>The only problem I had with Ti.admob on android was that I couldn&#39;t get interstitial ads working. I just had to provide a banner-ad publisherID (looks something like ca-app-pub-5768798437861981&#x2F;156738498) and everything worked.</p>

							<div><p>I used 2.5.1 also.</p>
<p>I did not need to make any changes to my android manifest, as the module does it for me.</p>
<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;iotashan&#x2F;c31691dd906db0aba352">This is the sum of my code I used to implement admob on Android.</a>.</p>
<p>For iOS, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;platform&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.UI.iOS.AdView">I used iAd</a>.</p>
