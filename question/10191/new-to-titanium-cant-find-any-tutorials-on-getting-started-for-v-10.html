		</header>

			<p>I&#39;ve watched several &quot;tutorials&quot;, but they mostly talked about overviews, features, submitting the app process, etc. … but no real how-to tutorials. So far it seems that you pretty much just have to read the APIs and figure it out yourself. But that&#39;s like reading the dictionary in order to write a short story. It doesn&#39;t help much beyond vocabulary. I need a &quot;follow the instructions as you click here and add this code, then build …&quot;</p>
<p>I finally found one tutorial called &quot;Titanium Mobile: Lab Session (Part Two)&quot; that was sort of a step-by-step guide. That seemed useful, but as soon as I tried to build I received an error that this project couldn&#39;t be built since it was version .04 and I needed code for version .09x or higher! Maybe I&#39;m missing the idea, but if it&#39;s javascript, html, and CSS, then why does that matter? It sure does though.</p>
<p>Anyway, I just need some beginning step-by-step tutorials for a couple of simple apps so I can figure out the workflow and what goes where. I&#39;ve been unable to find any tutorials for version 1.0. And if the code doesn&#39;t build (like the code less than .09 I guess?) I can&#39;t really figure this out.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>Hi Robert, </p>
<p>I&#39;d recommend just playing with the Kitchen Sink demo app and then looking at its source code - you will get a better feel for how things work from there than any of the available tutorials IMHO.</p>
<p>The starting point for a Titanium app is the app.js file. From there you create windows, and within a window attach views to display content (like a Table View, which is an iphone native UI element). This is all written in the javascript API provided by Titanium. </p>
<p>The html&#x2F;css has to do with one type of view, the web view, which is a webkit (browser) instance - the web view will reference an HTML file for its view content and there&#39;s where the html&#x2F;css come into play. So the &quot;develop your apps in html&#x2F;css&quot; is probably somewhat misleading in this sense, it confused me at first as well because I was lead to believe ALL UI content was done in html&#x2F;css, which is not the case.</p>
