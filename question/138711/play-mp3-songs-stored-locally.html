			<h1>PLay mp3 songs stored locally</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I want to play local mp3 files when one of the several button is clicked. I have 17 buttons on a screen , each corresponds to different song. My question is where should we store the mp3 files ,in the resource folder or the filesystem ? Like for storing the app images we generally use a separate folder say img likewise , should i create a folder in resource folder and save all the mp3 files or is there any better way.Is there any way to compress the mp3 files to make the app size small . ?<br>Please provide some code snippet or example.</p>

							<p>You can store your mp3 files in a folder the same way you store your images to keep them separate from the rest of your files. There are ways to compress mp3 files, but for the most part, an mp3 file is already pretty compressed, which is why its such a popular format. If you want to keep your app size small, you can ship the app without the mp3 files and then download them on either first run, or the first time it is played.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Anthony for the answer. I have 20 buttons on a window which will play 20 different sounds. How can i play the different sound when a song is being played and i press the button for the different sound because the interrupt event listener works only when the call is coming to the device.<br>Means i just want to free up the memory when a song is being played and meanwhile i click the button for the other sound , as the create sound hold the memory till it finishes the sound file.</p>

										<p><p>You can call the stop() method on a playing sound. So you&#39;d need to check and see if there is currently a sound playing. If it is, call stop() on the sound, load the new sound and play() it.</p>

										<p><p>Use the isPlaying() method on the Sound object. All this can be found in the docs for <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.0&#x2F;index.html#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Media.Sound">Ti.Media.Sound</a></p>
