							<p>There are choices like macincloud.com that let you rent a mac and give you remote access to it… in fact macincloud has titanium pre-installed and configured…</p>

							<p>As a note, emulating OSX on a system OTHER THAN OSX is illegal. If anyone posts anything regarding a how-to or even a link to a how to, it will be deleted and this question locked… so please everyone, lets stay away from that.</p>

							<p>No. You need a mac to develop for iOs. Emulate OS X will let you do some tests, but for real development, IMHO is not a choice.</p>

							<p>Emulating OSX on a system OTHER THAN OSX is illegal, FYI.  With Lion they just allowed your to emulate a regular OSX install instead of just a server..</p>

							<p>Pawnshops, used computer stores, thrift shops, even big box retailers with clearance specials can be great places to pick up cheap iCrap.<br>Check out 3rd party repair depots too.  Typically anything they have at the time is broken, but if you make nice nice, you can get dibs on leave behinds, trade ups, etc.</p>
<p>Apple fans are nuts and typically will leave old iCrap behind once they lay eyes on their shiny new iCrap.</p>
<p>You&#39;re going to need it too, because they investment for iCrap is an iPhone, an iPad, an iMac and iMeds to deal with the iAneurysm.</p>
