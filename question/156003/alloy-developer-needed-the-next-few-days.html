		<section>
			<p>Hi everyone, I hope it is ok to post this here.</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to get an Alloy app out the door by next week and could use a little extra firepower and know-how.</p>
<p>Would even be interested in a few hours of consulting from an expert to help me get over a few hurdles.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re interested let me know your rates and availability over the next 3-5 days.</p>

<li><p>The app is an Enterprise Distribution.  All of the licensing, provisioning…etc for distribution has been completed. You will not have to deal with any of this.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The existing code is formatted and commented.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This app is for one of our clients, there is money to hire you.  We will pay very promptly.  Work today get paid today.</p>

<p>I would like to hire an Alloy developer to help finish off a project.  You could work between 1 and 5 days.  How much you work during that time depends on you.</p>
