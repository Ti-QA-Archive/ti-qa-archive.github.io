			<p>So, Apple has two states for the APS environment for push notifications. Production and Development. I spent a lot of time just to discover that Ti is always set to production and I was using my dev cert from apple for push notifications. Is there a way to change this on Ti.</p>
<p>Also, God help us can we get some better documentation? Sorry, that&#39;s just a rant, but there is like 0 on getting push running, and when you discover that Ti is always on prod it makes one crazy. Seems like it would be good enough for Ti to set to prod only when building for app store distro.</p>

							<p>From my previous experience with Ti ACS that is not the case. When you are managing your ACS, in the top right you will see a toggle for Production&#x2F;Development. In the Development tab you will need to upload your dev .p12 file. And in the Production tab you would upload your production .p12 file. The Titanium build process will take care of the rest and use the correct one whether you are building the app to your device or building for distribution.</p>

										<p><p>I used the codsign function in terminal on my Mac on the build found in the Workspace folder and it has the aps.environment set to production. My push notification would not send until I was using my production .pem file not my development .pem file.</p>
