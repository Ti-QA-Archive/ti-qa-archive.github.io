			<h1>iOS7 icon causes xcode to export as a Mac app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m trying to submit an iOS7 app, but when I include the <code>appicon-60@2x.png</code> file as required, xcode says the app is a Mac App Archive and not an iOS App Archive. If I remove the 120px icon is it exported correctly as an iOS App Archive, but the app doesnt validate because it&#39;s missing a 120x120 icon.</p>
<p>Has anyone had this before and know of a fix? Thanks!</p>

<p>Missing from your question are a number of important pieces of information.

							<p>I just ran into this problem, what a coincidence. When i validated my app without the iOS7 specific icons, it did validate with only warnings, so i believe it would have let me submit it to the app store, but the bigger issue is what you have pointed out, that it shows up as a Mac App Archive.</p>

										<p><p>Christopher, I just installed the latest build this morning (version 3.1.3.201309132423) and Everything seems to be working now. Must have been a bug that was just fixed. Try install today&#39;s updates and hopefully it&#39;ll fix your issues too!</p>

										<p><p>Thanks db digital. I did try a different build and had the same issue. I eventually went back to the RC build and what worked seemed like just a weird fluke. I removed the -60 icons and did a package, then i added them back and did another package and it showed up as an App Store App the second time. Not sure why it worked. </p>
<p>Also had a weird problem where it added an extra &quot; .0 &quot; to the end of my app version. I have it as 1.5 in tiapp.xml, but when it builds it adds the .0 and it shows as 1.5.0. I had to manually edit the info.plists or there were submission warnings since i named the version as 1.5 in iTunes Connect.</p>

							<p>well, it´s definetly a bug considering the icon-sizes and it&#39;s still existing in 3.1.3.201309132423. what helps is to add the 60 &amp; 60@2x icon as non-default icons. they&#39;re still in the package and recognized by xcode. let the 57px one be the &quot;default&quot; one and the app will show up as iOS app again. (make sure to completely erase the build folder)</p>

							<p>The solution for me was just to launche the app in the Simulator, close XCode and after that let Titanium compile the Distribution package.</p>
