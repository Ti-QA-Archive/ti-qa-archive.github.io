			<h1>Appcelerator Platform Question</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am a consultant that usually evangelises the use of Titanium when asked about mobile development where most of the companies that I work with already either have a Titanium project underway or have evaluated it and what to take the next step and see what it is capable of.</p>
<p>I have yet to come across anyone in this situation that is using the Appcelerator Platform or goes on to use it, it is always Titanium Studio (presumably because there is no capex cost associated with evaluation and beyond etc.)</p>
<p>In some circumstances I have felt that they would be better off using the complete Appcelerator Platform, rather than the limited toolset they have. The problem is that once the app is developed and working they see no need for the additional outlay, and I have no reference point to persuade them otherwise.</p>
<p>I guess my question is have Appcelerator considered a way of allowing independent developers access to the complete platform, perhaps with a no cost&#x2F;low cost entry point for those that meet a set of qualifying criteria?</p>

							<div><p>Hi Rogers,</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if you are still waiting for the answers or not. I believe your question is more related to themarketing and distribution policy of Appcelerator, where as this community is involved in solving&#x2F;raising technical issues. Would you check on the contacts of sales&#x2F;business team of Appcelerator. I hope that might help you.</p>

							<p>Speaking as a publisher of a number of mobile apps, we were able to get by on Titanium Studio for a long time.<br>This year, we needed to move one of our externally-developed apps in-house.  Of course, we opted to migrate from its current native codebases (ios and android) to a Titanium codebase.  This app happens to have a fairly large number of users (approx. 300K).  The app makes heavy use of push notifications.  The free ACS doesn&#39;t allow for that kind of volume, so it was natural to move to Appcelerator Platform.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure what needs your clients had that you felt would be better served by Platform, but my guess is that if those needs were critical enough to their businesses, they would <em>know</em> that it&#39;s time to move to Platform.  If you have to convince them, then maybe those needs aren&#39;t so critical to them.</p>
