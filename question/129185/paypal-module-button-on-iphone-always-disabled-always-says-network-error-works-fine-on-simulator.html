			<h1>Paypal module button on iPhone always disabled, always says network error; works fine on simulator</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>iphone, ios5 &#x2F; ios4.3, SDK 1.8.0.xxx, paypal module 1.0 &#x2F; 1.3, Lion (osx 10.7)</p>
<p>When using Paypal module 1.0 or 1.3 on simulator with SDK 1.8.0.xxx (I&#39;ve tried every version, including some 1.7&#39;s) everything works fine with all environments (None, Sandbox, Live). Perfectly, in fact.</p>
<p>When I try to run it on the device, everything works up until the paypal button, which stays disabled on Sandbox AND Live, and always gives me the error: &#39;Network error. Pay with PayPal not available. Please try again later.&#39; It works fine with the None environment (Demo)</p>
<p>I&#39;ve created my app on x.com and know that works correctly, because when I comment my appID out, I get the message that I have an invalid one. I know I have connectivity, and can put a check beforehand that says I have connectivity, even to paypal.com!</p>
<p>I&#39;m at a loss at this point. I&#39;ve read someone else&#39;s q&amp;a that says it works with Snow Leopard but not Lion, but I don&#39;t have that available to me right now! Anybody have any idea about where to start with this? I&#39;ve been at it for days straight and it&#39;s the last thing I need to do to get it in the app store!</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>Update - In my dev console, I can see DEVELOPER ERROR: FILE SYSTEM CHECK FAILED when it&#39;s run on the device, which, when I google it, says that happens when the phone is jailbroken. I&#39;ve never jailbroken this phone (I have previous ones). I am, obviously, using it for development, so does anyone know if that would throw this flag?</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to try to load it on some friend&#39;s phones hopefully today and see if that is truly the issue. It looks like Paypal fixed this in september with mpl 1.5.5 - anyone know if there will be an updated module anytime soon?</p>

										<p><p>Me too - all this  time later using version 1.6.1 of the PayPal module compiling under Mac OS X 10.7.5 and Ti Studio 3.0.2<br>Exactly the same error message (Network error etc…) on a device (iPod Touch) whereas I can get a working PayPal button on the Emulator.<br>Frustrating to say the least given I have a client who is expecting their app to have a working PayPal system!</p>

										<p><p>I found that the module looks for certain things on the iPhone to determine if it has been jailbroken, or not the original iOS version. It looks like setting it up for development trips that flag. Put another device in your provisioning profile that&#39;s not setup for development, and it will work fine - in my experience at least.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Chris - good to have somebody come back with experience of problems when I always think &#39;is it just me&#39;? - as a further point did you have any trouble with  the PayPal screen failing to update the shopping cart items after editing some in the app? I&#39;m recreating the PP button with a new dictionary and clicking said button but I can&#39;t get the values to update - it shows the same items as it did the first time, or is this also caused by the issue you outlined above?</p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t recall the issue, but for my purposes, I don&#39;t believe that particular issue would have cropped up anyway. It doesn&#39;t sound related, though. We ended up dropping PayPal after we saw the conversion rates of PP vs StoreKit, which still gave us more profit, though I understand that&#39;s not an option for everyone. Does it work if you don&#39;t recreate the PP button? Or if you hit it multiple times, does it update (ie, just not the first time you hit it)?</p>

										<p><p>My client uses PayPal on her website and has requested the app uses it  too. The &#39;not updating&#39; issue is really strange as sometimes it does and sometimes it refuses to. I have info printouts in my console showing when the PP button is being nulled and recreated and the values being sent to it, so I would expect the &#39;My Total&#39; shown at the top of the PP sandbox panel to change as the values in the dictionary I&#39;m sending it change.<br>What does seem to change it is if a new product is added and the total <em>increases</em>. But not when an item is deleted or the shipping cost is changed, all of which are being correctly set in the dictionary. It&#39;s as if the old values are being cached by PP and is quite mad - not to say maddening!<br>I supposed this is the only PayPal option available for Appcelerator apps that is acceptable to Apple?</p>
