			<p>Hi friends,</p>
<p>As my first try, I&#39;ve started Ti Dev and, as suggested in the guides, created an testapp for Android (on Windows 7).</p>
<p>Clicking &quot;Launch&quot; starts the Android emulator showing the phone but a cmd window shows error: &quot;Error Loading Preferences&quot;.</p>
<p>After a while Ti Dev shows: &quot;javac&quot; is either incorrect or incorrectly written.</p>
<p>I would appreciate your help.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Miguel</p>

							<p>Hi Miguel</p>
<p>Please follow the instructions at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.appcelerator.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;installing_on_windows.html#install_diagnostics_for_windows">Install Diagnostics for Windows</a>. Copy the output and paste it to your preferred pastebin service. It&#39;s important that you do not modify it <strong>in any way</strong>, as this could mask problems with your configuration. Do <strong>NOT</strong> paste it here! This is because the system will change the formatting.</p>
<p>Please create and share a screenshot of your android installed packages.</p>
<p>Also, state the processor and RAM installed to your system.</p>
<p>Then I will help you further.</p>

<p>The &quot;Error Loading Preferences&quot; message can safely be ignored, as far as I know, as it doesn&#39;t have any adverse effects. It happens on all windows systems.</p>
<p>Are you able to use Titanium now? If any problems still persist, please follow the instructions in my last message, and I will try to help you.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>what do you mean by &quot;your preferred pastebin service&quot;?</p>

<p>A screenshot won&#39;t be useful. Paste the actual output to <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;">pastebin.com</a> and then paste the resulting url here.</p>

										<p><p>Your system configuration seems fine. However, please would you upload a screenshot of your android packages to an image sharing service, like <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;imageshack.us&#x2F;">imageshack</a>?</p>
<p>Please state the processor and RAM installed to your system.</p>

										<p><p>If it&#39;s that the app will not launch, you may need to delete your project build files and force a full rebuild.</p>
<p>For android, delete <strong>the contents of the immediate subdirectories</strong> of <code>&amp;#x2F;build&amp;#x2F;android</code>. Don&#39;t delete the immediate subdirectories, otherwise you may encounter problems. Watch ticket <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32238-titanium-mobile&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;2852">#2852</a> to be updated by email of a resolution to this issue. Then click the <em>Save Changes</em> button to force a full rebuild and launch the app.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Personally, I would remove all packages related to Honeycomb, as I have seen them cause problems with other users.  Anyway, Titanium doesn&#39;t support it at this time. Remember to delete all your existing AVDs after deleting these packages.</p>
<p>Can you clear your build directories, as explained above, and then launch your app with Titanium 1.4.3? If you don&#39;t have it already installed, you can download it from the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.appcelerator.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;continuous_builds.html">Continuous Builds</a> site (use the drop-down menu to select it).</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

							<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>thanks a lot for answering so fast.</p>
<p>Before your answer arrived to my email, I found that the error produced for &quot;javac&quot; was my fault as I made a typo when entering it in PATH. So this problem is solved.</p>
<p>But still, the problem with Android remains:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>&quot;Error Loading Preferences&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>on TiDev: Timed out waiting for android.process.acore</p>
</li>
<li><p>on Android&#39;s emulator: Sorry! Process system is not responding &lt;Force Close&gt; &lt;Wait&gt;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For this you need any extra info? or is easy for you to see where the problem resides?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Miguel</p>
