			<h1>iOS Annotation</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all. I am pretty new to iOS development so don&#39;t smile on my question. </p>
<p>  I have app that shows map view and have annotations. Want to add button on every annotation and to show data from database. I already have that view that I want to show, because from app I have detail view for objects in database. But when I try to load that view from map annotation app crashes. Manage to put simple white page on view but this one that I need no… </p>
<p>  Can anyone help me with what to put instead of simple push for view to manage to read data from database and show detail view.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<div><p>I understand what your going for, but 2 things:</p>
<p>1) Please post code samples for things like this, otherwise its like asking the community to write your app for you.</p>
<p>2) Please make your question titles more descriptive in the future, this will make it far easier for others to help you. Just saying &quot;iOS Annotation&quot; is more like a tag then a question.</p>
