			<h1>Handling table edits on different screens?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have an app that is an iPad tabbed app, with each tab being its own js file.</p>
<p>All of them relate to data from a database. On the first tab, you can select items from the database to add to your selections.  The items you selected are stored in User Data. </p>
<p>The second tab displays the selections and allows you to delete them.</p>
<p>The third and fourth tab allows you to view data from the database based on the selections (e.g. different data based on the selections).</p>
<p>To ensure tabs 3,4 display the most current selections, I have a focus handler doing the SQL statements and bulding the table again on focus.  This works ok, a little bit of a redraw but not bad.</p>
<p>The problem I am having is the third that is a checklist where the user changes state of row items (some can be &quot;checked&quot;).  Due to the onFocus event, the table is redrawn even if the data has not changed, erasing the checkmarks (due to redrawing the default unchecked state).</p>
<p>I can live with losing the checked state if the user adds items on tab 1 or removed items on tab 2.</p>
<p>What&#39;s the best way to handle this?  Thanks</p>

							<p>If you have non database stored data that affects the ui state, then you should try thinking about storing reference data somewhere to allow you to handle that in a reasonable way. For example, you can keep some hash of data that keeps track of whether or not a box is checked, so that when you do a redraw of the page, then you can reference that variable to see if the item should be checked or not. If you need this to persist across relaunch of the app, you can write that data to the system using the Properties API.</p>
<p>On a side note, rather than re-querying the db upon each focus, you can try setting a global property that lets each page know that data has changed and that you need to re-query, this will save you some cycles for when there is no reason to re-query the db because no info has changed.</p>

										<p><p>@anthony-decena<br>When you say &quot;global variable&quot;, I assume I will have to write this to UserData – or is there a better way to share a global variable across JS files?</p>

										<p><p>You can use the properties api to handle this data if you&#39;d like. Otherwise you&#39;re entire app would need to be properly namespaced in such a way that the top level namespace is accessible in other files.</p>
