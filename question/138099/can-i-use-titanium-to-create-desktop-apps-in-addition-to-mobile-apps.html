			<h1>Can I use Titanium to create desktop apps in addition to mobile apps?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>As I understand it, originally Titanium could build apps that ran on Windows, Mac OSX, iPhone and iPad, and Androids. Blackberries seem to have been added to the list, but I don&#39;t see mention of using Titanium to build desktop apps any more.  I would really like to use one platform to cover both desktop and mobile.  Does Titanium still do that?</p>

							<p>Unfortunately, Appcelerator has discontinued work and support on Titanium Desktop:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2012&#x2F;01&#x2F;the-future-of-titanium-desktop.html">Appcelerator Blog: Future of Titanium Desktop</a></p>
<p>The project will be made open source for the community to develop. However, as a few people state in the comments of that blog post, if the community doesn&#39;t work on it, it&#39;ll just die. If I were to be asked, I&#39;d have to say Desktop isn&#39;t dead, but it&#39;s pretty close. :&#x2F;</p>

										<p><p>Hi Tom. The Desktop Project is not dead and we are working toward a release candidate that we may be in a position to release a candidate for evaluation over the next week. We currently have builds on all platforms we support and have been working through tests to determine their quality. We have some testing and rebranding work left before we release.</p>
<p>I had recently taken over as the Project Lead to see this occur. As part of this I prepared a budget for submission to Appcelerator yesterday as we need a Continuous Integration system to develop a project like this destined for multiple OS&#39;s. Appcelerator had its own system in place and it surprises me that they believe we could continue without such a system.</p>
<p>We needed $2104 to start this up and $797 per month to run our servers which could also potentially  double  for network packaging of apps. This would allow you to send requests for packaging fromthe platform you are developing on to get packages for them all.</p>
<p>Appcelerator flatly denied the request in an email I received indicating our expectations for the type of support they were offering was excessive and beyond their capabilities. Kevin Whinnery advised he would be making a public statement on this on the Titanium Desktop Transition mailing list on Google groups yesterday which has not yet been seen. Needless to say this is disappointing to the small group of dedicated folks that are working to see this continue. You will see our plans at:</p>
<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;TideSDK&#x2F;TideSDK&#x2F;wiki">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;TideSDK&#x2F;TideSDK&#x2F;wiki</a></p>
<p>We will assess Kevin&#39;s statement when it comes and determine next steps. The code base is large and complex and we need a combination of legal, financial and some short term technical consultation with Appcelerator as we work through this.</p>
