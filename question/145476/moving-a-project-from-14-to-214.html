			<h1>Moving a project from 1.4 to 2.1.4</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have an iPhone project that is in the app store and runs on Appcelerator 1.4.<br>I have had to update the app, and find 1.4 to be very unstable on iOS6 (no idea why, all my natively written apps ran fine on iOS6)</p>
<p>I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that it would be best to update to a newer version of Appcelerator (2.1.4), however I find I get seemingly random crashes - it doesn&#39;t seem to be backwards compatible. </p>
<p>Does anyone have any advice (except for rewriting the app natively, which I am tempted to do) for how to go about solving these &#39;random&#39; crashes?</p>

							<div><p>not to be snippy, but are you going to be using iOS sdk 4.2  and xCode 3 (or the cutting edged at the time xCode 4.0) to build your native apps for iOS 6?</p>
<p>TiMobile SDK 1.4 was released TWO YEARS AGO. We are only on the 5th iteration of the iPhone. So you want to know why its such a pain to updated from tooling that is nearly 20% the age of an entirely new industry?</p>
<p>You would be hard pressed to take 2 year old native objective c and build it against a current iOS sdk with current tooling without problems and&#x2F;or &#39;random crashes&#39;.</p>

							<p>Hi Marc,</p>
<p>looks like you have to go the hard way and study <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;">release notes</a> for big changes and possible obsolete functions concerning your application.</p>
<p>Also look at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Titanium_Compatibility_Matrix">Titanium Compatibility Matrix</a>.</p>
<p>Try to isolate the crashing parts of your app and fix that stuff.</p>
<p>Good luck,</p>
<p>Matthias</p>

										<p><p>Thanks. Yes I&#39;ll have a good ol&#39; study of the documentation and try and get it working on 2.1.x - I imagine the differences between versions will become smaller over time so this will be less of a problem going forward.</p>
