			<h1>Change Tab Window in TabGroup</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello guys,</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to change a tab group&#39;s window in iOS.<br>As of <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.UI.Tab-method-setWindow">tab.setWindow()</a>, it should be possible to set the root window. However it doesn&#39;t seem to work, even if the method is not stated to be read-only. The tab simply does not refresh.<br>I&#39;ve seen <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;133182&#x2F;how-do-you-dynamically-refreshreload-a-tab-window">this post</a> already, the thread posters think it might be a bug.</p>
<p>Can any official member confirm this to be a bug?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I do not know if I am considered an &quot;..official member…&quot;, but I am number 3 on the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;top-100-experts">experts list</a> :-) </p>
<p>A few days ago I spent quite some time investigating this exact same subject for another persons question.</p>
<p>Despite the documentation providing both a property called <strong>window</strong> and a method called <strong>setWindow</strong>, neither of these actually have any effect on the tabs or the window stack within the tabs.  Strangely neither the property or method reports an error during use.</p>
<p>The property <strong>window</strong> is not denoted as <strong>read-only</strong> in the documentation and if it was it would then not have the matching method <strong>getWindow</strong>.</p>
<p>At this stage it is unclear if this is a bug or a documentation error.</p>
<p>I have tried this in Ti SDK 2.1.4 and Ti SDK 3.0.0 with the same results.</p>

										<p><p>I have create a quick proof of concept app for you to show how you can have several tabs as normal then remove a tab and add a different tab back into the tabgroup.</p>
<p>To test this code create a new default project and replace the code in the <strong>app.js</strong> with the code below.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> win1 = Ti.UI.createWindow({
    backgroundColor: <span class="hljs-string">'#fff'</span>,

    tabGroup.removeTab(tab3);
    tabGroup.addTab(tab4);
    tabGroup.setActiveTab(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>);
    tabGroup.setActiveTab(<span class="hljs-number">0</span>);
});
win1.setRightNavButton(btn1);

										<p><p>The <strong>addTab</strong> method only adds to the current stack so it would add to the end.  However there is no real reason why you could not remove all or some of the tabs and re-build from there.</p>

										<p><p>Hello Malcolm,</p>
<p>Thanks again for the code. I had some time to test it.<br>However I think that for my purpose this solution won&#39;t be sufficient (Though I will mark it as the best answer, since it actually solves the problem I described). I will briefly explain what I want to acomplish so that others having similar questions will find a way to solve this.</p>
<p>So my app&#39;s structure will be very dynamic. I have a webinterface where I can add category and pages in a hierarchy (which are stored as a tree in a sqlite database). When the app launches, it fetches the root node and its direct children (to save bandwidth). Is the type of the root node a &quot;tab&quot;, so will all direct children be the tabs. Since they describe only the tab, the 2nd children level of the root node (children of children of the root node) for the first node needs to be loaded as well (of course the first tab needs to have some content since it will be shown automatically on startup). This tab may contain a dashboard, a list or be a page itself (webview) as well.</p>
<p>Now the thing is, I want content to &quot;time-out&quot; after a previously defined amount of time. Let&#39;s say after 30 minutes the content of a branch will be reloaded. This may happen if the user switches to another tab and then switches back to the previous tab. The reload will be necessary so that news can be displayed or other realtime content. Of course it is unlikely that a user really has the app open for 30 minutes, but I want it to stay dynamic (think of a ticker, where a much shorter amount of time will be necessary). Only that specific branch and its direct children will be loaded, so that not the whole application structure has to be fetched.</p>
<p>For now I&#39;ve done it the following way: Each time a selection is made (tab content clicked, list item clicked, dashboard item etc.) a new window will be pushed onto the navigation stack. This makes it easy to let windows be dynamic (I have functions for creating a dashboard window, list windows and pages for instance).<br>But imagine the user switches to one tab and back to the other again after its content has timed-out. Now I&#39;d need to pop the root window and set it to another window (for instance when I would change the application structure, let&#39;s say I don&#39;t want to use a dashboard anymore, but a list view).</p>
<p>So that it seems to be impossible to re-set a tab&#39;s window, I will have to work with views. I will not create dashboard windows or list windows or page windows, I will simply create views of them and manage my own windowing system with pushing windows onto a stack and popping them.</p>

							<p>Thanks for your help.<br>This was also my observation, none of these methods has any impact on the UI. I was looking for a long time whether I was missing a &quot;refresh&quot; method somewhere :-)</p>
<p>Since it is not possible to change the root window in a tab, is it somehow possible to remove the tab, create a new tab at the current position and select this tab? This would be a hack of course, but be sufficient for my purpose</p>
