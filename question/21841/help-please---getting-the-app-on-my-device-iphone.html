			<p>Ok so I got my dev program enrollment complete with Apple!<br>I&#39;ve got all the certs and stuff and I&#39;m ready to run the app on my phone.</p>
<p>…but…</p>
<p>The titanium app seems to add the app to itunes and expect you to sync.<br>But I don&#39;t normally sync my phone to this itunes.<br>So if I sync apps (and select the one app that I built available to me) it warns me that all app data on my phone will be replaced.</p>
<p>Is it seriously the case that I have to erase all apps to get my app on the hardware?</p>

							<p>Well I&#39;m not concerned with why it is how it is - or who&#39;s fault it is. I just need to figure out how to not wipe all the data on my phone.</p>
<p>But doesn&#39;t apple have the &quot;Build and Go&quot; option in xcode?<br>Does that still require itunes?</p>
<p>I can&#39;t seriously be the only guy who develops on a machine other than where his primary itunes library is. </p>

							<p>Incase some other worried soul runs into this and finds this thread… here&#39;s what happened.</p>
<p>In the end risking all my data was worth it if it resulted in my beautiful app was on actual hardware.<br>So I did it.</p>
<p>In the end I did end up losing some apps.<br>But most were still on the phone afterwards with local data intact.<br>(the important ones thankfully)</p>
<p>had to reorganize all my screens, and I&#39;ll have to re-download some apps…</p>
<p>worth it.</p>

							<p>This is how Apple keeps people from getting content (apps, music, movies, etc) without paying for it. To get the app on your device, it will need to sync with an iTunes and if its not your normal iTunes, your device will get erased and that new iTunes content put on it. Again, this is how Apple does things, its not a Titanium issue.</p>

							<p>Hey Doug,</p>
<p>I&#39;m <em>pretty</em> sure you&#39;ll be okay.  At some point last year I had the same dilema and if I remember right nothing actually got erased.</p>
<p>No guarantee, though.  Sorry, wish I could tell you for sure.  :(  Maybe do a full backup to your other iTunes first just in case so you can restore it if things do go south?</p>

							<p>I believe what it did for me was &quot;synced&quot; them.<br>Meaning both itunes and ipod had the same items on them after I was done.</p>

							<p>Follow these instructions to add a new computer so you can sync… Apple only allows you 5 authorized computers.<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;kb&#x2F;HT1848?viewlocale=en_US</p>
