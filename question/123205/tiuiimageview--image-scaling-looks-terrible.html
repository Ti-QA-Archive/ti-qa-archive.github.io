			<h1>Ti.UI.imageView : image scaling looks terrible</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey all,</p>
<p>I have been using an imageView for some UI elements, at some point in the application these get scaled up and down by changing their width and height properties but this looks terrible. It appears that at some point they are being resized to the imageView size so upscaling results in a blurry image. Even if I create them &#39;big enough&#39; to incorporate the possible scaling they do not behave well and can end up blurry even when at their original size.</p>
<p>Checking through the archives it appears a workaround is to use the backgroundImage property instead of the image property, but, I am creating these images dynamically so they are just image blobs which are not supported by the backgroundImage property (it only accepts urls). I could obviously save these off to disk then load them into the backgroundImage from there but this will incur a speed hit whilst doing so and a potential stall that I want to avoid.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any other workaround for scaling issues using imageView.image or other ideas how to load the imageView.backgroundImage without having to go via disk or any other options here?</p>
<p>To be sure I am using 1.7.2 on iPhone.</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<p>Martin</p>

							<p>We ran into this issue as well with the scaling. We had it when going from landscape to portrait, so what we did was statically set the height and width so the image doesn&#39;t get resized. We found when the images gets sized again and again it got blurrier and blurrier.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the hint Steven.  I&#39;ve hacked around this now by keeping the original image blob around and resetting the imageView.image property <strong>after</strong> the width or height have changed. </p>
<p>Not exactly pretty but functional.</p>
