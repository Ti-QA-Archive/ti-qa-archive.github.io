			<h1>A lots of elements make the app slow</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>In my apps I have some window with a lots of element. For example, one of my window, have a calendar that I made using view, label and imageview and on the same page I have a list of users, plus a bunch of other stuff.</p>
<p>So, in the end, I can have up to 300 or 500 elements to the window.<br>And sometime, building all thoses elements take lots of time.</p>
<p>I manage to make it a lots faster if I add them all to a view, and only at the end, I add the view to the window. But sometime it&#39;s still slow.</p>
<p>So, what are your tips to make the application faster.<br>I know my calendar take a lots of elements, so if I create a module, will this make it faster or pretty much the same?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

							<p>Hi Etienne</p>
<p>If you speed issues specifically relate to the redrawing of those elements - due to the number of them - then it may relate more to the number of redraws required when laying out views that are dependant on each other for dimensions.</p>
<p>Try using the new methods found in the 2.0 or higher SDKs.  As shown here</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in">view</span>.startLayout(); <span class="hljs-comment">// this before you start setting and widths, heights and positions</span>
<span class="hljs-built_in">view</span>.top = <span class="hljs-number">50</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// just an example</span>
<span class="hljs-built_in">view</span>.left = <span class="hljs-number">50</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// just an example</span>
<span class="hljs-built_in">view</span>.finishLayout(); <span class="hljs-comment">// this once you have finished them</span>

<span class="hljs-comment">// where is the parent to the many views you are adding - so it could be the window, or a sub view itself that takes the place of `view`.</span>
</code></pre><p>Think of these two commands as setting up a batch process, using <code>startLayout()</code> tells the device to not redraw anythgin whilst laying it out - all calculations work exactly the same way, just it stop refreshing the screen for each change made.  Then when you have made all the changes for this section use <code>finishLayout()</code>, this lets the device know it can now show everything in one go.</p>
<p>The principle here is to reduce the amount of time spent adding, moving and changing things - each of which cause a redraw event.</p>
<p>Benefits varying - the more redraws required, the faster things will get for you - as it does not need to do them.</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

										<p><p>It affects anything that may cause one or more child views to adjust their size and&#x2F;or position.</p>
<p>So if you add a view to another view then if it has to work out where it is in relation to other child views then - yes should improve it.</p>
<p>If you add 10 items that automatically positioned themselves against each other - using the <code>layout</code> property for example, then those elements may move around depending on the size of the container or changes to the child elements themselves.</p>
<p>It does not improve everything though - as sometimes things you may expect to redraw - actually do not - so no time saving.</p>
<p>Because it is so quick to add the start and finish method calls before and after you make any changes - it is really easy to test performance.</p>
<p>Great documentation about it <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Titanium+2.0+Layout+Changes#Titanium2.0LayoutChanges-BatchLayoutUpdates">here</a>.</p>

							<p>From our (modest) experience with loads of views, drawing them in a html canvas in a WebView is the fastest way. You will have only one view and one event listener for the touch events. You will need to calculate the calendar cells from the (x,y) touch but that is straightforward.</p>

										<p><p>In our case, we use the canvas only for the grid-like view (your calendar). The tableviews and other native elements are in the Titanium context and communicate with the WebView via Ti.App.fireEvent .</p>
