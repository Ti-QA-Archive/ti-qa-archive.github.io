			<h1>Video is black, but I hear audio - Android</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>So on android, 4.0.3 on my ASUS Transformer tablet, I cannot get the video to show up. I can hear the audio and use the controls to skip around. I have this video player inside a modal window. The same code works on iPhone, iPad (and their emulators) as well as on old LG Thrive with android 2.2. What the hell is going on…</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var vidPlayer = Ti.Media.createVideoPlayer({
    <span class="hljs-variable">width</span>:<span class="hljs-number">320</span>,
    <span class="hljs-variable">height</span>:<span class="hljs-number">240</span>,
    top:<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,
    left:<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,
    backgroundColor:<span class="hljs-string">'#ffffff'</span>,
    autoplay:<span class="hljs-keyword">false</span>,
    allowsAirPlay:<span class="hljs-keyword">true</span>
});
win.<span class="hljs-built_in">add</span>(vidPlayer);
</code></pre><p>this loads the video</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">loadVideo</span><span class="hljs-params">(path)</span>
</span>{
    vidPlayer.url = path;
    vidPlayer.play();
}
</code></pre><p>Soooo, same code into a <code>new</code> empty project, the video plays fine. In my existing project it has to be conflicting with something, I just can&#39;t figure it out and I cannot really display the code as it is proprietary and I am not allowed to show it.</p>
<p>I guess has anyone run into this issue before. I&#39;ve seen quite a few threads on android video that has audio but no video. All of which seemed to have been video codec issues, which isn&#39;t my case.</p>

							<div><p>That is correct. That at least means it isn&#39;t an encoding problem with the video. Now I am making a little bit of progress. The way my video is presented in my actual window is in a full screen modal window.</p>
<p>I created a fresh app and just placed the video player on the first tab that comes with a new app template. The video played fine. I then removed that video player and put a button on the first tab that said <code>open modal</code></p>
<p>Upon clicking and opening a modal window, I was able to replicate the same behavior. Black video with only audio. I just found this out so it has to do with the video player being opened in a modal window. I am not sure if its entirely because of the modal or if its a certain setting on the modal window, but I am going to a little more playing around in this video test app I made to see if I can get it working within the modal</p>

							<p>Alright so I have determined the issue here. The video in my actual app opens in a modal window.</p>
<p>I created a fresh app with the two tabs that comes as a template. I&#39;m sure you all know what I am talking about. I added the code to the first window that you saw in my first post. The video played fine.</p>
<p>My second test was to remove the code I just put in and add a button to the first window. This button would open a modal window. Upon clicking the button, the modal window opens and I replicate the issue I am having in my actual app. No video, just audio (although the video controls have always been visible up to this point).</p>
<p>So, next step is start weeding out the minor properties on the window like <code>navBarHidden</code> and <code>fullscreen</code>. Alast, removing those did nothing.</p>
<p>Final step, I removed the property on the window of <code>modal = true;</code> and viola! Working video and audio.</p>
<p>I am still not sure as to why the video showed up fine on my older Android 2.2 GoPhone, but did not work with this brand new ASUS Transformer tablet with Android 4.0.3</p>
<p>Hopefully my findings will help some people in the future and save them some time. I&#39;ll submit this as a bug and report back here with updated information</p>
