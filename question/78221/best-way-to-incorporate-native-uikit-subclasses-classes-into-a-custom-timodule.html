			<h1>Best way to incorporate native UIKit-Subclasses classes into a custom TiModule</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>currently, i want to port some iOS native code into a custom TiModule. My original code contains a UIViewController and a UIView (no Titanium SDK integration yet, just plain iOS-SDK). The code works well, when being compiled and run in Xcode.<br>Now i need to know what is the best practice to incorporate the existing code into a custom TiModule. I prefer not to rewrite my UIViewController and UIView to subclasses of TiUIViewController&#x2F;TiUIProxy&#x2F;TiUIView. I think it would be less work to implement some sort of <em>adapter</em> using the Ti-Classes.</p>
<p>I already tried to instantiate the UIViewController from a TiUIView (with its own TiUIProxy) in my TiModule and then add the UIViewController&#39;s view to the TiUIView. The bad thing about it is, that UIButtons and UITextFields&#x2F;UITextAreas inside my UIView get overlayed with some other views that are layed out by the Ti-SDK, so touch-interaction with the UIView and its subviews just isn&#39;t possible.</p>
<p>Can anyone recommend a way to achieve the goal <em>without having to rewrite my UIKit-Classes into Ti-Classes</em>? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.</p>

										<p><p>Unfortunately, there seems to be no other information than the module developers guide which only scratches the surface of module development. In the meantime, i got it to work. But it was a real pain to get there as a lot of problems occurred during the implementation.<br>What i did was to rewrite my native iOS code into TiUIView and TiUIViewProxy classes. But i had to deal with lots of problems like threading issues, lack of documentation on the Obj-C side of the Ti framework, et cetera. I am seriously thinking about abandoning the whole Ti stuff because for what i need, the JavaScript part of it lacks too many features and extending functionality by implementing your own modules is way too complex and time consuming.</p>
