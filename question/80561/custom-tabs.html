			<h1>Custom Tabs</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I came across someone who had created their own custom tabs but cant seem to find it again.</p>
<p>Essentially I would like to emulate the default tabs but allow for more control especially height and width as well as scrollabitily and allowing complete fullscreen.</p>
<p>Does anybody know of a good example of this, something that will demonstrate the best method ?</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;ve started to work on this anyway here is the gist: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;703723</p>
<p>The issues I&#39;m having is that the label gets in the way of the eventlistener and so only changes that area. (it shouldn&#39;t)</p>
<p>I was thinking of assigning my own id to the label and view that way I would know what has been clicked and I would also be able to set the active tab from the outset.<br>This presents its own issues in that when I try to refer to the view by name nothing happens and it doesn&#39;t register.</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

							<p>Hi Kevin</p>
<p>I think you mean the code that Christian kindly gave to the community. You will find his post, about a custom tabgroup class, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;46801&#x2F;giving-to-the-community-custom-tabgroup-class-working-on-android-and-iphone">here</a></p>
<p>Cheers  :)</p>
