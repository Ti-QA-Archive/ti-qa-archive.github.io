			<p>Before I change my subscription to get the additional modules, can anyone tell me if the UA Android module for push notifications is working fine? Digging through all the posts here lead me to believe there are known issues with it.</p>
<p>Many thanks!</p>

							<p>The Urban Airship for Android module has recently been updated to support the newest release of the Urban Airship SDK. This module has been in beta for a couple of weeks and there were a few reported issues that were identified and fixed this week. Specifically there was a problem with the way that C2DM messaging was targeted. Those issues have been resolved and there will be a refresh of the beta version of the module early next week.</p>
