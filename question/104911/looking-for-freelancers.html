			<p>I have a somewhat large app under construction and I need 1 or possibly 2 people to assist me in the following areas:</p>
<p>1) Optimization - this is my first iPhone app based on Titanium, and I&#39;d like to have someone around who can dig into the code and find places to really make everything more efficient and make this app as responsive as possible.</p>
<p>2) New Feature Development - The app itself has a couple different areas of functionality, and while we have scenario wireframes and designs, I&#39;m looking for someone to help us get everything done on a tight timeline.</p>
<p>3) UI Polish - Having everything functional is job #1, but we also want it to look amazing. We are looking first for someone with great design skill, but if you are willing and able and even eager to jump into the code and apply your design to the elements, that will score you huge points.</p>
<p>I think that what I&#39;m asking for fits 2 people, but if there is a magical person out there with talent in all these areas, I&#39;m definitely excited to talk to you. Anyone who is interested please shoot me an email at trevize111 @ gmail . com.</p>
