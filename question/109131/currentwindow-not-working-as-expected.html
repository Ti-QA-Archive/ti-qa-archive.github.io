			<h1>CurrentWindow not working as expected</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve got a real painful issue that I&#39;ve been working on through the night (stubbornly).  I&#39;m trying to use the tabs example posted in another thread(see link at bottom).  In my example I&#39;m having a very odd issue.  If I make a certain tab the initial tab (of course the one I want to be the initial) when the screen loads nothing is clickable.  I can see via the debug log that the clicks are being registered to a window and not the buttons.  For other files this doesn&#39;t happen.</p>
<p>In the event code that opens the window I have:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Ti.<span class="hljs-keyword">App</span>.addEventListener('addTabGroupWindow', function(<span class="hljs-keyword">e</span>) {

    Ti.API.info('<span class="hljs-keyword">window</span> ' + <span class="hljs-keyword">e</span>.name + '(' + <span class="hljs-keyword">e</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">window</span> + ') <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> ' + <span class="hljs-keyword">e</span>.tabgroup + ' opened '+<span class="hljs-keyword">e</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">window</span>.name);

    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">window</span> = {

        <span class="hljs-keyword">window</span>: <span class="hljs-keyword">e</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">window</span>, 
        name: <span class="hljs-keyword">e</span>.name

    };

    windowStack.push(<span class="hljs-keyword">window</span>);

    <span class="hljs-keyword">e</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">window</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>();
    <span class="hljs-keyword">e</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">window</span>.show();

});
</code></pre><p>The url value of the window is already set and seems to be working.  However for this specific js file the following line of code dont work as expected (placed at the top of the js file):</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Ti.API.info('win.<span class="hljs-property">name</span> ' + Ti.UI.currentWindow.<span class="hljs-property">name</span>);
</code></pre><p>Basically the reference to currentWindow isn&#39;t the same as the one opened in the section before.  Even weirder is that if I start removing sections of the js file the info statement starts working (even though it&#39;s code much further done).  It&#39;s almost like something in the preprocessing of the file is breaking the reference to currentWindow.  I&#39;m totally lost, tired and a bit frustrated - any help is appreciated.</p>

							<div><p>Not sure if this makes any sense, but part of this feels like it may have to do with the file size of the JS… </p>
<p>Also are there any other places I could try to debug?  I dont see anything interesting in the traces.</p>

							<div><p>Thanks for offering - I actually figured it out.  It seems to have been a timing thing, if I tried to add the tabgroup before or after the main window open I had the problem however if I add it in the eventlistener (open) for th window the issue goes away.</p>

							<div><p>@Paul…. <strong>if you read closely what I wrote…</strong> you will see I said &quot;post a complete project… here is the important part..<strong>&quot;that demonstrates the problem&quot;</strong>, I did not say post the WHOLE project… and I have a clear grasp of the rules and regulations of the forum…</p>

							<div><p>heh, Aaron, my post wasn&#39;t for your benefit, as I am well aware how much time you have spent here. However, it&#39;s rarely necessary for users to post more than the stripped-down contents of a app.js file, whereas &quot;a complete project&quot; implies, to me anyway, all the associated files and directories.</p>
<p>Anyway, well done for sorting it, Frank! :)</p>

							<div><p>Thanks - honestly when I got it I was relieved and frustrated as I spent almost 10 hours of trial and error.  I wish I understood WHY the issue was occurring.  I guess that&#39;s one of the negatives of the abstraction appcelerator presents, you never really understand the internals properly.</p>
