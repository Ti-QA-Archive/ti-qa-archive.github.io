			<h1>Facebook open graph stopped working this morning</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, </p>
<p>The facebook open graph search on our published app stopped working this morning. (returns 0 results everytime) </p>
<p>I was hoping somebody might have information as to any changes that may have happened recently (overnight?) to cause this. We are using the Ti - Facebook - requestWithGraphPath module and it has been working perfectly up till now. </p>
<p>The open graph tool on facebook is still working fine (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.facebook.com&#x2F;tools&#x2F;explorer) and there doesn&#39;t seem to be any current API errors on their end. </p>
<p>Any ideas would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!</p>

<p>If any body knows what could of caused the three day down time, I&#39;d be interested in finding out to try and avoid it happening again. Thanks!</p>
