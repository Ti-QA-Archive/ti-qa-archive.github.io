			<h1>Unable to build app for Android in Mac</h1>

		<section>
			<p>I hace created a new project and which I am trying to build the sample application for Android and deploy it in the Android emulator. It is failing and is giving me the following error:</p>
<p>&#x2F;TitaniumWorkspace&#x2F;Test Application&#x2F;build&#x2F;android&#x2F;bin&#x2F;app.ap_&quot;<br>child_process.js:915<br>  var r = this._handle.spawn(options);<br>                       ^<br>TypeError: Bad argument<br>[ERROR] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 8</p>
<p>I have installed everything fresh on my Mac OS X 10.9.4. I am not sure as to why it is not building. I have not tried it with a real device. But is build perfectly for iPad and iPhone.</p>

							<div><p>Hi Stephen,</p>
<p>I have provided all the information that and also the error log. But I think I should be providing more information. Yes, I have been using the forum for more than 2 years and this is the first time I got a down vote. None the less, I think, this is an important issue and needs to be discussed on the forum so, I will proceed.</p>

										<p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Android Build-tools was not installed during the setup and that was causing the issue. I followed the following github link:</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;issues&#x2F;131</p>
<p>But now when building the Android project it is giving the following issue:</p>
<p>[INFO] :   Aligning zip file: null &quot;-v&quot; &quot;4&quot; &quot;&#x2F;Users&#x2F;soumya&#x2F;Development&#x2F;TitaniumWorkspace&#x2F;Test Application&#x2F;build&#x2F;android&#x2F;bin&#x2F;Test Application.apk&quot; &quot;&#x2F;Users&#x2F;soumya&#x2F;Development&#x2F;TitaniumWorkspace&#x2F;Test Application&#x2F;build&#x2F;android&#x2F;bin&#x2F;Test Application.apkz&quot;<br>&#x2F;usr&#x2F;local&#x2F;lib&#x2F;node_modules&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;node_modules&#x2F;longjohn&#x2F;dist&#x2F;longjohn.js:185<br>        throw e;</p>
<p>I am using node version v0.10.13</p>

										<p><p>The issue has been fixed.</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;androidembed.com&#x2F;titanium-compile-error-zipalign&#x2F;</p>
<p>You need to copy the zip align executable from the build-tools folder to the tools folder. Once that is done, the above issue will get fixed. Hope this is helpful to others.</p>
