			<h1>Memory and image from links problem</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I was searching for memory management when I came across this <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;usingimho.wordpress.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;06&#x2F;14&#x2F;why-you-should-stay-away-from-appcelerators-titanium&#x2F;">blog</a></p>
<p>Read the comments, and they are not really encouraging for someone starting out like me.</p>
<p>My particular concerns are loading images using a URL, which is someone commented on</p>
<p>&gt;Apart from the memory problems, there are other strange bugs which you need to solve with all kinds of workarounds. For instance, if you load images from an url, it sometimes (randomly) does not work. So you need to write timers to check if the image loading has failed and retry, because an error-event is not available. &gt;</p>
<p>and the memory leak issues.</p>
<p>So I want to get feedback directly in this site regarding those two. Is there anything being done? Are they real problems (I believe they are, I sort of experience both but cannot confirm yet)? Any suggestions?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve seen the suggestions on how to clear the memory, but again according to the comments, they don&#39;t always work.</p>

							<div><p>my comment on this is the internet is just like statistics, you can come to whatever conclusion you want if you keep working the numbers or in this case the content&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;tweets&#x2F;found on the internet.</p>
<p>whatever positive comments are posted here, I am certain you will find negative comments elsewhere. Developing software is difficult, developing a framework to develop software is even more complex.</p>
<p>Yes there are bugs, all software has bugs, and yes appcelrator and the community is trying to make developing software on this platform better.</p>

							<div><p>I can concur with Aaron. Titanium certainly is not without (sometimes serious) bugs, but it gets better every time. Especially Android has become much better in the last half year.</p>
<p>The only thing I would like to say that policy wise Appcelerator should focus on making the current functionality perfect instead of adding new functions to their platform – which is a point I heard from a lot of Titanium developers.</p>
<p>As for memory problems, I did not face them – at all. I&#39;ve seen in the blog you link to that some commenters think that single-context apps do not have as many memory problems. I&#39;ve always used a single context for all my projects, so that could be it.</p>

							<p>Its hard to say exactly, as the question is very broad however let me see if these details can help you:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There are many very large, and very well known apps that successfully run with Titanium Mobile. NBC’s flagship iPad app and the Late Night with Jimmy Fallon apps are all built on Titanium. Wunderlist, a top todo list app for Android, iOS, and desktop is built with Titanium.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There are, things you can do to free up memory – the big ones in the 1.x product are closing windows (which releases all UI resources associated with the window) and setting references to a proxy object (like one returned by Ti.UI.createXXX) to null, which will release the resources associated with that object. Also the 1.7.x release fixed a number of memory management issues.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Titanium is not idiot proof, if a developer builds an app poorly, it will perform poorly. Also we know there are bugs in the platform, just like any other platform. If you find a bug, we have a JIRA bug tracker <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC">here</a> that if a bug is submitted to we will do our best to fix it as fast as we can.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With all that said, many developers have successfully used Titanium unmodified to deliver applications. Many more have extended Titanium to fit their needs. Titanium can and does work for many developers, and I hope you will count yourself among them soon.</p>

							<p>First of all, thanks for your inputs. I brought the issue here so I can get better info on the matter, and not just based on what&#39;s in the blog.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been developing in desktop for 20 years, so I&#39;m well aware about software pitfalls. I also have used a software called ASP2DLL which basically is like Titanium, converting code to something else.</p>
<p>There&#39;s always a learning curve when dipping into new platforms and software. But it can only get better, right? :)</p>
