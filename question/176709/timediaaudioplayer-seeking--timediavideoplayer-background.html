			<h1>Ti.Media.AudioPlayer seeking / Ti.Media.VideoPlayer background</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Is anyone aware of a solution, that would enable seeking when using Ti.Media.AudioPlayer to stream remote sound files?<br>This question has been asked previously, however i would like to know if someone has gotten the functionality to work. The reason i ask is due to the fact that the questions previously asking about this were too old. </p>
<p>I am aware that VideoPlayer is able to seek, however this seems to lack the possibility of playing when another window is opened, the application is minimized or with the screen turned off on Android in particular. I was able to get background playing working on iOS.</p>
<p>If anyone has solution to either one of my questions, it would be greatly appriciated.</p>

							<p>Seams that media classes does not have a proper support to android development with titanium. Im trying to put, a video or an audio player in background mod for weeks. Nothing seams to work. Common services, like send and get strings, gps and other simple stuff works pretty well but audio is a pain in the a**. I am changing development do native way with ADT.</p>
