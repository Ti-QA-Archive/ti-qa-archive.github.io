			<h1>Geolocation problems</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Ever since recompiling in 1.4 and sdk 4 (as opposed to my app in store compiled in 1.2 and sdk3.1.3) I have been having problems with the geolocation. While it was pretty accurate before (The listener sets an app.property to pull when making a record of a bird), now it seems to freeze in a location often, not changing the variable. This especially happens after a crash (which crash log points to watchdog timeout which I asked a question about but never figured out). Has anyone found similar or have any ideas? When app is closed it shows the geolocation services are still enabled.</p>

							<p>The problem is that things don&#39;t re-run correctly after re-launching from the crash. The location listener doesn&#39;t run. The orientation listeners don&#39;t run. If I shut the app down fully and re-launch it seems to work. That&#39;s a pretty bad behavior. Anyone weigh in and help me?</p>

							<p>Thanks Danno. The frustrating part here is that it is working and solid with the 1.2&#x2F;sdk3.1.3 compile but giving these errors with the 1.4&#x2F;sdk4 compile. I still think there is something else afoot as I&#39;m crashing a lot more and it&#39;s after this crash that the app doesn&#39;t &#39;reset&#39; itself to run the location listener. I&#39;ll be out testing my app in the field all day with some error feedback in alert dialogs (it&#39;s a birding app).</p>

							<p>Kevin, </p>
<p>I&#39;ve been having issues with geolocation, but for android development. In my case, I have to manually set a location in the emulator or my app crashes. Do you have to do so for iPhone? Partially that&#39;s a limitation of Titanium&#39;s android support – the Titanium.Geolocation.locationServicesEnabled property isn&#39;t supported on android yet. </p>
<p>I was having some issues due to the async nature of location detection. Perhaps you&#39;re facing similar issues? Like, maybe the location detection hasn&#39;t finished by the time you&#39;re using the values? See my question at http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;55371&#x2F;titaniumgeolocationgetcurrentposition-wont-work-within-a-function</p>
<p>Also, I&#39;ve been downloading the latest-build versions of the API and have had better luck with things running as expected. YMMV as there might be new bugs or broken functionality. If you scan the Q&amp;As, 1.4 stock seems to have a few issues.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a birder, or more specifically a bluebird monitor. So, your app sounds interesting. If you need a beta tester on android, let me know. </p>
