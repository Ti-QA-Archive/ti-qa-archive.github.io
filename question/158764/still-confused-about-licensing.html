		<section>
			<p>Hi, i have read the discussion for the following question:<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;142516&#x2F;warning-licensing-of-titanium-chaotic-and-unclear-how-to-avoid-extortionate-fees</p>
<p>However, the official answer to that question doesn&#39;t address why the person was contacted by Appcelerator about purchasing a license, and furthermore, I am still confused about exactly what is permitted under the free licensing.  I don&#39;t know how to find this information either because i have searched online and this forum extensively.  Here are my questions about the free version of titanium:</p>
<ol>
<li>Am i allowed to compile android and ios apps using Titanium Studio AND deploy those apps as commercial apps to the various app stores using the free version of Titanium?</li>
<li>Am i allowed to use the full version of titanium studio under the free version?</li>
<li>Am i allowed to debug both in titanium studio as well as on android AND ios devices using the free version?</li>
</ol>
<p>If the answer to the above 3 questions is &quot;yes&quot;, then are the extended analytics, cloud services, and support the only real difference between the free version and the Appcelerator Platform?</p>
<p>I am evaluating Titanium for use in a commercial product, so i want to know if i can do these things in the free version, or if i&#39;d have to pay $999&#x2F;mo to accomplish what we need.</p>

<li>No</li>
<li>No</li>
<li>No</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the 4.0 platform has been released to everyone there should be an open source version which will be free; but keep in mind - you will need to wait until then to find out how to compile the source code and what elements and services are included.</p>
<p>I would recommend watching the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;university.appcelerator.com&#x2F;video&#x2F;cdkgD5pM&#x2F;Appcelerator-Platform-40">Launch Event Video</a> to fully understand the changes.</p>

										<p><p>Hi, thanks for revising this answer. What about using the 3.x platform that we currently have? Is that still free? If so, can we still publish apps built with 3.x and later choose to upgrade to 4.x and start paying? Is there an upgrade path from 3.x to 4.x? I&#39;m asking this because a client needs an app developed now, and we either have to choose titanium or invest in native apps for every platform.</p>

										<p><p>So far the expectation is yes but I would not expect that to last fie we or even for a long time. As each use of the platform requires studio checking back to the mothership.</p>

							<p>Hi, Is the above still valid? All I get at the above link is now a &quot;we would love to talk to you about the platform&quot;. Just to confirm, is developing an application and publishing it still completely free as of 04&#x2F;04&#x2F;2015? Or has that all changed now? I&#39;m not talking about google&#39;s or apple&#39;s cut of course, I mean with regards to using titanium studio and sdk.</p>
