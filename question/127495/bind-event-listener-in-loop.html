			<h1>Bind Event Listener in Loop</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve just finished creating a meticulously generated grid of icons (imageViews) and now I need to be able to do something with them. In the loop I have this snippet:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> icon = Ti.UI.createImageView(<span class="hljs-comment">{
    left: ( containerW - icoW ) / 2,
    height: icoH,
    image: icons[i].image,
    top: 0,
    width: icoW,
  }</span>);

  icon.addEventListener( <span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">( e )</span> <span class="hljs-comment">{
      alert( 'firing the click event' );
  }</span>);</span>

  container.<span class="hljs-keyword">add</span>( icon ); <span class="hljs-comment">// container is a view created before icon</span>
  thisRow.<span class="hljs-keyword">add</span>( container ); <span class="hljs-comment">// thisRow is also a view created earlier</span>
</code></pre><p>I&#39;m assuming that there&#39;s a timing issue or something similar happening, but I hope there&#39;s a way to get this done so I can click on these nicely arranged icons. Help.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<div><p>Whoops. I added an answer when I meant to add a comment:</p>
<p>I wish it was that simple. :-) I have a script that builds an array of objects that it passes to a factory that creates the icon grid layout. I just assumed I&#39;d be able to attach an event listener to the icon any time after the imageView object was created, but it doesn&#39;t seem like that&#39;s happening. I&#39;ll see what I can put together, but it may take some time to abstract it all out and test it.</p>

							<p>In the thisRow view, remove <code>touchEnabled: false</code>, then add a custom property to your icon imageview to check for in the event listener.  Like <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;2773858">this</a>.</p>

										<p><p>Adam, you just rescued any last vestige of my sanity. the <code>touchEnabled</code> property was a legacy from an early attempt to get the grid to display right and I completely missed it. Thank you.</p>
