			<h1>Titanium 1.7.5 android 2.2 admob not working</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I&#39;m using the Admob module for android but its not working. Sometimes it does view an advertisement especially when my phone is connected to my computer and I used run  on device in titanium studio. When I used distribute it doesn&#39;t work. Errors from logcat are invalid response: -1 and internal error.</p>
<p>Please help! I am out of ideas and almost moving to native because of this problem. searched on the internet but I found nothing.</p>
<p>Sorry for the short message I&#39;m typing on my phone.</p>

							<p>If the problem is intermittent, there&#39;s a good chance that the adview is just not receiving an appropriate ad for that run. Admob fill rates can be really low sometimes, particularly when you first start testing your app. Make sure you have enabled Adsense ads in your Admob management console, as this will help increase your fill rate.</p>

										<p><p>I did activate adsense. But it doesn&#39;t help much. Ads are showing sometimes but not much, are there titanium apps who successfully implemented admob?</p>

										<p><p>It looks much of a bug to me, so that&#39;s why I asked if there are other titanium apps with Admob. Btw the app is online already, with 100+ downloads.</p>

										<p><p>If they are showing up sometimes, that means you have it set up and configured correctly. We unfortunately have no control over the fill rate, which is a very hot topic among Admob users in all mobile deve environments, including native.</p>
