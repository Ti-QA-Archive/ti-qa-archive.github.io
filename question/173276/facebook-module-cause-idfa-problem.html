										<p><p>Harry; we were working through the problem and I gave you a starting point to look at.  There was no need to start a brand new question with the extra info just add it to the original question and we go from there.  However after you created this new question I was less than happy to jump in again as you essentially said &quot;not interested in your help as whilst you correct answer that it was a module issue, the fact you suggested checking storekit before the others (because it has caused this exact issue before) rather than guessing it was the Facebook module I will start again and forget about this&quot;.</p>
<p>There was another guy in the same question asking for help on the same thing so he has now been orphaned as there is no association from this question to that one (I will make a link).</p>
<p>Stephen not wasting time so much as annoying and disrespectful.  However the information and assistance you have given is very valuable so I am glad you did not give up on him.</p>

										<p><p>the initial thought is that I found out the problem is caused by facebook module so I want to make the title more clear. lots of people find out it is the facebook module&#39;s problem so I others to search it easier. I don&#39;t want to have a duplicated post neither if I can change the title of the post.</p>

<li>did you end up with an answer via @Stephen (or in other way), I mean is the problem now solved?</li>
<li>if Stephen did help answer the question and sufficient information is contained here - please mark the answer as accepted</li>
<li>are you suggesting the other question should be deleted to tidy things up, I can help with that?</li>
