			<h1>NavigationGroup root window doesn&#39;t fire FOCUS/BLUR events</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Using the docs code as base and adding the events:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;1937570</p>
<p>Now, in my iPad app I have windows working like that in the splitView. Problem is: the &#39;focus&#39; and &#39;blur&#39; events don&#39;t get fired when the root window of the navigation group is focused or blured.</p>
<p>This worked without any problems when using sdk Ti 1.6.2, now I&#39;m with 1.7rc1.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

							<div><p>No I haven&#39;t. I had to move the function fired in those events out, and put them firing where i knew the view would be blured or focused.<br>Not the best solution and definitely not practical, but at least the app isn&#39;t broken.</p>

							<p>I think I found half the answer for this issue:<br>It seems that the FOCUS doesn&#39;t get fired when it should be, but the OPEN event does. So by switching from focus to open should fix one problem. I&#39;m still no sure how to fix the BLUR since it never gets fired.</p>

							<p>Wow thanks for your tips I upgraded from 1.6.2 to 1.7.1 and my root&#x2F;home window stopped firing the focus after the initial fire from the time the app opens.</p>
<p>I changed it to &#39;open&#39; as you suggest and it now fires when I return to the root window from anywhere just like focus did in 1.6.2! Very odd that the SDK should change &#x2F; stop the focus working considering the window must be focusing?</p>
<p>Thanks again,<br>Dave</p>

							<p>Hello,</p>
<p>if you want to make an &quot;Open&quot; transition on the root window of your NavGroup, the best solution is to do that :<br>NavGroup :</p>
<ul>
<li>1 custom Listener for &quot;open &#x2F;close&quot; new Window,<br>each time you open a new window you animate your root window (opacity 0 for example)<br>each time you close a window (opacity 1 for example)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then you can custom your event if you have more than one level …</p>
<p>Root Window :</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Listener for the open state (fired when you open the tabGroup)<br>(used 1 time)</li>
</ul>
<p>Child Window(s) :</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Listener for the &quot;blur&quot;</li>
<li>1 Listener for the &quot;focus&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use &quot;Animated True&quot; for the child windows the event &quot;open&quot; wil be fired two times, so, prefer just to track blur  &#x2F; focus and not &quot;Open&quot;.</p>
<p>Hope it helps !</p>
