			<p>Hi</p>
<p>I am very new to titanium and want to make sure I adhere to best practices but finding it hard to find examples that fit my needs…even though its very simple in regards what i want to do:)</p>
<p>Basiccally I only need 2 states OR views:</p>
<ol>
<li>A screen that displays a list of content</li>
<li>A screen that shows an image (based on choice made above so I need to pass an id from the chosen list item) in a scroll view. (nb. want this to be dblclickable to back to first screen)</li>
</ol>
<p>I have watched Keven Whinnerys video here:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;9960118</p>
<p>And have based my app.&#39;s based on this.</p>
<p>So basically I have:</p>
<p>app.js - which includes two js files for each view<br>menu.js - which creates my list<br>viewer.js which creates my viewer</p>
<p>What I&#39;m struggling with is how to communicate between these views. And where to keep my methods for swapping views.</p>
<p>I was thinking the best way would be to use app.s as the hub. So all of my methods for controlling which view to move in would be based here. So my other views would then call methods in that file. Is that considered a good approach or if not what is the way to do such a thing?:)</p>
<p>I have a dug around a lot and I see tons of examples using tabs but they don&#39;t suit my needs. I&#39;m sure this is really easy but I could do with a pointer to help me grasp it.</p>
<p>I have looked at tweetatarium[sic] but that&#39;s very confusing for me at this stage.</p>
<p>Any help would be really appreciated.</p>
<p>thanks in advance</p>
<p>ade</p>
