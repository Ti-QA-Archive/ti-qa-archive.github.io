			<h1>Detect movement or standstill with Titanium API</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve created an app that uses Geolocation to track an users&#39; motion. I&#39;ve used Ti.Geolocation.getCurrentPosition for this. It works great to plot a traveled route on a map. But I&#39;m also using it to detect if the user stands still. I do this by listening for the location event and see if the speed is of the user is 0</p>
<p>I&#39;ve found that this doesn&#39;t work very well on certain Androids and inside buildings, on Apple devices this works pretty good. I think this has to do with the accuracy of the location update. I&#39;ve tried the manual mode in Android but didn&#39;t got any location updates after I fiddled with any of the values. But I&#39;m guessing that I should use GPS for this. What&#39;s my best option here?</p>
<p>I could use the accelerometer, but I can&#39;t use this in a background service on iOS. Also I don&#39;t want to drain the battery life of the phone.</p>
<p>Any help or pointer in the right direction would be appreciated.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The best option is to use them all and fall back to the ones best suited based on the previous response.</p>
<p>When in-doors use the accelerometer, outside geolocation, determine state by seeing no movement with geolocation then jump to accelerometer to confirm.</p>
<p>I do not think you are going to get a perfect solution - not yet anyway.  There is new technology coming but not for a few years - that will be able to detect exact position inside a building and outside.</p>
