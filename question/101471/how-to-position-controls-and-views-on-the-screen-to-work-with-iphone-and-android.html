			<h1>How to position controls and views on the screen to work with iPhone and Android?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m new with Titanium and was wondering if there is any way to position things on the screen that would work on any Android screen size.</p>
<p>For example, if I have:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var btnTest = Titanium.UI.createButton(
     {                                                                                                                                                                          
         title:<span class="hljs-string">'SomeTitle'</span>,
         <span class="hljs-variable">width</span>:<span class="hljs-number">80</span>,
         <span class="hljs-variable">height</span>:<span class="hljs-number">40</span>,
         top:<span class="hljs-number">20</span>,
         left:<span class="hljs-number">180</span>
     });
</code></pre><p>Then on the iPhone it may look ok, but on a larger Android screen this button might be unaligned.</p>
<p>How can I place something on my screen and make sure it will be on that same position on any Android screen?</p>
<p>I was thinking that maybe using some kind of percentage, like top:10% so it would be 10% away from the top no matter the screen size.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

							<p>You can only use percentages for placement properties under iOS; Android OS does not support them.  (You could use Titanium.Platform.displayCaps to get the device size of any device and compute your own sizes instead of naming a percentage in the property though.)</p>
<p>Would you clarify what you mean by &quot;unaligned&quot; and exactly how you would like it sized and positioned on different screen resolutions?  Because the question asks how you can make sure it will be at the same position, and your example will do exactly that:  ALWAYS start at 20 pixels down and 180 pixels from the left edge, with a size of 80x40.</p>
<p>So please elaborate on what you consider &quot;aligned&quot; vs &quot;unaligned&quot;?</p>
<p>In general, there are two main modes to what the numbers mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>layout: &#39;absolute&#39; = placement is relative to view&#x2F;window size</li>
<li>layout: &#39;vertical&#39; = placement is relative to previous view&#x2F;object</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don&#39;t specify the layout property when creating the window or view, it will default to absolute.  I&#39;ll assume that is what you are using.</p>
<p>The presence or absence of the other properties control placement.  In general, name the properties you want explicitly consistent and do not name the rest.</p>
<p>For example, if you both a left and right do not name a width and the width will dynamically adjust with screen size and orientation.  Give only a width and it will be centered on the screen.  Give a width and left OR right and it will have a consistent width and distance from the edge named.  (The width can also be &#39;auto&#39; to size to fit.)</p>
<p>The same concept applies to top&#x2F;bottom&#x2F;height.  Name the ones you want to be an explicit distance from an edge, and let the others default.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

										<p><p>Hey Doug!<br>Thanks very much for the answer.</p>
<p>What I mean when I say &quot;unaligned&quot; is:</p>
<ul>
<li>If I place a button with left:180, on the iPhone 320x480 screen it will be, say, just a little bit far from the center and pretty much <strong>close</strong> to the Right edge. But on a larger Android screen it would be rather far from the Right edge, therefore unaligned. Do you follow?</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#39;s like when you tell it to align in the center. It will always put it in the center of the screen no matter what the screen size is. But with other positions as well. </p>
<p>So could I do something like this?</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in">var</span> screen = Titanium<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>Platform<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>displayCaps<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>platformHeight;
<span class="hljs-attribute">...</span>
bottom:screen-<span class="hljs-number">50</span>;
<span class="hljs-attribute">...</span>
</code></pre></p>
