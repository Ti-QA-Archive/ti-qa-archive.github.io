							<p>If you&#39;re referring to Titanium Mobile&#39;s Mobile Web platform, then yes it&#39;s a great idea!</p>
<p>You can take the same code from your Android or iOS Titanium app and compile it into a mobile web version. This will produce a website that you can deploy on your web server.</p>
<p>Mobile Web is much more sensitive to poor software design, so you really need to minimize the size of the app. Titanium Mobile Web supports a number of modern browsers and devices and supports around 90% of the Titanium APIs.</p>
<p>It&#39;s definitely worth looking into.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t quite follow you there.</p>
<p>What are you trying to achieve exactly? Are there some very specific needs that your project need to fill?</p>
<p>Any idea can be good (or bad), it all depends on the goals and constraints of each project.</p>
<p>One of the big advantages in using Titanium is that you delegate the support of multiple mobile browsers to the framework. So you can focus on the actual functionality of your site rather than working  out the kinks depending on which device connects to your site.</p>
<p>The other near feature is that on every new release, you can simply recompile your project and benefit from all the fixes an performance improvements.</p>

										<p><p>But you have to always keep in mind, that using a mobile web site will require all your users to have a valid connection if they want to access your service. </p>
<p>While a standalone application will allow your users to use the application offline and &quot;sync&quot; it at a later time.</p>
