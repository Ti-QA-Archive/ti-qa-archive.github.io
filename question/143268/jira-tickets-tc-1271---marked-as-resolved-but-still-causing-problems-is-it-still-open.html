			<h1>Jira Tickets (TC-1271) - Marked as resolved but still causing problems, is it still open?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi</p>
<p>I have a problem with my app with the openPhotoGallery call (on iPad with IOS6+) which i created a question on here and got told there was a ticket on the issue. </p>
<p>The ticket is here:<br><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC-1271">jira ticket link TC-1271</a></p>
<p>The problem is it was marked as resolved before i found it and myself and others (as seen in the original question below) are still facing issues with it. My question is - if the ticket is marked as resolved, will anyone keep looking into it for a fix? I have added comments and attachement into the ticket but my worry is that the people at appcelerator no longer look at resolved tickets and it will get ignored.</p>
<p>My original question is here:<br><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;143129&#x2F;just-updated-to-the-60-ios-sdk---problems-with-openphotogallery">q&amp;a question</a></p>
<p>Sorry if this is not the correct place or i misunderstand how it works but i have just got into the jira section of appcelerator!</p>

							<p>Hello Javier,</p>
<p>There is absolutely <strong>no way</strong> in hell the guys at Appcelerator can keep an eye on every resolved ticket from the JIRA tool. Since the number keeps increasing each day, that would become too big of a task.</p>
<p>Now, if you ever experience regression after upgrading to a newer version of the SDK, ou will have to create a whole new ticket for this specific issue related to this specific version. Of course, you can link to the previous ticket to avoid having to detail everything all over again (if the bugs are similar of course)</p>
<p>Hope this clears this out for you.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you Christian,  I completely understand how hard it must be to keep on track with it all and you&#39;ve helped clear it up - I just wanted to know how likely it is for the tickets to be looked at still and what you said makes sense. I will have to hope I can resolve or I will create a new ticket</p>
