			<h1>Faster Compile / Build Flow</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Using the Titanium IDE is painful with testing. I generally see 40-60s on build times, depending on which system I use, plus another 15-25s for the iTunes transfer. If you compile 20 times an hour, you&#39;re wasting 33% of your hour waiting on the compile. For me, this is unacceptable as twiddling thumbs is not the best way to spend my time.</p>
<p>So…I&#39;m looking for ideas on how to better improve my Ti workflow so I can regain my ~33% loss.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Something I&#39;ve tried is building directly through XCode but this iPad only app (only deployment target checked in tiapp.xml) shows up as a 2X iPhone app. It does speed up the time to device but I still have to go through the 40-60s build time.</p>
<p>Any ideas are welcomed. Thanks!</p>

										<p><p>Seriously, you&#39;re overly sensitive. Let it go man. Just don&#39;t listen to my Twitter feed if you can&#39;t handle non-positive things about Ti. As a Ti partner and someone who could possibly get hired for a gig, you should be more welcoming vs combative.</p>
<p>Yes, an answer but the issue is marked as Resolved - Invalid with a reference to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-12400">#12400</a> which is marked Fixed in 3.0.2. Also this is for sim builds and I&#39;m talking about device.</p>
<p>If slow builds are the way of life, as it seems to be, I&#39;m merely looking for workflow suggestions from other devs.</p>

										<p><p>Sorry if I cam across as &quot;combative&quot; I am not being sensitive or combative, just responsive, just trying to suggest that this community is helpful if you give it a chance… BTW Trying to determine my personal feelings through a twitter response is not really a good idea :-)</p>
<p>and finally the issue is marked as fixed, but if you continue to read though JIRA, you will see that the fix will not be released until April unless you pull from the continuous builds server.</p>
<p>My recommendation is that you watch the issue in JIRA for updates</p>

										<p><p>The sensitive part came from you not letting it go. You could have easily said &quot;ask on Q&amp;A and we&#39;ll try to help troubleshoot&quot; but instead you try to discredit my statements as invalid because I referenced a year old post (illustrating my first point). It is all about how you approach someone and you started off on the wrong foot then carried it over here. Let it go.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t see the April note but will watch the ticket and leave this as the accepted answer for now.</p>

							<p>Actually noticed a major difference in compile time between the two separate buttons: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;screencast.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;NKrZ6OPhINMJ.</p>
<p>The tooltips do not show the difference between the two but <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Debugging_in_Titanium_Studio">this guide page</a> shows this as a full debug (breakpoints, etc).</p>
<p>When I use the top icon I get about a 15s compile time!! Now that is completely acceptable. I&#39;d prefer less than 5s but 15 is wayyy better than 40 any day!</p>
<p>It would be great to see improved tooltips for those of us with past Eclipse experience who are used to the top debug icon.</p>
