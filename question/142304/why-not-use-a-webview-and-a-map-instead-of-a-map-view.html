			<h1>why not use a webview and a map instead of a map view?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I get frustrated by the fact that I can&#39;t animate the movement of a marker on the screen. So my solution would be to display a webview, and inside it a map. What would be the disadvantage of this practice? Is there anything like this already built? Would you recommend it? Do you think it would be less effective?</p>

							<p>The main disadvantage would be that you&#39;re going to spin up an entire webview just to display a map. Complex map implementations can be notoriously slow within a regular browser, but now you&#39;re doing it in a mobile app, inside a webview. Iits likely going to be slow and not have the responsiveness that you&#39;d expect from a native mapview. I don&#39;t know of anything like this already built, and I would not recommend it. However, its effectiveness is purely dependent on your app. If you need to interact with this map alot, then I don&#39;t think its going to be very effective. If you don&#39;t, then it may possibly work for what you need it to do.</p>
