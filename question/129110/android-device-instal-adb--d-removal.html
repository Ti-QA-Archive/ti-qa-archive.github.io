			<h1>Android device instal, &#34;adb -d&#34; removal</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello community,</p>
<p>I am trying to test the app I am developing on my available android devices(nook color, samsung moment, samsung intercept, galaxy player 5.0 and lg Optimus S). Unfortunately I am on a mac and non of the adb drivers work at all(nook used to before the android sdk update). So to resolve this I have been packaging the app for deployment and just manually installing the app through dropbox(this takes forever). But recently I found an application called adbwireless. This app lets you connect with adb to any device through wifi, given they are rooted. The adb connects, and works fine. All normal adb functions work flawlessly for all of my devices. Given one acception, when Titanium installs an app to a device through adb, it places the -d parameter before install. The -d tells adb to only install to devices plugged in through usb. Since all of my devices are connected through wifi, adb returns no devices. I do understand that titanium does that incase an emulator is running, but I try not to use emulators since I have so many devices, I can test many android scenarios.</p>
<p>I have glanced through the Titanium preferences and have found no way to disable the -d. I was wondering if there was any way shape or form to disable this. I am tired of waiting 10 minutes just to test a few lines of code.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading,<br>Brandon - Student Intern for Peninsula School District 401</p>
