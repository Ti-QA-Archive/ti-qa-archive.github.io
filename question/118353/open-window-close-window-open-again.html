			<p>This question <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;92721&#x2F;open-window-close-window-open-again">was asked four months ago</a> and never really answered. It looks like it cannot be done. I.e., all the examples I found in the Kitchen Sink <strong>instantiate new windows</strong> in the event handlers, instead of reusing already-created instances.  Sounds like a lot of memory churning, and wastes time, too. </p>
<p>Has anyone been able to successfully reuse a window instance?</p>

<p>I fear you may be falling into the <em>pre-optimization trap</em> by wanting to do this. Be careful never to pre-optimize. I think these sentiments are best summarized in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;orionl.blogspot.com&#x2F;2008&#x2F;11&#x2F;scalability-is-war-and-dont-pre.html">Scalability Is A War; And, Don&#39;t Pre-Optimize </a>, which states, <em>&quot;you should never pre-optimize, because what you think is the performance or scalability bottleneck is almost surely wrong…the best thing you can do is to keep your architecture and implementation simple, elegant, and easy to change.&quot;</em></p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with opening new windows, or more typically views, when your application warrants it. The benefit is that all the objects that they contain will be properly destroyed when they are closed, and common coding mistakes (ie race conditions etc) can be avoided.</p>
<p>Be aware of the <em>Lifecycle Note</em> section of the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;1.6.0&#x2F;changelog.html">1.6.0 Release Notes &#x2F; Changelog</a>, which recommends that events be used to guarantee the correct execution order:</p>
<p><em>The Android Lifecycle changes in 1.6.0 mean that your Window&#39;s URL (and app.js) are executed synchronously as part of the Activity&#39;s onCreate(). Try to keep your initial code light, and don&#39;t count on window.open() being synchronous, especially if the window is launching a new Activity. Use a listener on the Window&#39;s &quot;open&quot; event to ensure that code gets executed after the new Activity has been opened.</em></p>
<p>Have you seen an example in one of the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;">Appcelerator projects</a> (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;tweetanium">tweetanium</a> is a good place to start) where they have used the technique you have described? If so, great; you can use it as an example, and post a link here to benefit others. If not, then I would assume that even Appcelerator does not code in the way you have described.</p>
<p>If you have a specific performance issue with your application, then please open another question and explain it with the help of <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Contributing+to+Titanium#ContributingtoTitanium-CreatingGoodUsecases">a usecase</a>, and I am certain someone will help you to resolve it.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
