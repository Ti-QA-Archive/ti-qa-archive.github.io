			<h1>How serious are [WARN]&#39;s?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have been trying for a while to find a way to check if a view exists in a window before removing the view from the window.  I have not been successful.  (If someone wanted to help me out there, I&#39;d be grateful, but that&#39;s not what this question is for.) What I ended up doing instead is removing all possible views from the window and then adding back the one I need.  Naturally, this means I am often removing views from a window that don&#39;t exist.  When that happens I get this warning:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[WARN] called remove <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> [<span class="hljs-tag">object</span> TiUIView] on [<span class="hljs-tag">object</span> TiUIWindow], but [<span class="hljs-tag">object</span> TiUIView] isn<span class="hljs-string">'t a child or has already been removed</span>
</code></pre><p>This is to be expected.  Sometimes I also get warnings that look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-attr_selector">[WARN]</span> <span class="hljs-attr_selector">[object TiUITableViewRow]</span> has an <span class="hljs-attribute">auto</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">height</span> value of 0, meaning this view may not be <span class="hljs-value">visible</span>.
</code></pre><p>So my question is: How seriously should I pay attention to these warnings?  Should I view them as show-stoppers and make sure they are all resolved?  Will they cause memory problems once the app is in the device?  Or… am I okay letting them slide?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<div><p>About removing views:  Initially I added all the views to the window and then just made them visible or invisible.  That worked fine in the simulator, but not he device I started to notice weird behavior.  i re-did the code to only add the view I needed to see, and remove all others.  Back on the device weird behavior vanished, but in the simulator I get the [WARN]&#39;s.</p>

							<p>First warning should be serious, you tried to remove a view that does not exist inside a window. So, that&#39;s your error. Second warning is not so important, just set default height value to table view row (like Ti.UI.SIZE) and it should be gone.</p>

										<p><p><strong>It&#39;s a warning that is an error in your code and it warns you to remove the error not to throw an error and crash the app without a warning which wouldn&#39;t be an error but still warns you.</strong></p>
<p>Makes more sense? :P</p>
<p>Now seriously Ivan is right, on iOS this is &quot;just&quot; a warning, but on android it will crash (at least this is what was happening the last time I  had this issue).<br>Is not a good practice to confuse the device and ask it to remove something there is not there. You simply put load on the device without reason or even may lead to crashes, like i said.</p>
