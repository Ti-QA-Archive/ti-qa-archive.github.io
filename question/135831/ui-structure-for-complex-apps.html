			<h1>UI structure for complex apps?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>i am new to Titanium mobile and try to learn some best practice about how to create the ui architecture of apps which are a little bit more complex.<br>At the moment i think of how to build an app like sparrow mail for iphone, or similar.</p>
<p>I am unsure how to do it so i will show my thoughts and hope to get some comments, advices and corrections…</p>
<p>So there are multiple mail accounts, where every accounts folder has three views (all, unread and starred).<br>Every folder could be a tab group, one for all, unread and starred. Every tab consists of a navigation group for the folder list and the mail detail view.</p>
<p>All those views could be created and populated with the correct data on selecting a folder (and the previous views would be deleted).<br>Or all views could be created for all folders of one account when selecting the account.<br>Or all views could be created for all accounts on startup, so you just need to hide and show them.</p>
<p>My guess would be that the last two variants could consume to much memory to be practical and the first one could be a little slow when switching between the folders.</p>
<p>So what do you think about this structure?<br>Are there any best practice examples for apps with that many windows&#x2F;views?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance, regards Joe.</p>

							<p>Thats not that much, build your ui on thy fly as needed. Always keep in mind that you do not need to create elemens which user cannot see, therefore creating views which are not directly visible is just waste of memory.</p>

							<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>So you would suggest to recreate the window with the tabgroup&#x2F;navgroup items on every account&#x2F;folder change? Is it ok to just delete the &quot;old&quot; window containing the other elements or would that leak memory?</p>
<p>Thanks, Joe.</p>

										<p><p>Yeah, but I would not use a TabGroup für such a use-case. I think there is no reason, to be able to switch &quot;that fast&quot; between the folders and also I have never seen an mail app (regardless of the OS) which used tab-like navigation for their folders. Instead I think you are fine with a navGroup, you could have a button which directly navigates to the rootView (list of Folders). That way you also do not need to recreate that much views and always keep in mind which components a user will be using the most, this components needs to be fast responsive.</p>
<p>e.g. an initial (longer in time wasting) configuration is acceptable, if this is necessary to run the app smooth, since it will occur once. In contrast having no init config at the costs of response of other ui elements which will take 1s longer, will become annoying.</p>
<p>So you may want to re-think your workflow, if you come to the conclusion that the tabGroup is needed to satisfy the user then we cannot avoid them. :)</p>

										<p><p>Hey,<br>thanks for your thoughts and explanations.</p>
<p>&quot;My&quot; workflow is given by the app (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sparrowapp.com&#x2F;iphone.php), that i want to understand ;)</p>
<p>So let&#39;s assume here, you select Account XYZ - Inbox. Then your send to the inbox-view which would be one navGroup. When you now tap on the title, you can switch from the list showing all mails in the inbox to the unread or starred ones.</p>
<p>That&#39;s why i thought that could be reflected by a tabGroup with three tabs and every tab containing a navGroup.</p>

										<p><p>Just prototype it, I think it should be ok, the tabGroup has a build-in  navGroup.</p>
