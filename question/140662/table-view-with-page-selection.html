							<p>It&#39;s not easy to provide a self-contained example, since this may be tightly coupled with the type of data source you have.</p>
<p>If your data source (in my case, a web service) can manage pagination for you and do the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>indicate whether there is more data available (or indicate you are on page m of n pages)</li>
<li>retrieve a specific page based on a parameter you pass in</li>
</ul>
<p>then here&#39;s the basic idea of how you would set up your tableview:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in">var</span> tv = Ti<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>UI<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>createTableView ({<span class="hljs-attribute">...</span>});

<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (_curr_page &gt; <span class="hljs-number">1</span>)
{
    <span class="hljs-comment">// add a "previous" row</span>
    <span class="hljs-built_in">var</span> row = Ti<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>UI<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>createTableViewRow ({
        col<span class="hljs-subst">or</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'#fff'</span>,
        backgroundCol<span class="hljs-subst">or</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'#006'</span>,
        title: <span class="hljs-string">"previous..."</span>,
        height: <span class="hljs-number">45</span>
    });
    row<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>page_num = _curr_page - <span class="hljs-number">1</span>;
    <span class="hljs-built_in">data</span><span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>push (row);
}

<span class="hljs-comment">// fill table rows with data here...</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (results<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>more_data)
{
    <span class="hljs-comment">// add a "more" row</span>
    <span class="hljs-built_in">var</span> row = Ti<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>UI<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>createTableViewRow ({
        col<span class="hljs-subst">or</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'#fff'</span>,
        backgroundCol<span class="hljs-subst">or</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'#006'</span>,
        title: <span class="hljs-string">"more..."</span>,
        height: <span class="hljs-number">45</span>
    });
    row<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>page_num = _curr_page + <span class="hljs-number">1</span>;
    <span class="hljs-built_in">data</span><span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>push (row);
}

tv<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>setData (<span class="hljs-built_in">data</span>);

tv<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>addEventListener (<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, function (e) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (e<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>row<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>page_num)
    {
        <span class="hljs-comment">// more/prev rows have a page_num property; construct a new URL</span>
        <span class="hljs-comment">// to retrieve the correct page from the server and retrieve it</span>
        <span class="hljs-attribute">...</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span>;
    }

    <span class="hljs-comment">// process your other rows as normal</span>
    <span class="hljs-attribute">...</span>
});

							<p>Hi Gerd</p>
<p>When I first saw this question it looked like an interesting one and I almost created an answer for you.  </p>
<p>However I held off, as the last time I spent a couple of hours assisting you ended it up with worse than no acknowledgement.</p>
<p>Having just gone through my most recent answers to people I notice you name appears more than once, each time I have spent a significant amount time assisting you.  However no acknowledgement of that effort despite each time providing you with the answer.</p>
<p>I then looked further and noticed you have asked 20 questions, you have never marked ANY questions as solved despite people spending a significant amount of their free time assisting you, working through problems sometimes through several iterations.</p>
<p>I know you know how much time people spend as you are the recipient of it.  Yet you fail to do the only thing that is really asked of you - to help both you and those who see your questions in the future - to mark the  questions answered to the appropriate answer.</p>
<p>So I would ask that you spend some of your time reviewing those question you asked - all 20 of them and where an answer was provided that assisted or even solved you problem - mark it as the successful one.</p>
<p>By all means ignore my efforts as maybe you think the significant amount of time spent by me was not enough - but I assure you that the efforts of others should be acknowledged.</p>

										<p><p>Excuse me Gerd I believe EVERYBODY pointed out that it was your reaction to my comment 3 WEEKS ago that was abusive, without manners and aggressive.</p>
<p>Your comment added in response to this 3 weeks later - only goes to prove them right.</p>
<p>In case you forgot this was where people asked you to be nicer - <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;140683&#x2F;since-when-can-people-demand-stuff-read-this-responds-i-got-trough-email">since when can people demand stuff read this responds i got trough email</a>.</p>
<p>This was dealt with three weeks ago, you did what was asked of you and I figured it was dealt with.  So why have you started this up again?</p>
<p>I would suggest you tone down your attitude or people will simply stop assisting you, which is a shame because people are here to help you and anyone else who is at least grateful for help..</p>

										<p><p>Then it should be even easier.  You know how many rows you want to show, you know how many data elements you have; just do something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (_curr_page &gt; <span class="hljs-number">0</span>)
{
    <span class="hljs-comment">// add a "prev" row</span>
    ...
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> idx = _curr_page * _num_rows_to_show
<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> i = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i &lt; _num_rows_to_show; i++)
{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> o = _source_data[idx];

    <span class="hljs-comment">// build a tableviewrow from o and add to </span>
    ...

    idx++;
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (idx &gt; _source_data.length -<span class="hljs-number">1</span>)
    {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">break</span>;
    }
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (idx &lt; _source_data.length)
{
    <span class="hljs-comment">// add a "more" row</span>
    ...
}
</code></pre><p>The bounds checking might need some tweaks, but you should get the idea.</p>
<p>Wrap this up in a method called <code>loadTable()</code> or something.</p>
<p>When the user clicks a &quot;more&quot; or &quot;previous&quot; row, you just update the _curr_page and call <code>loadTable()</code>.</p>
<p>This assumes that you&#39;re using a nice CommonJS module design so that you can share variables like <code>_curr_page</code> across different methods.  If you&#39;re not using such a design, refactor now before it&#39;s too late!  :-)</p>
