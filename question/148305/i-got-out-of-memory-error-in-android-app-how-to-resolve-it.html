							<p>Hi</p>
<p>You clearly have too many windows with too many child views open at the same time for whatever memory constraints your testing device has.</p>
<p>You should be monitoring the amount of memory you are using - particularly when developing for Android as there are so many devices that have a limited total available memory for your app (you do not get access to all the devices memory) that if you are not extremely conscientious about what is in memory at any one time then you will unfortunately run into these problems.</p>
<p>Titanium will handle many of the memory clean-ups as you dispose of views and windows but as you have 6 to 7 open at once, all the associated memory for those is still in-place.</p>
<p>You may find you need to manage your app by not having so many windows open at the same time.  This is hard - I know, but you should look into the possibility of dynamically loading and unloading a single window rather than multiple ones.</p>
<p>Also use the methods built into Titanium to reveal the amount of memory available to you at any one time.</p>
