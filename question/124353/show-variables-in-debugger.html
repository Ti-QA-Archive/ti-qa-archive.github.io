			<h1>Show variables in debugger?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have breakpoints set in my app (on lines of code, not blank) and the debugger is not showing anything in the variables view. The debugger is successfully halting, and I can see the vertical white line in the variables view. I have seen variables there in the past, but can&#39;t figure out what may have happened. Any suggestions?</p>
<p>It would also be nice if I could see variables at points in my app where nothing is happening (waiting for the user to act). Thanks!</p>

							<div><p>I just upgraded my Studio to the most recent version and installed the most recent build of the SDK. Now pretty much every time I debug, it crashes at a break-point. If I run without the debugger, there is no problem. Help?!?</p>

<p>Breakpoints work for me. So that we can see what you mean, would you please provide some code to demonstrate this, and state on which line your breakpoint is? Without this, it&#39;s difficult to know exactly what you mean. </p>
<p>Cheers</p>

							<p>It appears that I just needed to restart Ti Studio. It had probably been running for a few weeks, and a restart appears to have resolved the issue. Thanks!</p>
