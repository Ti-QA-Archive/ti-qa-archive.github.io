			<h1>TIBarcode does not work well with long barcodes</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>This is not really a question. More like a notification for appcelerator since I can not post the issue in the help desk. The barcode module does not like any code 39 barcodes over 11 digits long. I was creating an app that decodes automobile vin&#39;s and the barcode reader would not work. Testing it by printing out barcodes with varying numbers of digits i found that up to 11 it would read. After that it would not.</p>
<p>I have since moved over to tibar (the free community solution) which is working like a champ. You might want to look into changing the technology of your barcode reader to keep your modules &quot;best in class&quot;</p>

							<div><p>Chris, or any one else in the community.  Have you found a product that will work with VINs?  I have tried a few of the barcode readers offered, have been successful scanning shorter barcodes, but still no VINs.  Any one got any advice?</p>
