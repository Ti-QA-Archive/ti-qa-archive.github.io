							<p>OK, well I just went into the App Store, and searched for XCode, and it said there was a 4.4 update (even though that doesn&#39;t appear in the &quot;updates&quot; section).  I installed it and now it all works. So that was the fix for me.</p>

							<p>We have not officially certified Titanium Mobile&#x2F;Studio with OS X Mountain Lion, but there are a number of reports that the combination of 10.8 + Xcode 4.4 works fine.</p>
<p>Titanium Studio 2.1.1 is signed for Gatekeeper support.</p>

							<p>I upgraded to Mountain Lion GM and there are problems.  Mainly, I cannot get my iOS app to start in the iOS Simulator.  I have XCode45-DP3 installed and did a xcode-select to switch things to it, but it appears to still not work properly.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t been able to determine whether it is using the correct xcode path though (it appears to not be).</p>

							<p>Any news? The only thing I have heard was from a non-Appceletator employee pointing me to a document on general policy regarding OS releases.</p>
<p>It would still be good to hear from an official authority about when we can expect to use Titanium Studio under Mountain Lion. (Mountain Lion will not allow Xcode under 4.4 to even launch, and Titanium will not even recognize its there).</p>
<p>I would very much like to upgrade my new machines to Mountain Lion. The only thing holding me back is Titanium Desktop.</p>

										<p><p>Same here.  So many software companies update their compatibility status close to a new release, but usually I have to come to QA for anecdotal info.  I hope we hear soon. Everything else I need will be fine with 10.8.</p>

							<p>Oops…I stupidly just upgraded to 10.8 without checking this first.  Now cannot build my app.</p>
<p>Could always roll back temporarily, but would also appreciate an answer on timing…because I&#39;d avoid that hassle if a fix is imminent.</p>

							<p>I was on Xcode 3.2 when I upgraded to Mountain Lion.  When I tried to upgrade Xcode, it gave me an error indicating the OS was &quot;too new.&quot;  Until I found this link to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discussions.apple.com&#x2F;thread&#x2F;4135803?tstart=0">fix the problem</a>.</p>
<p>Upgrading Xcode to 4.4 right now.  Will report back if I have any further issues.</p>

										<p><p>Hi, I had exactly the same dyld image not found error. I had just upgraded to Mountain Lion and XCode 4.4. Ti Studio 2.1.2.201207252042.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: removed all XCode installations I could find and reinstalled. All working now with one error that doesn&#39;t appear to affect functioning.</p>
<p>I checked the iOS Simulator and found that it was broken regardless of what Titanium Studio was doing (e.g. simulator would launch to a black &#x2F; blank iPhone screen and ask to switch SDK). This suggested this was an XCode rather than a Titanium issue.</p>
<p>I had a mix of XCode installations on my Mac (in &#x2F;Applications and &#x2F;Developer) which I removed all of (delete and empty trash).</p>
<p>Then downloaded XCode 4.4 from the App Store and everything is working now.</p>
<p>I get one error on build and launch that doesn&#39;t appear to affect functioning. </p>
