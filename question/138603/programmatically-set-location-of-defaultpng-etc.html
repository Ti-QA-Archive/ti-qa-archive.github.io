			<h1>Programmatically set location of Default.png, etc</h1>

		<section>
			<p>I am building an app that will have multiple &quot;versions&quot; within the AppStore.  Most of the configuration and data used in the app will be downloaded from a server.  However, I need the &quot;branding&quot; to be different; Splash Screen, icons, etc.  I&#39;m able to handle most of the branding (app name, version, etc) through multiple versions of tiapp.xml that I will just swap out, but swapping all these images might be a pain.</p>
<p>Is there any way to programmatically indicate these images rather than relying on Titanium to find them in their default locations?</p>

							<p>Are you referring to multiple versions such as (for example) having a &quot;Lite&quot; free version and a &quot;Full&quot; paid version within the AppStore?</p>
<p>If your talking about &quot;Lite&quot; and &quot;Full&quot; these need to be completely separate apps, as per Apple Guidelines, so you should probably just bite the bullet and have multiple projects, multiple images, multiple tiapp.xml. Otherwise when your distributing the app and testing it will get very confusing.</p>

										<p><p>No.  My app is a resource for universities and each school would like it branded as it&#39;s own.  Each will be a separate app, but I didn&#39;t want to have to duplicate all the code for each school (or swap out images when building the app for different schools).</p>
<p>I&#39;d like to place each different app&#39;s branding images&#x2F;icons in sub folders and then programmatically specify them in code.</p>

										<p><p>Ok that makes sense, well I&#39;m not really sure you can do that through Titanium without a little hacking, since the file that manages the icons (the Info.plist in XCode) is constant per app…</p>
<p>BUT :)  You can specify your own custom <strong>Info.plist</strong>.</p>
<p> So I would do the exact same thing your doing with your tiapp.xml: for each school, create their own set of images (in a subdirectory), tiapp.xml, and Info.plist (which you can drop in the resources directory and titanium will put it in the project).  Go here to see how you can define your icon files for each plist: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;ios&#x2F;#qa&#x2F;qa1686&#x2F;_index.html">Apple Has a Page Here</a>, go to &quot;Add Icon files in Info.plist.&quot;</p>
<p>So that handles all the images for app startup and icons, if you also want to differentiate between in-app icons thats just simple if-else style switching.</p>

										<p><p>Ugh.  That&#39;s more painful than I was hoping for as well.  Keeping the tiapp.xml files in sync will be hard enough.  I might just create a script to automatically move the image&#x2F;icon files around.</p>
