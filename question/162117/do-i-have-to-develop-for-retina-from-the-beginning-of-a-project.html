			<h1>Do I have to develop for Retina from the beginning of a project?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>WARNING: I have VERY limited knowledge of dev!</p>
<p>I am asking this for one of the partners at our company. We have been redesigning our iPad app. The original dev was done in Titanium and we are using it to do this version as well. BUT- I, the one designing the mockups for the app, have been using a 326ppi 2048&#x2F;1536 setup in Photoshop so as to provide correct pixel and point measurements to the dev team for a RETINA screen. We are facing a problem with the dev now concerning the Retina display. It seems the team has been developing for the old (standard) resoltuion. Do we need to be developing in a &quot;Retina&quot; mode? Is that even a thing? Ex: When I provide a pixel length or type point measurement to the dev team, the outcome in the simulator is different than expected because they are developing for the regular iPad (we think, the team doesn&#39;t remember choosing a resolution for the project). Really, I am not familiar with the Titanium software, and the lead dev guy doesn&#39;t know if we should be doing something different.</p>
<p>Help please! Thanks!</p>

							<p>&#39;Retina mode&#39; at the base level are graphic assets that are 2x as big.</p>
<p>So, if you have a button graphic that is 300x50 named btnImage.png, its retina pairing would be btnImage@2x.png which would be 600x100.</p>
<p>Easiest method in hindsight is to develop the larger images and work down, as you can upscale an image and get better quality out of it.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the reply!</p>
<p>Titanium will recognize the &#39;@2x&#39;? Do I need both if the app will run on standard and retina screens?</p>
<p>Also- can I assume that font sizing will be doubled as well? or, if it&#39;s not a linear conversion, is there a chart for font point size conversions between the 2 resolutions?</p>

										<p><p>If the retina is missing, the low res is used on retina device.<br>If the lowres is missing, no image is shown on a non-retina device.</p>
<p>You can ship your app, with the @2x named as low-res, so that both devices can find use them and save space.  The problem with this, is that non-retina devices are a few gen back, so it takes a lot of work for them to process the hi-res graphics.</p>
<p>Fonts are scaled automagically.  As for a chart to compare point to mobile, well, never found one I could trust reliably.</p>
