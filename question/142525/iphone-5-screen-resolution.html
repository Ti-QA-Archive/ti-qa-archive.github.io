			<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>I just got my iPhone 5 and updated to the 2.1.3 SDK (thank you!) and XCode 4.5. I noticed on both simulator and device, that the app still runs in a black letter-box with padding to the bottom and top of the display.</p>
<p>Is there is fix for that, yet?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

							<p>Thank you Anthony! But i am shocked how the community reacts to an topic which is not clearly documented in the docs. </p>
<p>We were told that we can change the Default-image to have a well scaled splash-screen but not that this also changed the internal layout-dimensions. </p>
<p>Really disappointing to see that ..</p>

										<p><p>The iPhone 5 literally came out yesterday. We&#39;ve got all hands working on handling support for new hardware and software. I think the community has been instrumental in handling the passing of information that will eventually be in the docs when we have some extra hands to update them to include all iOS6 changes.<br>The community is only reacting to seeing the same question asked and answered so many times in such a short period of time. Its always crazy when iOS makes a major version change. Couple that with a new handset and the craziness triples. Everyone has questions, very few have the answers, and until we can get a docs update out, this questions posted here ARE the docs. The community just wants to see people search the board as they would search the docs before asking their questions. Don&#39;t take it personal, and don&#39;t let it dissuade you from asking questions in the future.</p>
