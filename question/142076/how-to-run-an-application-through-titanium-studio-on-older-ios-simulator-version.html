			<h1>How to run an application through Titanium Studio on older iOS Simulator version?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi. The question in its header.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t found a way to run application through Titanium Studio on older iOS Simulator version. Just choose older iOS sdk into Titanium &quot;Run Configuration…&quot; settings is wrong, because as I know SDK version setted must be always latest one from available. Simulator menu &quot;Hardware&quot; -&gt; &quot;Version&quot; not helps in this – after choosing 4.3 version simulator closes and after recompiling and second run you again get 5.1 version of iOS. Fortunately switching to Retina works for testing, but not switching the iOS version.</p>
<p>Only way what I found to run on older simulator version is to run the app directly from XCode. This is only way to do this?</p>

							<p>If all you need to do is run the application, you could first run it through Ti Studio, then quit and re-open the iOS Simulator directly. The app is still installed… This won&#39;t help if you&#39;re trying to go through debugging, though.</p>

										<p><p>:) This method is not working, because seems like different iOS versions has different environment and your compiled application not appearing into others iOS Simulator versions of iOS</p>

							<p>Try Xcode &gt; Preferences &gt; Downloads. There are usually a couple of other simulators that you can install based on what version of Xcode you&#39;re running.</p>

										<p><p>Of cource I already did this, Simulator of iOS 4.3 already installed. As I wrote before, I can run the app directly from XCode, but after I fix something into the project, I need to delete all the stuff from XCode, then close it, then compile (with run of Simulator, becouse no other way found to compile code into Titanium Studio) project into Titanium Studio, then open again XCode, then drag and drop iphone build folder from Finder to XCode and only then I can run the 4.3 Simulator from XCode. But anyway seems like something missed, some things not works properly in that case.</p>
<p>May be somebody know some hack for Titanium Studio to run the app in the oldest one simulator? Maybe some param in some config?</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m not sure I completely understand the question. You&#39;re saying that you want to run older sims WITHOUT the need to use &quot;Run Configurations ..&quot; but then you say that it should be easy to add into &quot;Run Configurations …&quot;. The statements seem contradictory to each other.</p>
