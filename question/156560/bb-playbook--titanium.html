			<p>I would very much like to give Titanium a go, but am not able to get a clear answer to the question if Titanium can be used to develop for the Blackberry Playbook. Beta support for BB10 is mentioned, but the situation concerning the Playbook is unclear to me.<br>And if it is somehow supported, could someone please also define the limitations to me. I&#39;d rather have it working with clearly defined limitations than not having it work at all.<br>Thanks in advance…</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>You are correct; Titanium does support BB10.  However the PlayBook is not supported.</p>
<p>You are correct to be confused - but not due to Appcelerator (in this case).  BlackBerry did announce some time ago that the PlayBook would be upgradeable to BB10, they promised this for some time.  However they have since changed their minds and the PlayBook will NOT get BB10 - annoying as I have one for this purpose!</p>
<p>As they said many time it would be upgradable - I imagine their are discussions about using it with Appcelerator.</p>
<p>However just to be clear - PlayBook does not support BB10 so cannot be used with Appcelerator Titanium.</p>
