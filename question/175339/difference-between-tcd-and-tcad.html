			<h1>Difference between TCD and TCAD??</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>What exactly is the difference between TCD and TCAD? From what I understand, both are one and the same thing just that TCAD is an earlier version and now it is being called as TCD. In that case, why are there different set of labs for TCD and TCAD at the following link?</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;td&#x2F;Home</p>
<p>Additionally, for taking up the TCD exam, shall I still follow the &#39;&#39;Building Native Mobile Apps&#39; video series? I ask this because it is quite old and seems to be designed for the TCAD exam; even the link to lab courses at the end of each of the video in this video series links to the labs for TCAD course.</p>

							<p>TCAD is the old certification, testing your knowledge of Titanium 2.x concepts and techniques.</p>
<p>TCD is the new certification, testing your knowledge of Titanium 3.x concepts and techniques.</p>
<p>There are no video training materials for TCD (at least none published by Appcelerator, there are third-party products). Check the Training pages for the list of certification objectives. Then, read the Docs and Guides on those topics. Make sure you can complete the labs and understand what and why the code does what it does.</p>
