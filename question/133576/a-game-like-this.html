							<p>There is a Box2D module in Titanium with some basic functionality that helps in making s2D games, not sure if it would help here but would be a good idea to test it. However, according to requirements you would have to change the module itself since the module is now open-source for the community to add to it. You can find the module on Github</p>

										<p><p>That game doesn&#39;t even <em>need</em> a physics engine, it&#39;s just linearly animated views. So if you did use Box2D on your game, it would probably be much more appealing!</p>
