			<h1>Problems creating Titanium Module Project</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am attempting to create an android module project from the command line according to the appcelerator tutorial on this subject. Here is the command:<br>titanium create –platform=android –type=module –name=mod3 –id=org.appcelerator.mod3 –android=c:\Program Files (x86)\Android\Android SDK.<br>The reponse I get is &quot;android&#x2F;android was unexpected at this time. I think it must be a syntax error of some sort, but I don&#39;t know what. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.<br>Android4.2, Ti 3.0, Win 7 Pro</p>

							<div><p>Thanks Mauro. Changing the path to one without blanks changed the results, but not what I was hoping for. After entering the titanium create command with all parameters, I was prompted for Target Platforms and Directory to place project, even though that information had already been entered. After answering the prompts, the command appears to be processed then two error messages: &quot;Unable to run command &#39;create&#39;&quot; and &quot;Maximum call stack size exceeded&quot;. Even with all this, it still created a module project, but the folders don&#39;t match those in the tutorial. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

							<div><p>Thanks Mauro. I performed the update to 3.1.0.GA. However, the errors are the same as before. The only difference I noticed was DEBUG statments as the Ti create command was executed. As I said before, even with the errors a module project of some sort was produced but not listed in Ti Studio, only in the workspace folder.</p>

							<div><p>Yes. Actually it always has but it creates yet a different set of folders&#x2F;files in the module project folder. Different from that created from command line and tutorial. However, I did use modules created this way and followed the instructions to import into Eclipse and run ant. However, in order to do so, a build.xml file is required but not created. So I just assumed that creating a module project from Ti Studio didn&#39;t work properly.</p>
