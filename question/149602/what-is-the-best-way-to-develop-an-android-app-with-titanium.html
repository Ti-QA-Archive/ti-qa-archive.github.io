			<h1>What is the best way to develop an android app with titanium?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello to all guys.<br>So far I have been developing on the iOS platform for iPhone and iPad, but now I would also begin to develop on the Android platform.</p>
<p>I ask you to ask is: What is the best way to develop an application on Android platform using Titanium?</p>
<p>I ask this because I know that Android, unlike iOS, offers a lot, I would say too many types of different resolutions for many types of smartphones. And I think that developing an app on Android that is perfect on each resolution is something really impossible and inhuman.</p>
<p>What I thought was to decide which target Android devices develop my app, and I would have thought the Galaxy line (s1, s2, s3, s4) and the most popular Android tablet.</p>
<p>This is a right way, according to you, to undertake the development of an Android app?</p>
<p>You suggest any other ideas? Do you have any advice?</p>
<p>Then another thing I would ask is this: What should I use SDK to develop in Android with Titanium?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve seen a lot of Android SDK are available and the last is 4.2.2. This SDK is compatible with Titanium? Can I use it without any problems?</p>
<p>Thank you all and I hope that in your answer that I can clarify some ideas.</p>

							<p>As you may have seen from the Q &amp; A, Android is one of those platforms where you need to get it reight from the start.</p>
<p>There is lots of documentation around on how best to do this. Some of it on the Appcelerator web site. heave a look <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Cross-Platform_Mobile_Development_In_Titanium">HERE</a> to start.</p>
<p>You seem to have thought about this very sensibly and selecting a set of devices to test on is a good way to go. A nexus 7 is also a good device to use for testing.</p>
<p>The only real advice apart from following the guides would be test on devices and if you notice a minor issue, fix it, Android is far less forgiving than IOS.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>T..</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Your question is too general for any real one answer fits all solution.</p>
<p>But to deal with your specifics;</p>
<ul>
<li>Testing Device</li>
</ul>
<p>When developing for Android - you cannot just test on the Emulator or one or two devices, you need lots, each providing different screen resolutions, aspect ratios, features, custom skins, camera resolutions, internal and sd card storage sizes.  At a minimum you should have 5 devices, covering the main screen sizes.  Developing for the high end only will mean your app with either perform badly on lesser devices or simply not at all.</p>
<ul>
<li>Android 4.2.2</li>
</ul>
<p>Bad choice to target (UNLESS you have an extremely good reason)_</p>
<p>This OS is not currently support by Titanium, first problem.  Second problem; so few devices actually have it as the OS, your market is massively limited in size.</p>
<p>The vast majority of devices run 2.3.x.  Whilst 4.x is catching up, 4.2.2 or even 4.2.x is a small percentage of the 4.x branch of currently installed devices.</p>
<p>Unlike iOS, Android OS upgrades are much slower in uptake for two reasons; carriers hate the idea and slow the roll-out.  Most users (of older devices) are either unwilling, unable because the do not know how, or unable because the hardware is outdated and will not upgrade.</p>
<p>If you are not assuming your app will run on devices with displays like; 240x320, 320x480, 480x600, 480x800, 640x800, 800x1200 to mention a few then you are in for an unwelcome surprise.  Developing for Android needs planning from the start on how things will look on all screen sizes.  You then need to work out if your storage requirements will exceed the average 2.x device.</p>
<p>The information Trevor Ward gave you pointed you towards more information, this is a learning exercise and one that cannot be answered in a single question I am afraid.</p>
<p>As to your comment to Sarafaraz about Ti SDK, always use the latest Titanium SDK, but target the Android audience rather than the latest version.</p>

										<p><p>ok thank you very much</p>
<p>I said that before you begin to develop an app on android I have to have a clear idea of ??what devices I want to run my app, because it is impossible to make it compatible with all the various resolutions. as you say no?</p>
<p>how about the Android SDK which should I use?</p>
<p>thanks again</p>

										<p><p>As I mentioned you should not target a single Android SDK, your app should aim to work on many of them.  For example if you create an app in Titanium and ALL it does is show an alert then it will work on all devices.  The Android SDK version should be somewhat irrelevant as if  you target the more recent Android SDKs you are then disallowing older OS versions the ability to run your app.  If you use older SDKs then you are allowing more OS versions but limiting some of the features.</p>
<p>This is a trade off game, not helped by the fragmentation of the Android system.  You CAN create one code base and compile for earlier devices using an older SDK minimum target and then with the same code base target higher devices.  This will create two APK files which you are now able to supply for ONE app.  So you can target high devices with one code base and provide all the higher resolution images in the file.  But also create another version using the same code that does not include the higher resolution images so earlier devices can have a smaller footprint.</p>
<p>This is something you will get a feel for when you start coding and working through problems.</p>
<p>Everyone has their own preference on what to do and that is dictated by the expected users, anticipated hardware they will use, the type of app you are creating, what time frame you have to build, expected revenue stream from the app.</p>
<p>Our basic Android testing involves these handsets;</p>
<ul>
<li>HTC Wildfire</li>
<li>HTC Desire S</li>
<li>Galaxy Nexus 4</li>
<li>Galaxy Nexus 7</li>
</ul>
<p>These four devices cover the main device resolution testing and performance you should be reviewing as you go.  You do not need THESE devices, but something like each of these to get to each screen size for real world testing - including the capabilities, particularly the HTC Wildfire as this has a tiny screen resolution, very little local storage, very slow, but a VERY COMMON handset.</p>

							<p>Hi Nicolo,</p>
<p>you can use</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> screenWidth</span> = Ti.Platform.displayCaps.platformWidth;
<span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> screenHeight</span> = Ti.Platform.displayCaps.platformHeight;
</code></pre><p>for the device height and width and set your layout as per device…so it helps you to manage layout for not all but most of resolution.</p>
<p>and i am using mobile sdk 2.1.3 and google api 4.0.3.</p>
<p>Best luck…</p>
