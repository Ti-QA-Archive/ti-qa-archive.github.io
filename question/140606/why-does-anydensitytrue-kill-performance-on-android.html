			<h1>Why does anyDensity=&#34;true&#34; kill performance on android</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I touched on this on a previous post about something else, but I just would like to flag to get thoughts from people, or to see if people even realise.</p>
<p>While building in appcelerator I had the anyDensity setting in the tiapp.xml set to true on android (bearing in mind I hadn&#39;t seen any reference to using dp&#39;s on android versus pixels or advantages&#x2F;disadvantages of it though after digging I did find references to using dp&#39;s on android instead), I noticed that the performance between iOS and android was quite noticeable in that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tableviews were choppy&#x2F;slow</li>
<li>Scrolling in general was slower</li>
<li>Map view was very choppy with numbers of markers added. Plus it appeared pixellated at points – ie- the &#39;your location&#39; beacon was pixellated</li>
<li>Swiping between scrollableView&#39;s was noticeably choppy<br>etc etc etc</li>
</ul>
<p>It was only upon accidentally while working out how to get high density images in android did I stumble across changing this setting. Naturally at this point, and every example app I&#39;d seen from appcelerator, that all my positionings&#x2F;sizings were just as standard numbers (defaulting to pixels), so the first thing I see when turning off the anyDensity setting is the layout became tiny (but images were now crisp). But then I noticed something.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the performance of the app went through the roof, everything was buttery smooth as I imagined it should have been, table&#39;s glide, scrolling flows, map views pan like butter, scroll views whoosh.</p>
<p>I then go through the laborious process of specifying all the values in dp&#39;s for android and my app looks how it should be again, but the performance is top notch.</p>
<p>So my questions are:</p>
<p>a) Why is anyDensity making performance become awful – I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s the whole scaling things up<br>b) Why do -all- appcelerator&#39;s guides&#x2F;examples not use dp&#39;s or set the anyDensity to false<br>c) Why isn&#39;t something that has such a detrimental impact on performance not underscored, flagged, made very clear from the offset<br>d) Am I missing something, does everybody know this already or have I just fallen foul of some appcelerator joke!</p>

<p>Before reading this I was pulling my hair out and spending hours making optimizations to my android code which seemed to have little-to-no impact. Removing anyDensity=&quot;false&quot; from my tiapp.xml fixed it immediately. </p>
<p>Now I just need to go through and switch everything to &#39;dp&#39;.</p>
