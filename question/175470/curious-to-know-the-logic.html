							<div><p>I would guess the reason that you have been marked down is due to the wording of the question itself not the use of English - just the tone.</p>
<p>You ask;</p>
<ul>
<li>parking spot app..how it is created?</li>
<li>how can the car be detected?</li>
<li>whats the logic?</li>
<li>what hardware detects its?</li>
<li>can we create using titanium?</li>
</ul>
<p>From this; most people including myself would think you want everybody else to teach you how to create your app. You clearly state that you do not have any idea how you should start the process or how it would even work.</p>
<p>If you read this - you might also come to the same conclusion - this person wants me to explain everything they need to do to create an app they will put in the store.  The Q&amp;A is for people to ask questions like;</p>
<ul>
<li>I cannot get xyz to work?</li>
<li>How can I make this animate like this other app I haver seen?</li>
<li>Is it possible to add this to my app?</li>
<li>How can I do this iOS only in Android but honouring the Android way of doing things?</li>
</ul>
<p>You CAN also ask something like this;</p>
<ul>
<li>I would love to make an app that determines car parking spaces available.  But I do not know where to start.  Does anyone have any pointers for me so I can start researching the subject?</li>
</ul>
<p>But your question read like this;</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to make a parking spot app, I have not even tried to think of anything myself but I want you do do most of the work for me.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately there are many that come here and demand that others do their work for them or demand their question is answered within a few minutes or else.  You no longer appear to be one of these people - but at first your question did look like you were one of those sort of people.</p>
<p>So for the next question you post, think about what you want to say and then think about how the person willing to give up their time will read that question.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it seem demanding?</li>
<li>Could people think you have not at least tried to research your subject?</li>
<li>Is the question so short in words that there is no way you could be clear?</li>
<li>Will they have to guess that you had found something relevant but did not include it in the question information?</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally</p>
<p>When people down vote a question they should in most circumstances provide a reason why, this way others can follow up and maybe even point out the down voter might have simply misunderstood.  This happens I did just this myself yesterday, I misunderstood an answer as being very wrong, So I commented this belief and down voted the answer.  Someone came back and explained how I had misunderstood - so I commented again - explaining I had been wrong and then up voted the answer.</p>
<p>Sometimes however when a question looks just so bad or very likely to be from someone who does the things I said above - you simply down-vote - you are giving the same amount of effort you believe the author of the question gave.</p>
<p>I hope that explains things.</p>

							<p>Well, looking at the URL you are calling, you are returning the following:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">{
    <span class="hljs-attribute">location_name</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"Central Parking"</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attribute">address</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"500 W. Monroe"</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attribute">city</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"Chicago"</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attribute">state</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"IL"</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attribute">zip</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"60606"</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attribute">type</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"commercial-garage"</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attribute">timezone</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"America/Chicago"</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attribute">lat</span>: <span class="hljs-number">41.880776963202</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attribute">lng</span>: -<span class="hljs-number">87.640315890312</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attribute">eticket</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attribute">directions</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"Look for the green Central Parking post on the sidewalk near the     garage entrance. The entrance is on the left on W. Monroe Street between Clinton     and Canal Street. There is an alternate entrance on Canal Street."</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attribute">description</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"Perfect spot for the Civic Opera House as it is very close. Indoor     parking lot completly sheltered from the elements. Heated during the winter and     well lit in a class A office building. This is a 24/7 parking garage."</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attribute">recommendations</span>: <span class="hljs-number">318</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attribute">accepting</span>: null,
    <span class="hljs-attribute">listings</span>: [ ]
}
</code></pre><p>And there is no <code>results</code> element in this response. So in order to display the actual parsed object, you would have to use the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> response = <span class="hljs-built_in">JSON</span>.parse(<span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.responseText);
Ti.API.info(response);
</code></pre><p>Also, use the <code>GET</code> action when invoking your http request instead of <code>Get</code>.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
