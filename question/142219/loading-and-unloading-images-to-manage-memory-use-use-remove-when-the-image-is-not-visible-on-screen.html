			<h1>Loading and unloading images to manage memory use: use remove when the image is not visible on screen</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all,<br>in the best practice document concerning the image optimization and memory management, they advise:  Loading and unloading images to manage memory use.</p>
<p>I have a lot of remote images loading in a tableview. Do you have an example of code which could work to do this:<br>remove() images from the view hierarchy when they&#39;re not &quot;on the screen&quot; to permit the operating system to free memory.</p>
<p>When I scroll up &amp; down in the table, would the images constantly be added &amp; removed?</p>
<p>thanks for your help</p>

							<p>I think removing and adding images as you scroll up will be an overhead on the app and bandwidth. Generally speaking this is what I would do - </p>
<p>1) create a window<br>2) create a function that will create &#x2F; populate initial table view with set number of rows<br>3) In that method, you would probably look through a list to get the images from server, use the same parameter to hold the image. before they are set in the view &#x2F; row<br>4) before you return the tableview from that method, set that param to null.<br>5) control is back to the main&#x2F;caller function, so here you would just add the tableview to the window. You may add a row&#x2F;button&#x2F;action listener at the end to &#39;Load More&#39; rows or you may want to refresh the tableview to add more rows as the user scrolls down. </p>
<p>What I have learnt using Apple Instruments to monitor memory leaks in my app is that as long as an object is attached to window (active) the memory will be released when the window is closed as that closes the attached objects. However you need to remove the application listeners and also nullify any objects you created within the class&#x2F;function that are not indirectly&#x2F;directly added to the window</p>
<p>Hopefully this helps you.</p>

							<p>images in the table view are cached I believe… The bigger question might be how many images are you trying to load in a table view and why so many at once? the user should probably page through the content… this might provide a better user experience</p>

							<p>Hello,<br>I want to create a facebook or instagram like timeline which auto load previous content when scrolling down.<br>And this apps seem to be able to load infinite content… Do you have an idea? Do they use tableview or scrollingview? And how do they manage memory with the pics and content?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Fabien</p>
