			<h1>Distribute in-house - need a little help</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I built and deployed an iPad app with Titanium 5 months ago (in-house distribution license). Then this past week I came back to code some fixes and upgrades and had an awful time with the certs and provisioning profiles. So I upgraded to the latest version of Ti and also XCode. After that the errors went away when compiling to an iOS device BUT I think something is still going wong.</p>
<p>A few data points:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can&#39;t find the IPA file after a build. Previously it always got generated. But I see some binaries, they&#39;re just not ipa files.</li>
<li>Ti is using my Development profile instead of my Distribution profile. I can&#39;t make it use the distribution profile and I thought that&#39;s what I needed.</li>
<li>The app ends up appearing in my local iTunes.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m getting a &quot;development build&quot; (requiring a registered device) instead of a &quot;distribution build&quot; in which I can install it on any device at my company. How can I fix this? On the &quot;run on iOS device&quot; dialog that pops up when trying to compile to hardware, I have 3 green checkmarks and no errors. But the Provisioning Profile points at my &quot;development&quot; mobileprovision instead of &quot;distribution&quot;. Both development and distribution profiles show up as Valid in my xcode. Should I make Ti use the distribution profile? I thought this is what I did before, 5 months ago, when it all worked correctly. But how can I? Ti doesn&#39;t seem to let me. Not sure if I&#39;m doing this right. Their UI has changed on this dialog, it&#39;s different now. Or if it&#39;s correct already, where do I find the IPA? It doesn&#39;t seem to be anywhere in the iphoneos tree where I used to find it. Please help.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>You have a number of things going on here, I will try my best to help you with them.</p>
<p>I think most of the problems may be how you are compiling the app, are you using the &#39;compile to device&#39; option which may sound right but it is not the right one for you.</p>
<p>Under the brown parcel icon next to the normal test icon - you can compile for adhoc, here you can specify your ad hoc certificate that you need to have already created, then compile.</p>
<p>From memory adhoc compiles go through the same system as app store distributions, so once you have compiled the app at it looks like nothing has happened - launch Xcode, open organiser from inside and choose archives.  Select the app and select &#39;show in finder&#39; from the menu.</p>
<p>You should then see the app file you are missing.</p>
<p>Hope that helps, if not let me know.</p>

										<p><p>Malcolm, thanks so much. I had forgotten about the itunes&#x2F;inhouse compile option, and that&#39;s it&#39;s different from targeting an iOS device. It&#39;s all working and deployed now. Wahoo.</p>
