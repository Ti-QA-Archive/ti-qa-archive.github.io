							<p>Which titanium sdk you are using ?</p>
<p>Ti SDK 3.1.3 GA and 3.2.0  has support for iOS7 so it is recommended to use SDK 3.1.3.GA  and above version in which this issue is already resolved.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Sounds like you need to set the property value for the window itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>window <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.UI.Window-property-statusBarStyle">statusBarStyle</a></li>
</ul>

										<p><p>Just to confirm - things have changed in order to support the new status bar styles for iOS7.  So unless your non-alloy app used the same SDK as you are currently using, you may now need to do things slightly differently.  Keep in mind unless you are only supporting iOS7 you will need to check that iOS6 and iOS7 devices see the status bars as you hope they will given they now operate differently from each other from a UI perspective.</p>
