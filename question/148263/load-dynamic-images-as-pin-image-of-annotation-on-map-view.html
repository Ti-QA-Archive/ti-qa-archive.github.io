			<h1>Load dynamic Images as pin image of annotation on map view</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, I am implementing map view in my project and I am showing annotations on this map view. now I want to use images for annotations image. I am able to do this with local images that are already stored in my filesystem. so my question is that &quot;is it possible to use remote images instead of local images for annotation over mapview?&quot; note- remote images working fine in browser. so please suggest me any solutions.<br>thanks!</p>

							<div><p>HI, I want to do that because I want to show directions on map view. I am describing situation in detail…. I am calling MAPQUEST Direction API to draw the route on map view. I am getting response of web service call. in that response I am getting distance, Images and lat long for route drawing. everything is fine. I am drawing the route but I want  to show directions on map view. I am getting remote images for particular lat long so please suggest me how to handle the situation. how to show these images on map view for particular position, so that I can show directions. I have used annotations for this work but it shows pins on the map.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>You can achieve this, you just need to think about it a little differently.</p>
<p>The <strong>annotation</strong> view has a property called <strong>leftView</strong>, and if you remember that there is a view designed for images called <strong>imageView</strong> you can marry the two things together.  An <strong>imageView</strong> has built in support for the remote images.</p>
<p>Here is a a working example for you, the image is a windows flag - do not shoot me for that.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> url = <span class="hljs-string">'https://twimg0-a.akamaihd.net/profile_images/2535822544/secztwqh31xo8xydi4kq_normal.png'</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> pin = Ti.<span class="hljs-built_in">Map</span>.createAnnotation({
    animate: <span class="hljs-keyword">true</span>,
    latitude: <span class="hljs-number">51.5171</span>,
    <span class="hljs-comment">//leftView: leftImage,</span>
    leftView: Ti.UI.createImageView({ image: url, height: <span class="hljs-number">20</span>, width: <span class="hljs-number">20</span> }),
    longitude: -<span class="hljs-number">0.1062</span>,
    pincolor: Ti.<span class="hljs-built_in">Map</span>.ANNOTATION_RED,
    subtitle: <span class="hljs-string">'London'</span>,
    title: info.title
});

										<p><p>Hi Malcolm,</p>
<p>Thanks for quick reply and your solution. I have checked it but my question is that I don&#39;t want to show default PIN Images on the map view for annotations. your solution works when I click on annotation then it shows Remote Image, but I want to show it instead of pin image.  situation is that I am getting images in response of a web service call. and I want to show these images on map view for direction purpose. so if you have any idea then please let me know…… Thanks again…..!!!</p>

										<p><p>Hi Malcolm, </p>
<p>I&#39;m trying something similar and I cannot get an image to appear on the map annotations.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s something simple.  (Developing for iOS using latest (3.1) Titanium everything.)</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried setting the leftButton to a remote URL (as the doc&#39;s suggest), I&#39;ve tried setting both leftButton and leftView (separately) to a created imageView (as you do in the example.) I&#39;ve verified that my URL&#39;s are valid.  I&#39;ve tried with it with local images as well.</p>
<p>My code is below. (I added the .toBlob() because assigning imageVIew to leftView as you do caused an exception that the annotation was looking for a string or a blob.</p>
<p>Any suggestions would be appreciated!</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">  var newAnnotation = Titanium.Map.createAnnotation({
                 <span class="hljs-string">leftButton :</span> Ti.UI.createImageView({<span class="hljs-string">image :</span> url, <span class="hljs-string">height :</span> <span class="hljs-number">20</span>, <span class="hljs-string">width :</span> <span class="hljs-number">20</span>}).toBlob(),

                <span class="hljs-string">latitude :</span> _geoloc[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>],
                <span class="hljs-string">longitude :</span> _geoloc[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>],
                <span class="hljs-string">title :</span> curFind.relatedInfo().username,
                <span class="hljs-string">subtitle :</span> curFind.relatedInfo().locationString,
                <span class="hljs-string">pincolor :</span> Titanium.Map.ANNOTATION_RED,
                <span class="hljs-string">animate :</span> <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>,


            });

However I only have a short while this evening, so others may pick up the thread; but no-one will spot you here.</p>

							<p>I don&#39;t think you can set a URL for an annotation image. But one thing you <strong>can</strong> do is to download those images (using the HttpClient) and save those images in the <code>Titanium.Filesystem.tempDirectory</code> directory. From there, you can use those same images.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
