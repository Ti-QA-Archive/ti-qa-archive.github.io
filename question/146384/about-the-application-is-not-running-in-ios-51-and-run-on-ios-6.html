							<p>Hmm, I&#39;m not sure why this would be happening. I would plug your iPhone 4 in, launch Xcode, go to the Organizer, and find your device. Expand it and you&#39;ll see the &quot;Console&quot;. Clean your project and do another device build and watch both the build output and the Xcode console to see if there are any errors being thrown.</p>
