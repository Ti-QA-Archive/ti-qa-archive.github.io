			<h1>Continue propagating touch events after a listener responds</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I need to listen for touch start&#x2F;end event on a window, but when I process it, the rest of the objects in the window no longer respond. Is there any way to make the objects continue to respond, ie not stop propagation of the event after my listener is executed?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>The webview cannot have BOTH listeners in the html and as Titanium UI entity.It is written in documentation.</p>
<p>&quot;Since a webview internally wants to handle its own events, scrolling and other related touch events against it&#39;s own view surface, you cannot have both Titanium style events against the webview instance and internal Javascript events in the DOM. You must choose between one or the other.&quot;</p>

										<p><p>I have a status bar of sorts near the bottom of the window, that needs to fade out while the user is interacting with the screen. Once the interaction stops, it fades back in. This works fine in every way, except that the webview on the screen no longer scrolls. I may have to just change the display portion of the interface to a tableview, but I liked having the flexibility of it being a webview.</p>
<p>It looks like you can&#39;t have eventlisteners on a webview, or any view that contains a webview, and still have the webview handle its internal events.</p>

										<p><p>Is the webview local? ( the html is local?) if yes, you can create cross-app events fired in the webview and listened in the app.</p>
<p>Makes sense?</p>

										<p><p>Nope, not local. I&#39;ll just use the tableview. Thanks for all your help.</p>

							<p>Not sure what you mean?<br>Anyway, you might want to attach the event to the window and check the source of the event and act accordingly. It&#39;s some sort of event delegation found in DOM.</p>

										<p><p>What I mean is if for example I add the eventlistener for touchstart to the window, the webview beneath apparently no longer correctly receives that event. It can&#39;t be dragged&#x2F;scrolled anymore. If I also add an event listener to the webview, it does hear it, but it doesn&#39;t respond to the UI and scrolls. I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m doing wrong.</p>
