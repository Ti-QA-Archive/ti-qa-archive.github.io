			<h1>App review is rejected because &#34;We found that your app failed to launch&#34;</h1>

		<section>
			<p>I distributed my app created by Titanium Mobile but it was rejected.</p>
<p>Apple says that:</p>
<p>&quot;We found that your app failed to launch on iPad running iOS 7.1.2 and iPhone 5s running iOS 7.1.2, on both Wi-Fi and cellular networks.</p>
<p>We encountered the issue when selecting the application on the Home screen - the app displayed a launch image then quit unexpectedly. This may be because iOS 7.1.2 uses a watchdog timer for applications; if an application takes too long to complete its initial startup, the operating system terminates the application. &quot;</p>
<p>Of course my app can launch on my device (iPod touch, iOS 7.1.2) and startup time is less than 3 seconds. So I wonder what I should do.<br>Have anyone encountered and solved this problem??</p>

							<p>You&#39;ll need to try testing on the devices Apple claims is crashing. Also, be sure to try running a production build on your device, not just a &quot;Run on Device&quot; dev build.</p>

										<p><p>Startup time of 3 seconds is pretty long. You will often see guides suggest anything over 10ms (milliseconds) is too long. You should consider what you can do to optimize the load time – see what you can delay after the app initially opens, don&#39;t hit the network right away, lazy load information, etc.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you for answers.I tried to run Ad Hoc version on device, but it worked. In addition, I tried to run it on other device not used for development, but it doesn&#39;t crash. Used device is iPod touch (iOS 7.1.2), not iPhone, but I do not think there are so big difference between iPod touch and iPhone. Any other possible test way?</p>

							<p>This issue was solved. It is because that my app stops when &quot;not allow&quot; is chosen in push notification allow dialog.</p>
