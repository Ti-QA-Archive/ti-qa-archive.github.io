			<h1>Xcode 4.2 GM seed</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Was wondering if this was supported with Ti Studio 1.0&#x2F;SDK 1.7.2 yet.</p>
<p>Would like to start testing against iOS 5 soon, since it wil be out next week and several of our Titanium apps will release after that</p>

							<p>Xcode and iOS betas are not supported by Appcelerator until they are GA… that said, any fixes to bugs related to iOS5  and Xcode would be in the CI builds for 1.7.3 or 1.8.0</p>

							<p>But a GM seed isn&#39;t a beta, it&#39;s the Gold Master that will be shipped on the firmware for the devices being manufactured.</p>

							<p>Understand about beta, which is why I never asked.  Except as Chris says, this is essentially the shipping product, which our customers will be using next week.</p>
<p>I am assuming our actual apps will run OK under iOS 5?</p>

							<p>Yes, we know GM is not beta, but we just got our hands on the GA too, so we are doing final testing before releasing fixes.</p>
<p>The gold master remains under the terms of Apple&#39;s NDA except for items announced by Apple at their event and on their website. For that reason, bugs related to iOS5 cant be discussed openly for open source projects. We are working very hard to make sure that everything works correctly on iOS5.</p>
<p>As I stated, the latest fixes will be in the CI builds for 1.7.3 or 1.8.0. But know that if you update to Xcode 4.2&#x2F;iOS5 we can&#39;t support you, as we can&#39;t openly talk about it as we are under NDA.</p>
