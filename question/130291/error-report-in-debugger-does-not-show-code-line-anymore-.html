			<h1>Error report in debugger does not show code line anymore ?!</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,<br> ever since I updated the SDK and Ti Studio through the latest update 2 weeks ago the error reporting in the debuger (console of Ti studio) is pretty useless! , it used to show (for most of the errors) the file, the line number producing the error and sometimes it was nice enough to mention the reason.<br>Right now it only says [ERROR] Script Error = {<br>and lets you shoot in the dark to find the error. I am relatively new to Titanium but I love it, so I don&#39;t want to sound complainting but I really miss the old the functionality it saved lots of time to just show you the line number, the rest is luxury, but line number and file of the error source is pretty crucial i think.<br>Thanks alot,<br>Adham</p>

							<p>Make sure your default log level is set correctly: Right Click on your project &gt; Run As &gt; Run Configurations &gt; Main tab &gt; Set Log Level to Trace.</p>
<p>In one of the recent updates, it seems to have gotten reset to a less robust level.</p>
