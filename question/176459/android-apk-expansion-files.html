			<h1>Android APK Expansion Files</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have an app built for Android ready to go on the market place. The problem is on this app I have numerous videos that need to be in the application. I have looked on here for a solution regarding APK Expansion Files, yet I haven&#39;t came across anything. Is this a feature on Titanium that I am missing or will there be a feature released in the new future to deal with expansion files? Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

							<p>As far as I know, there is no support for expansion files currently in our tooling or SDK. I don&#39;t even find Jira tickets requesting the feature be added. You&#39;re welcome to submit a feature request ticket and we&#39;ll consider it.</p>
<p>That said, do you really need to include those videos in the app itself? Will a significant portion of your users view a significant portion of those videos, and want to keep those videos on their device as long as your app is installed? Neither the developer nor the users of your app can delete files distributed as part of the APK. </p>
<p>Some sort of download &#x2F; first-run process to get selected (even all) the videos offers many advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smaller APK file, so more users likely to install the app</li>
<li>Users can choose when to sync the videos – to pick a time they&#39;re on WiFi, have lots of time to wait for a download to finish, or whatever</li>
<li>Users could delete the downloaded videos (they could &quot;clear data&quot; for the app to wipe them all, even if you don&#39;t provide a UI to delete individual videos)</li>
<li>You could present options to download just a subset of the videos if not everyone needs every video</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>Thanks for your response Tim. Yes, the client does want the videos on the app. You do bring up a good point regarding the downloading of the app. I&#39;ll see what I can do regarding the syncing of the videos. Any tips regarding setting up external downloading of the videos for Android?</p>
<p>Thanks Ingo for the ticket. I&#39;ll be watching this closely. Appreciate the feedback.</p>

										<p><p>Matt, this is probably nothing you haven&#39;t already figured out … our <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;platform&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Filesystem_Access_and_Storage">file system guide</a> covers the mechanics of saving the files. I&#39;d probably prompt the user with a yes&#x2F;no option to download the videos or maybe a set of checkboxes through which they could select which videos to download. Then, loop through each file, download, and save to the applicationDataDirectory. I&#39;d store the resulting path to a database table. The video player component accepts a file path for its url property. Pull that path from the DB and feed it to the video player.</p>
<p>I&#39;d download the videos sequentially and not attempt to download multiples in parallel. Since the files are huge, parallel downloads wouldn&#39;t speed up the process and would probably overwhelm Android. </p>
<p>I have a birding app that essentially did this. After installing, the first time I ran it, it offered me a prompt to download all the pictures &amp; sound files. That gave me the opportunity to say &quot;not now&quot; and then actually do so later that evening when I wasn&#39;t going to be using my tablet actively and could let it sit &amp; chug away on downloading.</p>
