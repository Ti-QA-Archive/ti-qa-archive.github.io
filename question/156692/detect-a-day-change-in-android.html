			<h1>Detect a day change in Android</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I have a little problem and till now I&#39;m not able to find the solution.</p>
<p>My app needs to change its data when a new day comes, so I was thinking on recalculate it when it comes back to &quot;resume&quot; from paused state. It works on iOS and Android. For iOS no problem: I just get the &quot;Ti.App.resume&quot; event and all works really fine.</p>
<p>But for Android I found a lot of problems:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If I use a custom Navigator controller (to have a navBar available) with the option to make the new opened window &quot;lightweight&quot; (navBarHidden = true), then the Android activity is attached to the splash screen and the app don&#39;t respond to pause&#x2F;resume events anymore (only on the splash screen). I think this is a bug or something like that (see <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;149942&#x2F;pause--resume-events-dont-fire-android">this post</a> for clarifications.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If I use a &quot;heavyweight&quot; window (just not setting navBarHidden in the navigation controller), the activity responds, but the physical BACK button closes any window directly, instead of returning to the previous window. Well, I can override the &quot;win.addEventListener(&#39;android:back&#39;, function(e)…) but then the problem in point 3 appears and all begins to mix.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Manually closing new windows on the custom navBar produces <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;156532&#x2F;custom-navigation-bar-problems-with-android">this problem</a>, so I can&#39;t use the previous technic to avoid the Android back button.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#39;m in a circle and don&#39;t find the solution to this problem other than make a timer and check the day change every X time, which sounds terrifying for battery life.</p>
<p>Any idea? After many twists still unresolved for me.</p>

							<p>Okay. I think I can help you. I will look at this issue later today, maybe tomorrow.</p>
<p>One thing I want to add relating to your thoughts on the ActionBar: I use it in many Apps because I want a good user experience for the 63% Android users with Android 4.X - I&#39;m afraid I waste time on custom UI implementations just to satisfy the 33% Gingerbread users. I guess they got used to a more uncomfortable UX and they know that they have tp press the menu button to access options. Anyway, my Apps work fine on Android 2.3 - they just look better on Android 4.X :)</p>
<p>If you wish, you can look at these samples that I have on github:</p>
<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;manumaticx&#x2F;dynamicOptionsMenu">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;manumaticx&#x2F;dynamicOptionsMenu</a></p>

										<p><p>For me, the code has a lot of sense.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To close a win, you don&#39;t do win.close() (in your window.js) you do nav.close, so yes, the close function is called, so popNavBar() is always called. I will put, in any case, a Ti.Api.info to verify it tomorrow. For example, in the pill.js file: <code>Alloy.Globals.navBar.close($.winPill);</code> (I must save the navBar as global to have acces to it in all the contexts).</p>
</li>
<li><p>navGroup is, in fact, the stack navViews = []. The code makes the next (under my understand, because I didn&#39;t code it): you start with a single empty navView, in which you create a view and attach it the window you pass as a parameter to the OPEN function. Also you create a label for the title. Optionally you can add a left&#x2F;right buttons, imitating iOS behavior. Once you need to call another window, you make Alloy.Globals.navBar.open($.window) that pushes this window in the stack (pushNavBar() function). navViews it&#39;s only a LIFO var to save all the windows. When you need to close the window, just Alloy.Globals.navBar.close($.window), that pops (it supposes destroy) the last window (current window in fact) and recovers the previous.<br>The other var, navView contains the current window composition (the view with the title and&#x2F;or buttons).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this design is very smart. The only problem is WHY popNavBar don&#39;t releases the objects in the navViews.pop() command (or I&#39;m supposing that).</p>

										<p><p>Okay. when I was debugging this code, popNavBar was never called. </p>
<p>Anyway, I think the problem is, that <strong>pushNavBar()</strong> doesn&#39;t push new objects into <strong>navViews</strong>, it only assigns <strong>navView</strong> to a new object and push another reference into <strong>navViews</strong>. I didn&#39;t test it but I believe <code>navViews[0] === navViews[1]</code>is <strong>true</strong> and same thing for every other element of <strong>navViews</strong>. Maybe you can test this. It would explain why the &quot;objects&quot; (actually the references) are not getting released.</p>
<p>Another problem is: you can not map a navigation with a LIFO stack. A navigation structure should be a tree. A stack can only map a navigation history. If this is the purpose of this design, then you should store the window references.</p>

<p>Following your tips I also tested (maybe bad, I&#39;ve 1 month with JS) to create a new object and push it on the stack. I did this:</p>

                backgroundColor: <span class="hljs-string">'#BBB'</span>
            });
            navViews.push(newNavView);
        navView = newNavView; <span class="hljs-comment">// To get access to the new object</span>
        };
</code></pre><p>Would be this correct?</p>
<p>Respect to LIFO, the goal is to have exaclty a LIFO navigation, not a tree. The user will always have a unique path to follow: win1 -&gt; win2 -&gt; win3 &lt;- win2 -&gt; win4 &lt;- win2 &lt;- win1<br>I dont need the window references because when the last window is closed (by the navBar), the previous is just behind, waiting to interact.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>First of all, I noticed that you confused the heavyweight &#x2F; lightweight issue. Setting navBarHidden makes a window heavyweight, not the other way round ;)</p>
<p>So, by default, every heavyweight window gets closed by the back button and you get back to the previous heavyweight window. If your first window (the index window) is also heavyweight, then you should give it an <em>exitOnClose: true</em> to prevent getting back to the &quot;splash screen&quot; (the root activity).</p>
<p>If you&#39;re using a custom navigation controller with lightweight windows, then you should store your navigation history in your own back stack (LIFO) and override the back event to close those windows manually.</p>
<p>I recently came across a similar issue finding a solution for resuming behavior. I don&#39;t use Ti.App.resume on android. To manage the activity lifecycle correctly I did some tests with activity events (have a look at my <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;156619&#x2F;confused-about-referencing-activity-proxy">question here</a>). To resume on both, iOS and Android, I use this code (note, that my index window is heavyweight):</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (OS_IOS){
    Ti.App.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'resume'</span>, onResume);
}
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (OS_ANDROID){
    $.index.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'open'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>)</span>{
        $.index.activity.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'resume'</span>, onResume);   
    });
}
</code></pre><p>I hope this helps you a little bit. Otherwise, you can always ask if something is not clear!</p>
<p>Manuel</p>

										<p><p>Hi Manuel.</p>
<p>Thanks for your response. You are right, I interchanged the light-heavy names, but the explanation was the same.</p>
<p>For your tip, is still not working on my project for a simple question: the first window, after the splash window, is created with the custom navbar, so it is configured as navBarHidden = true and only the splash screen responds to activity events.</p>
<p>You can say &quot;don&#39;t set this property and let the new windows to be light&quot;. But then we incur in the point 2, as I described, which ends in the problem I found in point 3.</p>
<p>It seems to be a dog chasing its tail.</p>
<p>If you want to test the code, I have it on github: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mcvendrell&#x2F;Pasti&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;app&#x2F;lib&#x2F;navigation.js">navigation controller</a>, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mcvendrell&#x2F;Pasti&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;app&#x2F;controllers&#x2F;index.js">mainpage</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mcvendrell&#x2F;Pasti&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;app&#x2F;controllers&#x2F;pill.js">secondary page example</a></p>
<p>If I can resolve the problem on point 3 (mixing data in the navbar view), I could resolve all.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ve installed your app but for me it only works on iOS. On Android the UI is completely broken. Since you are doing a very similar thing in terms of navigation I would suggest you take a look at the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;alloy&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;test&#x2F;apps&#x2F;models&#x2F;todo">todo app</a> in the Alloy test apps. Maybe you get some inspiration from there.</p>
<p>To solve your recalculate-on-resume-issue, just add the snippet from my answer to the index.js. It should work.</p>
<p>I&#39;m very sorry that I can&#39;t really help you with your custom navigation controller, but it seems you just need an fresh new approach.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you very much for your time, Manuel. The reason for use the same UI in iOS and Android is because I think that give visual options to de user is always better than &quot;long press over a row&quot; or &quot;click menu to show the Add option&quot;, which are the options to do things on Android and forces the user to make more clicks than necesary. My intention was to have all options in the screen, as much as possible, like iOS style.</p>
<p>But if it is not possible (due to the problem I have with the option 3, that mixes the content) I will surrender and make an Android UI style to make things work. It&#39;s a pitty, I was almost done, just that issue with the mixing views…</p>
<p>Again thanks for your time. Time to sleep (0.05 here). Tomorrow will be my last try!!</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say that it is not possible - It is just not the appropriate way to &quot;imitate&quot; iOS within an Android app (I know, that is a debate on principles of cross-platform development). As an example: You don&#39;t need to provide a back-button because Android users will intuitively  use the systems back button.</p>
<p>You should definitely also have a look at Androids <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;guide&#x2F;topics&#x2F;ui&#x2F;actionbar.html">ActionBar</a>. It provides you a smart way to present options of your menu as action items. I think this is even more handy than the iOS NavigationBar.</p>
<p>If I had some time I would fork your project to make some improvements, but unfortunately I&#39;m a little stressed at the moment. There are many good examples and sample code on the internet - I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find a good solution for your app.</p>

										<p><p>Same timezone, so we are synchronized. ;)</p>
<p>Some points: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Of course, the appropriate way is not &quot;imitate&quot; iOS, but for very simple apps (like mine), I think is not a bad idea, the user will find all that need in screen, no menus, no hidden options. And in my custom NavBar I&#39;m not using a custom back button, I use the android back button, but sometimes I need to autoclose the window (for example, deleting an item while in its screen needs to automatically close the item view and go back to the items list). To do this I need in my custom nav a way to close the window and go back to the previous.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Android.ActionBar">ActionBar</a>… I thought on it at the start but… it&#39;s only for Android 3.0 (API level 11) and above and I want my app to work on 2.3.3, which still have a lot of users. So I decide to use a custom navBar. I search at start for some examples and found my actual implementation (it is not my design). All worked so well until I realized the strange behavior with the mixing values I explained in point 3. If I can solve this strange behavior, all my problems will disappear.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The custom navBar, although it&#39;s not my design, seems to be well done. The navView is always the same, but it&#39;s changed in values accordingly to the new windows. What I don&#39;t understand is why the new data is showed mixed with the old. It&#39;s like this data remains instead of being ovewrited.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, today, some new tries with the custom navBar and will see…</p>

										<p><p>Umm a widget… I&#39;m new to titanium, but will try to integrate this widget. It is &quot;Alloyed&quot; and maybe will work. Thanks for this tip.</p>

										<p><p>Well, after some studying of the choices those are my conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Chariti widget is very complex and don&#39;t complay with the Titanium widgets rules (it is not self-contained, has some code in main functions that reffers to a general core.js library with a lot of code in the root app directory).</p>
</li>
<li><p>I saw your examples, but still need a solution for Gingerbread.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So I think my final options are only two: fix the custom navController to make it work without the mixing problem or forget the navBar and make a classic Android functionallity (no title bar, options in menu and long press in rows to delete an item).</p>
