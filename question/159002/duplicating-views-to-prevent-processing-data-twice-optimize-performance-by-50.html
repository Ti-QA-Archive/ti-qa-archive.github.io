			<h1>Duplicating views to prevent processing data twice, optimize performance by 50%</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve seen many people wondering on how to duplicate views.<br>Most of them seem to solve their problems by generating the view inside a function<br>and then call the function twice. (Non-alloy solution)</p>
<p>But this doesn&#39;t fix my problem… I&#39;m doing a view in Alloy based on db information.<br>Lets say I have to process like 100 rows in order to generate 43 rows in my table inside my view.<br>This takes some loading time.</p>
<p>Now to create 2 views it will twice as long.</p>
<p>The only solution I can come up with is to extract the tableview component to the parent view.<br>but this will mess code organization since the parent for itself is already complex and I will have half code in 1 controller and half in the other, which makes it harder for the next developer to understand.</p>
<p>This would be my last resource, I rather avoid extracting the table from the view to which it belongs.</p>
<p>thank you</p>

							<div><p>Yes, is there a way to duplicate the view without the need to execute controller.js code twice or extracting the code to the parent? I mean the view was built… why should I need to execute the same code over again in order to use it in a different place.</p>

							<div><p>for better understanding…<br>this wont work (why?)</p>
<p>file1.js</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> eventView = Alloy.createController(<span class="hljs-string">'eventsView'</span>).getView();
$.eventViewArea.add(eventView);
$.evtView.add(eventView);
</code></pre><p>Inside eventView.js controller doing like 99999 queries<br>so the only way i have to fix this will be moving eventView.js code to file1.js ?</p>
<p>since file1.js already has 9999 lines of code, and i will be adding 9999 more lines of code from eventView.js. this will result into a massive file with 9999999999999 lines of code in file1.js which makes it hard to read&#x2F;search&#x2F;work for code.</p>
<p>Can you see what I want to avoid?</p>
<p>And if im using this code to create the eventView… why should i move it to file1.js?</p>
<p>Im not very good explaining my problems sorry for that. I hope this help you</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>If you are looking for a faster tableView, then as long as your needs are based around a consistent template (or a couple) - use <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.UI.ListView">listView</a></p>
<p>No views, simply define one or more template layouts that your rows will use and provide the data.  Depending on your actual needs this is usually much faster as long as your view needs are not very complicated.</p>

										<p><p>thats the same as pushing the code from the view to the parent controller right?<br>Excuse me for this stupid question but…<br>Ignoring on how the rows will look like, because I believe the time I&#39;m losing is before the rows being built (on database queries and filtering data inside&#39;s view controller), is it possible to define a function inside the controller to return copies of this.view since the data is already in there?</p>
