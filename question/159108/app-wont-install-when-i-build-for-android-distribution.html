			<h1>App won&#39;t install when I build for Android distribution</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am trying to build my APK to upload to the Google Play store but when I send the file to my phone and attempt to install it the Android installer gives me an error message that says &quot;Application not installed.&quot; I have tried to uninstall Java 7 and java -version shows that I have 1.6.0_51 installed. I have tried to install the app on a different phone and the same issue occurs. The only thing I see in the console while the program is compiling is this. </p>

							<p>Ok, This error comes from the closure compiler that is used by the titanium tooling.<br>Compiler errors: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.google.com&#x2F;closure&#x2F;compiler&#x2F;docs&#x2F;error-ref">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.google.com&#x2F;closure&#x2F;compiler&#x2F;docs&#x2F;error-ref</a></p>
<p>However, this is warn, not an error.  If you are using jquery in an html view, its best to rename them to .jsl (i use this to reference javascript local files) so that they don&#39;t pass through the js compilers for minification and packing.</p>
<p>Next lets address the failed install.  There should be some details regarding the adb action, the actually pushing of the apk binary to the device.  </p>
<p>I try to get as close to the tooling when an error pops up.  To do that I hit the command line.  For this to work well, you need to have adb and monitor in your system path.  My example is for osx, and you failed to mention many details about your environment for us to work from.</p>
<p>Look in the <code>{project_root}&amp;#x2F;build&amp;#x2F;android&amp;#x2F;bin</code> for your built apk. If this is a debug built, not one used for play store submission, it will be called app.apk.  But since your problem is with a distro build, in which the js files have been compressed, mangled, manipulated, harrassed, scatter, chunked, covered and smothered, it might be named something else!</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">adb <span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">install</span> -r <span class="hljs-keyword">build</span>/android/<span class="hljs-keyword">bin</span>/your_app.apk</span>
</code></pre><p>This will try to push the apk to your connected device. At this point, you are outside the titanium tooling, and are using Android tooling to just talk to your device.  See if you can gather additional error information that Studio may not be pushing out to you.</p>
<p>If at this point, you still cant determine the problem, the next step is to use <code>monitor</code> (previously called ddms) to connect to your device and read the logs on the device.</p>

										<p><p>save that command, as, it is a best practice, to push your Play Store signed apks to a device for testing before sending to google play.  A lot of folks push an untested binary package to the play store only to discover signing problems later on.</p>
<p>Build an apk for distribution to the play store and try to push that generated binary to your device.  Delete the build on the device before doing so though.</p>

										<p><p>Ignore my previous comment, that was the debug build. When I tried to use adb to install the APK that Titanium build (and supposedly signed) I got this error message <code>Failure [INSTALL_PARSE_FAILED_NO_CERTIFICATES]</code>.  I went ahead and manually signed my apk and pushed it to the phone successfully. What would cause Titanium to not sign my app?</p>

										<p><p>Any number of reasons. Password for the cert was bad.  You have a store password and a cert password. It was a full moon.  Its java signing tools. Not making light of the problem, but then, i kind of am.  We have one project that there is a store password, so we can never use studio to sign that project.</p>
<p>I am a command liner, so most of the problem disappear the closer i get to the tools.</p>
