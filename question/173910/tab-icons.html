			<h1>tab icons</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi I am having an issue with my tab icons appearing in android. When I use an android sdk target version of 10, the icons appear as normal. However, I need to use an sdk target version of at least 11 as I need to request a larger heap. How can I get icons in 11 onwards? I am using the modular appraoch whereby I have a separate application tabgroup.js (not sure if thats relevant). Any help appreciated. Example tab creation below:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">SearchTradesman_Tab = Ti.UI.createTab({
    title: <span class="hljs-string">'Search'</span>,
    icon: <span class="hljs-string">'/images/TabBar/50x50/search_grey50x50.png'</span>,
    window: SearchTradesmanW<span class="hljs-keyword">in</span>
});
</code></pre>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Right now you need to perform some ruling out tests and return some confirmation information.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the PHYSICAL location of the images in your project, example references to return with your information;<ul>
<li>{appname}&#x2F;resources&#x2F;images&#x2F;test.png</li>
<li>{appname}&#x2F;app&#x2F;assets&#x2F;images&#x2F;test.png</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You may have that file in a density folder, what are the other density folders in the same location (Example; res-xhdpi)</li>
<li>Rename the reference , the folders and the filename to all be lowercase files.</li>
<li>You will need to clean after this (I know you have done before - do it again)</li>
<li>You have included a folder 50x50 - this implies you have images of different sizes - if so what are they?</li>
<li>Use the default icons from a default project in place of these - do those work (you may need to create a blank test project and use the images)</li>
</ul>
<p>Report back.</p>

										<p><p>@Malcolm Hollingsworth Thanks for the helpful response. </p>
<p>The physical location is {appname}resources&#x2F;&#x2F;images&#x2F;TabBar.<br>Within that I have 5 folders of different sizes. I have an event listener on the tabgroup focus and depending on the dpi of the phone i set the images of each tab (4 grey and 1 blue). This was the very first example I saw on how to use tab icons in Android. </p>
<p>Is it a case that we have to use density folders from 11 onwards? If so, could you point me to a link for the required sizes and names in each density folder before I try that and report back.</p>

										<p><p>This may well end up being something as simple as your folder management - you do not need to and should not try to manage your apps image files for densities - at least not here for these things (photos etc play all you like - but usually only for external content).</p>
<p>I would start very simply and place your images like this;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">{appname}<span class="hljs-regexp">/resources/im</span>ages<span class="hljs-regexp">/res-mdpi/</span>tab_search_grey.png
{appname}<span class="hljs-regexp">/resources/im</span>ages<span class="hljs-regexp">/res-hdpi/</span>tab_search_grey.png
{appname}<span class="hljs-regexp">/resources/im</span>ages<span class="hljs-regexp">/res-xhdpi/</span>tab_search_grey.png
{appname}<span class="hljs-regexp">/resources/im</span>ages<span class="hljs-regexp">/res-xxhdpi/</span>tab_search_grey.png
</code></pre><p>I have renamed your image so that you do not need lots of tiny folders for images - I have moved the images into density folders (the links below give lots of details to this) and given the file name a simple prefix - this way you can quickly find the image in the folder.  I have also made sure everything is lower case.  Whilst this is not a requirement - having a single case standard means you can never go wrong.</p>
<p>You do NOT manage your image size swapping.  Whilst the again the links below have lots of details here - a quick logic to the folders above.</p>
<ul>
<li>mdpi = 100%</li>
<li>hdpi = 150%</li>
<li>xhdpi = 200%</li>
<li>xxhdpi = 300%</li>
</ul>
<p>So if your baseline image is 36x36, then hdpi = 54x54, xhdpi = 72x72 and xxhdpi = 108x108.  So you simply drop the same image with a different wxh in each folder - but with the SAME file name.  A quick tip - not required but useful, image files should be divisible by 4.  This way the scale above can easily scale.  Technically you only need a factor of 2 - but if you support ldpi (most do not now - it was 75%).</p>
<p>I have provided some very detailed answers about how to manage images and density folders for iOS and Android and manage them so they are cross platform (should you need it).  Rather than rewrite all the information - review these two to see exactly how you can simplify your life - only problem is they are VERY detailed - so you will learn much more than you need for this - but everything you read will be useful.</p>

</ul>
<p>Give these a go and see what happens - chances are everything slots into place.</p>

										<p><p>@Malcolm hollingsworth much appreciation for the response. I have just one remaining question. With your folder names you have %&#39;s. What is the standard icon dimensions for android i.e. the one you have stipulated as 100%, once I know that, i can obviously work out the remainder</p>

									<li class="comment">
										<p><p>The % are there simply for scale indications - not a measurement, for the icons sizes this is something you choose yourself.  48x48 is a good starting point for mdpi and then scale based on the percentages I gave.  Obviously if it is too big or too small adjust as required.</p>
