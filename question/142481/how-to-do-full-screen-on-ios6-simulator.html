										<p><p>And why are you naming them test*?</p>
<p>Titanium required them to be called Default-*</p>
<p>Might I politely suggest you read the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com">development docs for Titanium</a> specifically the article <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.1&#x2F;index.html#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Icons_and_Splash_Screens">Icons and Splash Screens</a></p>
<p>I am kind of curious regarding your thought process.  What made you think you could just call your icons something random and it would work?</p>

										<p><p>You are correct, the Icons and Splash screens article does not mention the <strong>JUST RELEASED</strong> iphone 5 information as the 2.1.3 RC sdk <strong>HAS NOT BEEN RELEASED YET</strong> so no documentation is available.</p>

										<p><p>I think there is a real problem buried here - I tried running one of my apps that uses Ti.Platform.displayCaps to determine screen size and the iPhone 5 simulator (technically iPhone Retina 4-inch iOS 6) returns 320x480 as its dimensions even under 2.1.3RC and building with iOS6 SDK.  And so I ended up with the same picture - my app running with a black band at top and bottom.</p>

										<p><p>OK, so the solution has to be one of the more bizarre that I&#39;ve run into in a year and a half of Titanium - just putting the new large splash screen in makes everything work fine.  And it does.  After installing the new splash screen, displayCaps returned 320x568.</p>

										<p><p>yes, I have the same problem. I install 2.1.3RC SDK today, but the problem is still exist. I think will wait  the 2.1.3 sdk official release.</p>

										<p><p>Joe,</p>
<p>It is not Titanium, it is the iphone 5 support.<br>If the new splash screen doesn&#39;t exist, ios assumes you don&#39;t support the iphone 5 and drops you into a 320x box with upper&#x2F;lower letterboxing.</p>
<p>The same occurs with ObjectiveC projects straight out of xCode too.</p>
<p>But yeah, its weird.</p>
<p>And I&#39;ll add I wasn&#39;t happy with 25+ emails from apple &#39;suggesting&#39; I upload new screen shots to support their new hardware, not just the iphone 5, but the new ipod as well.  4 new graphics or new submissions will not even be looked at.</p>

										<p><p>cASe matTers: default-568h@2x.png will not work, it has to be Default-568h@2x.png. Clean the project after you correct the case.</p>

							<p>Hi chang, <strong>Appcelerator is planning to release support for iOS 6 and iPhone 5 in new 2.1.3 release</strong>, so then it will be better to use the method described by Stephen.</p>

										<p><p>If you are agreeing with or backing up the answer someone has already posted, then it belongs in the comments section. I believe that this had already been stated above along with link information to the 2.1.3 release. I&#39;m starting to notice that many of your answers simply reiterate what others have already said, and sometimes do so on questions that already have a best answer marked. We expect Titans to ADD value to the Community QA not just repost what others have already said in the same question. Please take more care to ensure that you are adding value with the answers you post.</p>
