			<h1>can modal window have its sub windows?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>in my app, there&#39;re 4 different tabgroups on the bottom tab bar. when a guest user clicks one of tabgroups, it opens a modal window to give the user options to log in or sign up. opening a modal window works just fine. but, i want to drilldown navigation on that modal window.</p>
<p>whenever i try to createWindow over the current modal window. it gives me a warn. We still care about isRootViewAttached!!!! (wish i can care about that too but, don&#39;t know how. :P )</p>
<p>so, my question is can i make a new window over a modal window????</p>

							<p>Yes, you can create new modal window over modal window.</p>
<p>As for error message: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;124466&#x2F;what-is-this-warning-all-about-">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;124466&#x2F;what-is-this-warning-all-about-</a></p>

										<p><p>I would hate an app that would open a window over another window, over another window.. and beside that, you&#39;ll make a mess with which window you should close first, etc.. they&#39;re not connected like they would with a navigationgroup.</p>

										<p><p>You would hate?! I thought you had some technical issues with modal windows … okay, if you don&#39;t like them, it doesn&#39;t mean that using them is a bad practice. Modal window are perfectly normal to use and I don&#39;t see a reason why someone wouldn&#39;t use them. Modal windows are good choice for Android applicaton because hardware back button works well with them (last window is always closed first, so there is no mess when one has that algorithm in the mind). On the other hand &quot;NavigationGroup&quot; is iOS only (although, it seems to me that they are functionally similar to modal window), so if you are targeting Android also, you will have to write Android-specific code …</p>

										<p><p>in fact I said that it was a &quot;bad practise&quot;, not that you have any particular issues. On iOS there are still few bugs in opening a modal over another modal, the animation sometimes doesn&#39;t work, and you would see a flashy window for a couple of seconds, and stuff like that. Yeah, it&#39;s iOS only, I just noticed it today. The cool thing about NavigationGroup is that the windows are all connected and you can close one for all.</p>
