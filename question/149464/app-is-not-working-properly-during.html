			<p>Hi guys I&#39;ve got big problems with behavior of application during downloading&#x2F;parsing website using WebView. For example EventListener like &quot;click&quot; for Button, imageView or View (It&#39;s doesn&#39;t matter) is absolutely not responding. Listeners aren&#39;t working just during downloading&#x2F;parsing before or after are working without problems…</p>
<p>More information: When user start the application on background begins downloading-loading web page using WebView then in webView.addEventListener(&#39;load&#39;),function(){}); underway parsing using evalJS(); . I have approximately eight evalJS commands in for cyclus which has four iteration. This process take approximately five seconds. User during these five seconds can&#39;t do anything in app. So for example user can&#39;t press button &quot;Stop loading&quot; or user can&#39;t choose some different feature he has to wait :( Thank you so much</p>
<p>Ti: 2.1.1GA</p>

							<p>Ti is, for the most part, single threaded.  how are you loading the pages in background?</p>
<p>If you use the httpclient, then you can tell that to do the loading in the background using async call, but that is pretty much the extent of background processing in Ti.</p>
<p>your best bet is to load an activity indicator window letting the user know that something is happening until things are ready.</p>

										<p><p>I didn&#39;t mean background like next thread. Process is in the background what means that user can&#39;t see anything. Can I use evalJS with httpClient?</p>

										<p><p>so your code is running in the UI thread which makes sense with what you are seeing.  I think your best option is to let the user know that things are loading.</p>
<p>The httpclient is more for ajax calls really, so any evals would still have to be done in a web view.  you could use it to download the content in the background (async) and then set the content on the web view wrapped in an evalJS.</p>

										<p><p>Yes I can set activityIndicator ,but problem is when user has for example slow internet connection. Then user can&#39;t use application and also user can&#39;t stop downloading&#x2F;parsing…</p>

										<p><p>so get the content with httpclient in async.  This will take care of slow download and user can still interact with the app (hopefully, this is the longer portion of the wait).  </p>
<p>But when you get to evalJS portion, they just have to wait it out.  unfortunately, I do not think there is a way around that portion, but you know best since it is your code.</p>
