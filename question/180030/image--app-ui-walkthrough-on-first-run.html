			<h1>Image / App UI walkthrough on first run</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>How can I give my users a few images upfront during their first run so that they can get a sense of how to use the app. Something like <img src="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;8531a4dea39362f5b234-05e060622ca2c116e9f71be35d9bd2ac.r68.cf1.rackcdn.com&#x2F;2013-07-11%2003-55-49-ifttt-intro.png" alt="this"></p>
<p>I am fine with figuring out that this is the user&#39;s first run (by using properties etc.) but am more interested in learning what are my options. At the moment, I am thinking about a horizontal scrollview with a bunch of images embedded in it.</p>
<p>Is there is a better way? I have been googling around and did not find anything useful and am curious to know how others do it. Any help &#x2F; guidance will be appreciated. Thanks!</p>

							<p>Another approach I&#39;ve seen is to use an overlay atop the actual window. You&#39;d show that overlay the first time the window is opened. The overlay would contain all the help text and arrows (and a transparent background). Tapping an &quot;X&quot; or something would close it. </p>
<p>This approach lets you provide help info in context, when the user first loads the window. And it doesn&#39;t overwhelm new users by showing all the help info on the first launch. It would be useful if your app has a few windows, some of which the user might not reach on their first use. For example, after a few minutes or days of use, the user reaches WindowFoo at which time its overlay is shown.</p>

										<p><p>@Tim: Yes..but what Titanium UI component would that overlay be? From other comments, I think we are all narrowing it down to a scrollable view. Unless there are other options that you can suggest.</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing this. Your comment has given me another idea. Maybe, it would be interesting to use a horizontal scroll and when the user reaches a view the first time, just invoke the scrollable view and programatically scroll to the relevant section. Thanks!</p>

										<p><p>I guess it&#39;s really up to you which component you use. I was thinking that you&#39;d be using a Window with a transparent background, with ImageViews placed appropriately to bring attention to the key UI elements of your underlying app window. Some of the examples at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mobile-patterns.com&#x2F;coach-marks">mobile-patterns.com&#x2F;coach-marks</a> are along the line of what I was picturing (like the Foursquare samples). But there are other ideas on that site that would work equally as well.</p>

							<p>I&#39;d probably use a <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.UI.ScrollableView">scrollable view</a> instead, since, after all, thats what you are showing there in the images…</p>

										<p><p>@Stephen: I agree. Scrollable view would make sense. I was curious to hear if there are any modules &#x2F; other neat ways of doing it. Thanks!</p>

							<p>I had used scrollable view with images inside it and skip button at bottom to skip the tutorial&#x2F;help. When use login in first time this tutorial&#x2F;help shown upfront to him. He can skip also if he don&#39;t want to go further with this tutorial&#x2F;help. </p>
<p>There are several ways, to check whether the user is first time launching the app.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>We have set variable at server side and on calling of login web service it returns which page to navigate. We kept this is because we want to render the user to password change screen on first login and then after this to tutorial&#x2F;help screen. We don&#39;t want to put headache of checking the variable on each app launch and managing at client side.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If your app does not have login screen. You can set Ti.App.properties and used that variable in app launch (app.js in Titanium classic&#x2F; alloy.js in Alloy).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>@Narendra: Yes, my question was about the UI component for the walkthrough. But you do bring up a great point about the firstrun launch logic. In my case, the app just looks at its properties to figure out if the user has logged before or not. </p>
<p>For some reason, I preferred that approach then storing it server side. I think my idea was to support a scenario where you may eventually have different app version for phone and tablet, and may have different walkthrough UI etc.</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing your wisdom on this. It is definitely useful.</p>
