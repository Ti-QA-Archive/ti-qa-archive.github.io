			<p>So I replaced the appicon.png &amp; Default.png with my own images. They are not appearing when the SDK is launched. Thats the first problem. Then I tried to make a background image for the first window. It won&#39;t load it because it says that it failed to connect. These are probably really simple questions but I am seriously new to this and writing code, so …yea, thats enough to get me pretty confused. </p>
<p>Anyway, Thanks!</p>

							<p>For the default images, make sure that the images in the <code>Resources&amp;#x2F;iphone</code> and <code>Resources&amp;#x2F;android</code> directories are deleted - any platform-specific resources will be favored first, and will overwrite any other versions you might have in <code>Resources</code>.</p>
<p>Also, if you haven&#39;t already, check out the <a href="&#x2F;training">Zero To App Training series</a> - should be helpful if you&#39;re brand new to Titanium.  If you&#39;re brand new to JavaScript, a great online resource is <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;JavaScript&#x2F;Guide">the Mozilla JavaScript guide</a>.</p>

										<p><p>check size is correct for Default, i had it where i created in illustrator then saved out forgetting about border, flashed up when ran simulator but then didn&#39;t show, resized in photoshop to correct dims and worked fine-might help with one bit. As Kevin said, watch the zero to app, but what i do that might help is use the kitchen sink, take parts of the kitchen sink you want and just modify little bits to get what i want and see how it works, then copy them out to my apps.</p>

							<p>which platform are you using? iphone or android?</p>
<p>for the icon to appear you have to choose it inside the project&#39;s edit tab in titanium developer</p>
<p>your backgroundImage problem seems to result from the system not being able to locate it, use a relative path to your image like this: &#39;images&#x2F;mypic.png&#39; instead &#39;&#x2F;images&#x2F;mypic.png&#39;. this seems to be working on both simulator and device for me</p>

										<p><p>im using the iphone platform. &amp; thanks, I will try that and see how it works. I was watching a tutorial on changing out the app icon &amp; default image and they just changed it out in the folder and it worked. So then, when I tried (and it failed), I was confused.</p>
