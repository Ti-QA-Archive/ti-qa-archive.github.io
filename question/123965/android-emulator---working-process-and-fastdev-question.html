			<h1>Android Emulator - Working process and Fastdev question</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I feel like I must be missing something, because since I have moved from building for iOS to Android, I have just not found a sensible and reliable way to use the Android emulator yet, and it is painfully slow.</p>
<p>Let me quickly run you through what I&#39;ve tried, excuse the long post, but not sure how else to explain my dilemma. </p>
<h2 id="launching-the-emulator-from-titanium">Launching the emulator from Titanium</h2>
<p>If I don&#39;t open up the Android SDK &amp; AVD manager manually (command line android) and simply use Titanium to launch the emulator then the startup time for Android is unbearable as I need to not only launch the app, but more importantly I need to boot up the Android emulator each time.  I have read in various FAQs and comments online that apparently you do not need to close and reopen the emulator each time, but I find that if I&#39;ve launched the emulator from within Titanium, then as soon as I stop debugging, the emulator automatically shuts down meaning I can&#39;t reuse it.  </p>
<p>So my first question is using this technique of launching the emulator from within Titaniun, how do I stop the emulator from closing each time I stop debugging the app?</p>
<h2 id="launching-the-emulator-from-android-sdk-amp-avd-manager">Launching the emulator from Android SDK &amp; AVD manager</h2>
<p>This approach I find works best in that I can manually start up an emulator that I need (say titanium_4_HVGA which is a profile automatically created by Titanium) and I can also use the &quot;Use snapshot&quot; feature of the Android AVD manager so that the Android startup time is drastically reduced.  However, once I start the emulator, I go to Titanium, and I choose &quot;Debug using Android Emulator&quot;.  Titanium Studio then does one of a number of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes it connects to my emulator and launches the app</li>
<li>Sometimes it starts a new emulator, but launches the app in the existing emulator anyway</li>
<li>It very rarely ever launches the debugger correctly and pauses at the breakpoint</li>
</ul>
<p>What I have noticed is that Titanium is trying to launch the emulator on port 5560, whereas Android AVD opens it up on port 5554.  See the startup log here:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[INFO] logfile = <span class="hljs-regexp">/Users/</span>matthew<span class="hljs-regexp">/Projects/</span>hellogator<span class="hljs-regexp">/appcelerator/</span>build.log

</code></pre><p>So what is supposed to be happening?  How does everyone else do this?  Surely there must be a reliable way to simply start up the emulator manually (ideally using snapshots to reduce start up time significantly), and then connect in the debugger from Titanium Studio and launch your app each time you need to start up in the existing emulator?</p>
<h2 id="fastdev">Fastdev</h2>
<p>Just a side note, I am using Fastdev with Titanium Studio too, although that seems to fail quite often and say that Fastdev does not connect.  To enable Fastdev I simply added <code>&amp;lt;property name=&amp;quot;ti.android.fastdev&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;bool&amp;quot;&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;&amp;#x2F;property&amp;gt;</code> to tiapp.xml.  Also, I&#39;m a little unclear on what you are supposed to do with Fastdev if you run into a script error.  Should you close the app somehow, and then update your code and then restart it?  If so, I assume the debugger will no longer be connected?  Does the debugger even work with Fastdev?</p>
<p>All your advice would be greatly appreciated.  I&#39;ve really struggled with Android, yet had no issues with iOS emulator.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Matt</p>

<p>In order for us to troubleshoot your situation, we need to confirm that your environment is configured correctly. Please copy and paste the following into your terminal&#x2F;shell so that all the commands execute successfully. Copy the output and paste it to your preferred <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;">pastebin</a> service, and paste the link to it here. It&#39;s important that you do not modify it <strong>in any way</strong>, as this could mask problems with your configuration. Do <strong>NOT</strong> paste the actual code here! This is because the system will change the formatting.</p>
<p>Also, please create and share a screenshot of your android installed packages, using something like <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;imageshack.us&#x2F;">ImageShack</a></p>
<p>Lastly, the processor and RAM installed to your system.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">clear

<span class="hljs-built_in">echo</span> <span class="hljs-string">"<span class="hljs-variable">$SOCKS_PROXY</span>"</span>
</code></pre><p>Note that you will need to configure the environment variable $ANDROID_SDK for the above to work. You can use the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;macosx&#x2F;system_disk_utilities&#x2F;environmentvariablepreferencepane.html">OSX Environment Variable Configuration Tool</a> for this.</p>
<p>Some general points to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>every time you update the Android packages, it is essential that you delete all existing AVDs, as explained in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Titanium+Compatibility+Matrix#TitaniumCompatibilityMatrix-UpdatingAndroidPackages">Updating Android Packages</a></li>
<li>certainly during this troubleshooting process, do not enable Android Snapshots. I am not certain that we even support them, so I will have to confirm with the team, and report back soon</li>
<li>during this troubleshooting process, let Titanium Studio handle the creation and launch of your emulator</li>
</ul>
<p>If you provide the above information, I will endeavor to help you further.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>Hi Paul</p>
<p>Appreciate you trying to help with this.</p>
<p>I have run the commands you provided, the output can be seen here <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pastie.org&#x2F;2344495">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pastie.org&#x2F;2344495</a></p>

<p>Processor is 2.53 Ghz Intel Core 2 Due, memory is 4GB, OSX 10.7</p>
<p>In response to your general points:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have not updated my packages so deleting existing AVDs does not apply.</li>
<li>I am happy to disable Android snapshots, but it would be useful if you could find out if they are supported.  I don&#39;t see why not as it&#39;s effectively the same as just keeping the emulator open.  Either way, if you provide any instructions I will disable them.</li>
<li>Fine, I will let Titanium handle the creation &amp; launch of the emulator.  However, I then need to know how to keep the emulator open so that I don&#39;t need to boot up an emulator each time I want to run the app.  Surely I don&#39;t need to wait 5 minutes every time I want to run the app as I have to wait for the emulator to start up, then the app to build and then be installed.  I&#39;ve seen numerous bits of documentation stating that you can keep the emulator open.  Please can you provide some advice on how one goes about doing that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, it would be really useful to have some up to date documentation with recommendations on how to Debug, Test and use Fastdev with the Android emulator as a complete process.  The current documentation is out of date, and it&#39;s hard for people like myself to then know what I should &#x2F; should not be doing to get everything running.  I have raised a JIRA ticket witha request to update the documentation at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC-191">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC-191</a></p>

<p>You are welcome, don&#39;t mention it! :)</p>
<p>However, it&#39;s going to be very difficult to help you, unless you cooperate fully. Everything I have said does indeed &quot;apply&quot;, at least during this troubleshooting process. Thus please delete your existing AVDs. Thank you for disabling snapshots - as I said, I will get the definitive information in due course, about whether they are supported.</p>
<p>There is no need to boot a new emulator to launch an app, or to reboot the existing one. Simply use the Titanium Studio &quot;Run &gt; Android Emulator&quot; button (see screenshot) to launch the app initially, and then again for each subsequent launch:</p>
<p><img src="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;img59.imageshack.us&#x2F;img59&#x2F;2938&#x2F;screenshot320q.png" alt="screenshot"></p>
<p>Once the emulator is launched, using fastdev (enabled by default) each subsequent app launch takes about 8 seconds on my system.</p>
<p>Please remove Android 2.3.1 and the associated APIs 9 packages - they are obsolete, and never needed. To be safe, delete all existing AVDs after doing this.</p>
<p>Note, don&#39;t update the Android SDK Tools revision 11 that you have currently installed, as there is a bug in the latest version, described in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Titanium+Compatibility+Matrix#TitaniumCompatibilityMatrix-WarningaboutAndroidSDKToolsRevision12">Warning about Android SDK Tools Revision 12</a>. Instead, wait for revision 13.</p>
<p>Delete all the files in your PROJECT&#x2F;build&#x2F;android directory.</p>
<p>Once you have followed this advice, please run the script again and post the output and also provide a new version of the Android Package Manager screenshot.</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

										<p><p>Hi Paul</p>
<p>Once again, thanks for your help.</p>
<p>Just to confirm:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#39;ve disabled snapshots</li>
<li>I&#39;ve deleted the 2.3.1 and associated API 9 packages, and deleted all AVDs.</li>

										<p><p>OK, great, Matt. </p>
<p>Please install the latest <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Continuous+Builds">Continuous Build</a> 1.7.X. Then create a new mobile project using Titanium Studio, but do not modify the code.  Check that tiapp is configured to use the 1.7.3 continuous build and the Android SDK selected is 2.1-update1.</p>
<p>Then launch the app. If it doesn&#39;t work on first attempt, wait until it has definitely finished, and try again. Try launching three times in total, just to be certain that it will not launch.</p>
<p>Then create a pastebin&#x2F;gist of the full console output, from the time the emulator is launched to the time the app fails.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>Hi Paul</p>
<p>Ok, I am very surprised but with a clean app the emulator does work as expected, and Titanium is no longer closing the emulator between each run.  I&#39;ve even tested the Fastdev stuff and that works too.  The only issue I sometimes get is that I am being told that keyboard is unresponsive, see the screen shot at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;imageshack.us&#x2F;photo&#x2F;my-images&#x2F;51&#x2F;voilacapture105.png&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;imageshack.us&#x2F;photo&#x2F;my-images&#x2F;51&#x2F;voilacapture105.png&#x2F;</a>. </p>
<p>Strangely though my previous test app, which does work on the device, is not working in the emulator.  I suspect that&#39;s a different issue, so for now, everything appears to be working.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.  I&#39;m not really sure what&#39;s different to be honest other than just clearing all the old stuff out and adding it back in again, but in reality it&#39;s worked a treat, and I appreciate it.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Matt</p>
