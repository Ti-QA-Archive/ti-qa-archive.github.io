			<h1>Unable to take screenshot on Galaxy S3</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Having sent my client a beta of his Android app he tells me he is unable to take a screenshot of any of its views on his Galaxy S3 by pressing and holding the power and the home button at the same time. Other apps are OK - it&#39;s just mine! As I&#39;m not even aware it&#39;s possible to cripple the screenshot mechanism, I am left scratching my head (again).</p>
<p>Has anybody else come across a similar problem?</p>

							<p>Not sure about that. I know that I can&#39;t take a screenshot of a Titanium app on an S3 using the &#39;side of hand swipe&#39; gesture though.  Power+home work for all my apps.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Stephen - that&#39;s interesting. Maybe it is the &#39;swipe&#39; method he&#39;s using, although I understood it was the two button method. So there does appear to be some kind of problem with Titanium apps and screenshots in Android.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ve just had it confirmed that it is the &#39;swipe&#39; method my beta tester was having trouble with. So has anybody got any idea why, or is it another Appcelerator mystery?</p>
