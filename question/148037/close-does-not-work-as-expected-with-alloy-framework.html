			<h1>.close does not work as expected with Alloy framework</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have read a lot of threads in the Q&amp;A here as well as threads on Stack Overflow and other communities that the .close() method should completely close and remove a window.</p>
<p>As I understand the documentation and the threads and comments I have read on .close() method is that the window is being closed&#x2F;killed&#x2F;set to null when used. This however doesn&#39;t seem to be the case when working with the Alloy Framework.</p>
<p>Let me explain it with a very simple piece of code:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">mainController.welcome.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'open'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> {</span>
    console.<span class="hljs-built_in">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Listener: welcome is open"</span>);
    mainController.main.<span class="hljs-keyword">close</span>();
    Ti.API.<span class="hljs-keyword">debug</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"mainController.main"</span>);
});
</code></pre><p>outputs:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">[INFO]</span> :  Listener: welcome <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">[DEBUG]</span> :  <span class="hljs-comment">[object main]</span>
</code></pre><p>Ofcause you could always manually set the main = null; which is a &quot;solution&quot; but it shouldn&#39;t be necessary?</p>
<p>Oh yea and running this example directly as it&#39;s written would not work ofcause as I don&#39;t add the $. namespace infront of the variables, but hopefully you get the point. Reason why I am not writing it in the specific example is that I&#39;ve define a global alloy variable mainController to be able to access the root window from any controller.</p>
<p>Could anyone please explain why the .close() method does not act like it is suposed to, when working with the Alloy framework?</p>
<p>Kindly</p>

							<p>No, calling <code>close</code> on a window does not destroy it. You can always call <code>open</code> again at any time to re-use it.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your answer Nick. I have a second related question. When I close a window, what happens to its content and to the window. It gets in the &quot;close&quot; state - but what does this mean, except for the fact that it&#39;s not rendered. Does it still run in the background and take up memory and CPU? What happens to a windows eventlisteners when you close a window?</p>

										<p><p>All the resources you have associated with it (labels, webviews, buttons… etc) will still be retained in memory. Event listeners…. hmm, not sure - certainly App wide ones will still hold  references on any local variables referred to in the event listener body unless you remove them (But thats a best practise you should observe to prevent memory leaks anyway). If you&#39;ve never seen <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;29804284">this</a> video from CodeStrong, then its worth a view</p>
