			<h1>Job - - Side work inside an iPad app for $$</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>We&#39;ve got an iPad app with more work than we can handle so we need some of smaller bits to be done as a &quot;Per item&quot; job.</p>
<p><em>This will be done simply as an isolated job. You will not be receiving our source code, and to make this easier on both keeping our app a secret(until release) and to make your job easier.</em></p>
<p>###Some of the things we need done:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Popup styled…</strong> Using the stock&#x2F;provided iPad popover doesn&#39;t work with our iPad&#39;s styled UI. All images will be provided in the exact slices&#x2F;sizes required but you&#39;ll have to let me know what those are. (ideally… I want an auto resizing popup which has a nice smooth transition in&#x2F;out of the screen and when getting larger and smaller(vertically… horizontal width would remain the same).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Image styling…</strong> Rounded corners and a png overlay with multiple sizes from 32px up to 65px.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Transitions…</strong> There are multiple parts of our application that needs transitions. It masks the loading of the application as well as enhances the user experience. There are multiple areas that need transitions, and the way that we&#39;ll accomplish this is I tell you the screen or area thats changing, you give me the code to add for the requested transition and we put it in.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Tables and Chair styling &amp; transitions…</strong> Our app is for restaurants and we have tables and chairs as the focus of our app. The functionality is already there but needs to look great in every version. They&#39;re currently being drawn so there are no images. We need gradients, inner shadows, drop shadows, stroke, and alternating color pallets. They are also clickable, so having an &quot;Touch&quot; event and a transition between states are crucial. We have a lot of different tables to be designed as well… meaning different types of table and chair combinations.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Statistics…</strong> This app relies heavily on statistics and we have a slew of information that needs to be displayed in a google analytics type way. Standard, but this too will need to be stylized as well.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Avatar Creator</strong> A single page with png avatar pieces. Using swipe left and right to navigate the different noses&#x2F;hair styles&#x2F;etc… And then to combine them all when finished for users avatars. Should be as simple as possible.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Background selection &amp; photo uploader</strong> Using a popover, the ability to select either &quot;provided backgrounds&quot;(large background images) or &quot;upload&quot; from the camera roll. The background would be fit inside of a top toolbar and bottom navbar.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you would like to do 1, multiple, or all of these please contact me ASAP with a <strong>PER ITEM</strong> price.</p>
<p>Those that help will also get recognition for their work. Message me for details.</p>

<p>To avoid advertisements polluting the search results for people looking for technical solutions relating directly to Titanium code and application development, we request that our members do not post them to this Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>We regret that we do not currently provide a method for advertising job vacancies, but will certainly investigate how we may improve this situation in future.</p>
<p>In the meantime, our members may well be interested in your offer of work, if you contact them directly using the method that Tony has suggested.</p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding.</p>
