			<h1>Prepare commonjs files/modules for 64 bit?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi<br>I have upgraded Titanium sdk to 3.5.0 GA as well as ios sdk (8.1) and xcode (6.1.1).</p>
<p>Now, when deploying on device (iPhone 6 or Ipad) I get this error message<br>&quot;Script Error Couldn&#39;t find module: Data for architecture: x86_64&quot;</p>
<p>I bet it is because I have not made the app 64 bit compatible.<br>I find instructions to make modules compatible, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides2&#x2F;iOS+Module+64-bit+Support#iOSModule64-bitSupport-Couldn&#39;tfindmodule:Xforarchitecture:X">here</a></p>
<p>However, &quot;Data&quot; in the error message above, is a simple commonjs file (…commonjs&#x2F;Data.js) alongside with a whole bunch of other ones. The instructions in the link above does not seem to apply in my case.</p>
<p>So how would I prepare an app, based on simple commonjs files, for 64 bit?<br>Any hints?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance &#x2F;Tove</p>

							<p>In xcode, make sure that you have set in Build Settings –&gt; Architectures –&gt; Architectures to $(ARCHS_STANDARD) for all targets and set set in Build Settings –&gt; Architectures –&gt; Valid Architectures to arm64 armv7 armv7s i386 x86_64</p>
<p>From Xcode menu select Product –&gt; Scheme –&gt; &#39; Select Your project target&#39;<br>then From Xcode menu select Product –&gt; Scheme –&gt; Edit Scheme make sure all of the items in the list on the left are set to &#39;Release&#39; in the pane on the right, select each item in turn and select from the &#39;Build Configuration&#39; pulldown.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Wouter<br>I am embarrassed to say that one major thing was that I acctually had the wrong path..<br>I had developed for android first, which accepted the paths but when developing for iPhone I had to change the paths to where my commonjs modules (windows) resided.</p>
<p>However I also updated all software and that might have helped in solving the problem too.</p>
<p>Hope you manage to solve it.<br>Best regards &#x2F;Tove</p>

							<p>For anyone interested I have had this problem a couple of times. I don&#39;t know why at starts?</p>
<p>However, I have found a simple solution that sort of &quot;resets&quot; the problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Studio on the project, right-click and select &quot;Show in &#x2F; Finder&quot;</li>
<li>Locate the &quot;build&quot; folder - and delete it</li>
<li>Locate the &quot;Resources&quot; folder - and delete that as well</li>
<li>Build your project again</li>
</ol>
<p>These steps seem to help in the cases where I have seen this problem :-)</p>
<p>I have read about &quot;architectures&quot; in manifest.xml (i.e. iOS section of tiapp.xml in Titanium Studio) - however, so far I have not found anything conclusive…. And really, those articles I have found have been related to native iOS <strong>modules</strong> - whereas the problem here is with a simple CommonJS file in the lib folder…</p>
