			<h1>XHR Call Android vs iOS</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Greetings-</p>
<p>For some reason this code works great on iOS:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> xhr = Ti.Network.createHTTPClient();

xhr.onload = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>)</span>{    
  alert(<span class="hljs-built_in">JSON</span>.parse(<span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.responseText).venues);
};

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> url = <span class="hljs-string">"http://www.gwahir.com:3000/api/venues"</span>;
xhr.open(<span class="hljs-string">'GET'</span>, url);
xhr.send();
</code></pre><p>…but doesn&#39;t work on Android. </p>
<p>Anyone know what I am doing wrong here?</p>
<p>Ben</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Without seeing the returned JSON this is hard to guess, but here are a few things to try.</p>
<p>Change this routine as follows;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">xhr.onload = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>)</span>{
  Ti.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">'on load: 1'</span>);
  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> response = <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.responseText;
  Ti.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">'on load: 2'</span>);
  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> data = <span class="hljs-built_in">JSON</span>.parse(response);
  Ti.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">'on load: 3'</span>);
  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> venues = data.venues;
  Ti.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">'on load: 4'</span>);
  alert(venues);
};
</code></pre><p>This will help you find any errors when you actually get into this block of code.</p>
<p>Add this underneath the onload method ;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">xhr.onerror = function (<span class="hljs-keyword">error</span>) {
  Ti.API.info('<span class="hljs-function_start"><span class="hljs-keyword">on</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword">error</span>: ' + JSON.stringify(<span class="hljs-keyword">error</span>));
};
</code></pre><p>This will at least tell you the problem.</p>
<p>Run the output from a desktop web browser and test it in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jsonlint.com&#x2F;">jsonlint.com</a>, for any structural error like trailing commas that iOS may forgive.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ve added a breakpoint to the onload method. It breaks in iOS but not in Android.  So, it doesnt even get to the onload statement in Android.</p>

										<p><p>I understood that.</p>
<p>The onload tweaks were in case a returned JSON object was failing to parse the splitting out of the functions line by line would have meant it would of got so far before failing. </p>
<p>The onerror code was to try and see if the problem was related to the URL, connection or response code when handled by android.</p>
<p>So what responses if any did you get from my suggestions.</p>

										<p><p>OK…so it seems it has something to do with the 3000 port on the url.  is there a unique encoding issue on android?</p>

										<p><p>And yeah, none of the  Ti.API.info&#39;s are hit and JLint shows no syntax errors.</p>
<p>Gotta be something related to the :3000 on the url</p>

										<p><p>I see you have created a new question, so this must be answered then as we have determined that it is not the xhr call itself.  So imagine you are going to mark this one answered so the focus is on the new question.</p>

										<p><p>So did my answers help you to get to that conclusion in anyway, as it looks like I gave you sufficient information to enable you to determine the actual cause by ruling everything else out.  So this question should be marked as answered then.</p>

										<p><p>This thread didn&#39;t help much though I appreciate the answers and the effort. I had already tried all the above suggestions before asking.  If there were a way to mark my own response as the answer, I would, but I don&#39;t see the option.  I will do it anyway tho to close out the question.  For those reading this in the future, please see my answer below for the ultimate conclusion.</p>

							<p>Turned out to be the fact that the android emulator doesn&#39;t recognize entries set in the local machine&#39;s hosts file.  I specified the IP address of my web server and all was well.</p>
