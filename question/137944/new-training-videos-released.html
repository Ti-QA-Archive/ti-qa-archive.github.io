			<p>Hey, fellow Titanium-ers… yea, there&#39;s no cool way to say that. :P</p>
<p>Anyhoot (yes, it&#39;s a word!), this isn&#39;t really a question. I just wanted to let you guys know that Tim Poulsen, Lead Trainer and Curriculum Developer for Appcelerator, just got through releasing an updated version of his video training series, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeopro.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;building-native-mobile-applications">Building Native Mobile Apps with Titanium</a>!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve looked through it, and it&#39;s really great stuff! It&#39;s been updated with current best practices, including how to properly use CommonJS, the &#39;encouraged&#39; way to build best-of-breed apps. There&#39;s even a new, in-depth video about the new Appcelerator Cloud Services feature and how to go about registering and using it (big time plus for me!).</p>
<p>Okay, I know this probably sounds like some sort of scripted marketing… er, script (:P). Don&#39;t worry though; I&#39;m not being paid for this. I&#39;m just really excited as I&#39;ve been waiting for this for a good while.</p>
<p>Anyways, I&#39;m gonna shut up now. Hope you guys enjoy it!<br>Best of luck and code strong! :)</p>

							<div><p>Oh! Forgot one thing:</p>
<p>For those of you looking to become Titanium-certified, these videos are <strong>extremely</strong> helpful in passing the TCAD certification exam. In fact, the TCAD is almost <em>completely</em> based on this series. I&#39;m not sure if the exam has been updated with the new information on cloud services; nonetheless, these videos were huge in my own experience with TCAD!</p>
<p>So, if you&#39;re looking for a little more recognition and prestige, I&#39;d go for it, and best of luck with your cert! :D</p>

										<p><p>Those videos are actually all new. Unfortunately, it looks like the &#39;time ago&#39; didn&#39;t update when the videos were changed, but they are all updated from the old set. While some of them offer pretty much the same material as before, the cross-platform and cloud services videos are really good at showing the &#39;new&#39; way to do things.</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s a huge shame.  Over the past 4 weeks, I&#39;ve trained myself to ignore any Titanium info older than about 6 months (anything older than 1.8 doesn&#39;t have a lot of value these days).  I would have never given those videos a second glance with the modification times the way they are.  Thanks for the post, Brady!</p>

<p>Hopefully they&#39;ll do a blog post about &#39;em so that won&#39;t happen to more people.</p>

							<p>Brady,</p>
<p>Thanks for the plug and kind comments. I&#39;ll tell our marketing team that you&#39;re a great candidate for their next job opening! :)</p>
<p>I replaced the old video files on Vimeo so that I could keep the same URLs, plus the same descriptions, stats, comments, etc. Doing so saved me updating a lot of locations (docs, wiki, training materials, etc.) plus made sure any inbound links from community blogs, etc. would remain valid. I didn&#39;t realize that Vimeo would also preserve the old dates. Sorry for the confusion those old dates have caused.</p>
<p>Best wishes, Tim</p>

										<p><p>Haha! Ah, marketing - the one place I could never see myself in. :P</p>
<p>And no problem. Those reasons all make perfect sense, and I don&#39;t blame you for wanting to keep thousands of links intact. Maybe you could contact Vimeo and see if they could help with that.</p>
<p>Or, even better, put up a post on the the developer blog about the new release! I&#39;m sure a bunch of developers (especially incoming ones) would be excited about the news! Plus, it&#39;s always nice to be recognised for your work. :)</p>
