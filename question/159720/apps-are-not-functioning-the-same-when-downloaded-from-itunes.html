			<p>I have had two different apps now where I experienced bugs in the app that were not showing up in development in either the emulator or devices, that show up when downloaded from the app store. This have been occurring since the launch of ios7. The latest app the main background does not show</p>

							<div><p>I hope you realize that you&#39;re giving folks very little information to go by, nothing someone could try to reproduce, etc. If you can post additional details, a description of what you&#39;ve tried to resolve the issue so far, and preferably some code others can test out, you might get some helpful information in return.</p>

							<div><p>Here is the code that is not working</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> win = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
          title: <span class="hljs-string">'Home'</span>,
          backgroundImage:<span class="hljs-string">'/images/background.jpg'</span>
        });
</code></pre><p>I did not add this because it is such a simple piece of code. My point is to see if anyone else is seeing performance differences in apps from the app store.  This has happened with both of the apps I have submitted with IOS7 so it seems like its a bug somewhere.</p>
<p>You can&#39;t even test this unless your app is approved by apple, so there is no reason to include code. I did point out in the post that the background was missing . I have been using this since before version 1 and this is the first time I have seen anything perform differently in an app once it is submitted and approved.</p>

<li>xCode used to build this binary</li>
