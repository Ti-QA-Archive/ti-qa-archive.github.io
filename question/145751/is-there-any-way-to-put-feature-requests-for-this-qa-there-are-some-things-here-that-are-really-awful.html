							<p>Hey guys, since I built the Q&amp;A, I&#39;m probably the best one to respond.</p>
<p>1) Yes, the search sucks. It sorta works. Since I originally added Apache Solr for full text search. I added a boost value for dates, but it doesn&#39;t work right. We had another guy look at it, but he wasn&#39;t able to improve it. Before Solr, we used Google, but despite paying Google to use their search API, we hit the maximum amount of queries per day by around 3pm. If we spent more time trying to fix Solr, I have to believe we could improve search and even add additional filter criteria.</p>
<p>2) I think you used to be able to edit questions and answers, but when the Q&amp;A was revamp in early Summer 2011, that was never added back in. We never had the ability to edit comments. I had every intention of adding back in editing capabilities, but higher priority projects kept coming up.</p>
<p>3) I&#39;m unaware of any bugs adding images. It&#39;s probably the shitty PHP markdown library we&#39;re using. Sorry.</p>
<p>4) Yes, there&#39;s a ton of other things that need love. Navigation is jacked. Actual timestamps of questions&#x2F;answers&#x2F;comments would be nice. The format of emails is horrible. The voting system is borderline pointless. The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>The Q&amp;A hasn&#39;t received hardly any updates since it launched. I don&#39;t actively support it since I moved from the web dev team to the Titanium platform team. FWIW, we did in the past couple weeks address 2 performance issues that should noticeably speed up Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>There were talks about ditching Q&amp;A and going with another solution. As far as I know, these talks have stalled. I&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;d lose all the points, top experts, and DevLink. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s an acceptable loss.</p>
<p>So, we hear you guys loud and clear. I am personally taking the initiative to maintain and improve the dev center. Thanks for your patience. If you have more comments&#x2F;complaints, fire away, we&#39;re listening.</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s an <em>awesome</em> answer.</p>
<p>I personally would like to remove&#x2F;edit the Stephen&#39;s comment in the question, or more probably ask him to. Although it&#39;s a resonable comment (since my message wasn&#39;t THAT clear), it&#39;s an awful annoying image. You can&#39;t remove a question either.</p>
<p>Once I tried to add a picture to the question, and the ![] markdown code didn&#39;t worked… but I may be dreaming, since I couldn&#39;t find the given question. NVM about this one.</p>
<p>You&#39;re right about the voting feature. Would be very handy if we could downvote something.</p>
<p>Another annoying stuff that I stumble sometimes is that you cannot ask a new question from inside a question&#39;s page. I mean, you have to go back to the home to click the &quot;Ask Question&quot; button. And guess what? There&#39;s no home link in here. If you&#39;re on a page opened through the middle button, you&#39;re stuck on it with no browser back, so the home link is pretty handy in those cases.</p>
<p>A issue that I would classify as &quot;trivial&quot; would be the need to preview before post. It would be much better if the preview was live, as it happens on StackOverflow. Another one that&#39;s quite boring is the line break in the text fields. It breaks in the middle of words! &gt;_&lt;</p>
<p>The backtick formatting is nice, but when you use it on comments the dark box is too big for the line-height, what makes it really hard to read the surrounding text sometimes.</p>
<p>And finally, I&#39;m totally at your side about not abandoning the current platform. the experts and DevLink features are very useful.</p>
<p>I think it would be awesome if you got someone to work on the Q&amp;A to make it better for us, as it&#39;s a very helpful (duh) tool. And you be very interesting if we could place bugs&#x2F;feature requests and etc for it, as we can currently do on JIRA for Titanium.</p>

							<p>There&#39;s a company called google that provides some decent search tools. Especially if you use the <code>site</code> syntax to limit your results to just the developer section. Oh, and there is also a nice little drop down that limits results based on age</p>

										<p><p>This is my favourite to, although I simply prefix <strong>appcelerator</strong> to all my searches, as there are lots of other sites out there that also have good information, from stackoverflow.com to the many blogs and Git repositories out there.</p>

										<p><p>yeah, usually I end up by using google, but I do think that I could get better results here. And it&#39;s quite boring to use Google when the website should itself have a good search. As the actual developer pointed out, they&#39;re trying to work on it.</p>
