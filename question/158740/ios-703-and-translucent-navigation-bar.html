			<h1>iOS 7.0.3 and translucent navigation bar....</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just upgraded to iOS 7.0.3 this morning on my iPhone, and all of the sudden the navigation bars I had set to translucent = true, no longer work. They go back to being opaque. However, on the iOS Simulator, the translucent navigation bars keep working as programmed.</p>
<p>Anyone else experiencing this with 7.0.3?</p>

							<div><p>Hello Juan, in my case I am not setting the &#39;tintcolor&#39; and still the translucent effect is gone since I updated to 7.0.3…which is also the time I updated to Mavericks, I am not wondering if that update did something to xcode which might have something to do with it.</p>

							<div><p>Thanks! I found out that if I remove the barColor the navBar becomes translucent again, now the problem is that for some reason it is black, and if I set the barColor then the color works but it gets solid again. Anyway I will keep testing. Thanks for your time! :)</p>

										<p><p>Thanks. As the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devforums.apple.com&#x2F;thread&#x2F;210495">Apple forum thread</a> suggests, it looks like Apple changed things up with 7.0.3.  </p>
<p>Using the RGBA trick that Jannis suggested below (which is also mentioned in the Apple forums) seems to be an OK workaround, but the end result is not quite the same effect as before 7.0.3.  </p>
<p>BTW, the alpha has to be applied to the window&#39;s <code>barColor</code> property, not <code>tintColor</code></p>

							<p>One workaround is to set the alpha of your window&#39;s tintColor like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">Ti</span><span class="hljs-class">.UI</span><span class="hljs-class">.createWindow</span>(<span class="hljs-rules">{<span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">tintColor</span>:<span class="hljs-value"> <span class="hljs-string">'#dd007aff'</span></span></span></span>})
</code></pre><p>So in this case the alpha is <code>dd</code> for my color <code>007aff</code>.</p>
