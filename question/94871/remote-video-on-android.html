			<h1>Remote Video on Android</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Greetings all!</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to play a video that is hosted on our webserver on an android phone. I&#39;ve already built this for iPhone and it works great.</p>
<p>Droid, however is a different issue. Instead of getting video, I&#39;m just getting a black screen, no error or anything.</p>
<p>The video I&#39;m downloading does play on the droid when not using Titanium, so I know its not a format issue. (its an .MP4 incase anyone is wondering.)</p>
<p>I&#39;ve used Titanium SDK&#39;s 1.5.1 and am on the continuous build of 1.6.0 from earlier today.</p>
<p>using the 2.2 Droid SDK, and Titanium Developer 1.2.2. I&#39;ve also tried this on an actual phone but with the same results.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>So… since I posted this, I&#39;ve been fooling with it and I might have made some headway, as I&#39;m no longer getting just a black screen. Instead I&#39;m getting a popup that says &#39;</p>
<p>Here is my current code:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var content = <span class="hljs-string">'http://video.qa.knowledgeblue.com/Sales.mp4'</span>;

activeContent = Titanium.Media.createVideoPlayer({
url: content,
    backgroundColor:<span class="hljs-string">'#111'</span>,
    movieControlMode:Titanium.Media.VIDEO_CONTROL_DEFAULT
}); 

        Ti.API.<span class="hljs-keyword">info</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Made it to point 016"</span>);
        activeContent.fullscreen = true;
        Ti.API.<span class="hljs-keyword">info</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Made it to point 017"</span>);
        activeContent.play();
        Ti.API.<span class="hljs-keyword">info</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Made it to point 018"</span>);
</code></pre><p>Here&#39;s the gist of the trace:    https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;758796</p>
<p>One thing I&#39;m noticing in there is a lot of &#39;max duration reached, size = 1293311 bytes&#39; lines. Most of them are the same. I would think that these are related to max download size or something. Maybe its nothing, but maybe someone out there has some thoughts.</p>

							<div><p>It isn&#39;t very long. Its 1:52, and only 5.6MB as a .MOV, 3.6MB as a .MP4.</p>
<p>If I were to see that elsewhere, I would think I just need to adjust a cache or buffer size for the prog. Very odd in deed.</p>
