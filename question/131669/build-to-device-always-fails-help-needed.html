							<p>Titanium SDK 1.7.5 was the last to support Android API 2.1.  Titanium 1.8.X and up will require <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Titanium+Compatibility+Matrix#TitaniumCompatibilityMatrix-AndroidSDK%2FTargetAndroidPlatform">minimum Android 2.2</a>.  You can either drop to the lower Ti SDK or upgrade the device.</p>

										<p><p>We have one app that will continue to be compiled against the older APIs for maximum exposure.  It is a very simple app that displays our customer&#39;s data to his clients.  Because it has no bells or whistles or fancy functions we can do that.  Not so much the case for the other projects I&#39;m afraid.</p>

							<p>Looks like it shipped with Android 2.1.<br>Also looks like an upgrade to 2.2 was released.</p>
<p>So, 2.1 would be your minimum target API level.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open your TIAPP.xml in the project.</li>
<li>Click the configure below the Deployment Targets.<br>3.Under Android, select Android 2.1 as your Default Android SDK.</li>
<li>Depending on that features you use in your app, may have to use Google APIs Android 2.1</li>
</ol>

										<p><p>Based upon Google&#39;s Market information, just less than 10% of the devices accessing the market are running an API less than 8 (Android 2.2, Froyo)</p>
<p>I mention it less anyone cry &#39;foul&#39; over the &#39;forced&#39; minimum base API that 1.8.x brought to us.  Many of those devices will never be upgraded due to hardware specs and or carrier restrictions.</p>
<p>Around 90% of the androids in the wild are at Level 8 and Level 10.</p>
<p>It is worth knowing your target audience.</p>
