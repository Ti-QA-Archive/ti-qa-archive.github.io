										<p><p>This is a very important question for me as well.  I&#39;ve read Doug&#39;s comments in the original post, and that looks like the best option.  Mark mentioned in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;29401&#x2F;desktop---can-i-protect-me-source-code">this post</a> (10 months ago!) that he was able to implement an encrypted database solution in Titanium.</p>
<p>Hopefully someone is able to able to post their solution eventually, as this would be a huge benefit for those of us considering larger scale commercial applications.</p>

										<p><p>Mike, that post was talking about Titanium Desktop, which is another matter entirely.  However, it still seems to me that this should be entirely possible, but would need custom modules for each platform (iOS, android, and blackberry when released).  It isn&#39;t high enough on my priority list to tackle myself, and last I looked it wasn&#39;t on a lighthouse ticket which suggests it isn&#39;t high on Appcelerator&#39;s priority list either.  Or maybe I missed the ticket.  And maybe it will be a module Appcelerator consider for Titanium+Plus.  It is only a week until we start finding out its terms and plans.</p>

							<p>Well I do hope it&#39;s not some kind of Titanium+Plus module as you need a special subscription to those for as far as I&#39;ve seen.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve just created a private service for one of our apps in order to communicate. Right now it&#39;s very hard to keep the service private as anyone can read the scripting and see where it goes and what is asked for.</p>
<p>Surely obfuscation can help a bit, but that&#39;s only for a small part as well as that it slows done the app dramaticlly.</p>
<p>A solution like this where you can at least store some important info you want to keep private, would be of major importance.</p>
