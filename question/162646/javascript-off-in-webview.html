							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I am not sure exactly what you are asking as it does not come over very clear.  But this might answer it if you are trying to run JavaScript in a webView html page and respond to the events back in your own app.</p>

										<p><p>OK I understand the problem now.  You have a web page that contains JavaScript that when you use a webView to display it - you do not want the JavaScript contained within the page to execute.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for you, the webView honours the same settings related to JavaScript being turned on or off and other important settings that are set at the OS level - you do not have control over these properties.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
