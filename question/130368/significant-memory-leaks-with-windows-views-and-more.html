			<h1>Significant memory leaks with windows, views and more</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I&#39;m struggling with memory leaks since days and I haven&#39;t found the right answer (here in the Q&amp;As) until now. I have an app in the app store since ~1 year. Because of tiny bugs I now switched to API 1.8.0.1 (that is much more robust!). The app update is nearly finished but unfortunately I now have severe memory leaks.</p>
<p>My app is a dice game (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunes.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;mia-hd&#x2F;id414289812?mt=8">App Store - Mia HD</a>) opening some windows, showing&#x2F;hiding views (sometimes using timeouts), and so on. With 1.8.0.1 I can play the game for only 10 minutes because my iPhone runs out of memory.</p>
<p>I cannot imagine that it is the intention of the Appcelerator team to provide an easy-to-use framework for developers providing the possibility to develop apps only with Javascript knowledge on the one hand, and on the other hand leaving them alone with their memory leak problems only providing a few hints how to solve parts of the problems with some workarounds. At least that is my feeling after reading several posts about this issue.</p>
<p>I already had a look at this post: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;116867&#x2F;this-is-a-solution-to-your-memory-woes">Why is there still the problem with memory leak ?</a>. But it did not work for me.</p>
<p>Does anyone have an idea or a solution?</p>
<p>Regards</p>

							<div><p>this is such a wide open question that it is impossible to answer. We have no idea what the architecture is of your application, how you built it the list goes on and on. There is no silver bullet here, you need to do the  appropriate analysis of your app, find the leaks and adjust your architecture</p>

										<p><p>Thanks a lot for all these hints! After partly re-implementing my app (using local contexts, closing windows, setting proxy objects to null,…) I could manage all memory leaks! Great :-)</p>

							<p>Had problems of memory leak with the ImageView, with 1.8.0.1</p>
<p>Posted a report to the JIRA <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-7051">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-7051</a></p>
<p>workaround, confirmed by the Appcelerator team :<br>Although it&#39;s depreciated, using the url instead of image property resolves the issue.</p>
