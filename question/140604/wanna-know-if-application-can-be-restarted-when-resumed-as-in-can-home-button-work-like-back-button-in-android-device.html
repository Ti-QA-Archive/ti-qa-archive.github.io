							<p>Hi Anuj</p>
<p>Not as far as I am aware, I assume you require this to simplify the prcess of reloading data into your app that happens when your apps starts.</p>
<p>You have to manage this process yourself I am afraid. </p>
<p>If anyone knows any different I would also like to know.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Stephen</p>
<p>That would not re-start the app on resume though, the user would need to go and start the app again manually.</p>
<p>Unless of course &quot;…user resumes the app again from the main menu..&quot; literally means force them back to the home screen.  Not the best user experience though (personal opinion).</p>

										<p><p>Hi Stephen, thanks for the support, but i&#39;m sorry to say: it&#39;s not working in android. I believe i should elaborate the question more.<br>First of all it&#39;s android device specific question.<br>What i actually want is, while the app is running , if user presses home button to minimize the app( it usually goes to background and get paused). Now when the user resume it again from the menu, the app should restart&#x2F;reload from beginning..!!<br>Is this kinda thing feasible…..any support would be a great help… thanks..</p>

										<p><p>We can answer the question as asked: no, can&#39;t restart your app.</p>
<p>Or, we can provide a solution to the problem, instead of the question.</p>

										<p><p>Well, thats not entirely true: cannot restart.</p>
<p>If it can be accepted in the tiapp.xml under the android activites entries, you could try to hack in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;guide&#x2F;topics&#x2F;manifest&#x2F;activity-element.html#clear">android:clearTaskOnLaunch</a> to your root activity</p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t think you can fake an intent call to the PackageManager to start the activity in your app, as I think the &#39;restart&#39; problem we have at initial install from Play will occur.</p>

										<p><p>HI Stephen </p>
<p><em>&quot;There would be no &#39;resume&#39; as the app has exited.&quot;</em> was my point - wanted it to still resume but closing it down would not allow it to resume as it would no longer be running.</p>
<p>My actual answer included <em>&quot;.. I assume you require this to simplify the process of reloading data into your app that happens when your apps starts. … You have to manage this process yourself I am afraid.&quot;</em>.  Which was designed to provide the answer, <strong>sorry no short-cuts</strong> as far as I am aware.</p>

										<p><p>the only difference in the user experience is in one case, they have the icon in the task manager.</p>
<p>In both cases its a relaunch of the app (as he originally requested).</p>
<p>clearTaskOnLaunch will do just what he asked for originally: restart the first activity.</p>

										<p><p>When I read <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;guide&#x2F;topics&#x2F;manifest&#x2F;activity-element.html#clear">android:clearTaskOnLaunch</a>  I noted that the first activity (which could be three tabs each with a window and a table full of data) would remain persistent.</p>
<p>Anuj would still need to deal with managing these items - which was not wanted - it was all meant to reset.</p>
<p>The <em>android:clearTaskOnLaunch</em> does not actually restart anything it simply returns the app to the first thing loaded &#39;activity P&#39; in their example - basically anything until the back button would exit the app.</p>
