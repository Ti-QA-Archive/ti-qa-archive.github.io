			<p>Hi - after developing an app for the last few months it suddenly won&#39;t run on the simulator or on my test device (iPad).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been testing on both regularly without problems, but suddenly neither works.</p>
<p><em>Error message trying to run on simulator:</em></p>
<p>&gt;[DEBUG] Session could not be started: Error Domain=DTiPhoneSimulatorErrorDomain Code=1 UserInfo=0x100300d30 &quot;iOS Simulator failed to install the application.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Error message trying to install on device:</em></p>
<p>&gt;[ERROR] Error: Traceback (most recent call last):<br>  File &quot;&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx&#x2F;1.7.2&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;builder.py&quot;, line 1305, in main<br>    execute_xcode(&quot;iphoneos%s&quot; % iphone_version,args,False)<br>  File &quot;&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx&#x2F;1.7.2&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;builder.py&quot;, line 1066, in execute_xcode<br>    output = run.run(args,False,False,o)<br>  File &quot;&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx&#x2F;1.7.2&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;run.py&quot;, line 39, in run<br>    sys.exit(rc)<br>SystemExit: 65</p>
<p>If anyone can shed any light on this issue that would be great.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried the standard things like restarting everything and rebuilding the project without any joy…</p>
<p>I&#39;m using the latest versions of all software &#x2F; SDKs and I had it running both in the simulator and on my test device less than an hour ago!</p>
<p>The only thing I think I changed is I updated the default &#39;spash&#39; .png files (Default.png, Default@2x.png.. etc) - could this have anything to do with it!? Can&#39;t imagine how!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

							<p>I have also done this once. If the images are not quite right, they can cause the app to crash. Try opening the images in a separate app. Then get the graphic bod or yourself to re export them and copy them in.</p>
<p>I am assuming you have deleted the iphone build directory as a starter before this.</p>
<p>Hope this helps…</p>

										<p><p>Thanks very much - turns out it is a problem with the new png files. I&#39;ve just rebuilt using a new project with the default png files and it&#39;s working again! Any idea what might be up with my png files? I used photoshop to save them as I have in the past…</p>

										<p><p>sorry I am not a graphic bod, my knowledge would say export them as web graphics. But hopefully a graphic bod can confirm.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your help - much appreciated! If anyone knows what requirements there are for pngs please post a reply! From google I think it may have something to do with colour profiles, but I&#39;m not a graphic bod either - please help!</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>
