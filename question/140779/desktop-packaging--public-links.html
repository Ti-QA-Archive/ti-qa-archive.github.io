			<h1>Desktop packaging | Public links</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve just made the switch for Adobe Air to Titanium Desktop, and am very happy with my choice.</p>
<p>Since this is a Business Application, I don&#39;t want to create public links. I&#39;ve set the <em>PUBLISH PRIVACY</em> to <em>PRIVATE</em>, but it created a Public Link.</p>
<p>All I wanted was to be able to <strong>download</strong> the installer file, and then distribute it internally. Is there anyway I can achieve such behavior?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>V.</p>

							<p>Might want to head over to <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tidesdk.org">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tidesdk.org</a> as Appcelerator open sourced the desktop sdk and the community is managing it now.</p>

							<p>Thanks, I was able to compile my dmg with the TideSDK.</p>
<p>Can I compile for Windows also, under a MacOS environment? I have a Win7 Virtual Machine I can use, if it&#39;s needed, but I was unable to find the packaging instructions for Windows.</p>
<p>TIA,</p>
<p>V.</p>

							<p>Hi Vasco. First. I think many folks should be pleased with the direction we are taking TideSDK. I&#39;ll be posting a rather long update on the project on our blog  at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tidesdk.org&#x2F;blog">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tidesdk.org&#x2F;blog</a> since many positive developments to share. In our developments, are currently building on Ubuntu 12.04, Windows 7 and 8 and OSX Lion and Mountain Lion. We still have much work but it is coming and will announce a date for our first release.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll be sharing nightly build links quite soon so that you can install from the builds from our continuous integration system. Visit our site for links mailing list, and wiki. TideSDK devs and app developers like yourself online at #tidesdk on freenode. We&#39;ve got many new things coming out shortly including a beautiful site blog and docs on their way that will be quite amazing when they are ready.</p>

										<p><p>The reason I switched from Air to TideSDK was the support for SVG, since I&#39;m developing an app that will require charts (created using KendoUI DataViz).<br>If I could understand you, I will be able to compile my app into a Windows installer (msi?) on a MacOS Environment?<br>Thanks,<br>V.</p>

										<p><p>Vasco, you will be able to bundle your app for installation on the various platforms. Understand that you must bundle you apps for each os by having a machine or vm with the sdk installed. You cannot bundle a windows app on a mac for example. We may offer services so that developers can develop on one os and build for all os&#39;s to replace the service appc has taken down.</p>
<p>I would encourage you to join the mailing list at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;groups.google.com&#x2F;forum&#x2F;?hl=en&amp;fromgroups#!forum&#x2F;tidesdk">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;groups.google.com&#x2F;forum&#x2F;?hl=en&amp;fromgroups#!forum&#x2F;tidesdk</a> for questions at or join with other desktop developers and the TideSDK dev on irc at #tidesdk on freenode. You are going to find more support there when it comes to your desktop efforts.</p>

							<p>I am now ready to package my application, but I&#39;m having problems with the network type installed. I tried a bundle packaging, as it should include the needed runtime, but I must be doing something wrong, since it does not bundle within the MSI.</p>
<p>The code I&#39;m executing is as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">C:<span class="hljs-command">\TideSDK</span><span class="hljs-command">\sdk</span><span class="hljs-command">\win</span>32\1.2.0.RC6d<span class="hljs-command">\tibuild</span>.py -p --type=BUNDLE --os=win32 "C:<span class="hljs-command">\path</span>_to_app<span class="hljs-command">\app</span>_dir"
</code></pre><p>I also tried:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">C:<span class="hljs-command">\TideSDK</span><span class="hljs-command">\sdk</span><span class="hljs-command">\win</span>32\1.2.0.RC6d<span class="hljs-command">\tibuild</span>.py -p -t bundle --os=win32 "C:<span class="hljs-command">\path</span>_to_app<span class="hljs-command">\app</span>_dir"
</code></pre><p>And all the uppercase&#x2F;lowercase combinations. Also tried version 1.2.0.4, without sucess.</p>
<p>Am I doing something wrong?</p>
