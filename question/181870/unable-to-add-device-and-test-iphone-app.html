			<h1>Unable to add device and test iPhone app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I am upgrading my iPhone app which is in Apple App Store, built using Titanium Alloy. </p>
<p>My problem is that I am trying to add a new device in apple.developer.com to test my app but I am unable to do so. I don&#39;t get any errors but the activity indicator just goes on and on. </p>
<p>So on the screen to &quot;Add Device&quot; in apple.developer.com I am able to enter the UDID obtained via XCode and a name for the device. Once I click &quot;Continue&quot; the activity indicator just goes and on. </p>
<p>I already have a device added about a year back. I recently renewed my Apple Developer program membership and I already have all the Provisioning Profile, development certificates etc created for the app.</p>
<p>I have tried searching for the same on the web and this forum but found nothing relevant.</p>
<p>I know this is not Titanium related question but since there so many experienced developers may be some one can help me out. This is my first app so I obviously don&#39;t know a lot of things and looking for the right direction.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and help.</p>
