			<h1>new date object fails when beyond cell reception</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>So this is a weird bug.  On several occasions my app has failed to generate a valid date object with new Date() when outside of cell reception.  I can&#39;t seem to replicate this when I put my iPhone in airplane mode or turn off 3G and cellular data.  It only seems to happen when I power up my phone and there really isn&#39;t any cell reception, then start my Ti-based app and do something that tries fetch the current datetime, which fails.</p>
<p>Strangely, the error seems to stop after the phone gets cell reception, even if it loses reception again.</p>
<p>Has anyone else experienced a bug like this? Can anything be done? I&#39;m using the Ti SDK 1.6.2.</p>

							<p>On the surface, this sounds like whatever device you are using won&#39;t report its clock time after a power up until it has verified it with a cell tower to get the correct current local time and timezone information.  Once it has done that, it continues to report the time even if it can no longer see a tower.</p>
<p>This sounds to me like a device &#x2F; OS specific problem instead of a titanium problem per se.  But all of this is just a SWAG based on your description.</p>
<p>What device &#x2F; OS version are you using?</p>

										<p><p>That is certainly what it sounds like, but I&#39;m using an iPhone 3GS (MB717LL), iOS 4.3.3.  I haven&#39;t tried it on an iPhone 4, and I haven&#39;t targeted any other platforms yet.  Have you heard of things like this happening on iPhones?  I&#39;ve never noticed the system clock being messed up when I don&#39;t have cell reception, and indeed, when I experienced this issue, the system clock was fine, which made me suspect Titanium and not the OS or the hardware.</p>

										<p><p>I have not experienced it, but then I don&#39;t have an iPhone ether so I can&#39;t even see what the clock reports before a tower in contacted after a reboot.  I was just suggesting that could explain the difference between a phone restart and just going into airplane mode.</p>
