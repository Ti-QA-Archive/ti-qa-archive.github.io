			<h1>New to Titanium, Password issue on OSX install</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>HI,</p>
<p>When installing Titanium on OSX where it goes to download stuff like Node, etc. it prompts me with a pop-up box asking for a System Password. A lot of problems are occurring here.</p>
<p>First off, the User field is greyed out so that I can not change it. It is defaulting to some name that does not exist on my mac. It looks like the beginning of my email address I used for Appcelerator. So I tried that password but that&#39;s not working.</p>
<p>I have no system password set.</p>
<p>I can not get this to install and work until this is resolved. It appears after searching this Q&amp;A forum that this is an error a lot of people get, and it never seems to get resolved. I&#39;m hoping someone has a fix, otherwise unfortunately I can&#39;t use this and will have to look at something else.</p>

							<p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>The problem I am getting here is that I don&#39;t know what this password is, I guess I need to look into resetting it somehow, but without having an install disk for Mavericks I am not sure how to do that.</p>
