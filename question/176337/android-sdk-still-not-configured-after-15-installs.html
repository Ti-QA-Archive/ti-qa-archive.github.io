			<h1>Android SDK still not configured after 15 installs.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Well, hello appcelerator guys !</p>
<p>I&#39;m absolutely new to Titanium, and I already got problems, even before starting to code. </p>
<p>Here is the situation : I installed the last version of Titanium (3.3.0) on my Windows 8.1 x64 computer (nope, I don&#39;t have a mac and don&#39;t want one.). Of course my Java is fully up to date. Titanium installation went well. First thing I did was to install the Android SDK as the SDK window popped immediately at launch. I checked the 2.3.3 and 4.1.2, then started the installation, which went well too. They I created my first project, which was a Mobile App project, using the Alloy default project (hello world). I selected Android as the only platform, and it told me that the SDK wasn&#39;t installed. Funny, I thought I just installed it.. Whatever, let&#39;s install it again. It went well again, and I was moved to the TiApp Editor. As the &quot;Getting started&quot; tutorial from appcelerator said, I tried to run the app, but the Run option is grey and unclickable. I tried to watch the build configurations to choose the Android emulator, but the Emulator drop-down list is empty. I clicked on Install SDKs on the TiApp Editor, and, oh what a surprise : Android SDK not configured yet ! I installed it two times and it&#39;s still missing ? </p>
<p>I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing wrong. I tried to manually download and install the SDK, and it&#39;s still not working. Am I that noob that I can&#39;t even install a SDK ? </p>
<p>Anyone got a clue about this ? I found nothing on the internet.. Maybe I&#39;m not even able to search, and I should stop being a developer ? </p>
<p>Thanks in advance for helping guys !</p>

							<p>The installation process for android can be a pain due the specific requirements. I would suggest you look at the installation <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Installing_the_Android_SDK">guide</a> first.  Make sure you carefully read the versions of everything. For example, you MUST install the 32bit JDK (preferably 1.6)</p>
