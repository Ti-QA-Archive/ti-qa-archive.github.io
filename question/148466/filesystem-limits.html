			<h1>Filesystem limits?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>For an upcomming application I need to use the Filesystem or save files remotely on a server. I am trying to determine the possibilities but can&#39;t find much in the docs. I need to know this for both iOS and Android. So here goes:</p>
<p>Are there any limitations on using the Filesystem?<br>I can&#39;t find what type of files are supported and the maximum file size allowed.<br>Is it possible to save unlimited amount of files?</p>

							<p>You will get a performance problem if you save a very big number of files on one folder. On the other hand it is not allowed by apple to store very big data (esp. caching) in iCloud. To avoid this you can the special file property <code>remoteBackup()</code></p>
<p><em>Value indicating whether or not to back up to a cloud service.</em></p>
<p><em>Some apps may be rejected by Apple for backing up specific files; if this is the case, ensure that this value is set to false for them. This value should only need to be set once by your app, but setting it multiple times will not cause problems. For files distributed with your app, this will need to be set on boot. This flag will only affect iOS versions 5.0.1 and later, but is safe to set on earlier versions.</em></p>
<p><em>Note that setting this property to false will also prevent the file identified by this object from being backed up to iTunes.</em></p>

										<p><p>Are you saying that the use of Titanium mobiles ´Filesystem´ goes paired with iCloud?<br>The idea basically to save some documents in the application which then can be accessed even when the user is offline. The user selects what documents to save.</p>

										<p><p>Sorry, I misunderstood you. Anyway if for example I have a 16gb iPhone would it be possible to save a file from like 6 gb? Won&#39;t happen, but I wanted to know how large a file can be.</p>
