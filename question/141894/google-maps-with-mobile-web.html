			<h1>Google Maps with Mobile Web</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I understand that mobile web has GPS functionality working(great!), and I&#39;d like to know if it is possible to integrate Google maps. The application basically needs to give driving directions to stored locations and search stored data by location.</p>
<p>Any help &#x2F; suggestions would be awesome!</p>

							<p>Yes, this should be possible. Ti.Map.View has a &quot;userLocation&quot; (bool) flag that you can enable that will draw a little blue dot showing the device&#39;s current location. This basically does all the hard work of listening to the GPS and drawing the dot.</p>
<p>To draw a route, you need to use the addRoute() method. The only inconvenient thing is the route is a list of lat&#x2F;lng points that are used to construct a polyline. So, you would have to get that data from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;directions&#x2F;">Google&#39;s Directions API</a>.</p>
<p>The rest of the turn-by-turn data is easy to get. Here&#39;s an example from Google&#39;s Directions API docs that shows the &quot;legs&quot;, the lat&#x2F;lng of each leg, and instructions: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;maps.googleapis.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;api&#x2F;directions&#x2F;json?origin=Toronto&amp;destination=Montreal&amp;sensor=false">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;maps.googleapis.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;api&#x2F;directions&#x2F;json?origin=Toronto&amp;destination=Montreal&amp;sensor=false</a>.</p>

										<p><p>Sounds great! And this would all work in the mobile web app, as well as the &quot;native&quot; Android and iOS apps?</p>

										<p><p>Well, sort of. The mapping stuff should work just fine, however getting the direction data is going to be a little different. The problem is doing the cross-domain request to Google&#39;s servers. Web browsers have security that prevents them from downloading data from other domains.</p>
<p>It can be remedied if the cross-domains have CORS enabled. I&#39;m not sure if Google&#39;s servers have CORS enabled, so you may need to use a proxy server to relay the directions results. We usually setup a simple nginx proxy, but you could use Apache or write one in PHP or node.js.</p>

<p>The application will need to give driving directions to exhibition venues(their GPS coordinates stored on a server by administrators). Once in the exhibition venue, the application needs to give directions to exhibition stands via a floor map(Don&#39;t think that would use Google maps), and information on stands and their products etc.</p>
<p>We need to do this through mobile web, as we need to support Blackberry and Windows Mobile devices as well as Android and iOS.</p>
