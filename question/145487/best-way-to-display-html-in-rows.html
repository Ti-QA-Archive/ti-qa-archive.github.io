			<h1>Best way to display html in rows</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>From a web service I am getting back html to display in my iOS application. This is so the content providers can change their styling without having to update the app.</p>
<p>I have tried putting a webview into a tablerow and inserting each html row into webview. This seems to be very messy as it seems to do funny things to styling and cannot automatically get the webview height.</p>
<p>Is there a better way to achieve this? The only other way I can think is to render the whole table in a webview, but it makes it harder to insert new rows into.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Jamie</p>

							<p>i&#39;n afraid it&#39;s one or the other in this case. Either use a WebView and give your client full control over <strong>how</strong> the content is presented or you will have to formalize a little with him.</p>
<p>Of course it&#39;s easier said than done. But one way to have a little of both would be to provide them with a way to give you some formatting info. (sizes, fonts, positions) And you would then parse this info and <em>construct</em> your UI using said information. Of course, this is easier said than done. But it&#39;s an idea that could work well on the client and give your client some form of flexibility.</p>

							<p>Using a webview it table rows is not a good idea. Each webview is an entire instance of the browser object. After a few of those, your app is going to get really slow.<br>You might try the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;790?119343022">Styled Label Module</a> in the marketplace. There is another called Rich Text or something like that as well.</p>

										<p><p>I tried using the Styled Label before and thought I remember it is really just a light weight webview. Even with the Styled Label, once you get to around 8+ instances  it really starts to slow down.</p>

							<p>Another option is to generate the results one by one in a single webview, take a screenshot each time, and cache&#x2F;display it.</p>
<p>You may lose some loading time but the overall performances will be better.</p>
