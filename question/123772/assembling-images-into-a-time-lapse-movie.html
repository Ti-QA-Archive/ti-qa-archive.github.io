			<h1>Assembling images into a time-lapse movie</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve developed an app that takes a picture at a defined interval, and saves it locally. I would like to compile all these images into a movie, creating a beautiful time-lapse.<br>I have absolutely no idea on how to do so. Could anyone of you help me out ?</p>
<p>Also, in order to retrieve these images onto my computer I am currently doing a really absurd procedure : I upload the pictures from the iPhone to a remote server and then I download them onto my computer. This is a complete waste of time and I am sure there is a way to make the transfer a lot easier, but I haven&#39;t found it yet.<br>Again, has anyone an idea, even just a little something to get me started ?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Vincent</p>

							<p>If you are looking to do this directly on the iphone, it will require a custom module written in objective C.  At this time, Titanium does not have native support for the iOS AVFoundation APIs which are needed to do this.  You can read more about creating iOS modules for Titanium <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Module+Developer+Guide+for+iOS">here</a>.</p>
<p>As it so happens, I may have a need to do this myself within a few weeks though I am not sure yet it will end up at the top of my to-do list.</p>

							<p>btw: A quicker way I use for getting files off your app is to enable File sharing for the app, using the Info.plist and setting UIFileSharingEnabled to YES. </p>
<p>Then, if you get your app to save the photos in the applictionData folder (rather than the album) you&#39;ll be able to drag them out via iTunes while it&#39;s plugged in.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your answer Rainer, but I&#39;m actually looking for a way to generate the movie on the iPhone. I&#39;ve already downloaded Time Lapse Assembler to do this on my Mac, and it works like a charm</p>
