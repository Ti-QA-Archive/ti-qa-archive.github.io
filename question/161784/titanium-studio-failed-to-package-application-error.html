			<h1>Titanium Studio Failed to package application error</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi everyone.</p>
<p>This is extremely frustrating.</p>
<p>My project was building with no problems at all, but then suddenly I started getting the following error when trying to run the project on a device or in an emulator.</p>
<p>[ERROR] :  Failed to package application:<br>[ERROR] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 1</p>
<p>there is no other information in the console. I&#39;ve tried the following steps.</p>
<p>1: Close and re-open titanium studio.<br>2: Restart PC.<br>3: Delete and reimport project.<br>4: Uninstall and Reinstall node.js and Titanium Studio.</p>
<p>Other projects run fine so I&#39;m sure it must be something I did within the project but I made no major changes to it.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve posted my project here - http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sdrv.ms&#x2F;1hKIBDD . If anyone can have a look and help me I would be eternally grateful!!</p>

							<p>Try doing a <strong>project -&gt; clean</strong> this should clean out the build folder for your project.</p>
<p>If you are using Alloy you could also try clearing your resources folder, if the clean doesn&#39;t work.</p>

							<p>I went back to an older, backed-up version of my project and it&#39;s working now. I&#39;ll just have to be extra vigilant and test EVERY time I make a single change.</p>
<p>I really wish Titanium Studio would throw proper errors :-(</p>

							<p>I had the similar problem but it has been solved.</p>
<p><code>[ERROR] :  Failed to package application:
 [ERROR] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 1</code></p>
<p>The solution is changing to use the Android Build-tools version &quot;20&quot;</p>
<p>I found the solution from the page below:</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;178514&#x2F;</p>

							<p>I had the exact same issue. It happened because I accidentally saved PSD file into &quot;images&quot; folder. Removed the PSD from &quot;images&quot; folder and project is building again(Clean didn&#39;t help previously).<br>So, try to look for some unnecessary files.</p>
