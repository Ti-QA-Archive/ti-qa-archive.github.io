			<h1>Can you build an ipad and iphone app at the same time</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;m a bit confused why there&#39;s an ipad option separate to mobile, does this mean you can only create an iphone app and ipad app separately?</p>
<p>Opften newer ipad apps in the store are able to work on both and are able to simply tweak layout for each.<br>Is this possible in Titanium?</p>
<p>I&#39;d rather not have to make a seperate mobile app for iphone&#x2F;android and another for ipad as I&#39;d be pretty pissed as a customer buying an ipad app and finding I need to get the iphone app because the ipad version wont work on both.</p>
<p>Can you simply create a mobile app and then use the platform detection tests for specific ipad tweaks or is the only option to create 2 projects?</p>

							<p>With the in development Titanium Developer (1.3.0) you can. Download it form github and build it as a desktop app. Anyway not being released yet it means it may have bugs so you&#39;re on your own :)</p>

							<p>I dont think Titanium supports Universal apps.</p>
<p>Besides, isnt the layout going to be a little different to compensate for screen sizes, retina display, etc?  I have an iPhone and iPad version of the same app, and it took maybe an extra day.  The code is the same for the most part, except for using things like the SplitView in the iPad, and new artwork.  The actual code functionality, though, was easy.</p>

										<p><p>My point is that building 2 app 1 for ipad and 1 for iphone is stupid. As a customer if I bought an ipad app only to find I couldn&#39;t use it on my iphone I would be very pissed off. Using Objective-C you can make 1 single app that works on both. You handle layout differences within the app depending on platform.</p>
