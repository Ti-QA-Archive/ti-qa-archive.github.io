			<h1>Setup - Unable to configure Android SDK</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am setting up Titanium Studio for the first time. The Andoird SDK is not visible to Titanium.<br>Under preferences - Platform- Android it gives the error &#39;No Android SDKs were found under the specified location&#39;.<br>The Android SDK is installed and I&#39;ve treid this several times, installing seperately and under Titanium.<br>Added PATHs under System and User.<br>Made copies of the adb.exe etc.<br>Checked permissions.<br>Uninstalled everything and reisntalled in different locations.<br>Basically spent 2 days now googling this problems and trying to solve it and on the point of giving up and using Xamarin instead (if it this hard to get started then imagine problems down the line).<br>Is there something obvious I&#39;m missing here?<br>Does anyone know what Titanium is looking for when it is working out whether the SDK exists or not?<br>(I know there&#39;s lots of posts out there about this problem but some are going back years and so far none of them have helped.)<br>I&#39;m hoping somebody can shed some light on it.</p>

							<div><p>Same here Steven. I was so excited to develop in Titanium. But with the headaches I&#39;ve gained on the last 3 days, I&#39;ll just use Xamarin.</p>

							<div><p>Threat?<br>I invested in a new PC and lots of time to get up and running with Titanium, I really would have preferred that to work. I was feeling exasperated at lack of progress when I can normally figure things out. I should not have mentioned Xamarin, there&#39;s Cordova too and that might be better to get a quick start with mobile development. I just want to create a cross platform app, quickly and not too bothered how.<br>I&#39;m under threat daily with my other business, customers go somewhere else if the service&#x2F;product is not 100%. Titanium&#39;s installation is not 100%. I guess some people are just lucky.</p>

<li>good idea: using of unixlike system like osx</li>
<li>you go to your adk folder. in this folder is a folder platform-tools. In this folder you start <strong>android</strong>. You must install android 2.3.3 and the newest SDK and some other tools. If you have enough time and&#x2F;or place on your SSD you can install all ;-))</li>
