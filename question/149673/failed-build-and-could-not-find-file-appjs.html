			<p>HI.</p>
<p>I had Ti SDK 3.0.0.GA and i got the red screen &quot;Could not find file app.js&quot;.</p>
<p>So i looked in the forum and it seems that the SDK build had a bug so i updated it to Ti SDK 3.0.2.GA<br>But now i get this error instead.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-list">[<span class="hljs-keyword">INFO</span>] :   Invoking xcodebuild
<span class="hljs-list">[<span class="hljs-keyword">ERROR</span>] :  ** BUILD FAILED **
<span class="hljs-list">[<span class="hljs-keyword">ERROR</span>] :  The following build commands failed:

</code></pre><p>I have cleaned the project. Removed tha app from both phone and iTunes and deleted the build folder but still get the error.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Firstly you were right to move to Titanium SDK 3.0.2, there was an issue and normally it would have gone away with the SDK upgrade and a full clean.</p>
<p>The problem you <strong>had</strong> found was due to an error in your code, this is likely because of something really small and even more likely could be as simple as a comma badly placed.  Most of the issues for 3.0.0 users was just that (not always of course).  It would be smart to try and find those issues and resolve them.</p>
<p>This is an example of what <em>could</em> be the cause and you may have this problem more than once.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var view = Ti.UI.createView({
    backgroundColor: <span class="hljs-string">'red'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-variable">height</span>: Ti.UI.FILL,
    <span class="hljs-variable">width</span>: Ti.UI.FILL, <span class="hljs-comment">// notice the trailing comma - this SHOULD not be here</span>
});
</code></pre><p>I would suggest using <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jslint.com&#x2F;">jslint.com</a> to test your code on a regular basis, however you should not that you will need to add a few common library names at the bottom of page otherwise you will get lots of warning about things that are not actual issues.  I would also suggest using the toggle switches to turn off some of the more harsh rules - like white-space checks.  </p>
<p>However before all of this, I would suggest you firstly rule out a bigger issue - can you build using Ti. SDK 3.0.2.</p>
<p>To test for this, create a new default project, confirm it is using the latest SDK and make sure you change NO code.  Does this work?  If yes then, if you are using any modules, if so add them to the test app and a quick test code block to make sure all is called.  If this works - then it is likely a code syntax problem.</p>

										<p><p>Ok i have some questions…</p>
<p>Should i check for trailing commas in my code in every *.js file? </p>
<p>I have copied the code to new project now without the module i am using (path animator)</p>
<p>And i get the exact same error.</p>
<p>The funny thing is that everything worked like clockwork with 3.0.0 before i had to renew my Apple certificates (It had gone one year so they expired) . So what libs should i use at jslint.com? </p>
<p>Thanx for your time to help me resolve this.</p>

										<p><p>OK we shall start by assuming it is the certificates - I had not noticed your previous question related to the certificates.</p>
<p>Make sure you do not have BOTH the old and new certificates assigned in your computer.  You should delete the old ones.  You can find these using either xcode organiser (window menu in organiser) or keychain.  If not sure, delete anything that matches the same device id and re-install all of them.</p>
<p>Have you tried creating the new default project without any code changes yet?</p>
<p>If this works, try compiling for device using the new certificate - remember to set the device id to the same as the certificate.</p>
<p>If this fails, create a NEW certificate with a test name, adjust your app device settings for this name and try for device again.</p>

										<p><p>Yes i have done a new test project without any changes and that is no difference. Same error. I have removed all my provisioning profiles and deleted all my old cert. I have new profiles and new certs. </p>
<p>I have tried to build an old app that i used 2.0.1.GA for and build that with Ti. SDK 3.0.2. and that worked fine. </p>
<p>So if that worked maybe we can rule out the cert and profiles?</p>

										<p><p>OK, &quot;looks&quot; like the problem maybe the SDK installation.</p>
<p>Try installing another version - newer one from the continuous builds, this will then &quot;hopefully&quot; rules out&#x2F;in SDKs</p>
