			<h1>db.install linking to db in Resources</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I have strange issue that just appeared tonight relating to DB. I use a db.install to install a preconfigured DB into a mobile app. This has been working great. Tonight after reseting the contents of the iPhone simulator (a number of times) it seemed that data was persisting in the simulator. I&#39;ve gone through and checked that the reset deletes the application content in the Application Support directory, so it is blowing away all of the files correctly.</p>
<p>What I&#39;ve discovered though is that the run in iPhone simulator no longer installs the DB as a file. It is now creating a SymLink back to the DB file in my resources directory. This is bad.</p>
<p>Up until tonight this worked fine and I can&#39;t see what I have done to change this (I&#39;ve only been working on UI code), I haven&#39;t changed tiapp.xml settings and don&#39;t see anything that make this work like that.</p>
<p>Anyone else seen this behaviour?</p>
<p>Nick</p>

							<p>Hi Nick, this is a bug in 1.8.x. This has been an issue I&#39;ve been fighting with for awhile.</p>
<p>You can follow the Jira ticket here http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-6081</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Ben, this behavior pretty much kills mobile database development. I was shocked to see a comment from some from appcelerator that this is expected behavior for the simulator but bit the device. That is crap, it breaks development, it breaks testing and makes a mess of your development. I really don&#39;t believe this is expected behavior as no developer would consider this reasonable.</p>

										<p><p>I have come across this also.  Another issue you need to watch is that as the simulator is writing to the database in your resources folder, you will need to ensure you clean it out prior to releasing to devices, otherwise that data will copied with your database.  This really is a bug.</p>

										<p><p>Hey Nick - I&#39;m a git newbie…does this availability mean it will be fixed in a future SDK release?</p>

										<p><p>Hi Darren, it will be fixed in the next release. Or you can download the CI build and use it now if you&#39;d like. To do this you will want to download the master branch here http:&#x2F;&#x2F;builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;index.html</p>
<p>Here is the instructions on what to do after you&#39;ve downloaded the build https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Installing+Titanium+SDK+Continuous+Builds</p>
