			<h1>iOS simulator only shows in non-retina mode with 3.1.1 beta</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I had to update to TiStudio 3.1.1 beta (  Titanium Studio    3.1.1.201304302027-30042013202932    com.appcelerator.titanium.rcp.product    null)</p>
<p>Since the 3.1 update, it&#39;s been difficult to change the iOS simulator.  I had to change in Xcode (as always) and THEN change it in Ti Studio (Preferences -&gt; iOS), clean and rebuild.</p>
<p>WIth this beta update, I cannot find any combination of changes that will get the simulator to persist as anything other non-retina.<br>I&#39;ve tried changing in Xcode, running my build in Xcode, changing first in appcelerator, not changing the setting in Appcelerator and every other combination.</p>
<p>I building with Titanium 3.1.0.GA, iOS 6.1 sdk, Xcode version 4.6 (4H127).   (Xcode 4.6.2 is not yet listed as supported by Titanium.)</p>
<p>Has anyone else seen this?  Suggestions?</p>
<p>thanks.</p>

										<p><p>To set this preference for all <em>new</em> projects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose Titanium Studio, Preferences</li>
<li>Expand Studio &gt; Platforms and select iOS</li>
<li>Select your simulator target</li>
</ol>
<p>If you delete your old run configurations (from the Run, Run Configurations dialog), the next time you run your old projects they will be built for the default simulator type you&#39;ve selected in the preferences.</p>

										<p><p>aha, the missing part was deleting old run configurations.  I had tried changing the configuration on it&#39;s own at least 10 times with no luck.</p>
<p> If I understand what you&#39;ve said, then each time I want to change the simulator type, I have to delete all the old configurations for all projects.  Frankly, the old method of using Xcode was more straightforward.</p>

										<p><p>Oops, I didn&#39;t read your full comment. Sorry. You should be able to use my first answer without deleting the run configuration. To set them all (my comment&#x2F;second answer), yes you should delete the configs.</p>

										<p><p>Unless I delete all the run configurations, the change will not take.  i.e. just now, I followed your instructions, changed the simulator target from &#39;retina&#39; to &#39;retina and tall&#39;. Did a project clean (jik).  Ran the app in the simulator (not with the debugger).  Still runs as as retina 3.5 inch.</p>
<p>Then went back, deleted my new run configuration (that was auto created.)  I did NOT touch the simulator target in preferences, it was still set to Retina Tall from my first test.</p>
<p>Ran the app in the simulator and this time it switched to retina and tall as it should.</p>
<p>My conclusion is that I must delete all run configurations for this to work.</p>
<p>(Unfortunately, I also deleted my device build configurations which are a bit of a pain to rebuild.)</p>

										<p><p>Strange, because I didn&#39;t need to do that. After setting Retina &amp; Tall in my overall preferences (technique in first comment), I built &amp; got the iPhone 5 sim. Then, in the tiapp.xml, I clicked configure to change to Non-retina. Built without deleting run config. and got the iPhone 3&#x2F;4 non-retina sim.</p>

										<p><p>I am running Ti Studio 3.1.1 beta (version listed above) if that could make any difference?  It seemed to me that it was working before this update.  (I had to update to fix an issue with the debugger.)</p>

							<p>Step 1: Locate the Simulator</p>
<p>In Finder, go to Applications, right click on Xcode, and select &#39;Show Package Contents&#39;.  From there, go to Contents&#x2F;Developer&#x2F;Platforms&#x2F;iPhoneSimulator.platform&#x2F;Developer&#x2F;Applications, and there you will see the Simulator.</p>
<p>The complete file path is:</p>
<p>&#x2F;Applications&#x2F;Xcode.app&#x2F;Contents&#x2F;Developer&#x2F;Platforms&#x2F;iPhoneSimulator.platform&#x2F;Developer&#x2F;Applications&#x2F;iPhone Simulator.app<br>Step 2: Make the Change</p>
<p>Once you find the simulator, run it, then go to the menu Hardware &gt; Device and select either iPhone or iPhone (Retina).  Important: Close the Simulator after making the change.  Then, when you run your app again from inside Studio, it will load in the newly selected Simulator size.</p>
