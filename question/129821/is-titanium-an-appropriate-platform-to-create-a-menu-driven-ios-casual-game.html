			<h1>Is Titanium an appropriate platform to create a &#34;menu-driven&#34; iOS casual game?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>We&#39;re a small company creating our first iOS title.  It will largely rely on 2d art and menu-driven actions (think Storm8 games, for those familiar, click various actions - get results and points) - so no 3d or even scrolling 2d graphics engine.  </p>
<p>We have some experience writing native iOS apps, but we&#39;re drawn to the Titanium for the obvious benefits of rapid development.  I&#39;m optimistic because of some of the success apps like Wunderlist have had.  However, we&#39;ve been spooked by a lot of blog articles and comments about the memory management issues about Titanium.  Game responsiveness and speed (and not crashing) is critical for us.</p>
<p>At this point (12&#x2F;11), should we rely on Titanium to build our product?  Of course, we plan to do our own diligence and build a few sample projects to get the feel for the platform, but we&#39;d certainly appreciate honest feedback and opinions from those who have worked more with the platform.</p>

							<p>there is a lot of &quot;noise&quot; in the market place and it cannot be all placed on appcelerator, since the language itself, javascript, is very particular with how it handles memory management.</p>
<p>there are thousands of games in the market that have been delivered using appcelerator and in the end that is the only fact that matters. There will always be people that have problems with technology and without knowing the specifics it is difficult to say what the specific problem was… but the numbers dont lie</p>
