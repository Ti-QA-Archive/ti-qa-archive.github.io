			<p>&quot;Project creation error: Error creating project. Please try again&quot; ?!?!</p>
<p>I can&#39;t believe this. This project creation problem existed 5 months ago when I first evaluated this Appcelerator thing. Now when I tried to re-evaluate it by installing the latest and supposedly greatest version, I still got the same problem! The KitchenSink sample project is running though. But isn&#39;t it frustrating to see something like this happen when a team of engineers try to give it a second chance while seeing a 5 months old issue persisting? It drives some people instantly back to that ugly Objective-C. </p>
<p>There are other issues as well. For example, there is always this iphone&#x2F;android SDK loading problem that takes place on Mac OS and Ubuntu etc. that requires manual fixes - hardly is there a smooth installation of this Titanium stuff without a problem, ever.</p>
<p>We hate to do Objective-C and neither do we like PhoneGap. But Titanium isn&#39;t ready for prime time, or is it?</p>

							<div><p>I would recommend to try out the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;my.appcelerator.com&#x2F;resources">latest TiSDK and the studio</a>. The latest studio allows user to configure the system with much smoother experience. The studio dashboard has option to configure the iOS &amp; Android SDK. Please give it a try and let me know if you run into any issue. We would love to take your feedback for further user experience enhancement. Thanks for using the Appcelerator products.</p>
