			<h1>Titanium asking for Android Platform 5.0, can&#39;t find any of the SDK</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Fresh install of Studio, installed the Android SDK, but the Dashboard is saying that &quot;An Android SDK is missing. Titanium requires Android platform 5.0.&quot; </p>
<p>Running Linux Minut 16.</p>
<p>Looks like other users have had similar issues but there is not yet a clear solution.</p>
<p>Steps I took:</p>
<p>Titanium was just installed and successfully updated to the latest 3.2.0 and CLI 3.2.0.</p>
<p>After clicking &quot;Install or Update Android SDK&quot; the &quot;Platform Configuration&quot; dialog appears (this looks new - it is NOT the AVD&#x2F;SDK manager). Android is already selected by default, under the settings Android 4.1.2 is selected by default. </p>
<p>Android 5.0 is (obviously) not listed as one of the available platforms.</p>
<p>After clicking Configure with the default 4.1.2 selected, the progress bar runs for about a minute and then it comes to a screen with two green checks - Latest Version: Unknown, and Installed Location: &#x2F;home&#x2F;john&#x2F;android-sdk-home</p>
<p>Closing this window and refreshing the Dashboard leaves the Android SDK still unavailable (red X). The Dashboard instructions need to be changed to mesh with the new Android SDK install dialog, but that&#39;s another issue..</p>
<p>Under Window-Preferences-Platforms-Android I get the message:<br>Problems detected with the SDK settings - [Android SDK Home] No Android SDKs were found under the specified SDK location</p>
<p>Clicking Install SDKs under this dialog brings up a similar dialog to the one under the Dashboard. Selecting Android SDK 4.1.2 proceeds with similar non-results. </p>
<p>Clicking Manage AVDs brings up the original AVD manager. I created several AVDs.</p>
<p>From here I switched over to the original SDK installer, and installed everything under Tools, the entire 4.4.2, 4.1.2, and 2.3.3 APIs. </p>
<p>I even checked the &quot;Obsolete&quot; box and I found API 5, Android 2.0.0 - thinking that this is possibly what might have been meant in the Dashboard where it originally told me I that needed Android Platform 5.0.</p>
<p>All of these APIs in there entirety have been installed by way of the AVD&#x2F;SDK manager, and all show as checked on that screen. However Studio still shows a red &quot;X&quot; beside Android SDK in the dashboard, with the same message to install Android Platform 5.0. </p>
<p>Another poster recommended changing permissions of &#x2F;opt, however the permissions of &#x2F;opt were already at 755.</p>
<p>I had originally installed Titanium in &#x2F;opt, but removed it and re-installed it under my home directory (&#x2F;home&#x2F;john&#x2F;TitaniumStudio). The problem still persists.</p>
<p>Please help.</p>

							<p>Android 5 doesn&#39;t exist yet, AFAIK. The latest release is KitKat 4.4. The minimum required install for Studio 3.1.3 is Android 2.3.3 (API10). Check if that minimum version is installed. If not, try installing that and see if the error goes away. I haven&#39;t installed 3.2 yet b&#x2F;c I&#39;m too deep into a project built on 3.1.x to introduce any unknowns. But if that doesn&#39;t help, I&#39;d consider logging a bug. Hopefully someone can add something more constructive than this. Thought I&#39;d throw it out there, though.</p>

							<p>Found the answer.</p>
<p>The problem was related to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC-3399">#TC-3399</a> - just follow the instructions in that post and it recognizes the installed SDKs and no longer asks for non-existent ones.</p>
