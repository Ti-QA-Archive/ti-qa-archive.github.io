<p>Hello gurus,</p>
<p>I could use some general advise. </p>
<p>I&#39;m gleefully developing an app that has a lot of news&#x2F;media-realted lists of content. A first content feed is loading great and I&#39;m able to generate a table of article listings (seen above). Cool!</p>
<p>The end goal is to cache content in a database for offline viewing (found great instructions to make that happen). I&#39;m a bit stuck on images however…</p>
<p>Currently table row images are loading remotely, with each row showing up one at a time when the image loads per row. Once deleting the view and coming back to it, the remote image loading process starts again. </p>
<p>I&#39;m thinking I should load all the images after the feed loads to external storage (or internal if not available), if the local images don&#39;t exist - then load internally. That would make the loading time a bit longer, but viewing time shorter correct? If doing so, I&#39;m guessing I would need to reference in a database so that when content gets deleted, the associated images get cleaned up as well…</p>
<p>Anyone else run into this challenge? What do you recommend?</p>
<p>Thanks for taking a look!</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Chris</p>

							<p>Use the XHR lib made by Raul, it has the possibility to cache the images (actually any http request) and delete them after a configurable TTL. </p>

										<p><p>This library helps me in SO MANY WAYS! I&#39;ll soon replace some of my existing terrible code with this as it is more flexible than what I came up with. I may cache a few images with it as well (a few less images than originally planned thanks to great advice from Malcolm).</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Image caching and in fact any caching should be well thought out and relative to the use case and level of connectivity of the device.  So thinking about it is a great start.</p>
<p>As you have identified it might be a good idea to cache the images locally.  But before you go down this road you should consider the age of the images.  By this I mean how often will the user look at this image.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once - If they are only only going to look once - then no caching required.</li>
<li>A few times - if these are spread apart in time then no caching required.</li>
<li>Lots of times - caching required.</li>
</ul>
<p>How many images are we talking, you may sacrifice speed with total size required.</p>
<p>Management - you are in charge and should employ either a FIFO (first-in-first-out) clean up or a least-used-first-out process.  This will depend on factors only you can decide - but keep file size as a consideration rather than numbers as you may find some images are noticeably larger than others.</p>
<p>Consider adding a date stamp to the db rows to show data entry added and date last accessed - useful if you have lots to manage things.</p>
<p>This is a good starting point for an image caching function.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;khopkins218&#x2F;TitaniumCachedImageView&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;cachedImageView.js">cachedImageView</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>Remember &quot;Lazy people do nothing - smart people may still end up doing nothing&quot;, the difference is determining if caching is the best solution for your app.  I would start by putting some logging in tot he app to determine repeating use of specific images, if this ends up being a number that requires triggering effort - then do something.  If it does not, then focus any effort somewhere else that can improve the app.</p>
<p>Lastly remember the OS of the device does handle image caching as best as it can, iOS is better than Android at this but both do it to varying degrees - you may not need to override this.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
