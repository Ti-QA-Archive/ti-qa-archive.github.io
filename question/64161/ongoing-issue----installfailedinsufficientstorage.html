			<h1>Ongoing issue . . . INSTALL_FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Ever since I updated to the latest Titanium SDK 1.4.1.1, I keep getting these insufficient storage errors. I only have the Kitchen Sink app on my Android Emulator and I have installed apps of 1mb - 30mb. No matter what the size, even 1mb, I get these errors while developing. This was supposedly fixed a couple of sdk&#39;s ago.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if this is an Android issue or a Titanium issue, but nonetheless, it is an issue.</p>
<p>The only solution I have found is to go into settings uninstall the most recent app and then reinstall it again via Titanium Developer. These is a very inefficient use of time and very frustrating to have to uninstall every time I want to test a single change in the app.js.</p>
<p>This happens every time I update an app unless I do the aforementioned.</p>
<p>On another note, I noticed that when the apps are being updated by relaunching from Titanium Developer after an update, the size of the app &quot;almost&quot; doubles even if only one word changes in the app.js file. I say &quot;almost&quot; because I noticed that its usually closer to 80-90% larger than the original file size.</p>
<p>Shouldn&#39;t it be &quot;replacing&quot; the app and not &quot;adding&quot; to it at the very least? Ideally, it would look for differences between the new app and the original and only update what has changed. Just my two cents.</p>

							<p>How I finally solved this thing is by increasing the internal storage of the emulator. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2013&#x2F;04&#x2F;quick-tip-increase-the-storage-size-of-your-android-emulator.html&#x2F;comment-page-1#comment-184455">Here</a> is an article about how to do that. I have to mention that at first it didn&#39;t work only with the instructions from the article. What worked for me was opening the AVD Manager, selecting the android virtual device I was having problems with, Edit, then going to Harware,New, selecting Property Ideal size of data partition. Then adding 512MB (very important 512MB not 512) to its value.Edit AVD and launch the app on this emulator again. The internal storage of the emulator should be now 512MB.</p>

							<p>1.4.1.1 was an iPhone only release, it has none of the fixes and features since 1.4.0 for Android. Have you checked the settings area for the amount of free memory on the emulator? </p>

										<p><p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>I am getting an Out of Memory error when i load my app, I researched a bit, and found this to increase the internal storage memory - </p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;2239330&#x2F;how-to-increase-storage-for-android-emulator-install-failed-insufficient-stora</p>
<p>But Titanium doesnt have the &quot;additional emulator command line options&quot; in the Debug or Run configurations. I think you might have to do it using the AVD Manager (which is how I increased the SD Card storage).</p>
<p>Hope this helps. If I find a way to do it in Titanium, I will repost it here.</p>

							<p>Go to your android SDK location folder and go into folder &quot;tools&quot; type android avd to launch android virtual devices manager, then locate the emulator wich has the same name than the one you use when you have the error.<br>Delete it and close avd.</p>
<p>Clean then rebuild projet. You should be good now.</p>
