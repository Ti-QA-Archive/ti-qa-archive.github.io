			<h1>Load bitmap error</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a scrollableview where i load some imageview.<br>When a scrollend event is called i try to load next image (with the previous one and next one) but i still have all the previous image loaded like that when you scroll back image was already loaded.<br>No problem for made that but when my image was to big i get an &#39;Unable to load bitmap. Not enough memory: null =&gt; java.lang.OutOfMemoryError&#39; no problem with that, thats normal when you tried to keep big images in same time to have that kind of error.</p>
<p>Now my question, how (or&#x2F;and where) can i catch the error OutOfMemoryError (i tried at the creation of imageview without success…)? Like that i can release some images from the memory and then reload the new one in the catch. </p>
<p>Why i want to made that? Cause my image didn&#39;t have all the same size and all scrollable view willn&#39;t have the same number of image so when i have a lot of &#39;small&#39; image that was more usefull to have all images load for navigation of course :).</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your answer.</p>

										<p><p>My explanation was probably bad (the first was cool but didn&#39;t manage that kind of error when you tried to load 3 big image you will have the same problem has mine). Actually i know that i will have in certain case the error of OutOfMemoryError. My question is how to determine if i will have a lot of space&#x2F;ram&#x2F;memory for load an other image or if that was not possible to know it how to catch the error for made what we need in that case.</p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t know how to catch this error but…</p>
<p><strong>You should avoid this issue:</strong><br>How huge are this images ?<br>Can you scale the images to an appropriate size by the server which provides the images ?<br>Did you test on emulator? Maybe you defined your emulator device with too low RAM</p>

										<p><p>I am testing in a device. And the image is in HD resolution. But i know how to resize and how to limite the number of image load in same time but that was not the goal, the goal is to be the more smooth navigation as possible with the max image load that i can and without the catch of this error or the means how to know the memory available for load an other one that can&#39;t be possible :s. Thanks for your help</p>

										<p><p>Something like 1700*1000 but i can get the exact average in the application directly if you have an idea for calculate the number of image that can load in same time :)</p>
