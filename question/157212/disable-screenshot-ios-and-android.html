			<h1>Disable Screenshot IOS and Android</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>All,</p>
<p>Is there a way to disable the screenshot function found in the later rev. of android and then later in IOS ? Or is there a way to trigger something else when the phone takes  a screen shot? I have an app that uses proprietary data from a server that can not be distributed. While I understand that someone can take a photo with another phone or a camera but I want to make sure that I am taking necessary steps to assist in the protection of the information. </p>
<p>Thanks<br>John</p>

							<p>If I was on android and writing in native, I would reference <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;reference&#x2F;android&#x2F;view&#x2F;WindowManager.LayoutParams.html#FLAG_SECURE">FLAG_SECURE</a>. This is NOT extended by default in the Titanium SDK, but you could, in theory, roll your own SDK and hack in the support.</p>

										<p><p>Now regarding iOS, great news! Ok, not really.  The one hack that could be used by developers to detect when a screen capture was taking place has been &#39;fixed&#39; in iOS 7.  There is talk of a new notification that you could listen for, but haven&#39;t done any research on it.</p>

										<p><p>I would love to be able to hack my own SDK but alas I have neither the time nor the desire to start from scratch with my own SDK :)…. I like titanium because of the value it adds and the time that it decreases for dev work. Can this be done in Titanium or potentially with a watermark or something that triggers on the screenshot event ? </p>
<p>Thanks<br>John</p>

							<p>When I see some apps, like those for banks, in the task manager on iOS 7, their thumbnails are blurred. I figure this means there is a way to flag an app as encrypted or secure in some manner for the developer. Unfortunately, that does not translate to taking screenshots - which I was able to do with no blurring.</p>

										<p><p>Daniel,</p>
<p>Thanks what I am talking about. What I am looking to do is detect the power button and the volume down button together (Taking a snapshot of the screen in Android &#x2F; Not sure how its done in IOS) and triggering a label to pop up on the screen so that anyone who saw the image later would know that it was stolen &#x2F; misappropriated. </p>
<p>Any ideas ??<br>John</p>

										<p><p>The method for taking a screenshot on iOS is similiar (holding home and tapping power).  I&#39;m not familiar enough with Android to know if the screenshot action can be captured as an event, but there does not seem to be a way on iOS that I can find.</p>
