			<h1>How to use FQL</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Is FQL an option for obtaining information from Facebook? I am sorting my friends that have an education value including a certain college. I was able to get the data with the FQL explorer, but couldn&#39;t get the JSON to parse with Titanium.</p>
<p>I tried many different methods including Facebook.request and even with the requestwithGraphPath using FQL. </p>
<p>I guess my question is, is it possible to use FQL with Titanium nowadays? I have Graph working fine, so right now I am just trying to manipulate the arrays in order to get my solution. It would be nice to use the simple FQL statement though.</p>

<p>maybe some sample code….</p>

<p>I have an idea..</p>
<p>Missing from your question are a number of important pieces of information. I suggest you take a look at the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Using+Questions+and+Answers">Using Questions and Answers</a> article, specifically the Q&amp;A Question Checklist.  The missing information is critical to reproducing problems in a test environment and often indicates other factors that cause the undesirable outcome you are experiencing.</p>

							<div><p>Since I have been trying to figure it out, I&#39;ll try and reproduce what I was working with. I realized my question was very vague, so hopefully this will clear out some details.</p>
<p>My code was:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var query = "<span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">name</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">user</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">WHERE</span> uid <span class="hljs-keyword">IN</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> uid1 <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> friend <span class="hljs-keyword">WHERE</span> uid2=<span class="hljs-string">" + Titanium.Facebook.uid + "</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">AND</span> <span class="hljs-string">'The University of Alabama'</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">IN</span> education<span class="hljs-string">";</span></span>
</code></pre><p>At this point, I&#39;m not sure what to do about the single quotes in the variable. I used escape characters at one point and nothing worked still.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-type">Titanium</span>.<span class="hljs-type">Facebook</span>.request('fql.query',{queries: query},function(e){
    <span class="hljs-type">Ti</span>.<span class="hljs-type">API</span>.debug(<span class="hljs-type">JSON</span>.parse(e.<span class="hljs-literal">result</span>));
});
</code></pre><p>I was never able to get anything to show up from the JSON parse..</p>
