							<p>I have also been trying to figure out this problem to put FB social plugins into the app.  The route I went with is logging in via the Appcelerator&#39;s Facebook API and then for some pages that I want these social plugins I am going with a webview. </p>
<p>Currently there has to be a double login situation.  They have to login via the app and then in the webview if they want to post to the social plugins such as likes or comments.  Yeah i know this sucks.  But havent figured a way around it.</p>
<p>I think i have narrowed down where the problem is.  The webview has it&#39;s own local cookie jar that is holding the FB session.  If somehow you can take the authToken and place a cookie down that it recognizes then the social plugins would be logged in with that current user.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m working on the same thing at the moment but have been running into some problems. I&#39;ve read that it&#39;s possibly to attach an access_token to an HTTP POST request and send it to a Graph URL, like &#39;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;graph.facebook.com&#x2F;PAGE_ID&#x2F;likes&#39;– and that should work. But so far I haven&#39;t had much luck. It&#39;s certainly possibly to embed a WebView into one of your app&#39;s views and use a standard IFRAME or FBML implementation of the the Like the button (the kind you see all everywhere). But I&#39;d prefer to avoid a WebView.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m in the same situation. I have already integrated Facebook in the app so users can post to their wall, therefore they will already be logged in. But using the Like button social plugin in a webview doesn&#39;t integrate with the facebook session in the app so the user has to login again. I&#39;m probably going to try and do it via the graph API in the new Facebook module.</p>

<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> graph = Titanium.Facebook.requestWithGraphPath({
        path:<span class="hljs-string">'me/likes.php'</span>, 
        <span class="hljs-comment">//params : 'no params for this in graph',</span>
        httpMethod:<span class="hljs-string">'GET'</span>,
        callback : <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">response</span>) // <span class="hljs-title">callback</span>
        </span>{
            alert(response);
        }
    });
</code></pre><p>But this doesn&#39;t work…</p>
