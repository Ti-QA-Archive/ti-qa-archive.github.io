			<p>Hi, in my app the user can request details of a given place.  Each request currently leads to an HTTP request and json response.  To improve performance I&#39;m considering storing the request&#x2F;response pair locally as a sort of cache.  I can use the Preferences API, filesystem or DB.  The Preferences seem to be the most simple - are there any factors that would make you consider the other options?</p>

							<p>I built this and figured I would share with others.  As Doug said a DB might be better in most cases but so far this has seemed very helpful in my app.</p>

							<p>Factors that would make me consider a database:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance.  A properly indexed database can search very fast.</li>
<li>Scalability.  Database performance can handle large volumes easily.</li>
<li>Cache TTL.  With a database, it is easier to add a field to calculate an expiration timestamp based on some Time To Live criteria.  While you could also put a TTL&#x2F;expiration in a json response, with a database you can remove all expired entries easily with a single SQL DELETE statement.</li>
<li>Prepopulate.  It would be easier to either install or download a set of common&#x2F;default places.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are just some reasons off the top of my head.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, they all seem very logical to me. One question re: Performance - using the Preference API I assume the lookup of a value based on a key (e.g. Ti.App.Preferences.getString(key)) is pretty fast as well?</p>

										<p><p>I assume so, at least while the volume of pairs is reasonable.  I don&#39;t know how they implement it.  Perhaps it is a database that already is indexed by the key name.  If so, it may have similar performance and scalability.  However, being a database type of guy, I&#39;d still roll my own so I could more easily control things like TTL, purging entries which are &quot;old&quot;, or whatever.</p>
<p>But that&#39;s just me.</p>
