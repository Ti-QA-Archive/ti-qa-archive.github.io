							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Lanica are soon to be releasing a gaming engine which has the potential to be amazing.<br>click <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lanica.co&#x2F;about&#x2F;platino&#x2F;">HERE</a>  for their website.</p>
<p>i have used the appcelerator box2d module and found it to have bugs as far as memory management is concerned.</p>

							<p>You can definitely develop a Box2D game with Titanium.  Checkout Matt&#39;s <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator-titans&#x2F;TiBall">TiBall example</a></p>

										<p><p>You can indeed create games with it however the problem i found was when you destroy box 2d objects they are not removed from memory.</p>
<p>I  had a conversation with someone from the appcelerator market place and they confirmed this issue and stated that it was to be added into future versions.</p>
<p>The appcelerator Box2d module has yet to be updated. </p>
<p>So if you created a game with lots of interactivity then you would almost certainly run into memory issues.</p>

										<p><p>I have created a game with the Box2D module without issues, such as an angry birds clone.  You just have to make sure that you destroy the world and re-create it in a timely manner.  By attaching the world to a view, it&#39;s real easy to remove it from a window and re-add it.</p>

							<p>I developed a game with titanium… I was on the platino beta team and was trying out some of the new features and they were pretty awesome!! I later downgraded this project to tiquickgame2d when beta was over but I stripped out the parts that were platino specific and I could still get it to run in either tiquickgame or platino.. I had the platino version tricked out lol</p>
<p>Give me some STARS!!!</p>

										<p><p>Checked it out and downloaded code to play around with it. Nicely done. What is the future for tiquickgame2d with the acquisition by Platino?</p>

										<p><p>I think quicktime is going to go from unsupported to obsolute eventually… Platino has some real sharp features and they just did a drop in price…The problem is there needs to be more in depth examples that people can just pickup and run with.</p>
