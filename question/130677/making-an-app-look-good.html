			<p>This isn&#39;t really a Titanium specific question but I thought the community may be able to help.  I have an app that is 80% or so complete functionally.  I haven&#39;t done much in terms of styling.  I was wondering what resources you use to help make the app look good?  I need to create a number of icons, buttons, and style some text.  I&#39;m willing to spend a few bucks on getting this done as well.  Any thoughts&#x2F;experiences?</p>

							<p>I usually just design all of my GUI elements from scratch with the Adobe package.</p>
<p>In terms of sparking my creativity, I like browsing through <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.deviantart.com">DeviantArt</a> for general graphic design inspiration.  Also, find a few apps in the Android Market and Apple App Store that you really like the gui of and try re-designing the elements you like from those for your app.</p>
<p>My strategy is that if I want complete customization of various elements, such as buttons, use custom images.  If you want a button to look completely different than a normal coded button, then design an image.  It really just depends on how much customization you want&#x2F;need your app to have.  However, keep in mind to not go overboard…less is usually more in the case of gui design.  I usually only use images as backgrounds for windows or views, or imageViews.  Rarely will I use an image for a button…there&#39;s a reason buttons should be simple and look like buttons.</p>
<p>You can style text in various ways, either directly within the label element, by adding custom fonts to your app (see the KitchenSink example), or by simply designing your font on the computer and saving it as an image file.</p>
<p>There <em>are</em> some websites that help in providing some of the more specific elements, such as icons.  I am a big fan of <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;glyphish.com&#x2F;">Glyphish icons</a>.  If I&#39;m needing to implement&#x2F;design with a cool font, I head over to <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dafont.com">DaFont.com</a>.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>

										<p><p>Great help, I guess my issue is that I&#39;m just not good visually with this stuff.  I will look into the resources you posted, but am also curious if anyone has ever sent the &quot;raw&quot; images of their screens to someone to then have them design the backgrounds, icons, buttons, etc.</p>

										<p><p>Sure!  That&#39;s usually what it&#39;s like in the industry…there are programmers&#x2F;developers, graphic designers, project managers, program architects, UI designers, etc.  Usually a single person does not fill all of those roles, unless it is a smaller or lower-budgeted project.  With Titanium, more and more people are finding that they are able to create apps without having to specialize in all roles.  Like myself, I am more of a web&#x2F;graphic designer than app developer, but with Titanium, I am able to create convincing apps due to my familiarity with Javascript and background in HTML.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure you could post some raw screenshots of your app and have someone else design the backgrounds, icons, buttons, etc., but others will probably want compensated for their time.  Probably no harm in posting some and seeing if anyone bites the bait.  However, I would caution you to not do business through this Q&amp;A forum and post work-for-hire requests.  If someone acknowledges that they are interested in helping you out, try and continue your correspondence outside of this forum.</p>
