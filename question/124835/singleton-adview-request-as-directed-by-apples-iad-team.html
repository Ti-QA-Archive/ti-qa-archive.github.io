			<h1>Singleton adview request as directed by Apple&#39;s iAd team</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a tabbed based app in the app store using iAds, and today received an email from the iAd team requesting a &quot;singleton&quot; adview.<br>Right now it&#39;s a standard tab based app, and I include a file that includes iAds that fail over to admob in each window in the app, so a new ad is loaded each time a new window gets focus.<br>Here&#39;s a link to the free app in the app store:<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nm1.in&#x2F;tahd</p>
<p>Here are the contents of the email:<br>I am a member of the iAd Publisher Partnerships team and we have noticed a recent decrease in CTR for your App, Selena Gomez Artist Alerts. We have included some suggestions for key optimizations that you can make to your integration that will increase overall CTR. With a strong CTR, eCPM and overall revenue will increase. Here are our suggestions:</p>
<p>Use a shared ad view across all pages: Currently, you are calling for a new ad when a user navigates between the different screens within the App. This type of implementation causes the user to see individual ads for only few seconds as they navigate; which is not allowing enough time for clicks. This in turn decreases the CTR. With the implementation of the singleton, the same Ads will remain on the screen while a user navigates throughout the App, increasing visibility and thus increasing CTR.</p>

We would be more than willing to help you test any changes.</h2>
<p>So, how do I make my adview not update as each window changes in the app?</p>

							<p>There are a couple ways, you could use a singleton approach in your tab-based app. One way is simply by using an extra &quot;wrapper&quot; or container window whic will house both the AdView and your TabGroup. I made a small sample using that approach here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;1175312">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;1175312</a>.</p>
<p>Good thing about this approach is the fact the AdView itself doesn&#39;t slide, redraw or flicker at all while the user is moving between tabs and windows.</p>
<p>Potential downside is the fact the NavBar is not on top of the screen anymore but positioned so the AdView is displayed on top of it. This might or not be okay in your case. If you&#39;d want to have the NavBar on top, you would probably need to implement your custom navigation layer on top of a clever use of NavigationGroup or something similar.</p>
