			<h1>Secure data transfer between server and app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi guys,<br>I&#39;m developing an app with the classical &quot;remote data loading&quot; (from a server).<br>I was thinking about a way to make sure that data can&#39;t be read clearly during the transmission (I mean an encryption method).<br>The app need an user account to be used and this the idea that I would like to realize:</p>
<p>When the user sign in the app passes to the server the device id of the user&#39;s smartphone (that is secret) and the server passes to the app an identification code (that is public) .<br>The server creates a new account with the relation public-code &#x2F; secret-code.<br>Well… since the secret code (the device code) is passed just once time (during the registration) nobody won&#39;t be able to know it anymore.<br>So everytime the app needs data it passes to the server the request with the user identification code (that is public) and the server returns encrypted data (encryption on the basis of secret code) .</p>
<p>In this way nobody who is listening on the conversation between the app and the server could be able to understand what the server is telling to the app (that is confidential).</p>
<p>The question is: &quot;How can I do the  decryption of the server response on the basis of the secret code?</p>
<p>Is there any Titanium tool ?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance,</p>
<p>Luca</p>

							<p>If you only need encryption during transmission to prevent man-in-the-middle snooping, then why not just use an https connection ?</p>

							<p>You could try the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;1882?1549553552">Crypto module</a>: I haven&#39;t tried it yet though, I contacted sales 20 days ago for a trial and still waiting for an answer. But from the documentation it looks like it does what you need.</p>
<p>Alternatively I used another module similar to the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;5881?1880556650">Encrypted Database module</a>, to store whatever kind of data you need in a database. Encryption&#x2F;Decryption looks relatively fast, but I would discourage to use this for large data.</p>
