							<p>Hy, Roger, Thanks for your Query, This problem has occurred to me and many others, and there are different solutions to resolve this problem. Please try to perform these solutions below, one of them should work for you.</p>
<ol>
<li>Try Project &gt; Clean to clean you project build, and then try again. </li>
<li><ul>
<li>Go to Window &gt; Preferences &gt; General &gt; Editors &gt; File Associations</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Select the &quot;*.js&quot; file extension on the file types window and &quot;JavaScript Source Editor&quot; in the Associated editors window. Set it as the default editor.</li>
<li>Close the js files that were already open and reopen again.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><p>Try going to Titanium Studio preferences, typing the words &quot;assist&quot; and &quot;complet&quot; (short for &quot;code assist&quot; and &quot;code completion&quot;) into the filter at the top, and going through each config screen in the results and clicking on &quot;Restore Defaults&quot; and &quot;Apply&quot;. Then restart Titanium Studio.</p>
</li>
<li><p>create a new, blank, project, and copy into its resources folder the code from the resource folder of an existing project that does not work. Again, you may need to restart TiStudio.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope you find your solution. thanks.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your answer, I have tried most of these before it seems to be on and off parts work and parts don&#39;t, is there a big difference between the Studio and the Aptana plugin, do you know and does it have the same problems ?</p>
