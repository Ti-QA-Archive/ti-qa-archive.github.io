			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am not an app-builder, but a Persian language instructor. I came up with an idea to make an app for a game in the Persian language since I could not find one to refer to my students. The idea for my app is like one of those &#39;did you see it&#39; memory games, where basically you look at a picture for 20 seconds, and then are asked a few questions about what you saw in Persian. I know that there is a big and rich community out there who would love something like this. But i have NO IDEA what i&#39;m doing. Can someone out there help, or do i need to pay big bucks to get this outsourced? I&#39;ll gladly bring someone experienced on board.</p>
<p>Thanks a million,<br>Farrah</p>

							<p>I&#39;m afraid you will have to hire a real developer if you want anything done. </p>
<p>While Titanium has a very large and vibrant community, we still are in the business of making mobile applications. I chose the term <strong>business</strong> carefully to make sure you understand that making an application requires an investment (Whether it&#39;s time or money; you usually need both) If you don&#39;t commit to an app, you will be left with the people&#39;s good-will and the <strong>hope</strong> they will take you a little further up the hill. But from experience, you will have a hard time finding someone that will take you all the way to your goal without expecting something in return. Same would go for a carpenter, electrician or any other contractor</p>
<p>####Just try to apply your question to something else than a mobile application shall we?</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">I have <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> very exciting idea <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> building <span class="hljs-operator">and</span> I would like <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> know <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> there are <span class="hljs-keyword">any</span> construction workers out there that could build <span class="hljs-keyword">it</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> me.

</code></pre><p>Hum, now that is something you would <strong>never</strong> see in the wanted ads. I guess you see get point.</p>
<p>That being said, the community is more than happy to help out fellow developers who are faced with a technical problem. And you can count us to be there to help if you have any issue getting your application to work.</p>

										<p><p>You can check out the DevLink page:</p>
<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;devlink">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;devlink</a> </p>
<p>And look for a developer in your region. As for hiring someone that is good, ask them to show applications they have done in the past. It might help you get a better appreciation for the quality of their work.</p>

							<p>thank you for your responses. it makes sense that i would need to hire someone to build this app, as it is a service indeed. How will I know to find a good developer?</p>
