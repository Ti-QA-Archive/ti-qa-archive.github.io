			<h1>Running Bluetooth LE Application in Background - iOS</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m using Titanium to build a Bluetooth LE application for iOS however because Titanium doesn&#39;t support BTLE functions I&#39;ve created an xcode module. Therefor any solutions via xcode or Titanium would work.</p>
<p>The Main problem I&#39;m having is that I want my phone to be updated with the data from the Bluetooth device at a certain interval. Even when the app gets minimized to the background. I&#39;ve been using <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;ios&#x2F;#DOCUMENTATION&#x2F;iPhone&#x2F;Conceptual&#x2F;iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide&#x2F;ManagingYourApplicationsFlow&#x2F;ManagingYourApplicationsFlow.html">This iOS Reference</a> to understand the different app states. Now, as I understand it, when you add the UIBackgroundModes key to your info.plist file and specify bluetooth-central within that array the app will remain able to execute certain Bluetooth commands.</p>
<p>The problem I&#39;m having is that, when the app goes into the paused state, I set a timer at a user defined interval where the app will then execute Bluetooth code which will connect to a device, get the data, etc. After the 10 minute cutoff mark however, the app gets suspended if no Bluetooth device has been connected to. I&#39;ve found the in order for the app to remain active in the background a device must be connected to every 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Is there anyway around this problem?? I&#39;ve been searching all over the web to try and find a solution but have turned up nothing.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly, greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<div><p>Hi Chris.  I am developing an app with a similar communications mechanism but I am only communicating once per day.  Have you found a way around the 10 minute limitation?  Will you make your Bluetooth module available to other developers via a Titanium plug-in?  I would be very interested in buying it …</p>

							<div><p>Robert,<br>Unfortunately the app I&#39;m developing is for a company instead of my own personal project. The company doesn&#39;t want the module distributed until their product goes on sale.</p>
<p>As for the 10 minute problem I was facing, I actually tricked the app into staying open longer by setting a timer that will run right before the 10 minute mark. The timer executes code to get the location of the device. This in tern keeps the application open in the background. However this may result in a large battery drain so I&#39;m still on the lookout for other alternatives.</p>
<p>I hope this helps and I will make sure to let you know when the module will be up for sale.</p>
