			<h1>Sharing Projects Between Two Different Computers</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>So this is more for some advice than anything.</p>
<p>My current developer setup (iOS and Android) is running on my iMac, but i&#39;m frequently out and about or away from my desk for long periods and I have a few projects on my MacBook Air too.</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to find the best way of keeping the two in sync, so if i&#39;m at home I can develop on the iMac and whilst I&#39;m on the road I can carry on developing on my MacBook Air.</p>
<p>I did consider using Dropbox as a repository for the source code, but wasn&#39;t sure if that was the best solution.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any experience of running two Macs under the same dev profile and switching between projects?</p>
<p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Simon</p>

							<p>Get yourself a real source repository. While Dropbox may work for a while, it can become tricky if there are ever any conflicts (trust me on this one). Also, you will benefit from many other features generally associated to using a source repository like version control, tagging, change requests, and many more.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can take a private account on <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com</a> (about 5$ a month)</li>
<li>Or you can also use <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitbucket.org">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitbucket.org</a> which also offers private repositories but completely free.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;d thought about GitHub as well. Can Titanium Studio be configured to push changes etc up to either of those services?</p>

										<p><p>Yes they can.</p>
<p>You can even set you GitHub credentials directly from the <strong>Preferences</strong> window.</p>
<p>Simply go to the <code>Studio</code> -&gt; <code>Accounts</code> section.</p>

										<p><p>No, for this you will simply specify your repository using the Git plugin just you would if you were using your own in-house Git Server.</p>
