			<h1>titanium android sdk development</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>If you are working on Titanium framework for iOS, it gets pretty easy. You just have to open the Titanium xcode project. You can then modify Ti sdk sources and see the result&#x2F;debug directly on Kitchen Sink</p>
<p>Under android, i didnt find such a easy way. Right now for me it s kind of hard as i have to modify the sources, fully rebuild the sdk (between 2 and 5 min), install it, clean my test project, build again….</p>
<p>i was wondering if there was an easier way?<br>I have tried importing all the Ti sdk android projects, but i dont see how it could help me.</p>
<p>I would really appreciate any help on this as i am working a lot on the Ti sdk right now.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Once you have everything installed developing for Android is as simple and quick as iOS, I am not sure why you are having to re-build your code every time.</p>
<p>Once you have some test code you can just run by selecting the <strong>Android Emulator</strong> from the <strong>run</strong> menu.</p>
<p>The first time you run your app it will&#x2F;should perform a full-rebuild and if you have manually cleaned the project using the menu <strong>Project</strong> &gt; <strong>Clean</strong>, but all other times the app should simply take your new code into account and start from there.</p>
<p>Typical times for me are;</p>
<ul>
<li>Emulator open and start (from first run) around 2 mins - not Appcelerators fault</li>
<li>Second run, emulator still running - no need to close it - 10 - 20 seconds, longer if it is a VERY large app.</li>
</ul>
<p>I run a Mac Mini, OSX 10.8, i5 quad, 4Gb of RAM and all files over a network share to a drobo (not the fastest choice).</p>
<p>Please try and create a very basic project;</p>
<ul>
<li>In Ti Studio</li>
<li>File menu</li>
<li>New</li>
<li>Titanium Project</li>
<li>Choose &quot;Default Project&quot; - should be selected already</li>
<li>Next</li>
<li>Provide a project name (example; test1)</li>
<li>Leave default location unless you want to put it elsewhere</li>
<li>Enter a suitable App ID (yours)</li>
<li>Finish</li>
</ul>
<p>Choose the run Android Emulator from the toolbar, wait for the app to open - time this.</p>
<p>ONCE loaded, leave the emulator running and repeat the &quot;run Android Emulator from the toolbar&quot; process - this should be much faster.</p>

										<p><p>I am not talking about developing an app for android using Ti SDk.<br>I am talking about developing on the SDK itself. That s why you need to recompile everytime</p>

										<p><p>The reason I am confused is you asked about &quot;titanium android sdk development&quot;, leading me to believe you actually wanted to use the Titanium SDK rather than the Android SDK directly.</p>
<p>If you are looking for help with Titanium Studio and its related SDK then I and other will happily help, but this is not the right forum if you are hoping to use the Android SDK without Titanium.</p>
<p>Everything is easier if you use Titanium.</p>

										<p><p>No i am not talking about the android SDK, i am talking about Titanium SDK :D<br>But i am talking about working on the SDK itself :D<br>What i mean is implementing&#x2F;developing the Titanium SDK. Compiling it then testing it in Kitchen Sink.</p>
<p>Thats why i am taliking about the Titanium xcode proj in the Titanium sources.</p>
<p>If i could edit my question i would and be more precise. I MEAN working on titanium sources.</p>

										<p><p>Then I am afraid I am not your man - I have not had any experience playing with the SDK source, I have always been happy with the stock SDK.  </p>
<p>Have you taken a look at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Android_Module_Development_Guide">android module development</a>, this is often used to natively extend Titanium with enhancements not already available and you are happy to create yourself.</p>
<p>There are also lots of already created modules in the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;home">marketplace</a> and available with a quick <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=appcelerator+module">Google search</a>.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks i am already implementing a lot of modules. But developing the sdk itself is not the same thing. Especially in the build process</p>
