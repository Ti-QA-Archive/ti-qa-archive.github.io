			<h1>IOS File Encryption - Use of NLSFileManager?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Being new to app development:</p>
<p>We have an IOS&#x2F;Android application created in Titanium, in which we import our generated HTML content files (created via XSL from XML)  into, have our app.js created in Titanium and build .ipa file.  </p>
<p>We need to have the html files encrypted on the device to prevent someone plugging in and grabbing those html files, as their content is sensitive.  So, with that being said, one option I am looking into is the use of the &#39;NSFileManager&#39; class mentioned in the &#39;iPhoneAppProgrammingGuide.pdf&#39; under section for &#39;Protecting Data Using On-Disk Encryption&#39; which states if using the &#39;NSFileManager&#39; class to set some properties on the files, when passcode security is used, the files will be encrypted.  My question is, where and in what piece of code to I add that?  Is that something I create a script for to run against my html files??  Within the app.js??  Can I do this in Titanium or is this only for xCode?  I cannot seem to find any examples of how and where to do this.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve also talked about possibility of moving our html files to within the SQLite database and encrypting the database, not sure if that should be an option, worry over app performance of loading different html files using TOC menus and how fast they will load having to decrypt (and how from app.js to call to decrypt files anyway)?  Any suggestion or help greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Titanium:  3.0<br>iOS:  6.1</p>

							<p>You&#39;d have to create a custom module for this or modify the Objective-C code for iOS SDKs for appcelerator. If you&#39;re good with Objective-C then updating the code is easier than writing the module. You can find the obj-c code in &#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx&#x2F;[SDK_VER]&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;Classes&#x2F;</p>
<p>Be advised that you might break up something if you dont pay attention, so better backup the folder before modifying the files.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, I&#39;ll take a look at this.</p>
<p>For another option, would it be easier to just store our html files in the SQLite database and cipher that?  Can you easily serve up the html pages from there with decryption without hurting performance?</p>

										<p><p>Performance wise I think you&#39;d be better off with a custom module written in native Obj-C. I dont really see a way to encrypt&#x2F;decrypt files efficiently using Javascript.</p>
<p>Perhaps another option would be serving these files through a SSL conection off from a server? That way you display only what you need and no need to store this on a device.</p>
