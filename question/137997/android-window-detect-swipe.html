			<h1>Android window detect swipe</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure if this is even possible but I&#39;m trying to come up with a way for the window to detect a swipe event <em>regardless</em> of what else is loaded in the window. I&#39;ve been able to get it to work when it&#39;s just the window, but when I add a table into the window, it doesn&#39;t listen for the touch event.</p>
<p>If that&#39;s not possible then I&#39;d like to get a table view to identify the swipe event (I&#39;ve tried multiple times but I cannot seem to get it to work).</p>
<p>Please, any help (or examples) would be really great… I&#39;m stumped.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>If you can wait, swipe support for Android is lined up in JIRA as having been implemented now.  You could try a CI build to try it out ?</p>

										<p><p>Well I found a nice little touchstart and end function which emulates swipe on android but I cannot for the life of me work out how I can get the window to listen for that. Like as soon as a view is added to the window, it seems to go over the top of the windows listeners… If that makes sense?</p>
