			<h1>Geolocation with interval on iOS</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>I got two questions at the moment. I hope at least one of you could help me out a bit.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In order to request continuous gps location updates on Android, you need to create a custom LocationProvider with a LocationRule where you can set a time interval for requesting a gps location update. After that you have to instantiate a listener in order to receive the location updates. Would there be a difference in battery use (by the location service) when requesting a location every 15 seconds or every 5 seconds (as the location service remains active when a listener is defined)?</p>
</li>
<li><p>As you can read in me previous question, I&#39;d like to limit the number of gps location requests by time. How is this possible in iOS? Of course I can ignore events being triggered with every location update, as they come in about every second, but is there a more battery efficient way to do this? I believe that <code>Titanium.Geolocation.frequency</code> is meant for Android only (and the API says it&#39;s deprecated).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Ricky</p>

							<h3 id="question-1-">Question 1:</h3>
<p>Is there a difference between 15 seconds and 5 seconds for the interval? Not likely, given how short those durations are. </p>
<p>The GPS circuitry is off unless you add the listener. It then is powered up to a full-power state to fulfill the request – there&#39;s a minimum time it must stay fully powered to achieve a lock on the GPS&#x2F;network location provider and obtain usable location data. It will stay in that full power state for X amount of time (determined by the device&#39;s manufacturer. Once your location rule duration says the GPS circuitry can sleep, it goes to a mid-power state – it&#39;s quicker to reach full power from that state than from fully off. Eventually, the GPS circuitry fully powers down. Again, time in those stages is determined by the hardware maker.</p>
<p>From what I&#39;ve read on one phone, the GPS would take 2 seconds to transition from off to full power, stay in the full power state for a min. of 5 seconds. The time to lock on a location was not documented, but assume a couple of seconds. Then it would take 1 second to drop to mid-power, stay there for 12 seconds, then drop to off again. </p>
<p>Keep in mind, that&#39;s one sample device, which was profiled on Google&#39;s docs site. Devices vary greatly. It&#39;s likely with the short durations you&#39;re describing that most devices would be kept in a full power state nearly continuously. </p>
<p>Do you really need updates that frequently? How far are people going to move in 15 seconds? And will that location difference matter for your app? Could you add a feature for users to tune the frequency so that they could balance power usage? </p>
<p>These are all questions for you to consider when setting the interval. You should also do some research on device characteristics to see what typical power state durations are for the devices used by your users.</p>
<h3 id="question-2-">Question 2:</h3>
<p>You can use a function with <code>setTimeout()</code> to add&#x2F;remove the listener on iOS. I don&#39;t know what iPhone&#x2F;iPad power cycle durations are. There&#39;s a similar off&#x2F;full&#x2F;mid-power state on iOS devices too. Maybe that info is documented somewhere on Apple&#39;s site?</p>

										<p><p>Thank you for your reply Tim.</p>
<p>Let me tell you a bit what I&#39;m trying to develop. I&#39;m to trying to do some research to map the battery use with the location requests with Titanium apps (for school) and therefore I&#39;m building this app. You can set an interval and then run the function that will update the location by the interval filled in and it will log the location with a timestamp and the current battery level to a file. So the interval is in 1 test 5 seconds and in another 5 minutes (or even more). Think I will play with adding and removing a listener then. I hoped there was another way to accomplish my idea.</p>
