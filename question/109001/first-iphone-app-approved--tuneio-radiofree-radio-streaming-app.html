<p>This module worked well for us for adding admob on iphone.</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;masuidrive&#x2F;TiAdMob4iPhone</p>
<p>We also added iAd support (currently turned off)</p>

										<p><p>No it worked fine. You do however have to build it yourself from the supplied source code. This guide helped in understanding the building process.</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Module_Developers_Guide_iOS.pdf</p>
<p>Also I noticed that in admob admin the app showed it required updating. So you can fix this by downloading the most recent admob sdk and replacing the folders in the TiAdMob4iPhone code and then do your build of the module.</p>
<p>Worked perfectly.</p>

										<p><p>I also added iAd support so I can toggle from our server which is going to be served by default and as a fail over I switch to the other if an ad is not available from one of the networks.</p>
<p>Of course if you managed to get adwhirl to work in appcelerator you wouldn&#39;t need to do this.</p>

							<p>Hi Janet,</p>
<p>Have you had any success getting the Android streaming app working yet?  I have a client that is requesting an Android streaming app for their internet radio station and I know there have been some issues with Appcelerator and Android doing so.    Thanks.</p>
