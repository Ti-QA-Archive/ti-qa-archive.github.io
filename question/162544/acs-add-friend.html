			<h1>ACS Add Friend</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I don&#39;t really have any code to post as I&#39;m not exactly having a problem (I don&#39;t think, anyway). This is more of a question about functionality. </p>
<p>I have a login sequence set for ACS that uses a date stamp and only logs in if the default 6 months expiration has lapsed. So if the app starts and the user should still be logged in based on the day, I&#39;m not logging in again. So from a clean install, I&#39;ll login and then add a friend- no problem. But then if I rebuild the app, the app assumes I&#39;m still logged in and tries to add a user but receives an error: Failed to authenticate user. I thought the error was a bit vague but it definitely goes away if I login explicitly before adding a friend. </p>
<p>What am I missing? Is the 6 month session not good for all ACS activity? In the docs it states that to add a friend &#39;requires user login.&#39; Is it to be assumed that this does not include the 6 month session established at login?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for the help!</p>

										<p><p>Thank you, Wei! </p>
<p>That had briefly crossed my mind but there&#39;s barely a mention of it in the docs that I was in. I just assumed that a unique ID for the phone was sent and matched to a sessionid online. But storing and saving the session id was my problem. </p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>
