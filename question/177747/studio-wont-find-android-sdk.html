			<h1>Studio won&#39;t find Android SDK</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi- I&#39;m having all kinds of trouble (about 6 hours in now) with Ti and Android&#39;s SDK manager differing on which SDK&#39;s are installed. I try to get Ti to install the SDK&#39;s it think should be there, it does and tells me I&#39;m fine (from the Dashboard). I got to my project and no Android build options are present. I go back to Dashboard and I&#39;m not &quot;fine&quot; anymore and am missing SDK&#39;s. The Preferences &gt; Platform &gt; Android options similarly will tell me I&#39;ve pointed to a good directory and then tell me the next time I access the screen that it&#39;s no longer valid. </p>
<p>Android&#39;s SDK manager says I have the required SDK&#39;s installed. I&#39;m completely lost as to what&#39;s going on. I&#39;ve seen several QA sections about this but none fixed the issue. </p>
<p>Where is the mismatch here? Where is Android&#39;s SDK looking and where is Ti looking? Where is Ti installing the SDK&#39;s it downloads? </p>
<p>Titanium Studio Version: 3.3.0.201407100905<br>Latest Titanium SDK: 3.3.0.GA<br>Host OS: Mac OS X</p>

							<div><p>So I deleted Studio and re-installed. After some config, things started to fire up. I was excited. I worked until late last night, building, debugging, etc. I was going to come post my results here. </p>
<p>I literally left everything open after a successful build and went to bed. I came back this morning and went to build the app again and it it&#39;s back to telling me that the Android SDK&#39;s are found and then not again! I didn&#39;t even close the program! What on earth….!?</p>

							<p>Hello, Ben, The same problem happened to me and it&#39;s really irritating. The thing that solved for me is I downloaded and installed a fresh copy of the Ti SDK 3.3.0.GA again. To do that</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the SDK.</li>
<li>Go to your studio&#x2F;help&#x2F;install titanium sdk&#x2F;install from URL and there browse the sdk zip file path. </li>
</ul>
<p>Install the sdk and restart the studio. That worked for me. Hope it does for you. Thanks.</p>
