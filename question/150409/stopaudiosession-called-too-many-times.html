			<h1>stopAudioSession called too many times</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>This question has come up before, but I can&#39;t find any kind of answer to say what is actually causing it, or how many times is too many times for stopAudioSession on a AudioPlayer instance. The error comes from near the end of the Titanium TiMediaAudioSession.m class, but not being fully up to speed on Objective-C it&#39;s not something I can easily fathom.</p>
<p>I&#39;m using the Ti AudioPlayer in an iOS streaming radio app I built last year, and up until now has behaved very well. But now I&#39;m doing an upgrade using Studio 3 and 3.0.2GA (under Mac OSX Lion), I&#39;m getting this &#39;stopAudioSession called too many times&#39; error, which I&#39;d never previously seen.</p>
<p>As the error suggests, it happens when stopping and restarting a stream, and usually after a stream has failed to start the first time and an attempt to restart it has been made.</p>
<p>I have an &#39;anti-bounce&#39; timer set on a single play&#x2F;stop button (500ms) so I know &#39;stop&#39; is not being sent multiple times quickly in succession and I am doing <code>if(player.playing) player.stop()</code> too - all to try and get a well behaved player.</p>
<p>Has anybody else come across this problem, and if so what fixed it for you?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
