			<p>I&#39;m pretty new to Titanium but have done plenty of searching and come up with mix results as many answers are for outdated SDK&#39;s.</p>
<p>First up, Is there any way I can remotely serve html through Appcelerator and make use of device hardware? I realise Ti.App interacting with remote webviews is locked up for &#39;security reasons&#39;, but is there any way around this? We really need to have access to the device API&#39;s and need to deliver the pages as html, splitting the webapp to part local and part remote is not really an ideal solution. I&#39;ve tried replacing a local webviews html with a remote webviews innerHTML, and saving a remote file locally and loading that in a webview with no luck. Though other people seem to have luck here, is it because I&#39;m using SDK 1.7.1?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve even attempted to bind a function to remote dom elements on each page load that sets a variable to the Ti.App action required, then setting an interval in my app to check that variable with evalJS, resource intense, and again to little luck.</p>
<p>Is there ANY way remote webview communication can be achieved? HTTPClient or someting? Titanium is a great way to package webapps for multiple platforms, but it all starts seeming somewhat pointless if I can&#39;t take advantage of the device hardware. Considering Titanium also blocks access to html5 things like geolocation, it makes some things completely impossible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>My second question is in regards to evalJS causing crashes on Android, I&#39;ve read that it may be a bug, but no further info, any known workarounds? Is it only when trying to fire alerts? Seems very intermittent for me and being new to titanium I&#39;m often unsure if it&#39;s my scripting or a Titanium bug.</p>

							<p>A way would be to get the remote html code using the <strong>httpClient</strong> and set it&#39;s reply as <strong>html</strong> property of  webview. This way the webview will think it&#39;s local code and will allow you get over the security locks.<br>The drawback is that you will have to code your remote stuff to have access to all the resources -  like absolute path for images, etc.</p>

										<p><p>This sounds like a possibility, I just need to figure out how to set up and run a httpClient, although I forsee many issues with submitting any forms and changing links to submit to the remote site on-the-fly. Unless this is easier than I imagine?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>I am having some success with using a variable on the remote page that is set to any native action that needs to be performed (ie: vibrate), then setting an interval that uses evalJS to check the value of that variable and act accordingly. This is working on a remote website, but with intermittent yet constant force close crashes. It&#39;s either the interval is hogging too many resources, or crashing when initially setting the interval on pages?</p>

										<p><p>HttpClient it&#39;s easy to use. It&#39;s almost like a normal &quot;ajax&quot; request on the web<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;latest&#x2F;Titanium.Network.HTTPClient-object</p>
<p>Take a look at all KitcheSink to see how the API works. See all the xhr_* examples:</p>
