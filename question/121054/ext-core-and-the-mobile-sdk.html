			<p>My understand is that Titanium will get my JS code and compile it down to native code, right?<br> So if I use a framework like Sencha Ext Core to take advantage of the class structure it provides, will all of that be compiled to native code?<br> Using Ext Core on a mobile project will decrease the overall performance or JS code is all the same for Titanium?</p>
<p>Thx</p>

							<p>Most frameworks out there today require the DOM, Titanium does not have a DOM so they fail… there are several open source titanium frameworks that people have started on GitHub, Ext, jQuery and such will not work.</p>

							<p>Thanks!<br>I think I&#39;m learning my way here… I think I can kepp using Ext-Core or even ExtJs within the Desktop SDK and use Extanium (www.extanium.org) within the Mobile SDK.<br>This way I can keep coding in Ext-style in both worlds.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Aron,</p>
<p> Now that I got done my first desktop project (w&#x2F; Ext-core) I wold like to start my first mobile project and that will be nice if Extanium is still an option so I can keep going with ExtJs style.</p>
<p> But what is holding me back right now (besides laziness) is the fact that the latest version of Extanium, the 0.2.1, was realized back in June and I&#39;m woldering if that is because Extanium is kind of discontinued or is because it is already good enough and don&#39;t need too much updates. Is Extaium working with the latest 1.7.5 Ti Mobile SDK?</p>
<p> If so there is some sample app we can take a look at to get us started with Extanium?</p>
<p> Thank you.</p>
