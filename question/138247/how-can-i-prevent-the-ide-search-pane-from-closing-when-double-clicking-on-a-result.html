			<h1>How can I prevent the IDE search pane from closing when double-clicking on a result?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I think this is more of an Eclipse question, but here goes: I use find-in-files a lot to find occurrences of a text string across my project. When I single-click on a particular search result, it jumps to the file and line ONLY if that file hasn&#39;t yet been opened in a tab. If the file is already open, I have to double-click on the search result in order to jump to the specified file and line, but the double-click ends up closing the search pane, which is the incorrect behavior about 95% of the time. Generally, I want to investigate the context of the search result, and then continue looking at other search results.</p>
<p>This quirk of the search pane is rapidly melting my brain. Is there a setting I can change to prevent this behavior, or another way I can approach this?</p>
<p>I&#39;m using Titanium Studio 2.0.1.201204132053.</p>

							<p>When you double click on a search result and the Search View goes away, look for the search icon around the corners of the Studio window.  Next to the icon, you should see the &#39;double window&#39; icon that says &#39;Restore&#39; when you hover the mouse over it.  Click the restore button, and the search view will be shown again.  Now, try double clicking on a result.  The search view should stay where it is.  </p>
<p>When you are ready to close the search view, just click the x on the tab.  This will remove the view.  The next time you do a search, the view should be restored to this previous location.  From here on out, close the Search view with the X when you are finished using it.  </p>
<p>If you want to revert to the Search view minimizing each time you double click a result, look for the single horizontal bar icon on the right side of the search view.  Click that to minimize.  </p>
<p>If you have the search view in a pane with other views, like console or terminal, you can drag it to other panes or create a new one for it just by dragging and dropping the view&#39;s tab.</p>
