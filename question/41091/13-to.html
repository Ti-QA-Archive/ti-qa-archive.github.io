			<h1>1.3 to </h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>HAHA, Some how my title got cut off.. suppose to be &quot;1.3 to 1.3.2&quot;</p>
<p>I have a few issues and questions about this newly pushed out 1.3.2 sdk.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Why did you release it as 1.3.2 if it will inevitably be 1.4? Just doesn&#39;t make sense, the whole reason for versions is to tell the difference between them and now thats worthless (If you would want to fix 1.3 bugs and release an actual 1.3.2 or 1.3.3 how do you do that now? You are an open source project so someone could want branch 1.3 and now its impossible to know the difference between 1.4 stuff and actual 1.3).. release the RC of 1.4 as &quot;1.4 RC&quot; not &quot;1.3.2 (The 1.4 RC)&quot;.. silly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For some reason includes got messed up, now the relative location for iPhone and Android are different. For iPhone it always references from the &#39;Resources&#39; folder, where in Android I have to backtrack and get into the &#39;Resources&#39; folder.. in 1.3 this didn&#39;t happen.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Did you change the way you reference images for Android? We were happily loading a bunch of PNGs in 1.3 with no problems and it was super fast. Now, in &quot;1.3.2 (The 1.4 RC)&quot;, we are getting errors while it tries to load the NinePatch (*.9.png) files, which creates an inevitable OutOfMemory exception?? Do we need to now convert all of our PNGs to .9.png? Will this create a problem with the iPhone reference to the images?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Is there a change log for &quot;1.3.2 (The 1.4 RC)&quot;?</p>
</li>
<li><p>When will the actual &quot;1.4&quot; release be? The blog claimed that it would be approximately 2 weeks ago, but you must have ran into a couple issues. I understand that you are busy coding along, but it would be nice to know when a realistic and static release date is or even just an update of what is going on. For people who are nearing the end of development and want to verify their app will work with &quot;1.4&quot; and&#x2F;or don&#39;t want to release under &quot;1.3 (The 1.4 RC)&quot; (because that just seems like a no-no), it would be extremely nice to know what is going on.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Please do not take my post the wrong way, yes I am frustrated about a few things, but I am in no way trying to criticize you guys! Just joking around for the most part (the &quot;RC&quot; thing ;)). </p>
<p>If you would like any clarification or help in fixing these bugs, shoot me an email at armsteadj1@gmail.com.</p>
<p>Thanks!<br>James</p>

							<p>(#5) ditto. (Forum) Is this thing on? (tap)(tap). I noticed a high ranking member of the Titanium staff commented on a very recent post concerning the awesomeness of the premium membership (it probably rocks, i just can&#39;t afford the high fee). Wish he could give us an update on the status of the promised 1.4. </p>
<p>sincerely yours,<br>Ti.createFrustratedUser</p>

										<p><p>Yea, I am sure Premium membership rocks. As soon as our app rolls out and we make enough money to pay for one I am sure we will. The accelerator developers deserve it =)..</p>

										<p><p>i honestly can&#39;t afford to pay for &quot;premium access&quot; for bug fixes. so, i have to wait weeks while i get refunds and customer complaints, that i can&#39;t do anything about. it&#39;s also a catch 22 - i could pay for premium access if i could sell my app, but i can&#39;t sell my app because it&#39;s buggy because of this giant titanium 4.0 readiness fail. depressing.</p>

							<p>Please provide an example of what&#39;s changed in #2 are you saying that on iPhone all path references are now absolute wrt to Resouorces and Android uses Relative paths.</p>
<p> #3 We made changes to reduce the memory used for bitmaps which has solved the out of memory for others. Please provide an example of how it&#39;s failing. Also are you getting an actual error wrt to 9.png or simply file not found?</p>

							<p>&gt;<strong>Please provide an example of what&#39;s changed in #2 are you saying that on iPhone all path references are now absolute wrt to Resouorces and Android uses Relative paths.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, that is what it seems like to me. if I have the following structure:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"> /Resources
     /logic
        test<span class="hljs-class">.js</span>
     /logic2
        test2.js
</code></pre><p>and test.js does a &quot;Titanium.include(&#39;logic2&#x2F;test2.js&#39;)&quot; it will work on the iPhone but not in Android. If I do &quot;Titanium.include(&#39;..&#x2F;logic2&#x2F;test2.js&#39;)&quot; then it works on the Android and not iPhone. If I go back to 1.3 then &quot;Titanium.include(&#39;logic2&#x2F;test2.js&#39;)&quot; works for both.</p>
<p>&gt;<strong>#3 We made changes to reduce the memory used for bitmaps which has solved the out of memory for others. Please provide an example of how it&#39;s failing. Also are you getting an actual error wrt to 9.png or simply file not found?</strong></p>
<p>First thing to note is, We aren&#39;t using NinePatch PNGs. Just normal ones.<br>Second, It just gives me this error for every single &quot;PNG: path not found: file:&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;android_asset&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;images&#x2F;**.9.png&quot;<br>It almost seems like Android is automatically looking for these files, I know they are awesome and everyone should use them, but shouldn&#39;t there also be a way to turn them off? I am assuming the iOS doesn&#39;t use them, thus really making them irrelevant if you want to use the same UI for both iPhone and Android.</p>

										<p><p>The Android method is the correct one in that we&#39;re suppose to support relative paths. If you want absolute paths. Try &quot;&#x2F;logic2&#x2F;test2.js&quot; on both platforms.</p>
<p>iPhone knows nothing about nine patch images and if you only put them in your <code>android</code> folder, they&#39;ll only be bundled with android and not with iPhone. We are going to be making major changes in 1.5 with the handling of images on Android to allow multiple resolutions&#x2F;densities and transparent nine patch support. Currently, the only way to figure out if there are nine patch files that should be used on Android are to check when an image is loaded as a background. Those messages are harmless, but I&#39;ll look at changing them to debug.</p>

										<p><p>I actually tried using &#39;&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;…&#39; and it got converted into &#39;&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;Resoucres&#x2F;….&#39; in Android??</p>
<p>So the fact that my app runs perfectly fine in 1.3 but fails in 1.3.2 and the only difference from the Trace is the NinePatch errors doesn&#39;t throw a flag up that something is wrong and its not just the fact that its throwing an error?</p>
<p>Maybe there is a memory leak when loading files? It has to be leaving something open and not getting cleaned up when it goes out to try and find a NinePatch file for every image we have? </p>
<p>Wouldn&#39;t adding something like.. &quot;Titanium.UI.CheckForNinePatch = false&quot;, work instead? I understand that there isn&#39;t a way of knowing if a PNG has NinePatch files, but I know that before the app starts up. Heck, why not add one into the options for each control? I would GLADY add &#39;ninePatchExist: false&#39; into every place if my app worked.</p>
<p>Any how, has anyone from appcelerator tried to add a TON of non-NinePatch PNGs to an app and seen if it worked in 1.3.2?</p>
