										<p><p>Personally, I think disabling on-access antivirus scanning for the whole computer is not the best solution. Instead, you should exclude just the directories where scanning causes an issue. However, if this answer resolved your problem, Silas, then please mark it as &quot;best&quot; to close the thread and allow others to find it easily in future.</p>

							<p>I get exactly the same problem with a fresh install from yesterday on Windows 7.  I can make a simple app (window 1, window 2) but can&#39;t run the kitchen sink project, getting exactly the same error as Anthony.  My Ti version from the log is:</p>
<p>Titanium SDK version: 1.5.0 (12&#x2F;13&#x2F;10 21:20 efb9caa)</p>
<p>Hope that helps, I have used the iPhone version of Titanium with great success and looking forward to Android but I know how important the Kitchen Sink is to aiding development.</p>

							<p>The KS wouldn&#39;t work for me either with the 1.5.0 SDK. Installing 1.5.X fixed it.</p>
<p>Would you install and try 1.5.X (master) <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;index.html">continuous build</a>?</p>
<p>Hope this fixes it for you too.</p>

<p>I just noticed that you are using Android SDK 2.3.  If this is true, then note that it&#39;s not supported. Version 2.2 is what I use.</p>

<p>OK, let&#39;s try this again. :)</p>
<p>Are you actually using a database in your application? </p>
<p>Is your system configured to use <strong>by default</strong> 32bit Sun JDK 1.6 revision 10 or above? (not 64bit, not version 1.7). run <code>java</code> and <code>javac</code> at the command line to find this information.</p>
<p>Is your system configured to run python 2.6 (not another version)?</p>
<p>Do you have Titanium Developer 1.2.2 installed?</p>
<p>Titanium 1.5.X from the continuous builds website should work, but you can always try 1.4.X, which is very stable and so useful in finding the &quot;baseline&quot; of what should work.</p>
<p>Close all emulators.</p>
<p>Close Titanium Developer. Rename the directory in your system&#39;s user dir named something like <code>.titanium</code>. This is where TiDev stores all its settings for the projects you have created (it also stores some data in some sqlite databases). Note, if the approach I am explaining does not work for you, you can always rename the directory back later to recover all your settings. If you can&#39;t find the directory, search your user profile for the file <code>application.properties</code>, which is inside it.</p>
<p>Delete the android directory in your user profile. On my system this is named <code>.android</code>. Inside it, there is a directory named <code>avd</code>.</p>
<p>Delete the android directory in your system&#39;s temporary directory. On my system this is <code>&amp;#x2F;tmp&amp;#x2F;android</code>.</p>
<p>Delete the adb.log file in your system&#39;s temporary directory. On my system this is &#x2F;tmp&#x2F;adb.log.</p>
<p>In your project directory, delete everything in the following directories:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable">$PROJECT</span>/build/android/&lt;subdir&gt;/*
</code></pre><p>Hence, anything inside subdirectories assets, bin, gen, lib, res and src.</p>
<p>Now launch Titanium. You will need to reconfigure it, as you deleted the titanium directory. Ensure that the path to the android SDK is configured correctly, On my system it is <code>&amp;#x2F;opt&amp;#x2F;android-sdk</code>. This directory contains the <code>tools</code> directory which holds the <code>adb</code> or <code>adb.exe</code> executable.</p>
<p>In &quot;Test &amp; Package&quot; &#x2F; &quot;Run Emulator&quot; Android SDK &quot;APIs 2.2&quot; should be selected, as version 2.3 is not supported at this time. Note this is &quot;APIs 2.2&quot; not &quot;2.2&quot;.</p>
<p>Launch the app.  Give it 3 attempts.</p>
<p>If an emulator does not boot successfully, from the command line run the command <code>android</code>. Select the &quot;Virtual Devices&quot; category on the left, which should show you a list of AVDs. There should be at least one with a name that starts with <code>titanium_7_</code>. Boot this manually using the &quot;Start…&quot; button on the right.  Does it boot?</p>
<p>When an emulator has booted, try launching the app again.</p>
<p>If you provide all the information requested here, and it still doesn&#39;t work, I will try to think of some other suggestions.  :)</p>

							<p><strong>Are you actually using a database in your application?</strong><br>I am trying to load the KitchenSink application. Running the hello world app works fine.</p>

<p>I followed your instructions.<br>I am using Windows and the options selected were:</p>

<p>Same error occurred.</p>
<p><strong>Select the &quot;Virtual Devices&quot; category on the left, which should show you a list of AVDs. There should be at least one with a name that starts with titanium<em>7</em>. Boot this manually using the &quot;Start…&quot; button on the right.</strong></p>
<p>I can&#39;t locate &quot;Virtual devices&quot; - where is that located?</p>

<p>It&#39;s important which JDK version is running by default. Please confirm this.</p>
<p>When you run the android executable, you will see your &quot;Virtual Devices&quot; as follows:</p>

							<p>My situation has gone from bad to hopeless.</p>
<p>I tried Hal&#39;s suggestions (most of them, since I was never able to find anything called .titanium or application.properties in my user profile.</p>
<p>Uninstalled everything.  Removed all the old emulators.  Removed all the contents of the build&#x2F;android directories.  Removed every trace of the android SDK and Titanium that I could find.  Reinstalled everything.  </p>
<p>Titanium still shows my old projects, but all of them get the same compiler error.   It doesn&#39;t matter what TI SDK, or Android emulator I use.</p>
<p>I even installed the new (unsupported) google API&#39;s … ran into the problem of adb.exe&#39;s location that is documented elsewhere.  I tried the &quot;fix&quot; that everybody says works - it doesn&#39;t work for me - I get a version error on AdbWinApi.dll.</p>
<p>Beyond that, several new quirks&#x2F;errors&#x2F;problems popped up, but is there really any point in listing them here?</p>
<p>I&#39;m two seconds from giving up on Appcelerator and moving on … I realize that this is all still HIGHLY beta (alpha?), and that there are a lot of good people here trying to help … but as I&#39;ve stated before, I need a working proof-of-concept before I buy any sort of support.</p>
<p>The only reason I&#39;ve kept trying is that even though all my projects hit roadblocks due to features not-yet-available, or to-be-fixed-in-1.5, I was still hopeful.</p>
<p>I guess I put too much faith in Appcelerator&#39;s printed word.</p>
<p>To all the folks that have had success with this product, I think that&#39;s wonderful.  I&#39;m truly happy for you.</p>
<p>However, for the over 2,500 unanswered questions in this forum - I feel your pain.</p>

<p>I think your final statement was a little unfair to the community. Contrary to what you say, there are so many people who do put a lot of time into answering questions, and often there are good reasons why some are left. Did you realise that those 2,500 &quot;unanswered&quot; do not include questions where Helpers have requested more information by posting a comment? I think when people explain their issues in a conscientious way, more often than not someone will post a satisfactory answer, which is supported by the fact that a good number or questions receive &quot;best answer&quot; status.</p>
<p>All that said, I do empathise with your frustration. It&#39;s very disconcerting when all you want to do is to get working, but are hampered by install issues. This is the same for quite a few products I&#39;ve tried over the years.</p>
<p>If you aren&#39;t averse to using Linux, I am putting together a disk that has the Titanium environment pre-configured on an Ubuntu OS. Thus, you can either use it to boot from and install a new system, or use something like VMware or <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.virtualbox.org&#x2F;">VirtualBox</a> to boot it and run as a virtual machine. It takes about 3 minutes to install to VirtualBox, although this may depend on your system.</p>
<p>If anyone else is interested in this, let me know.</p>
<p>Lastly, if it is Windows you are having an issue with, I&#39;m going to set up my a windows environment next week, so will let you know how I get on, and if I am able to find a solution.</p>
<p>Cheers<br>Hal</p>

							<p>Hal, </p>
<p>Providing a virtual machine with Ti completely setup is a great idea (ubuntu or windows)… you will be considered a hero by many people who are not using a Mac… I am looking forward to it… </p>
<p>I will be monitoring this thread regularly  :-)</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>You rock.  I was sitting here getting heated thinking about having to uninstall and reinstall yet another version of the JDK (was on 1.7 but moved back to 1.6 64bit when I stumbled across problems with that; to be told above that 1.6 64bit may need to be downgraded further to 1.6 32bit I was beginning to lose faith in this tool).  But your run-as-admin fix did the trick for me (at least got past that &quot;unable to open database file&quot; error anyway!)</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>Happened to me when I had non-english user profile folder name.</p>

							<p>Yesterday was a good day, I worked with Titanium Studio without a single problem. Today however I could not get past the dreaded &quot;[ERROR] OperationalError: unable to open database file.&quot;<br>So what was I doing different? At my wits end I turned off Windows Media Player hoping that a little quiet would help me think and it started working!<br>Just for kicks I turned it back on and it still worked. Until I tried to run my app on my device instead of the emulator and the problem was back. Once again I turned off Window Media Player and I was back to work.</p>

							<p>Richard, I feel your pain too… I just went through the same process of agony and pain… Here’s my account just to encourage everyone to keep trying:</p>
<p>About 10 days ago, I decided to give Ti a shot after seeing a friend doing some nifty development work on his Mac.  He said it should be as easy doing it on Win (since I am a windows guy).  I figured I&#39;ll spend an afternoon to check it out and create a simple hello world app. I literally spent one week glued to my Win computer just trying to get a proper install, and create the first &quot;I am a window&quot; app, and almost gave up many times.  I read and re-read messages relating to the errors I was getting.  Many people tried to help, some with success others not. I was disgusted but it became a challenge to get this platform up and running. I finally got the whole thing working on XP, Vista, and Win7.  Each has its own quirks and what works on one does not necessarily solve problems on another.  (For example, I still have some lines in the XP version’s index.js code commented out since otherwise Ti thinks I am not online.)<br>My distilled wisdom boils down to this:</p>
<p>1- Make sure all required products (other than Ti Dev) are installed properly and they all work from the DOS prompt (for Android work: Java, Android SDK, Python, Scons, Git) by trying the tests specified in getting-started document to make sure all path are correctly defined… failure to do this will send you in days of agony and unrelated error messages.</p>
<p>2- For Android, make sure SDK 1.6 and Google API 1.6 are installed along with at least one more recent version (2.1 or 2.2 but not SDK 2.3).</p>
<p>3- Install Ti Dev and make sure it points to the correct Android SDK folder… this will require copying some files from the default install folders to the platform-tools folder like adb.exe, AdbWinApi.dll, etc… Ti will tell you which files are missing and you can copy them manually</p>
<p>4- Do not mix and match versions i.e. when using Ti SDK 1.4, do not use KitchenSink 1.5, but rather use KitchenSink 1.4.</p>
<p>5- To get your message to the appropriate eyes in Q&amp;A (VERY IMPORTANT), make sure you follow the guidance listed in: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;contribute.html  </p>
<p>6- If you can afford it, sign up to the professional version where you will get help quickly, but if you don’t (like me) hang in there in the Q&amp;A and keep trying: once you get the whole thing working, you’ll be amazed all the stuff you’ll be able to do with just a couple lines of code!!</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
