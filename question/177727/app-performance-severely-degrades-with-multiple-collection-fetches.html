			<h1>App performance severely degrades with multiple collection fetches</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>We are nearing completion of our first titanium app and have discovered that there is a serious performance hit in the app when doing a fetch on large collections (20,000+ records).</p>
<p>Current situation is we have the collection Locations bound to a tableview in at least two different screens in the app.  At first we had the collection declared and fetched in alloy.js but this ended up being redundant as the tableviews would not bind properly to the collection unless a fetch was performed in that view&#39;s controller.</p>
<p>Is there any way to only fetch the collection once and have it bound to separate tableviews in multiple screens?</p>
<p>Also, can anyone give us some tips on how to optimize the fetch itself?  Currently takes about 20 seconds to complete (note we are using a sql adapter for the models in the collections).</p>
<p>Thanks!<br>Mike</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;m no expert on collections, but I&#39;d fetch into a local store, then you can access it from any other page by requiring it on the page. As for the fetch itself, is it really necessary to pull 20k records into a mobile device? I would first look at filtering whatever you can out of that fetch. I know it&#39;s kinda late in the game for you, but I&#39;d question a design that tries to pull that much data into a mobile device.</p>
