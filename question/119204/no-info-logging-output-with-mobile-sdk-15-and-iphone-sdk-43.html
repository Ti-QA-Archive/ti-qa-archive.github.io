			<h1>No INFO logging output with Mobile SDK 1.5 and iPhone SDK 4.3</h1>

			<p>I&#39;ve seen lots of references to similar problems but I have yet to be able to resolve this one and it&#39;s a biggy since there&#39;s no other good way to debug issues.  Has anyone seen this problem in the versions mentioned above?</p>
<p>Is there anything special I need to do to use:<br>Ti.API.info(&#39;test&#39;);  </p>
<p>And by the way, it&#39;s also not working with the Kitchen Sink app.  There was mention of replacing the logger.py script with another one that fixes a similar issue but that was in reference to the 1.4 mobile sdk, not the 1.5.  I tried anyway and I&#39;m pretty sure the two files are the same.</p>
<p>There was also mention of going back to the 1.4 version of the mobile sdk and then upgrading to the 1.5 but that seems unlikely to work and I don&#39;t want to do that if I don&#39;t have to.  </p>
<p>Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>
