			<h1>iTunesU TabGroup UI Replicate</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I developed an app with opening dashboard from where subsequent tab group windows are launched according to the dashboard icon tapped. I was able to close each tabgroup after use to return to the dashboard</p>
<p>Everything works in test until I deployed to device (iPhone and Android) when after a few minutes of opening and closing tab groups and associated tableviews the app freezes and crashes.  I suspected it has to do with memory management so I ensured that all Ti.App.listeners and component listeners are removed when tabgroups are closed. I only gained 3 minutes more before crash. So I gave up on the idea of such an app UI, thinking it is not possible or recommended to launch multiple tabGroups, which even though I think I am closing may not be released from memory.</p>
<p>Until today when I visited an Apple store and played with the iTunesU app which used the same concept I was about to abandon. Its bookshelf of books is like my dashboard and the tabbed notebook like my various tab groups. Here is the question:</p>
<p>(1) Are the tabbed ui in iTunes actually tab groups or make-believe created with images and hotspots? If tab groups, how does one orient the tabs to be on the right hand side as shown in this app?</p>
<p>(2) The library icon on the navbar is like my close button that closes the tabGroup and returns to the dashboard. Is this a button with a listener for close event of a tabGroup? Or what&#39;s the best way to close the tabGroup to ensure it is not living in memory?</p>
<p>(3). If the iTunesU tabbed UI is not a real tabGroup but a series of images with layers, then I guess tableviews with transparent backgrounds must have been layered on top to contain their contents. Right?</p>
<p>I like this interface and playig  with it for 1 hour without a crash or freeze like I am experiencing tells me it is feasible to implement and acceptable by Apple.</p>
<p>ANy thoughts and&#x2F;or pointers will be appreciated. I really don&#39;t want to abandon the concept if only I can prevent the memory crashes I am getting now. I know it is an issue of memory becasue when I reset myiPhone, the app starts normally again.  Thanks and Happy New Year.</p>
