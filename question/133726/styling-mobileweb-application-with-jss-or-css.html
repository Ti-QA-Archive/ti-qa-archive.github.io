			<h1>Styling MobileWeb Application with jss or css</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey all,</p>
<p>is it already possible to style the generated mobileweb application with css or jss? Haven&#39;t found anything useful in Confluence and Jira. Also Q&amp;A gives me no answer. I&#39;m currently using the latest 2.0.0 build of Titanium Mobile.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

							<div><p>You can modify some stuff. If you look in index.html, there is a bunch of CSS at the top that you can tweak, however keep in mind that subsequent builds will overwrite your changes. You can also modify a file css file at &lt;titanium mobile SDK install folder&gt;&#x2F;mobileweb&#x2F;themes&#x2F;common.css, however note that this will affect ALL mobile web projects.</p>

							<div><p>Thanks Bryan. I think I&#39;ll do something like styles.cs but instead of putting all my styles on one file I&#39;ll spread them across each view&#39;s file, placing them at the top.</p>

							<div><p>That is really bad news. Hope they don&#39;t drop the support for jss. That&#39;ll be the moment I stop using Titanium. I&#39;m sad of refactoring the app all the time. While Titanium is really cool to develop an app very fast, it&#39;s very difficult and time intensive to maintain it. It would be cool to have a simple CSS File for mobileweb where one is able to set styles for classNames and Ids.</p>

<p>Totally agree with you. I lost lots of time to move to JSS because it was easier for the designer to make changes on the app. Now I have to change things back to how they were before! :S<br>I think Titanium is still trying to find its way but I do think they will get there… eventually.</p>
