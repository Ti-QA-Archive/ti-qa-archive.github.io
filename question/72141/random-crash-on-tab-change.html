			<h1>Random crash on tab change</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>This is more a tip than a question.</p>
<p>My app started crashing -mostly in the simulator- at random moments, usually just after showing the splash screen or changing tabs, no error message or anything shown in Titanium, just &quot;Application exited from simulator&quot;. Launching my app in the simulator through XCode, when the crash occured I was getting the following error in the console:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">*** -[NSArray initWithObjects:<span class="hljs-command">count</span>:]: attempt <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> insert nil object <span class="hljs-keyword">at</span> objects[<span class="hljs-number">6</span>]
</code></pre><p>I have totally no idea what this means.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was so desperate I had to use my app&#39;s backup files from 2 days ago.</p>
<p>Starting with <strong>app.js</strong>, I started comparing the old and current file. The only difference I spotted was the <code>barImage:&amp;#39;images&amp;#x2F;nav_bar.png&amp;#39;</code> in the tabs&#39; windows. I removed these from my current app.js file and suddenly the app stopped crashing.<br>It seemed so weird I put them back in and the app started crashing again.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve seen this error showing up to other people in here too (splash-crash error etc), and it seems to be getting fixed with so random solutions.</p>
<p>For me that made the trick. I hope I could help.</p>

							<p>It&#39;s a race condition which I think Appcelerator have fixed in the current dev code. In your case changing that line may have adjusted the timing just enough to stop the bug from triggering, but I don&#39;t believe setting the bar image is the root cause. In my app I was frequently able to trigger that bug in the simulator by switching back and forth between windows in a tab group.</p>

										<p><p>They have fixed it? Then why would the bug still be triggering?<br>And yes I&#39;m sure barImage wasn&#39;t the root cause as well. I would really want to know what the real cause is and what I can do to fix it permanently.</p>
