			<h1>How to test whether the app is in active state or inactive state</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am developing a ios app in titanium and I need to test whether my app is in active state or inactive state when it is in foreground. I know about &#39;Resume&#39; and &#39;pause&#39; events but I need something equivalent to iosUIApplicationStateInactive and UIApplicationStateactive. Please let me know if there are any events similar to this in titanium or any way of handling this events programmatically is also be helpful. [ I am using titanium studio 2.1.1 and ios5].</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

							<p>Hi Nivedita</p>
<p>I may be missing something here but the <code>iosUIApplicationStateInactive</code> and <code>iosUIApplicationStateActive</code> are functionally the same as the <code>pause</code> and <code>resume</code> events from Titanium.</p>
<p>You receive these events to allow you to react accordingly, you cannot test for inactive state as you are at that point inactive - nothing is actually happening - you last block of code (in the pause) event has finished processing).  When you are in the active state, again you are actually working so nothing to do extra.</p>
<p>The events for <code>pause</code> and <code>resume</code> allow you to add code that will run when each state occurs.  These means you can store session information during a <code>pause</code> and call a network refresh of data on a <code>resume</code> - for example.</p>
<p>In short Titanium handles these events the same way as XCODE would have and you cannot test against the state as the state just &#39;is&#39; and the events would have already been actioned already.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the answer. My actual problem is I am using push notifications and when a push notification arrives the same callback is calling even if I am already in foreground and or when I click a notification on notification bar. So how to differentiate between these to scenarios. Since in both cases first &#39;Resume event calls and then the callback  I am not able to differentiate them. Please let me know how to do this.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Nivedita</p>
<p>Whilst not ideal this principle should work.</p>
<p>Depending on the order of the events, I have not tested which is fired first; push notification callback or resume - you could set a global flag you then react to.</p>
<p>If the push callback is first, simply toggle the flag to show came via push - handle appropriately.<br>If the resume comes first set a timeout to run whatever code you need to run, then if the push callback fires reset the timeout so it does not run.</p>
<p>Let me know.</p>
