			<h1>Tip to create an App with Titanium</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all.</p>
<p>This is only question to select Titanium for the project or not.</p>
<p>I want to create a mobile app that can receive push notifications. This client is so easy: only a list of received notifications, and the posibility to receive more.</p>
<p>The server will be a simple web page for a user, where he will have the sent message and also can write a new message to broadcast to all the clients.</p>
<p>Just this, it&#39;s a simply concept. So I suppose it can be done with Titanium technology, using ACS for clients (mobile apps) and Node.ACS for the web server. It&#39;s right? Can I have a little database in Node.ACS to store the messages or I need another approach?</p>

							<p>Regarding Node.ACS, you can have your own database if you so desire that is not the problem. </p>
<p>The only caveat that I foresee with such an application is that your app will simply display a webpage from the server. Apple has rules against that sort of app that basically &quot;embed&quot; a website. Meaning that your application can be refused publication on the app store.</p>
<p>The best way to avoid this is to build an application that brings added value to a service. Remember, application <strong>are not</strong> the web.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your response, Christian. Well, I only explained the &quot;basic&quot; of the app. It&#39;s not exactly like show a web page. The web will not be operative for normal users, is only a management interface to send notifications.</p>
<p>The final purpose is to send push notifications to the user&#39;s mobile, being the user able to suscribe to notifications by some criteria.</p>
<p>The tip here is if I understood the purpose of Node.ACS (to do web pages and support your own webservices?) and if I can get my needs with Titanium technology, which seems affirmative</p>
