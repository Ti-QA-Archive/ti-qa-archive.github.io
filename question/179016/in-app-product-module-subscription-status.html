			<h1>In-app product module subscription status</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,<br>I&#39;m using the in-app product module (for iOS).<br>I have just one product which is a yearly subscription.<br>I would like to check if it is valid or not, to give the user access to parts of the app.</p>
<p>Is purchaseUpdate&#39;s e.purchase.state the one to listen to?<br>What are the values for it, the doc doesn&#39;t say?<br>Is there a better way?</p>

										<p><p>Not very straightforward to implement, cause you actually have to calculate everything manually. A remote server is recommended to keep track of the subscriptions (would have hoped for a nice little variable that tells you what state the subscription is in). Once the subscription has been made, record the date and whatever is worth keeping in a remote db, and calculate the end time for this user (it HAS to be accessed cross-devices, otherwise your app will be rejected like mine first was, so you need a login system so they can retrieve it on another device). Then your app will have to check if the user&#39;s subscription is still valid before moving on. You can do the logic locally in js too but it&#39;s less secure and solid.</p>

										<p><p>My problem with that is auto-renewable subscriptions. How can I detect they&#39;ve auto-renewed to update the backend? I don&#39;t believe there is a way, right?</p>

							<p>My short answer will simply be I was willing to use auto-renewing subscriptions but they are a big mess (Google search will confirm the flaws) so I ran away and used non-renewing subscriptions eventually. I think if the user renews it, you catch the action just like when they register, and you update the backend with the new lease.</p>
