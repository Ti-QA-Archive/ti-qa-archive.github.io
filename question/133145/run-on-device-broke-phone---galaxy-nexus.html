			<h1>Run On Device Broke Phone - Galaxy Nexus</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I built an Android app and tested it on API 2.3, 4.0 and 4.0.3. It worked fine in the emulators (including different screen resolutions.)</p>
<p>Then I decided to give it a go on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus (4.0.2, factory unlocked, stock ROM).</p>
<p>I installed the Samsung USB drivers (Samsung_USB_Driver_for_Moblie_Phones_v1_4_6_0.exe), used the Titanium Community Developer to run on device.</p>
<p>As soon as the app went on the phone, it displayed &quot;Unfortunately, Launcher has stopped.&quot;. If you click ok, it comes back up after 2 seconds… I tried all sorts of app removers and cache clears, but they all crash when they try and look at the app that was installed on my phone.</p>
<p>Its an absolute nightmare, looking like my only option is to factory reset… this would mean downloading all my apps and music (Google music) again :(</p>

							<div><p>Just a quick update, as I see there are a few people reading.</p>
<p>Just tried the app in the emulator that I guess represents a Galaxy Nexus (WXGA720), it caused the same error on the emulator.</p>
<p>Now using Ti SDK 1.8.2 and Android SDK 4.0</p>

							<div><p>So I built the app using Android SDK APIs 4.0…. not sure what the difference is?</p>
<p>The app got on the device, the same error popped up. BUT it launched the app, straight into an error: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i43.tinypic.com&#x2F;s42h7c.png</p>

							<div><p>Just created a new project, installed to simulator… crashed the launcher again. However, the app did run fine, no errors.</p>
<p>Also tried the latest continues build (Ti v2), same error. </p>
<p>Does Titanium actually support Android 4?</p>

							<div><p>I have resolved the main breaking of the phone issue. Turns out Android 4.0.2 doesn&#39;t like processing large appicon.png files.</p>
<p>Still getting an error in the events.js class, any advice?</p>

							<div><p>Which events.js? We can&#39;t see them, without code, we can&#39;t help. Likely you should open a new question if it&#39;s not the same topic… </p>

							<div><p>Thanks for the reply Mauro, I have fixed all the issues myself now.</p>
<p>An overview:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Dont use large appicon files, Android 4 cant process them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I couldn&#39;t create  and reference a window like this ift.app.window, and get events to work on Android 4, worked fine on 2.3.3.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks again.</p>
