			<h1>Notifications iOS</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I need to establish something like a notification system on my app. I&#39;ve developed an app (Titanium, running on iOS) which takes information via webservices from a server (I also have control server) when the user runs the app.</p>
<p>Now, I need the app receives a notification from the server indicating to the user that something new is available. Something like… You have new messages, check the app to see them.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve readed some information about push Notifications and Cloud Services but I can&#39;t understand if this is the proper solution for me.<br>Is there anyway to do this directly between the app and the server? any suggest?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot!</p>
<p>Antonio</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The answer depends on frequency of messages, the interval between them and the acceptance of the user that is the frequency is high they may be prompted often.  Although with planning you can choke (limit) the number.</p>
<p>If the interval is low for example daily then you could get away simply polling your server from the app using <strong>httpClient</strong> and obtaining a JSON (or other format) response containing the message headers that they user can then select to obtain the full message or all the messages including content.</p>
<p>Otherwise the common technique is a Push Notification.  You have almost certainly seen these arrive before on devices, for example; twitter apps can tell you tweet are available and email apps tell you there is new mail.  The mechanism for the receipt of these notifications is built directly into the main mobile OS (think iOS and Android for now).</p>
<p>In your app you add code to receive the push notification and optional react to the receipt of that push notification - you could start the app at a specific location or display the message in addition to the push notifications initial display of an alert, top bar or whatever other display options are available on the device.</p>
<p>In order to manage push notifications you can install all the required server software on a dedicated server add SSLs and manage the transactions.  Or if you are smart - don&#39;t - leave it to a service provider - Appcelerators Cloud Services (ACS) is a good starting point.  They handle the heavy lifting and the first x million are free (5M currently).</p>
<p>You then write server code to send the push notifications to each individual device (user) as required.</p>
<p>You send a few different types of push broadcasts, including; broadcast (everyone), tags&#x2F;tokens (different services different names) these are sent to any user that is marked to accept that type, so a single message would be sent to as many as match.  The final type is a simple one-to-one - most suitable for your situation where you tell &quot;user a&quot; they have &quot;message b&quot;.</p>
<p>You can use email but it is a little old-school if you want instant gratification as you cannot guarantee the users email account announces new post will display your message as you want it and many more reasons.</p>
<p>This is an overview only and I strongly suggest you research push before you go ahead.  You can get up and running within and hour to testing level, but you will need to plan how to include this into your solutions infrastructure.</p>
