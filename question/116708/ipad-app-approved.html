			<h1>iPad app approved</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Just got my first iPad app approved (I have 2 iphone ones).  It&#39;s called PlotMe for iPad, basically lets you enter all of your addresses or locations that you&#39;re going to be visiting, and organizes them as to which is closest to you, so you don&#39;t spend time and gas driving around.</p>
<p>On a side note, it got rejected twice before, and I tracked it to locking the app into Landscape mode.  Worked fine on the Simulator, but I dont have an iPad, so I couldnt test completely.  Once I took that out it got approved.</p>
<p>I did have to tweak my &quot;Details&quot; splash screen, so it wouldnt be blank, I just made it &quot;designed for Landscape mode&quot; and it looks fine.</p>
<p>Special thanks to Aaraon Saunders (@aaronksaunders) for his tech help on getting my Splitview working.</p>

							<div><p>Hello Josh.<br>I&#39;m developing an app for a client and since you already have an ipad app on the store can you perhaps tell me the following:<br>is your application only for ipad or is also for iPhone… and if yes for both devices.. how did you put in the app store…  compile it has different apps and submit the both? or there is a way that if your app is for both devices you only have to submit one app?</p>
<p>Regards,<br>Bruno</p>

							<div><p>Josh, Great going!. Was there an issue with the app being locked in a particular orientation? I plan to develop an app to be used always in PORTRAIT mode. Would Apple reject that?!. The mode is required because of some of the functionality of the app.. which is portrait oriented. Thanks.</p>

							<div><p>@Bruno,<br>I dont think Appcelerator supports universal apps, so what I did was just create my iPhone app, and then created a new iPad project and ported a lot of code over.  It was pretty simple, the longest part was changing the design a bit and using the iPad specific controls (like the SplitView).</p>
<p>Then in Xcode, when I compiled the iPad version, I changed the build configuration targeted family to iPad.  Otherwise it still shows up as an iPhone app.</p>
<p>@Neo,</p>
<p>Apple didnt reject it because it was Landscape only, they rejected it because it crashed.  The only way I could fix that was to remove the restriction, so I dont know if that is a Titanium bug or not.  To help me, I just made my splash screen say &quot;designed for Landscape mode&quot;, and I haven&#39;t had any complaints.</p>

							<div><p>Appcelerator does support universal apps, you just have to open up the generated xproj file in your build&#x2F;iphone directory and then do an archive with the target set to iOS universal device.</p>

							<p>I have a question on your SplitView (As you said Aaraon Saunders helped you with it?), how do you get it so there are like 2 windows side-by-side, like <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;a4.phobos.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;r30&#x2F;Purple&#x2F;d6&#x2F;96&#x2F;ac&#x2F;mzl.pkrbnxts.480x480-75.jpg">here</a>? Whenever I try (Using KitchenSink), it&#39;s more like there&#39;s just a button that pops up a type of OptionDialog. If you would like to keep this thread just for your App, do you mind Emailing me at coltonarabsky@me.com? This would help me with my own iPad app a lot :)</p>

							<p>Very smart idea! Looks very well done. Good job :) And yes, testing on a live iPad is annoying if you don&#39;t have one :P</p>

							<p>Yes, it was kind of a pain.  Luckily I was able to develop pretty quickly, since I was porting my iPhone code over and had to just change the visual aspects of it.  But still, it would be nice to have a physical unit to test on, instead of sending it to my brother who has one, but has no NEED for one…</p>
<p>Maybe if I sell about 200+ copies I&#39;ll go get one…</p>

							<p>Thanks Josh for sharing the code, I&#39;m going to buy your App as a symbol of appreciation.</p>
<p>Congratulations for being approved, I&#39;m still waiting for my client&#39;s app to be reviewed since march 2 :( It&#39;s an iPhone App for a local radio station.</p>
<p>I hope they were only busy prepping the iPad 2 release. But now that it is out I&#39;m also hoping that the app gets approved.</p>

										<p><p>I had to delete and re-install but here&#39;s the steps to reproduce this bug, add a location, click on my locations, click on the location you just created and then click the &quot;show on map&quot; button. When you do that, the google map will open up in full screen with no way to go back to the app.</p>

										<p><p>Its just opening the native Maps application, so you have to just go back to your app and it is back where it left off.  The routing in Titanium isn&#39;t the greatest, I just past the current location to the lat&#x2F;lon of the destination and let Google take care of it.</p>
