			<h1>Desktop app Packaging failed. HTTP status: 400</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Why is the desktop packaging not working?</p>
<p>Is anybody from Appcelerator going to answer this. I think there are more than 50 questions about this matter and no input from them.</p>
<p>When i create a new project, a blank one, the packaging works, when i copy my resource folder in the newly created project, its not working.</p>
<p>The error is given after more than 40 minutes, it used to be after 23 minutes.</p>
<p>I dont have any git files, i dont have any errors in the project.</p>
<p>I tried all combinations on the initial packaging settings window.</p>
<p>Please Appcelerator, can you get to the bottom of this? Is it because of the number of file in the project, or….</p>
<p>I am using a Macbook Pro with the latest build of Titanium Studio and i tried packaging with 1.1.0 and 1.2.0.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

							<p>I think i have found the problem.</p>
<p>If your app has a big size and contains many files, it wont work. So for example, if you have sound files or any other type of resources, and you have 100 (just an example) of them or more it wont work to package because their servers have some limit put in place. So after some time it just drops the connection right in the middle of the file uploading process.</p>
<p>I recommend archiving, where is possible, and then un-archive when the user runs the app.</p>
<p>I really think Appcelerator should look into this issue.</p>
<p>I am going to install a network sniffer to see the connections being made from my mac, and i bet the packaging process will drop in the middle of the upload, because of the size of the upload.</p>
<p>I will keep you guys updated.</p>

							<p>Yes, it seems that the above explanation is the problem. The bigger the size of the app, the lesser chances of it being packaged.</p>
<p>I tried the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>package with 200 files - total size: 9MB - works</li>
<li>package with 750 resource files - total size: 20MB and it worked</li>
<li>package with 900 resource files - total size: 25MB - FAILED</li>
<li>package with 1500 resource files - ~50MB  - FAILED</li>
<li>package with 1500 files but archived in a single file, size: 30MB - FaILED</li>
</ul>
<p>so this tell us clear that the packaging is limited by the size of the build, it doesn&#39;t matter how many files.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>Alex</p>

							<p>Just did a little more digging using some network sniffers and it seems that when the package is uploaded on the titanium amazon cloud the connection time depends on the cloud server is used. but if your package cant be uploaded in 2-3 minutes, i think the connection is being dropped automatically by the server.</p>
<p>I kind of rounded up the allowed maximum package size to be at 20-22MB, can&#39;t say a fixed size because it takes to much time testing.</p>
