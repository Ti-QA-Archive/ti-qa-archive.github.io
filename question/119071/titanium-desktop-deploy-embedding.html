			<p>I would like to know if it&#39;s possible to &quot;embedded&quot; all source file (.html, .js .css etc) into a unique package file to avoid final user to tamper o modify original application. At the moment on Titanium Desktop all files can be modified by end user easily.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m also trying to find a way to prevent user&#39;s modifying or copying source files. Best way i found so far is structure your app like how Tweetanium was written, then Obfuscate some or all of your source files. You could use those free online Javascript Obfuscater or use commercial ones. I tried Obfuscate all of my js, but saw some performance issues.</p>
<p>It is not a real fool proof method to prevent modification or copying, but it takes a longer time for them to do it.</p>

							<p>Obfuscating js make our deployment process more complex and makes very hard debugging on the field if needed. I was only thinking that should be easy to put all Resource content into a unique file, or zip.</p>

							<p>If they didn&#39;t rely on IronPython (which is my understanding), you would be able to distribute your sensitive logic as compiled .pyc files, which would be HUGE.  You could do some trickery as part of a build script to create psuedo private methods in your Python Classes, and it would take some pretty heady rev-eng to get at the logic…however, it is not my impression that they will be moving in this direction without a significant user base and clamor on that topic.</p>
<p>In another development, it appears someone has posted recently on making C++ dlls work inside of Titanium apps:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;119172&#x2F;desktop-using-c</p>
<p>Perhaps if you have some C++ understanding, you could put together some DLLs to reduce the visibility and edit-ability of some of your logic.</p>
