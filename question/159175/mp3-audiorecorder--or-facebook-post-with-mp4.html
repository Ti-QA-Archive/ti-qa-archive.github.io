			<p>Mobile<br>Titanium 3.1.1<br>iOS 6.0, 6.1, 7.0<br>Mac OS X</p>
<p>Hello - I am having a problem with audio recording and &#x2F;or posting to facebook, depending on how you look at it.  What I would like to do is to make a recording on device using audiorecorder, which I can do successfully.  However I would like to also post this to facebook along with a couple of other parameters.  I can get a successful post to facebook complete with text and picture, but I cannot get an audio file to post.  I read on the facebook feed dialog info page that they will except mp3 audio files.  Currently my audio is being recorded in mp4 on both android and ios.  (android using a separate module). So I figured the problem was my audio file format, right?  So I tried changing audiorecorder.format from Ti.Media.AUDIO_FILEFORMAT_MP4 to Ti.Media.AUDIO_FILEFORMAT_MP3.  Now I can&#39;t get a recording at all.  My recorder doesn&#39;t even work properly.  I have tried literally every single compression format available in the docs to see if that was the problem, but so far none of them made any change. That is the only change I have made and if I change it back to mp4 it works perfect.  Help?!  Is there a way to record a file as mp3 in titanium?  Or better yet, is there a way to post to facebook using mp4 file format?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>Hello Jenna,</p>
<p>If you want to save recorded audio file as .mp4 extension, you need to set &quot;compression&quot; as &quot;Titanium.Media.AUDIO_FORMAT_AAC&quot;. According to this <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Media-property-AUDIO_FORMAT_AAC">link</a>, it&#39;s for audio format MPEG4 AAC encoding.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">recording.compression = Titanium.Media.AUDIO_FORMAT_AAC<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
recording.format = Titanium.Media.AUDIO_FILEFORMAT_MP4<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>I have tested this with KitchenSink sound recording example. It&#39;s working. Hope this helps. Thanks.</p>
