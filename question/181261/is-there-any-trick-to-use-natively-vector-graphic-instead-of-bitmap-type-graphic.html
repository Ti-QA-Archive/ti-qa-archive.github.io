			<h1>Is there any trick to use natively vector graphic instead of bitmap type graphic?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>HI Folks, to reduce the size of the app and to offer a better visual experience (totally independent from devices) it could be good to use vector graphic (realized, for example, using Illustrator) instead of bitmap type graphic avoiding also memory issues. In my case, for example, I need to create very simple graphic elements (a lot of them) that in vector style they&#39;d be very very small in size and memory occupacy but in bitmap mode (e.g. jpg, png or gif) they don&#39;t. Do you know if there is a possibility in that direction? Thanks guys.</p>

							<p>First, your question failed to address what platforms you were targeting. Because of that, I&#39;m going to only address iOS and if you come back with &#39;what about android&#39; I&#39;ll mark your question down. Fair warning for skipping the instructions that were on the question submission page.</p>
<p>Even in xCode 6, while you can have vector assets for iOS, xCode still generates and packages PNGs at build time from them. So, at the core, iOS is only using static bitmapped based graphics.</p>
<p>You could look at wrapping a native library such as <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SVGKit&#x2F;SVGKit">SVGKit</a> (but they are a cocoapods based distro)</p>

										<p><p>The quick answer on android vectors, is that in Android 5.0, you can have Vector based drawables, and there are some SVG libraries to handle loading in predesigned images.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your reply. I didn&#39;t mention the target platform because I was speaking in general about the possibility to use a trick or something else (like a module) valid for all mobile platforms. Indeed I&#39;m looking for a solution valid both for IOs and Android. Bye</p>

							<p>Depending on how you want to use these images, you might be able to make use of an icon font.</p>
<p>But you should be aware of some of the caveats, which I mention in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;smorgasbork.com&#x2F;component&#x2F;content&#x2F;article&#x2F;38-titanium-mobile&#x2F;156-titanium-mobile-gotchas-volume-2">this blog post</a>.  For example, in my experience, icon fonts did not work with ios 6.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the advice. I have to use some custom graphic images created by Illustrator mainly for buttons and backgrounds so I can&#39;t use icon fonts. Bye</p>
