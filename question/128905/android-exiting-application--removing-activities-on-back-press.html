			<h1>[Android] Exiting application / removing activities on back press</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>On my app, pressing the back button on a couple screens should exit the app. If I close all the windows in my <code>android:back</code> handler, I end up with the splash screen (or <code>Ti.UI.backgroundColor</code> if I set that property), which I cannot close. Pressing back again causes the app to actually close.</p>
<p>Since <code>Ti.App.exit()</code> is not supported, I&#39;ve tried <code>Ti.Android.currentActivity.finish()</code>, which doesn&#39;t work, as well as .finish() in the window&#39;s close event handler, which causes the app to have a stack overflow exception in Java that I cannot trap. There are many different posts here, which indicate that this should work.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also tried <code>win.exitOnClose = true</code> before closing, which does diddly as well.</p>
<p>I should also note that normally, one window will close when it&#39;s finished (it&#39;s a login window). It&#39;s not possible to say exitOnClose on this window for this reason. The other window closes when you go to a different screen because it has a lot of stuff on it so again I can&#39;t use exitOnClose.</p>
<p>Just guessing from what limited digging I&#39;ve done in Ti in general, that there are activities open (created by Ti) that are not visible on screen that need to be killed. Since this app uses maps, perhaps that&#39;s one of them. There&#39;s not like, <code>Ti.Android.activities[]</code>, so I can&#39;t really tell you.</p>

							<p>Ti.Android.currentActivity isn&#39;t documented by I can confirm it works with .finish().<br>I was messing about with it last night before realizing that while it closes the window, it doesn&#39;t necessarily unload and destroy the activity.<br>The following code works but it probably doesn&#39;t do what You intend it to do.  It certainly doesn&#39;t do what I want it to do.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">win.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'android:back'</span>,<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span>{
   <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> activity = TI.Android.currentActivity;
   activity.finish();
})
</code></pre><p>I imagine chaining the function should work, but I haven&#39;t tested it myself.  I&#39;ve confirmed that the code above works just like a win.close();</p>
<p>I&#39;m still trying to figure code to kill an Android activity.</p>

										<p><p>Both <code>win.close();</code> and this result in the window not appearing on screen (as you&#39;d expect), however the app still doesn&#39;t exit. And you can&#39;t set <code>exitOnClose</code> at runtime for some reason.</p>

							<p>Remember that everything we produce here is mapped to an existing object in one of the three platforms supported (iCrap considered as one).<br>exitOnClose changes the sort of window that is created, hence it&#39;s not a runtime property to begin with.<br>I&#39;m not understanding the issue you&#39;re experiencing.<br>You want a window to close, or you want the app to close?</p>

										<p><p>When the back button is pressed on the login window, but not when the login window is closed through the normal course of using the app, the app should exit.</p>
<p>What instead happens is that the login window closes (which is correct), leaving no visible activities except for the splash screen (or if I set <code>Ti.UI.backgroundColor</code> to something, that appears). One would think that in Android, if every window&#x2F;activity in the app is closed, the app would exit.</p>

							<p>Ack, that last one was supposed to be a comment, not an answer :(<br>And there&#39;s no way for me to move it either, eh?  Crap.  </p>
<p>Ok so you have a login window that opens after the main window?<br>Put the event listener on the login window and make the login window modal.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-string">modal:</span><span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
</code></pre><p>So when somebody presses back, you can go win.close() and if you programmatically close the login window, it&#39;s modal so back to the previous window you go.</p>

										<p><p>The flow of the app is something like this:</p>
<p>App starts.<br>Do we have an auth token?<br>Yes -&gt; Load main app.<br>No -&gt; Display login screen.<br>A successful login results in opening the app and closing the login window. The login screen blocks you from getting in the app until you login (the app has no function without being logged in).</p>
<p>The login screen is heavyweight, and making it modal doesn&#39;t really make sense since it&#39;d be modal with respect to the background of the app since no other windows would be open.</p>
<p>Possibly, we could just hide the login window instead of closing it and then use exitOnClose, but I don&#39;t like leaving stuff allocated in RAM.</p>

										<p><p>So to clarify the problem : if the user backs off the Login window without inputting information, they&#39;re shown a black screen instead of the application&#x2F;main window closing altogether?</p>
<p>You could make the login modal, etc, but the logic you&#39;re using seems sound.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, that&#39;s correct. The screen is only black though if I set Ti.UI.backgroundColor to black. Otherwise, the screen is the splash screen default.png.</p>

							<p>Target the parent.  I can&#39;t remember the exact code cuz I&#39;m not at home but I can post it later.  I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve dealt with it in the past.</p>
