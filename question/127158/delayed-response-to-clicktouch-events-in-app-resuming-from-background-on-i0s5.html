			<h1>Delayed response to click/touch events in app resuming from background on i0S5</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I developed an app using Titanium 1.7.3 and Xcode 5, and I noticed that when I resume an app running in background on iOS5 there is about a 5 second delay before the app responds to touch or click events.</p>
<p>Has anyone experienced this behavior?</p>

							<p>Is it possible to display a splash screen when the app resumes until the UI becomes active? Using the pause&#x2F;resume event listeners to display a splash window is ineffective because they are also delayed when the app resumes.</p>

										<p><p>There is an app called Momento that does this. I don&#39;t think it was made with titanium. I would like to know if this is possible as well. I don&#39;t mind displaying a screen till the app is functional again.</p>

							<p>I solved the problem by turning off analytics in the tiapp.xml file.  Can anyone explain why this happens when analytics is turned on?</p>

										<p><p>Hi </p>
<p>Can you please tell me how to stop the analytics as i don&#39;t want my user to use Internet just because of that and even the app is causing little delay on any touch or click event.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m not totally sure how it works, but Analytics logs data and is then sent back to Appcelerator. However, from what I read, this only happens when your app is packaged for distribution.</p>

							<p>I have seen this in a number of apps both titanium made and not… thats not saying titanium does not have an issue here, but rather that I think the core of the issue might be iOS5. If you can get more of a use case, that might help track down if their is an issue on the titanium side.</p>

							<p>Yea I get this all the time.. frustrating, because then people start clicking and clicking and clicking and sometimes an uncaught exception occurs and the app falls over. Great huh.</p>

										<p><p>Matt, I noticed that I don&#39;t see this behavior when I install the KitchenSink app on my device. The code structure for my app is different as I have taken the approach of putting everything into a single context.  Can I send you my code to take a look?</p>

							<p>I&#39;ll give you an example of how the scenario looks at the moment.</p>
<ul>
<li>app.js</li>
<li>New Window -&gt; Login</li>
<li>New Window -&gt; Split Window</li>
<li>Master Window -&gt; Contains 1 Image (320x90) and 4-7 Labels</li>
<li>Detail Window -&gt; Contains one image 704x704</li>
<li>(Click on Label in Master View -&gt; New Window Opens)</li>
<li>New Modal Window -&gt; Contains Images (representing gallery)</li>
<li>Close Modal Window</li>
<li>— Delay of a few seconds —</li>
<li>(Put app, on an iPad, not in the simulator, into the background, leave a while and come back, and you experience this delay).</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#39;s effectively a perfect scenario to replicate this, as that&#39;s, element by element, one of the apps that produces this (but effectively all apps seem to experience this, and they all use different sources!).</p>

							<p>I haven&#39;t bothered because it would be a fairly inconclusive test seeing as eliminating the kitchen sink won&#39;t prove it&#39;s the code or the framework or the iOS.  Too many variables to make an accurate analysis.</p>

										<p><p>Gotcha.  I&#39;ve recently adopted the practice of coding my applications in a single Javascript context which is different from the way the KitchenSink is implemented. I&#39;m wondering if this has any impact…</p>
