			<p>As an Information Science student, geek and household hacker I was amazed by Titanium Mobile. I participated in a webinar and was even more amazed! So I downloaded Studio as soon as it was released.</p>
<p>I saw that &quot;mobile debugging&quot; was a premium feature, but guessed that was just for debugging on device. Then I realized debugging was disabled all together. But why? How can you build and more importantly learn effectively without such a fundamental feature for any IDE?</p>
<p>I don&#39;t want to seem cocky or anything (more nerd sadness than nerd rage). I have a few ideas in my head but your &quot;indie&quot; subscription just doesn&#39;t fit my current budget. I could always develop native iOS apps with Obj-C, but I&#39;d feel much better without the lock-in :)</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

							<p>Our old(er) Titanium Developer did not have application debugging, so it is still an upgrade. The community (aka free) Titanium Studio does still have a console that outputs data and errors just fine. If you have any questions, or have any issues, please feel free to let us know :) We are always listening to the feedback from the community! :)</p>

							<p>Everyone has bills to pay and they feel that charging for debugging is they way to pay theirs. Its not impossible to develop mobile apps with just the free tools.</p>
