							<p>Anyone have an answer to this?? I have built a brand new Mac environment, and got this error on it also. My previous environment had been running for over a year and started doing this – after 3 days, I built a new Mac, and first compile for iOS - same error.</p>

							<p>I am having the same issue, and I am looking for resolution.  My studio setup had been working for a few months, but after an update to both studio and the SDK, I have been unable to build anything in Studio and get it to deploy to an iOS device (including through iTunes).  </p>
<p>First, I am working on an application that we began development on a few months back that is using a previous version of the SDK. I am trying to get this to work.  Versions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Titanium Studio – latest version</li>
<li>SDK - 1.8.2 (last updated version)</li>
<li>XCode - version 4.2<br>(Per the compatibility matrix, this should work, and I have two developers adjacent to me who have these versions and are able to build the project without errors).</li>
</ul>
<p>Since this setup is not working, I have tried other things:<br>I have tried SDK version 2.1.2 GA (and others).  I have tried Xcode 4.2.1, and 4.3.  I have tried pasting the &quot;resources&quot; folder into a new project.  The project runs on the simulator.  I have tried creating a new project (e.g., Titanium Mobile project –&gt; Single Window Application) from the template.</p>
<p>I always get the following error:</p>
<p>[ERROR] Error: Traceback (most recent call last):<br>  File &quot;&#x2F;Users&#x2F;blah&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx&#x2F;2.1.2.GA&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;builder.py&quot;, line 1534, in main<br>    execute_xcode(&quot;iphoneos%s&quot; % iphone_version,args,False)<br>  File &quot;&#x2F;Users&#x2F;blah&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx&#x2F;2.1.2.GA&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;builder.py&quot;, line 1215, in execute_xcode<br>    output = run.run(args,False,False,o)<br>  File &quot;&#x2F;Users&#x2F;blah&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx&#x2F;2.1.2.GA&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;run.py&quot;, line 41, in run<br>    sys.exit(rc)<br>SystemExit: 65</p>
<p>What is the root cause of this issue?</p>

							<p>Hi guys, try this solution first for this kind of problem, Update your Markdown parser</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-number">1</span>: Download <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> latest release <span class="hljs-built_in">from</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">https</span>://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2
<span class="hljs-number">2</span>: Unzip <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> resulting download*
<span class="hljs-number">3</span>: Using <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> setup.py script <span class="hljs-operator">in</span> <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">directory</span> that was created <span class="hljs-built_in">from</span> expanding <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> zip <span class="hljs-built_in">file</span> you downloaded, install <span class="hljs-operator">with</span> `sudo python setup.py install`

<span class="hljs-number">4</span>:Re-run build.py
</code></pre><p>then clean your project and try rebuild, this solution mostly help with 3rd party modules. but may resolve issue with updated Titanium SDK as well.</p>

										<p><p>this problem is related to configuration not related to module but could be due to those as well. i tried both the options the options but working fine at my end.</p>
<p>can any guy provide steps to reproduce the problem. then i can look for it.</p>
<p>share your MAC version, titanium SDK version, iOS SDK version, Xcode version and steps what you did when this error happened?</p>
<p>any third party module name and configuration required for it, also if used.</p>
<p><strong>one generic solution is, check the build folder and Xcode project generated. if yes generated then open that in Xcode and check the log messages and put them here for more clarity about error.</strong></p>
<p>As i also saw many developers are facing this issue now a days.</p>

										<p><p>Xcode version 4.2 Build 4D99</p>
<p>OSX v10.7.3</p>

<p>(Let me know if there are any other versions that you need)</p>
<p>I have tried other versions of the Titanium SDK, and I can also switch to Xcode 4.3, but the info above is targeting the same setup as our other developers.  I get the same error regardless of version.  To re-create, I simple open a new mobile project (using single window template), and try a &quot;Distribute-Apple iTunes Store.&quot;</p>
<p>I am not using any third party modules.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Mike, surely i will try to look at this issue, but one question i would like ask here that may not be relevant to problem reported here with titanium SDK version 1.8.3?</p>
<p>Is there any specific requirement to stay with titanium SDK 1.8.3?, as earlier also many developers reported issue for this and with some details trying Xcode as well. but after a while they reported that with version its working fine. so can you try with 2.1.3.GA the latest version of Titanium SDK if possible.</p>

										<p><p>Ashish,</p>
<p>My problem may be a little different - as I was on 2.1.2GA when this happened, and it still exists on 2.1.3GA. In my case, if I start a new project it is fine, however, the existing project that we have been developing for the past 8 months will only build DROID and extremely large to restart as a new project (however, I am working on that this week to let you know).</p>
<p>I will try your solution this afternoon also.</p>

										<p><p>I just tried building a new project with 2.1.2, and 2.1.3, and I receive the same error message.  I restarted Titanium studio and did a project &quot;clean&quot; between each attempt.  The project is just a new mobile project created with the &quot;single window application&quot; template.</p>
<p>It is creating the deployable &quot;app&quot; file.  I am able to open the project in Xcode, it is building without errors, and I am able to create an &quot;ipa&quot; file.  I have had a breakthrough – I was previously unable to install to a device via iTunes, but if I eject the device and reconnect, the app installs fine (that part seems to be a separate problem).</p>
<p>At this point, I am still getting the errors at the end of the build process, but I can at least deploy a test app to a device.  I will try with our full application and see if it works.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Mike, if you are able to build <strong>ipa file</strong> using Xcode then it seems like problem is with keychain access and my suggestion is that try deleting all your mobile provisioning profile and .p12 certificate from keychain, organizer and titanium studio. try fresh adding them and then try directly from Titanium, many time it resolved the issue.</p>

										<p><p>Hi to all,</p>
<p>please check following error possibility for solution.</p>
<p>1) Try to find out not printable or non permitted character or special character in the Tiapp.xml file.</p>
<p>2) Try to remove multiple line break from your Tiapp.xml file and remove linebreak if possible.<br> for more information <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;133742&#x2F;cant-run-my-app-anymore-on-ios-simulator">see this thread</a>, it also contain open issue link for jira also.</p>
<p>3) Remove all image from your project then check if error is still there? sometime it gives error because of faulty image</p>
<p>4) Try to find out not printable  or non permitted or special character in your file name.</p>
<p>most of time the error is related to Tiapp.xml but try to figure out exact problem in your project. if you got any success then please share it so other can get guidance from your experience.</p>

<p>I said you that i had the same problem.</p>
<p>I looked the build log into the folder build in your app.</p>
