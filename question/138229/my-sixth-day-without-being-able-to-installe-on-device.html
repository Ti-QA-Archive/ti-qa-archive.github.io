			<p>I just renew my Apple Dev account for the 3 rd year, 3 years using Titanium…but now I&#39;m stucked with the retro-vintage-out of order Titanium Studio that refuse to install on device.<br>I triple checked almost everything from profiles, to certs and XCode version but I&#39;m still with this error. (simulator is OK, same credential are working perfectly on another computer).<br>I&#39;ve been looking everywhere on the internet and neither XCode or Ti Studio would allow me to installe on device.<br>If someone could help (Paying support is pretty weird to obtain from Appcelerator crew as they don&#39;t publish the support prices), this is my error.</p>

							<div><p>I have the same issue. Cannot build to device ever since upgrading to Xcode 4.3. My code in my Titanium project has not changed, so the error must be environment related. There are about a dozen other posts on the QA forums from users having this same issue. Has anyone solved it yet? Appcelerator, can you please investigate this issue and offer some suggestions?</p>

							<div><p>I finally solved this issue and I can now build to device. In my case, I investigated build.log and found the following error being thrown (but it was never printing to the debug console in Titanium Studio): <code>UnterminatedRegularExpression() jspacker.UnterminatedRegularExpression.</code></p>
<p>My offending code was:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-regexp">/regex_pattern_here/</span>.test(subject);
</code></pre><p>Changing it to this fixed the issue:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> pattern = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">RegExp</span>(<span class="hljs-regexp">/regex_pattern_here/</span>);
pattern.test(subject);
</code></pre><p>Maybe Appcelerator changed something recently with how javascript is minified? In any case, if you&#39;re having this problem I suggest you review the bottom of iphone&#x2F;build&#x2F;build.log right before <code>** BUILD FAILED **</code> because it contains additional error messages that do not make it to the Titanium Studio debug console.</p>

							<p>I have certs and provs for 3 of our own accounts + because we do outside work, certs&#x2F;provs for many of our clients.  The last time something like this happened on one of our Macs, removed all the provs from within xCode, made sure the files themselves were gone as well.</p>
<p>The next step I don&#39;t remember (and will write down if there is a next time) was if we started a new project and it made TiStudio reset all that it knew about provs, or if we deleted the file in {project_folder}&#x2F;.settings that contains all the prov mapping.</p>

										<p><p>To isolate, clean your project. build for simulator.  In the build folder, open the Xcode project file in Xcode. Try to build to the device from there.</p>

							<p>Open the build in xcode, have your device plugged in, and then choose iOS device in the Run menu, and it will install.</p>

							<p>Last time I renewed my apple license, both the old and the new were active and installed simultaneously in my mac. This is due to the license is renewed a few days before the other expires, and this causes a lot of problems, because if you try to use a duplicated certificate  compilation fails.</p>
<p>Ensure you do not have duplicated certificates installed in your key chain. Even better, delete both (if both are installed), create a new certificate and regenerate the provisioning profile.</p>
<p>Keep the keychain tool open and just before compile from Titanium Studio be sure that the old certificate is not installed again (I found that sometimes is installed automatically I don&#39;t know how). If you see that the old one appears, delete it ASAP. This way the compiler will use the new (and unique) certificate. A bit tricky, but this is what I had to do.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your help, I pretty much cleared all the certs, but it doesn&#39;t work. I just wait for a fix from Appcellerator, but I&#39;m not sure at all that I&#39;ll get this solved soon. I tried to contact the support in order to have a paid support but they disn&#39;t answer. Too bad!!!</p>
