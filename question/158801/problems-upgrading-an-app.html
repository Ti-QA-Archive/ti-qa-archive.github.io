			<h1>problems upgrading an app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m trying to update an app that I created a year and a half ago. Everything went fine, until tried to upload it to iTunes Connect. I got an error saying my &quot;binary is not optimized for iPhone 5,&quot; but I don&#39;t want it to be if that means I lose support for older devices.</p>
<p>I&#39;m using iOS SDK 5.0 and I&#39;ve got Xcode 4.2.1 installed. Do I have to upgrade Xcode? I was hoping to avoid that, in case it creates new problems.</p>

							<p>This is not a Titanium problem.  This is between the developer, you, and Apple.  Apple requires developers to keep up with tooling.  That means updated versions of xCode, OSX, etc.</p>
<p><strong>but I don&#39;t want it to be if that means I lose support for older devices.</strong></p>
<p>You don&#39;t really have a choice in the matter if you are working with apples store.  You can now upload a newer binary that may not support the older devices, and the older binary can remain.  Check your iTunes Connect account for the information regarding this new (last 45 days) feature.</p>
<p>I do understand your pain though.  We had an app with updated features that we held for 6 months so as not to lose the older users.  The new feature was a pleasant surprise.</p>

										<p><p>My mention of maintaining compatibility with older devices was not my main point and unfortunately took my question away from my main point: I developed an app just over a year ago that uploaded fine, but now an update is rejected. Does this mean I have to upgrade Xcode, or is their some other thing I can do <em>in Titanium</em> that will make this app once again uploadable? I just want to figure out the easiest way to post my update.</p>

										<p><p>if the update was built with older tooling, you will need to update the tooling.  At a point after new tooling is pushed out, Apple stops accepting uploads built using the older ones.</p>
