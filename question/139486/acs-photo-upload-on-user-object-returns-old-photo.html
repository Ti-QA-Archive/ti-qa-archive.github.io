			<h1>ACS photo upload on user object returns old photo</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve implemented the uploading of a new user photo when updating the User object using the REST api. It gets accepted and the User object is returned, however, it contains the old photo that was already present prior to updating. When I do another call to retrieve the user, I do get the new photo, also when not already processed. Along with the <code>user_id</code> and <code>photo</code> I&#39;m also sending <code>photo_sync_sizes[]=medium_500</code> to synchronously process the image.</p>
<p>Does anyone know what could be going on? I really want to prevent having to do another API call as the single call is slow enough of itself. Cheers!</p>

							<p>the image needs to be processed so there is probably a slight delay before it will be available.</p>
<p>i would suggest just using the local copy as a placeholder to give the illusion that it downloaded the correct version of the photo</p>

										<p><p>But then what is the synchronous processing of photos about? That suggests that the processing is a synchronous operation and you should retrieve the right url straight away. I&#39;m using cloud services to not have to save a local copy at all, that would make the entire thing obsolete. If synchronous is what&#39;s offered, it should be synchronous.</p>

							<p>Hi Cory,</p>
<p>Agree if synchronous is whats offered then thats what should be delivered. But I guess with all things new we have to adapt and find a workaround, </p>
<p>I came across extacly the same issue. One workaround is to add a delay function so that when you update your details it will wait for some time until your viewimage is updated.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">setTimeout(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
    code <span class="hljs-keyword">here</span>();
}, <span class="hljs-number">2000</span>);
</code></pre>
