			<h1>Application crashes on startup</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>On Mac OS X 10.7.5 (Latest updates) I downloaded Titanium Studio <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;titanium-studio.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;latest&#x2F;Titanium_Studio.dmg">latest</a> as of this posting. I opened the DMG and dragged the application to the Application folder. Then I ran the application and said it was ok to run (new apps need a confirmation to run). I pops up a dialog saying there was an error and to look in the log file which I&#39;ve attached to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;4e9fe13f2ef2980cb23b">this gist</a>. Seems related to the app unable to load the xerces SAX XML parser.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve renamed <code>&amp;#x2F;Library&amp;#x2F;Java&amp;#x2F;Extensions</code> and <code>&amp;#x2F;System&amp;#x2F;Library&amp;#x2F;Java&amp;#x2F;Extensions</code> to new directories (<code>~&amp;#x2F;Library&amp;#x2F;Java&amp;#x2F;Extensions</code> did not exist) and the same error log is printed every time.</p>
<p>I just started a new job and need to get my Titanium running to start code. Please can someone help?</p>

							<div><p>Using Mac OS X 10.7.5 (all software updates installed). You download the latest mac version of studio (follow the download links and eventually click on mac). it downloads a dmg file which you open and are presented with two files. one is the Titanium app and the other one is an alias to Application folder. You drag and drop the app to the Applications folder. Then you open the application <em>from</em> the Application folder. OS X asks if it is safe to run this application and you click ok. Then the splash screen shows and a popup saying &quot;An error has occured, see this log file: …&quot; <strong>then it quits</strong> You can see the full log file at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;4e9fe13f2ef2980cb23b</p>

							<p>I don&#39;t think this is related but I can no longer reproduce the problem. I recall a few possibilities. I first created a new user and tried <em>with</em> success. Returning to the other user I also install the command line titanium package from npm (<code>npm install titanium -g</code>). (Used the homebrew version of node). After this things started working properly. Unknown if those changes are related or not.</p>
