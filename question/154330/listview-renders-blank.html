			<h1>ListView renders blank</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am using the Titanium mobile SDK (3.1.1 GA) with the &quot;bleeding edge&quot; Alloy framework as I wanted to take advantage of full support for data binding and ListViews.  (I am migrating from using the TableView, as performance of that component was not acceptable.)  My app is iPhone-only, and I&#39;ve been testing against the simulator (running iOS 6.1) and a physical device (also iOS 6.1).  Build platform is OSX 10.8.</p>
<p>The main app interface is comprised of a tab group with two tabs.  The first presents a video player and video details.  The second tab contains a scrollable view with three pages, each comprised of a single ListView bound to a corresponding collection in Alloy.Collections.  These collections are populated by calling the reset method on the collection, passing it an array of objects that are retrieved via a web service call.  The default tab is the video player, so these are normally populated before the user would switch to the tab.</p>
<p>The symptom I&#39;m seeing is that with a fair amount of frequency, one or more of these video lists appear blank.  However, I can see that the ListSection does have the full collection of ListDataItems and the ListView will actually be sized as if it contains all of the individual ListItems.  However, there is no rendering of any of the items on the template, and the ListView doesn&#39;t appear to respond to any click events, either.</p>
<p>The only workaround I&#39;ve found is to add a listener in my controller for the &quot;reset&quot; event of the collection.  In there, I need to have some code of &quot;substance,&quot; such as a call to Ti.API.info() or a loop that runs a sufficient number of times.  I&#39;m using a do while loop that just increments a variable 100000 times right now, which takes about a millisecond or two.  Somehow, the extra delay created by the secondary processing of this reset event in the controller allows for my ListViews to render correctly each time.  However, this workaround really doesn&#39;t sit well with me, and I&#39;d love to know if this had been encountered by anyone else or if there are any other suggestions that I could try that don&#39;t feel as much like a hack.</p>

							<p>Well, I created a stripped-down test app which proved to be instructive since it guided me to the solution.  I was calling reset() on the collection and then, if the collection wasn&#39;t empty, I was using scrollToIndex(0, 0) on the ListView to move to the top of the list.  This seemed to be causing the problem.  If I scroll to the top first and then reset the collection with the new data, I don&#39;t run into this rendering problem.  I don&#39;t know enough about the inner workings of the framework to venture a guess as to why calling the scroll after the reset would cause these symptoms, but I feel much more comfortable with this resolution than an artificially introduced delay.  It must have something to do with exactly when the reset event is handled by the ListView relative to when the scroll occurs.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Ted,</p>
<p>Glad to hear you came to a better resolution. I would have to venture into the SDK to see exactly how it is done but as you guessed, I believe also it may have something to do with the rendering of listViews with Collections. I know that when I get stuck on a bug I always like to narrow down the issue and 90% of the time it fixes my problem. Again, glad to hear you found your solution and don&#39;t hesitate to respond here if anything else comes back up. </p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Carter</p>

							<p>You shouldn&#39;t put a ListView inside a ScrollView because the ListView class implements its own scrolling and it just doesn&#39;t receive gestures because they all are handled by the parent ScrollView. I strongly recommend you to simplify your layout somehow. This is more than likely the cause of your strange behavior. Is there a certain reason why you must have this functionality? Would you consider having views inside the header and footer locations of the listView? This seems like a more logical approach that coincides this good mobile practices.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Carter</p>

										<p><p>To be clear, I&#39;m talking about Titanium.UI.ScrollableView, not Titanium.UI.ScrollView.  The reason I did that is because the same screen on our Android app has fragments for each video list, and the user simply swipes to the left or right to switch between them.  It provides an easy, elegant, and intuitive interface.  Using the ScrollableView in the Titanium API provided the closest match to this same design.  It seems to me that trying to replicate this through other means would only complicate the layout, not simplify it, as I would have to handle all touch events, animations, etc. on my own instead of using the view specifically designed for that purpose.</p>

										<p><p>Ted,</p>
<p>Sorry for misreading your post, listViews inside scrollableViews should work fine. As for encountering a similar issue as to what you are describing unfortunately I have not, but your post may get a bit more traction if you post a sample code that demonstrates the issue at had. A simple test case with the bare bones functionality to demonstrate the issue would help someone see exactly how you are doing what you are describing and could possible display a possible bug that is the culprit of this issue. If you post a sample code I will be sure to review it and if I see an apparent bug I would be happy to report it to engineering for them to fix.</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience with this,</p>
<p>Carter</p>
