		<section>
			<p>Hi there</p>
<p>Now that Microsoft has opened up for developer preview of the upcoming windows 8, which is partly build towards apps: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thisismynext.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;09&#x2F;13&#x2F;microsoft-releases-windows-8-developers-preview-announces-windows-store&#x2F;</p>
<p>What is Appcelerators plans regarding the API support of building win8 apps?</p>
<p>And the community, How many of us believe that this could be either the next big thing, or just a great opportunity to build apps for another great platform?</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Mads</p>

							<div><p>As the win8 developer guide says:</p>
<p>With Windows 8 you can leverage your existing skills and code assets to create great experiences for<br>your customers.</p>
<p>• Web developers can use their HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript skills to build native applications for Windows.</p>

										<p><p>Does it matter? </p>
<p>I like iOS better than Android, but my customers cares about being present in every platform. Even the onces Microsoft creates.  </p>
<p>The point is: Would Appcelerator consider supporting win8 ?</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m a user, so I can&#39;t answer for them.  That said, I personally doubt there is enough information available yet to make an informed analysis of how well the Titanium paradigm and API set would transition to Win8.</p>

							<p>In Windows 8 JavaScript is just another language like C#, VB or C++. The only difference is that you use JavaScript along with HTML and the others along with XAML. This has nothing to do with the .NET framework, they build a layer above the Kernel called WinRT, which is installed together with Windows. You can access it with JavaScript the same as with C++! Blend is intergrated into VS and has HTML&#x2F;CSS-equivalents to XAML. So if you do a so called Metro-style app you get a touch-centric application that runs on every device where Win8 is running, be it a mobile, a tablet or a PC.</p>
<p>This is the typical Microsoft &quot;We come late, but we come&quot;. If you want to  jump on that bandwagon TiDesktop is not an option anymore on the Windows platform and there is practically no need that TiMobile compiles to Win8, as you already can use JS and HTML for those apps. So no, I think Appcelerator does not support it.</p>
