			<h1>Cross Platform PDF Viewer with page flipping</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, I need to show pdf documents with page flip effect, zoom in&#x2F;out and search&#x2F;highlight features for both iOS and Android. Is it possible? If yes then what would be the best way to do this? I tried appcelerator&#39;s PageFlip module from the marketplace but it is iOS only and doesn&#39;t have zooming and searching features plus it doesn&#39;t seems to be supported on titanium 2.x mobilesdk. I get error when using with SDK 2.1.4. Any help in this regard is much appreciated. Thanks.</p>

							<div><p>You appear to want loads of features, seems like a big ask from the community.</p>
<p>But if anyone does know - I would also love this :-)</p>
<p>The PageFlip for iOS module does work with 2.x as I have had this working on a test app and an iPad.  It is slow with big PDF files and especially so when retina is involved - but for the price - very good.</p>

							<div><p>I know this is a long list but actually I am searching for almost 3 days on this topic. I thought someone else might ever had to do this before so I was asking about any resources, marketplace modules that could help in this regard that&#39;s why I posted this question. For the PageFlip I can&#39;t find a usage example. I&#39;ve tried in the following way but nothing shows up:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in">var</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">self</span>= Ti<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>UI<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>createWindow()

<span class="hljs-built_in">var</span> PageFlip = <span class="hljs-keyword">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'ti.pageflip'</span>);

<span class="hljs-built_in">var</span> flipView = Ti<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>PageFlip<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>createView({
    pdf: <span class="hljs-string">'pdfs/Julio.pdf'</span>,
    enableBuiltInGuestures: <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>,
})

<span class="hljs-built_in">self</span><span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>add(flipView)
</code></pre><p>Am I doing the right way?</p>

							<p>This is a pretty tall order. I don&#39;t know of any cross platform viewers with even the page flip. And maybe only 1 or 2 iOS viewers that have even a few of the features that you&#39;re looking for. The <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.binpress.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;pdftouch-sdk-for-appcelerator&#x2F;1162">PDFTouchKit</a> for iOS might come close to most of those features. But for Android, I haven&#39;t seen much beyond just a simple pdf view. Regardless, a cross-platform answer may not exist for what you want. You&#39;ll either have to create one, or find 2 different viewers to implement.</p>

										<p><p>Well, if you&#39;re going to create this yourself, it will have to be done with native modules. So, the first place you&#39;re going to have to start is <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Extending_Titanium_Mobile">Module Development Guides</a>. From there, you&#39;re literally going to have to step through creating each module for each platform adding the features one at a time. You would want to start by just getting a simple pdf viewer up and running.</p>
