			<h1>Getting currently opened window when window is opened using exports</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hi</p>
<p>I have a method to show an alert for notifications or errors.This is a common method throughout the app and uses the Ti.UI.createAlertDialog to show an alert.Now according to new requirements I have been asked to create a custom alert.This alert will be ideally a view added to whichever window it is called from.This will require an additional window parameter in the method.But then I will have to change it everywhere in the app .Is there a way by which I can get the current window from the showAlert method?</p>

							<p>As per my understanding, make a view and add all required elements as you need for alert message add save it on some custom js. Now wherever(window) you need to display that alert view, just call that view and add it to current window and after user take some action, remove that view from that window.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your reply Raj!! The problem will still persist.I will still have to do that in every file.There are around 250 method calls in the application for showing alerts.</p>

							<p>I ultimately solved it by creating a transparent window in that same method.Then adding the view with alert to that window.</p>
