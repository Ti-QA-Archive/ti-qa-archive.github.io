			<h1>&#34;Ti.UI.orientation is deprecated since 1.7.2&#34; so how do you deal with &#34;FACE_UP&#34;?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have an app that requires me to change positioning on items when I rotate between portrait and landscape. I&#39;m currently using Ti.UI.orientation as it&#39;s differentiates between portrait and landscape when the device is flat on it&#39;s back where as the suggested Ti.Gestures orientation detection does not.</p>
<p>What is the supposed best practice for handling Face Up while migrating away from Ti.UI.orientation?</p>
<p>My app is for iOS and I&#39;m currently using 3.2.0.GA, but I think this applies to everyone.</p>

							<p>If you are simply asking how to determine whether the orientation is portrait&#x2F;landscape <strong>and</strong> facedown&#x2F;faceup? </p>
<p>Then you can use the following methods; <code>Ti.Gesture.isPortrait();</code>, <code>Ti.Gesture.isLandscape();</code>, <code>Ti.Gesture.isFaceDown();</code>, <code>Ti.Gesture.isFaceUp();</code>, all of which provide booleans.</p>
<p>How you implement this would be up to you, eg. conditional statements.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

										<p><p>Are you suggesting that if a device was in portrait mode before you set it face up both isPortrait() and isFaceUp() would return true?</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think this matches my experience, but I may have to retest this.</p>

										<p><p>Sorry, I have just checked the documentation, <code>isFaceDown</code> and <code>isFaceUp</code> are blackberry only. </p>
<p>But <code>isPortrait</code> and <code>isLandscape</code> methods should work cross platform.</p>
<p>A better solution would be to use the <code>orientationchange</code> eventListener</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Ti.Gesture.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'orientationchange'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span></span>{
    Ti.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">'orientation = '</span> + e.orientation);
});
</code></pre><p>You can then use the Titanium UI orientation constants to determine the orientation, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Gesture-event-orientationchange">Titanium.Gesture-event-orientationchange</a></p>

										<p><p>I use that listener to check for change, but e.orientation is either 1 (portrait) or 5 (face up) not both, so you have to fall back to Ti.UI.orientation, which supposedly is long deprecated.</p>
<p>If I&#39;m missing something please give a more complete answer. Because I think you&#39;re missing the point that the proposed method for replacing Ti.UI.orientation (not your proposed, the official proposed)  fails completely when trying to determine if a face up oriented device is actually displaying landscape or portrait content.</p>

										<p><p>After looking into this, it is not possible to detect multiple orientation at the same time. I realise I misunderstood your initial question, but I have tested this myself and spoken to colleagues about this.</p>
<p>Sorry I could not be any help.</p>

										<p><p>No worries, I&#39;m just glad I&#39;m not crazy. This seems like something that appcelerator needs to address if they actually plan on get rid of Ti.UI.orientation, otherwise you&#39;ll always have to keep track of both the previous Ti.Gestures orientation and the current Ti.Gestures orientation so that you can know that a device that is currently face up used to be either portrait or landscape.</p>
