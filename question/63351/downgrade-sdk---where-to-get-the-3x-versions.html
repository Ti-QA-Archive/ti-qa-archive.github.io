			<h1>Downgrade SDK - where to get the 3.x versions?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve developed an app using Titanium on Windows. It compiles and works fine on the Android emulator. I have it running on my Droid and it&#39;s working just fine there too.</p>
<p>I have a Mac now so I can port to iPhone. The exact same code won&#39;t compile &amp; run correctly for either iPhone or Android via Titanium on the Mac. The app gets stuck in an endless loop determining the lat&#x2F;long &amp; geocoding the address when compiled on the Mac. (There&#39;s no loop in the code, I think the event listener is just firing over and over.)</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried a few different versions of the 1.4.x nightly builds. The Developer came with the 1.2.0 SDK. Where can I get the 1.3.x versions? Maybe it&#39;s more of the troubles others have reported with the 1.4.x line. I&#39;ve look on git, the downloads page, nightly builds page.</p>

<p>Did you simply copy the project directory over from the Windows to the Mac machine, and then import it the project in TiDev?</p>
<p>I&#39;d recommend creating a brand new, blank project on the mac, and then copying over your code and assets from the Resources folder of the original folder to the respective folders of your new project.</p>
<p>This may or may not work, but it&#39;s worth a try.  :)</p>

										<p><p>Hal, a newer nightly build eventually solved this issue. The app is working, almost finished now using the 1.4.2 SDK. I was having some issues with the 1.5 branch, though my recent changes might have things working right with it too. I haven&#39;t checked.</p>
<p>For a while I use sharing my project directory on Windows and loading it remotely from my mac. That was working fine. Over time, I ended up with so many if(platform=android) type statements that my code was getting pretty slow. I eventually just copied the files to the mac &amp; imported as a new project. That worked fine, btw. I now have two &quot;branches&quot; of my code.</p>
