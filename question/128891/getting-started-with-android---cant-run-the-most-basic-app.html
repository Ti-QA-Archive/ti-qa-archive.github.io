			<h1>Getting started with Android - can&#39;t run the most basic app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve followed the steps <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;doc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;mobile-build-osx">HERE</a> to setup my system for android development on a mac as best I could, but I still can&#39;t even run the default &#39;two tab&#39; app that is created when I start a new mobile android project. (The one that says &#39;I am window 1&#39;, &#39;I am window 2&#39;).</p>
<p>I am able to add the Android SDK and target my app to the android platform, but when I try to run the app in the emulator, the emulator runs and the app never shows up. I just get a phone interface. I&#39;ve looked in the apps folder of the emulated phone and it&#39;s just not there. I&#39;m not sure if this is because I haven&#39;t properly completed any necessary steps in configuring my system. The article linked above seems to be way out of date – especially the section under &quot;Add the ADK to your PATH&quot;. The folder &#39;android-1.5&#39; is not on my system. </p>
<p>Also, the under the section &quot;Verify the ADK Install&quot;, the command &#39;aapt v&#39; reports back &#39;command not found&#39;. The second command &#39;android list&#39; works, but it lists Android 4.0&#x2F;API lvl 14, rather than Android 1.5&#x2F;API lvl 3 (which is why I&#39;m thinking the instructions are out of date).</p>
<p>Any suggestions are welcome. Basically, I need to know why the emulator is running fine, but my app isn&#39;t running on it.</p>

							<p>I don&#39;t have a specific answer for you. You may want to try <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Quick+Start#QuickStart-MobileSDKInstallationandConfiguration">HERE</a>. Once you are there, you can click underneath &quot;Installing development tools for Android&quot; to expand the details.</p>

										<p><p>One more thing, lately, some users have reported having to install all available SDK platforms 1.6 thru 4.0 before they had any success.</p>

										<p><p>Your first link wasn&#39;t much help as far as installation on a mac, but you were right about the other SDKs. For anyone else having the same problems, there&#39;s a reference table <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Titanium+Compatibility+Matrix">HERE</a> that shows the min&#x2F;max Android SDK you can use depending on the version of Titanium you&#39;re running.</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve found the Android Emulator to be a POS…Usually when it just sits there, I open the Activity Monitor (start Spotlight and just start typing it), and then kill the &quot;adb&quot; process.  Leave the Emulator running, and try and run it from Titanium again.</p>

										<p><p>I agree wholeheartedly about the emulator. I had read similar posts about keeping the emulator running, but found that the compiler wouldn&#39;t be able to &#39;find&#39; an available emulator if I didn&#39;t close it. I&#39;ll try out your tip to just kill the process.</p>

							<p>Be sure to check -all- of your console windows (in trace mode) in Ti Studio too.. that&#39;s where I found my answer.  As always with Titanium for me, my problems were permissions related.</p>
