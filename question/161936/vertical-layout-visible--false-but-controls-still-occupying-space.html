							<p>Hi</p>
<p>When you specify visible to be false it simply hides the &quot;thing&quot; from view - it does not remove it from the display other than its visibility.  The top, left, bottom, right, width and height all remain exactly the same as they were before you made it invisible.</p>
<p>So when you add a view to a parent view with layout set to vertical, simply saying &quot;hide&quot; does not change the layout, nor would setting horizontal.</p>
<p>This is the normal behaviour and is not an error.  If you have error worked with html&#x2F;cc then the visible property there is the same here.  Whereas the css display none would do what you what in html&#x2F;css there is no direct equivalent here as the two environments are completely different.</p>
<p>The only way to free up that space is to either remove the item in question from the parent view or be sneaky.</p>
<p>The sneaky way (although not tested this) would be to add your child view and set the width and height to be zero, this would then remove the size of the view from the parent view.  It might be more manageable to wrap the child view in a container and apply the width and height of that - this way the real child is simply clipped and should not affect any complicated layouts you may have inside the client.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, I eventually did exactly that:</p>
<p>Added a parent view and made the layout composite, set the top and left properties for each child view and I was good to go.</p>
<p>I understand the behavior, I just wanted to make sure I wasn&#39;t missing some &quot;magical property&quot; that could have made the above easier.</p>

										<p><p>No - you had not missed anything magical, there are few things like this that would make things a lot easier for us all - fingers crossed they come in an update in the future.</p>
