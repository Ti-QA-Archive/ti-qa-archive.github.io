							<p>I have also faced this problem many times in Titanium Developer tool. After restarting some times it start printing (only some times). This happens to me many times. I don&#39;t know why this is happening. I have never got solution to this but i found another way to check my console logs. </p>
<p>Titanium is also printing logs in log file on hard drive. I don&#39;t know path of that file on winows but in mac you can find that log file in your project directory of iOS simulator. I mean that library&#x2F;application support&#x2F; ios simulator ….. path.</p>

							<p>those functions print in console the argument you pass to them, nothing more, nothing less. The only difference is the &quot;log level&quot; of each of them (and the color used to print). You can set up the log level in Run Configurations menu.</p>
<p>If this does not have sense for you, send a sample code of what are you doing and what do you expect, maybe I&#39;m misunderstanding your question.</p>

							<p>I have set the settings run configurations—&gt;Log level-&gt;trace, but I can&#39;t find info I expected on console. The source code is as follows:<br>Ti.API.info(&quot;DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD&quot;);<br>Ti.API.error(&quot;EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE&quot;);<br>Ti.API.debug(&quot;FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF&quot;);</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t find any info , such as DDDDDDDDDDDDDDD, EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE, etc. in the console window.</p>

							<p>If it&#39;s printing in console and if you are using iOS for development than have tried my suggestion ? Check the log file on hard drive, you will definitely get your log over ther. In previous answer i just gave u over view of path where you can find log file but here is exact path,</p>
<p>Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;iPhone Simulator&#x2F;4.0(or your iOS simulator&#x2F;SDK version)&#x2F;Applications&#x2F;your applicaiton&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;<strong>appname</strong>.log</p>
<p>this log file will be same as your console. Check this file. You will be able to see your logs.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your answer. I have found the debug information. It must run the application in the emulator, then the debug information appears.<br>By the way, Could you tell me how I can exit a application with Titanium? I.E. Which api can be called for exit application?</p>

										<p><p>Ohh …. you were trying directly on device. You didn&#39;t mention this thing and yah you can use window.close function and set the attribute of that<br>window, exitOnClose:true.</p>
<p>It will work for android only.</p>

										<p><p>I have tried as you said. But I can&#39;t exit application. I just want to implement the senario: I open some windows, such as three windows, A,B,C. Open A, then open B from A, Open C from B, then I want to close A, B,C when C was closed. How can I do that?</p>
