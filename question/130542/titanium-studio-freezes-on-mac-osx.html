			<h1>Titanium Studio Freezes on Mac OSX</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am new to Titanium Studio, and I have had some problems getting it to run on my Mac. I works flawlessly on my Ubuntu and Windows 7 machines.</p>
<p>I can install the software and install SDK&#39;s no problem, but when I try to create a new project of any type Titanium studio freezes. If i force quit the app and restart it freezes on loading the project.</p>
<p>I have to delete the project directory to get Studio to startup again, but It freezes as soon as I try to create a project.</p>
<p>The version I have is:<br>Titanium Studio, build: 1.0.7.201112281340</p>
<p>any help would be appreciated.</p>

							<div><p>What version of OS X are you using? Try creating a new user account on your system and installing Titanium Studio using that. If it works, then you know there&#39;s just something weird about your user account that is conflicting with Titanium (perhaps a previous installation of Aptana or Eclipse?)</p>

							<p>Ok, so it appears that Git was the problem. Disabling Git has fixed the problem.</p>
