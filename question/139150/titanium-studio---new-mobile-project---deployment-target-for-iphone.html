							<div><p>Missing from your question are a number of important pieces of information. I suggest you take a look at the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Using+Questions+and+Answers">Using Questions and Answers</a> article, specifically the Q&amp;A Question Checklist.  The missing information is critical to reproducing problems in a test environment and often indicates other factors that cause the undesirable outcome you are experiencing.</p>

							<div><p>Thank you for your response.  I did go to Q&amp;A however I didn&#39;t see a Checklist.  I will check this out.  I searched on a variety of strings such as &quot;Deployment Target Iphone&quot; &amp; wasn&#39;t able to find something directly related to my issue.  I understand there are certain requirements for replicating issues.  I am certain that it is my own setup &#x2F; environment that is causing the issue as you have highlighted in your 2nd response below..  Thanks again.</p>

										<p><p>Hi,<br>I am on a Windows PC &amp; I don&#39;t have Xcode installed.<br>I initially started out by registering with Apple Development &amp; was about to install Xcode when I thought I read that you cannot use it on a PC … so then I found Titanium.  I must have read incorrectly &amp; require Xcode to be installed as well.<br>Thank you for your response.</p>

										<p><p>If you have registered with Apple, hate to see you throw good money away.</p>
<p>Take a look at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macincloud.com&#x2F;">macincloud</a> as a possible solution.</p>
<p>You could start with a mac mini, but not really recommended as they are low end systems.</p>
<p>But a system running OSX is required to build and submit iOS apps.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you but it only registered for free as a developer.  I have been trying to locate the free version of xcode but not having much luck :-(<br>Was trying to avoid having to buy a mac yet still want to experience the development of an iphone app.  I appreciate your time &amp; hope I haven&#39;t wasted it.</p>
