			<h1>Facebook like Menu WITH Scrollable Components?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey there…</p>
<p>i am playing around for 2 Days now, and so i wanna ask if anybody did create a facebook like Menu&#x2F;Strucutre for his&#x2F;her App containing scrollable (eg Lists) components on the content.</p>
<p>The Problem is the splitting between &quot;Ok the user wanna scrolls the list&quot; and &quot;ok the user wanna slide off the menu&quot;</p>
<p>I can&#39;t really post my code, so any examples AND experiences are welcome. Even ideas how to achieve this could be great, maybe i have an error in the basic thinking about my menu,</p>
<p>Titanium SDK 3, ios &amp; Android</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Having just completed this myself for a large cross platform project, my solution is a simple one.</p>
<p>Do not worry about it.</p>
<p>By this I mean, leave the opening of the slide menus to the menu buttons that would be placed on the top bar.  Then focus on getting your app complete.  If you are not comfortable with handling the complexities of multiple events on the same views affecting different processes - simply hold off that until the end or version 1.1.</p>
<p>There are lots of things you will have to overcome to ship the app and this is a &quot;rat hole&quot; that you mind yourself down for some time when you could be shipping your app.</p>
<p>Most good apps that use the Facebook style UI, do not actually use the slide to open gesture in the main body as it DRASTICALLY reduces the content windows views you can use, no scrollableViews for example, no zooming&#x2F;scaling images.</p>
<p>If you want a great example of a Facebook style app, that takes the content section up a notch with other interactions, find the German McDonald&#39;s app, it is a great example of what you should focus on.</p>
<p>Concern yourself more with getting the Android version to do the same basic thing.</p>

										<p><p>Also a quick google search will find already created code that gives you a Facebook style UI for appcelerator.  I needed more than they gave, but can be a good starting point.</p>

										<p><p>The problem ist, facebook contain scroll views, too and it works. So for me there have to be a way to solve it.</p>
<p>The mcdonalds app (i use it often^^) is nice, BUT for me … i don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve expected that MCD have the approach and goal to deliever a perfect result. and for ME this isn&#39;t a perfect result.</p>
<p>But of course you are right with finishing the app is a good way to start.</p>

										<p><p>The point I was making - which I think you understand is that there is no easy &quot;one solution fits all&quot; view implementations.  So focusing on having the menu only appearing on a button press is a good way to get the app moving along.  Then come back to the events later on.</p>
<p>You never know in about a month someone might write up their experience fully and with code examples to help solve the problem (might be me).</p>

										<p><p>i&#39;ve solved the problem. ;)</p>
<p>My key error in thnking about it and&#x2F;or adopting other examples&#x2F;Codes is to try handling the drag&#x2F;drop Stuff on the whole view (or in my case window) </p>
<p>i&#39;ve build an environment that allows me to speciify each single item to be able to &quot;drag over and move the whole view&quot; or not. </p>
<p>So, i can &quot;flag&quot; a list as &quot;dragable&quot; but maybe a single button as &quot;not&quot;. That was my apporach earlier, but my structure was wrong so it won&#39;t work.<br>After that worked, the behavier was still very strange. the view jumps around by dragging and so on… Solved this by adjust my code to startDrag, Drag and StopDrag the view.</p>
<p>So over all:<br>I received a solution that worked well for me, looks&#x2F;feels like the facebook-app(which is the best on the market, i think) </p>
<p>Now i have to adjust my settings and Code to run on android as well as on iphone, cause i left this one out for a few days. ^^</p>
