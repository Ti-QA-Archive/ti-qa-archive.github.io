			<p>Does a SSD speed up the build process with TI Studio? Anybody got some experience with this?<br>I&#39;m regularly building apps for on-device testing and this just takes too long for doing it several dozen times per day…</p>

							<p>My impression says YES.<br>On my old MBP (2,2 Dual + HDD) a complete build of my project took 4+ minutes, on my new MBP i7 2.0 SSD it take less than one minute.</p>

							<p>More or less, your computer will run faster but only for processes that require hdd read&#x2F;write.<br>On compiling the app there are this kinds of operations, but the majority is still CPU.</p>
<p>You will have though an improvement because overall the computer will run faster.<br>I had one on my previous MBP and I can tell you is waaaay faster than when I had a normal hdd.</p>

							<p>I have both a standard HD and a SSD in my Mac Book Pro, and I recently moved my titanium studio workspace to the solid state drive to improve speed, and it helped a lot.  I didn&#39;t track it or anything, but it felt like it takes about half the time on the SSD as it did on a standard HDD.</p>
<p>What I would LOVE to be able to actually get working is &quot;LiveTainium&quot;, which I haven&#39;t seen much talk about lately, but seemed like a HUGE timesaver.  I couldn&#39;t get it to work, and would love to see the community try to get it working on the current version of Titianium, as I think it would save me a HUGE amount of development time.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the link for LiveTainium:<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2010&#x2F;12&#x2F;livetanium.html</p>
