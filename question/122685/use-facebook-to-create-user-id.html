			<h1>Use Facebook to create user id</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi. This is a high level question. </p>
<p>I am working on an app that allows the user to create their own ID (user name, etc). For convenience, I would also like to offer logging in with their Facebook ID. I&#39;ve played with the Facebook functionality in Titanium (i.e.: allowing users to post to their FB page through the app) but I&#39;m still not sure if I can use the FB sign-on as a substitute for allowing the user to log on to my app.</p>
<p>To be clear (as I&#39;m probably not explaining this very well), I want users to create their own user name as part of logging in but to save time would like to allow them to log in via their FB sign on. </p>
<p>At the moment I know what content in the database belongs to a user - when they log in I get their user id and return data for that ID, but how would I do this if they logged in via FB?</p>
<p>Does FB return a permanent ID that is valid forever (as long as the person&#39;s FB credentials remain valid)? And I would then store this ID in the database in the place of the existing user ID? </p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>Every FB user has a unique id. You could use that.<br>Or you could use the unique ID of the device itself from Titanium.Platform.</p>
