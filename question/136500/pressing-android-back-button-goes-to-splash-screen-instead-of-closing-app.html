			<h1>Pressing Android back button goes to splash screen instead of closing app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>From within my app the physical android back button works mostly as expected, but pressing it a few times eventually takes the user back to the splash screen instead of closing the app. That is, the splash screen acts as if it was a window within my app.</p>
<p>Any ideas on how to get rid of this and have the app close instead of display the splash screen?</p>

							<p>When you are creating your main window (the one that needs to close the app when the back button is pressed), make sure you set the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.0&#x2F;index.html#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.UI.Window-property-exitOnClose">exitOnClose</a> property to <strong>true</strong> - like this for example:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> mainWindow</span> = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
    title:<span class="hljs-string">"Main window"</span>,
    exitOnClose:<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
});
</code></pre>

										<p><p>What if your app requires multiple end points?  Such as exiting from normal windows prior to logging in, but also from a tabbed application after loggin in?</p>

<p>I have a login window, once you&#39;ve logged in correctly it closes the login window and opens the one with the app content etc. So, if I use this property it will close the app when people logged in correctly :S. What should I do here?<br>Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>Hmmm.  I can only describe how I answered my own question ……</p>
<p>My app now has an &quot;init&quot; window. This is the first window opened by the app.js.  The exit on close setting is there.  On open of this window, I control which route the app takes (login screens or tabbed groups). On the &quot;init&quot; window I set up an app level event listener for &quot;ExitOnClose&quot; which closes the &quot;init&quot; window (and hence the app). In each of the login screen NavGroup (root window only) and tabbed groups, I listen for the android back button (android:back) and fire off the &quot;ExitOnClose&quot; if I want to.  This has multiple benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>It traps the android back button and I control what happens (exit app or do something else)</li>
<li>I can exit the app in android at any time from anywhere by firing it. </li>
<li>I can have multiple &quot;tab&quot; groups that I can switch between without the app closing in android if I choose. Keeping in mind that you can ony open one tabbed group at a time in Android. </li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, hope this helps … </p>
<p>Also, I had to make the background of the init window the same as the splash screen since it is shown sometimes for a very short time and I like seemless &quot;loading&quot;.</p>
