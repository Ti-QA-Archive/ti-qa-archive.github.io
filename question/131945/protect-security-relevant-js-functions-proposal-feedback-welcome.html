			<h1>Protect security relevant js functions: proposal. Feedback welcome!</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>recently a new module (encrypted sqlite db) showed up in the Appcelerator Marketplace enabling protection of security relevant js functions with the proposed method:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;1924">Encrypted sqlite databases</a></li>
<li><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;787">Storing keys in the phones keychain</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="situation">Situation</h3>
<p>I have one sensitive function (F) in js, validating a given tag of a data set (50 lines of code). I want to protect it from being reengineered as good as possible. So packing and obfuscation of the js is not enough in my opinion.</p>
<h3 id="idea">Idea</h3>
<ul>
<li>I store the source for function F it in an encrypted sqlite db. The key to decrypt the db is not packed with the app, it will be obtained from an online api (end-to-end encryption using https) once an authenticated user logged into the app.</li>
<li>Once the user is authenticated and the key is downloaded, the app stores the key in the iOS keychain.</li>
<li>On runtime the app decrypts the sqlite db using the key from the keychain. Once the function F comes into game, it is loaded from the db and evaluated using eval(). This should work for a js function of this size.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advantage">Advantage</h3>
<p>Using this method it will get very hard to hack your way down to the source of function F.</p>
<h3 id="backdrop">Backdrop</h3>
<p>Right now this is only possible on iOS, because the keychain module in the marketplace doen&#39;t support Android (is it on Android possible anyway?).</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

							<p>This <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-7553">ticket</a> is related to this topic. Can someone comment on the security vs. javascript being inlined in a c file and compiled, as it is done on iOS?</p>

							<p>Hi, I think the critical point here is what you mean with &quot;F is used for validating a given tag of a data set&quot;. </p>
<p>If this is a sensible operation and the security of the process only relies on F to be secret (security through obscurity), I guess there is a flaw in the mechanism: while your solution for obfuscating F would probably make a bit more difficult for an attacker to retrieve F source code, there is a point where F will be clearly available in memory, since it needs to be executed by the JS engine. Then a sufficiently motivated cracker would not find it much difficult to retrieve it.</p>
<p>IMO, It would be better if the mechanism didn&#39;t rely on the secrecy of F (my 2 cents)</p>

										<p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>thanks for pointing this out! Since this seems to be related to js nature there seems to be no way to hide the js from any motivated cracker.</p>
<p>So what will make it more hard to crack? Maybe native modules for each supported OS?</p>

										<p><p>Putting F in a module would mean it will be distributed as ARM assembly code in iOS and Dalvik VM bytecode on Android. This would make F <em>a bit</em> harder to decompile than having it as JS in memory. The point is to make F as much obfuscated as possible&#x2F;convenient.</p>

										<p><p>Looks like I have to think of a different approach without embedding F into the App. Best place for F would be on the server - but then I need to have an internet connection available, which I wanted to avoid. Thanks a lot for your input Olivier!</p>
