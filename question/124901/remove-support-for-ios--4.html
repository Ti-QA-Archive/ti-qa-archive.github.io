			<h1>Remove support for iOS &gt; 4</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>This is not a question about a beta version.</p>
<p>Is there anyway to remove support for devices using iOS later than major version 4?</p>
<p>If Apple would release in the future, lets say version 5 or 6, but I&#39;m unsure if my app would work on these future versions. I would then like to remove support for them <strong>now</strong> but maybe later on submit an update which would support these future versions.</p>
<p>Anyone?</p>

							<p>This is more of an iOS issue then a Titanium one… Apple currently does not allow blocking of the newest OS (or any limiting to older OS) I know that some free apps in the past have put up messages to alert users that the app is not fully compatible.</p>

										<p><p>I suppose you are right. One Titanium aspect of it though, is that non-Titanium developers can test and fix their apps before an actual major version is released. Titanium developers can&#39;t. Speaking in general terms, is there anything we can do, except wait for a future iOS update and fix the problems as fast as possible when Titanium supports it? Thank you for your time Matt.</p>

							<p>Do you mean like using Ti.Platform.version and setting an if statement in your code?</p>

										<p><p>No, sorry. Then the users would be able to pay and download the app, but not be able to use it, even if they got a nice error message instead of just a crash.</p>
<p>This might be less of Titanium question and more of a iOS development one. I have only seen ways to limit the minimum version of SDK, not maximum. I&#39;m a little worried than when Apple might release an iOS update, my app won&#39;t be working for people updating right away. Before I got the chance to fix the errors using Titanium.</p>

										<p><p>well the fact of the matter is this, native developers cannot put these kinds restrictions on their apps, and there are people using ios5 beta are running your and&#x2F;or other paid apps and giving them negative&#x2F;bad reviews already. It&#39;s an issue that APPLE will need to solve, they are the only ones that can. </p>
<p>Most of the time issues within a beta OS will be fixed before or shortly after the OS reaches GA. The best way to stay up to dat with this is to test out the latest CI builds as this will get you the fixes faster.</p>

										<p><p>Very true.. I hope Apple will try to solve this in the future.<br> They are not very fast removing reviews mentioning betas either.. :) Anyway, thanks for your input. I&#39;ll mark your above answer as correct, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll get any closer.</p>
