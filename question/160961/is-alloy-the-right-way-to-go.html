			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Are there any applications in appstores made using Alloy? Also are there any books written for Alloy?</p>
<p>I do believe the MVC mode is neat but I would like to know if the new method is stable enough to generate &quot;live&quot; apps being used on x devices for y period of time..</p>
<p>Also, I would like to know if there is a good book for getting ready for using it. As I can see, some simple online resources exist but I find it faster to reference a thorough guide already written by an expert.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Taner</p>

							<p>simple answer to this.</p>
<p>Alloy is stable we use it for our apps,both android and iOS. there are hundreds of apps using alloy.</p>
<p>now should you use alloy over Classic is a different question and there Is a blog post coming about if and when to use either. keep an eye on <a href="tidev.io">tidev.io</a>.</p>
<p>there are no book currently released on alloy. but they are being written keep an eye on amazon over the next month.</p>

							<p>There are Alloy apps published all the time. I helped build one of the first from the official Alloy release - 21st Century Insurance app. That was built from the ground up on Alloy. And I helped on a less well-known app, ULS Freight. Additionally, I have 2 cross-platform apps in development right now built on Alloy. There are other folks who are much more prolific. So there are probably hundreds since it released a year ago.</p>
<p>As for books, I don&#39;t know of any yet.</p>
<p>Hope that answers your question.</p>
