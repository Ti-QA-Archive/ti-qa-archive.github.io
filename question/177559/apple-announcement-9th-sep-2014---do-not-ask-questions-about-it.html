			<h1>Apple Announcement 9th Sep 2014 - do not ask questions about it</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi All</p>
<p>In a couple of hours Apple will begin the event that will announce a number of products.  Do NOT start posting questions like;</p>
<ul>
<li>When will Titanium start supporting the iPhone 6</li>
<li>When will Titanium start supporting the iWatch</li>
<li>When will Titanium start supporting the Apple TV apps</li>
<li>When will we be able to support various iPhone resolutions</li>
<li>and so on</li>
</ul>
<p>So any questions asking any questions about this sort of thing will be treated as if they are a child who keeps asking are we there yet when going to Disney - &quot;can you see the Disney sign yet?  Then no - we are not there yet!&quot;&#x2F;</p>
<p>During the event the following items may be announced or refreshed quietly a short time afterwards;</p>
<ul>
<li>iPhone 6; 4.7&quot; &amp; 5.5&quot;</li>
<li>iPads; often these have a separate event - but could be</li>
<li>iWatch; not even a name is known for this let along if we will get any info today</li>
<li>iOS 8 - likely to be released the day before any phones are shipped, possibly next Thursday</li>
<li>MacBook Pros - likely given the time since last update</li>
<li>iMacs; possibly - with 4k screens a possibility there may be a high-end version</li>
<li>4k screen; Apple is overdue with this as an option externally</li>
<li>MacPro - less likely</li>
<li>Apple TV, new box and&#x2F;or actual screen</li>
<li>iPods - long overdue a refresh, but also a tiny part of the business right no</li>
<li>Mac Minis - long over due, but more likely to have a quiet after event announcement</li>
</ul>
<p>None, some or all of these may occur - and possibly others. </p>
<p>ALL of these are subject to rumours right now and as no announcements have been made yet - there is no way brand new features or devices will have support from day 1.</p>
<p>Appcelerator has been busy providing support for iOS 8 as the XCODE beta is available for that to have started.  You can play with it right now in the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2014&#x2F;09&#x2F;titanium-sdk-3-4-0-beta-for-ios-8-now-available&#x2F;">Beta (pre-release) version</a> - head over to the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;">blog</a> to read more.</p>
<p>Given that 3.4 is still in beta, this should not be used for production apps and you should not consider upgrading if you have one or more in-development apps.  Play it safe and install it to a clean machine, external hard drive or other test equipment.  Remember Appcelerator is not liable for problems you may have in pre-release software.  So upgrading a live system is at your own risk.</p>
