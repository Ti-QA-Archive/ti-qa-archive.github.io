			<h1>Issues with &#39;datajs&#39; usage.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve included the following &quot;datejs&quot; files, date.js and time.js, into my project, with the following statement:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'src/date'</span>);
<span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'src/time'</span>);
</code></pre><p>When I&#39;m running in debug mode in the iPhone Simulator, execution always stops at the 2nd require() statement, but I can continue without any errors.</p>
<p>Also, execution stops at <code>Date.parse()</code> statements, but I can continue with out any errors and the Date and Time functions work correctly.</p>
<p>I have no breakpoints on these statements, I did a clean project, but still execution stops at the aforementioned lines. Is this &quot;normal&quot; for these objects?</p>
<p>Also, when I tried to use 1.8.0.1 with datejs, on the <code>require(&amp;#39;src&amp;#x2F;date&amp;#39;)</code> statement I get a parsing error.</p>
<p>Any help&#x2F;insights would be helpful.</p>
<p>TIA,</p>
<p>jb</p>

							<div><p>Same problem here, Gary.<br>You also know to pull the date.js from the SVN and not from the download on the dates page?  Quite a few months difference between the two.</p>
<p>The parse error makes it a pain to debug.  In 1.7.6, the debugger pauses on that line about 20 times before moving on to our own project files.  I haven&#39;t had a chance to open it up and take a good look at it all.  The compressed nature of the fail will make it all the more difficult.  May have to pull corejs and the rest and look at them individually.</p>
<p>It is a nice library, but it is nearly 4 years old.</p>

<p>I pulled the source for the 5 main files.  A few were NOT UTF8 encoded (android complained) and had windows cr&#x2F;lf (xcode complained) in them, which caused Titaniums build script to puke.  Opened them in TextMate and resaved them.  Added them to a test project, and so far (knock on silicone) no pauses when starting in the emulator and no errors in the console.  Will play with them for a while, and if no problems surface, minify them myself.</p>

							<div><p>Stephen,</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion. I took the files from SVN, src directory, opened and saved with TextMate as UTF8, LF. It works a lot better, though it pauses after <code>require(&amp;#39;lib&amp;#x2F;parser&amp;#39;)</code> and also when I do a parse() operation. But there are far fewer pauses.</p>
<p>Are you encountering this or is it working without pauses.</p>
<p>Gary</p>

							<div><p>I recommend changing the title of your question to actually &#39;datejs&#39; instead of &#39;datajs&#39;, since people looking for datajs (OData&#39;s js library) end up here as well (like me).</p>

							<p>I quit using datejs, Titanium couldn&#39;t handle the size. For Android I had to raise ti.android.threadstacksize the prevent &quot;Too deep recursion while parsing&quot; errors. Datejs doesn&#39;t adhere the CommonJS&#x2F;NodeJS module interface, in the debugger you get an awfull lot of exceptions, it made my code crash (on Android SDK 1.8.0.1, iOS was okay).</p>
<p>So I switched to Moment.js. Much leaner and just works. Recommended.</p>
