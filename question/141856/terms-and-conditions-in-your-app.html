			<h1>&#39;Terms and Conditions&#39; in your app?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m 99% done with an IOS app I&#39;ve been working on for a while and my remaining task is to do &#39;terms and conditions&#39;.   I&#39;m wondering if others are specifying terms and conditions in your apps?  I don&#39;t think my app has unusual risk but still feel like I should cover myself.  Having  trouble finding the right lawyer to handle this, also, and don&#39;t want to spend a lot.  I&#39;ve looked at some generic templates available online that I could alter, but that option seems questionable.</p>

							<p>Hope I have understood your question… When you upload an app to the AppStore unless you specify different will use the standard eula http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;legal&#x2F;itunes&#x2F;appstore&#x2F;dev&#x2F;stdeula&#x2F;</p>

							<p>Actually, I was thinking that perhaps I need my own &#39;terms and conditions&#39; that go beyond the generic AppStore terms.  My app uses a series of web services and allows users to interact with each other.  I was thinking that perhaps I need to specify that I can terminate the service at any time, and also specify that users that engage in inappropriate conversations are doing so at their own risk.  Also, I&#39;m using in-app purchases and was going to specify that my tokens may not be redeemed for cash or refunded.</p>

										<p><p>I just figured out that the default &#39;terms and conditions&#39; for an app may be edited in iTunesConnect.  Upon going into &quot;View Details&quot; for your app, then scrolling to the bottom, there a section labeled &#39;EULA&quot; (End User License Agreement) and an EDIT button.   Upon editing the standard EULA and saving, the revised version is made available in the app store.</p>
