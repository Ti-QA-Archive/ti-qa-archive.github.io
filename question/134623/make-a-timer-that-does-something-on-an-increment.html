										<p><p>Just out of curiosity, if I set this to the ms equivalent of 1 day, what would happen if the app was in a closed or exited state during that time? If closed (multitasking backgrounded), does the function still run? If the app is exited for 3 days and then started, does the function run 3 times? or not at all?</p>
<p>I have always wondered and never bothered asking!</p>

										<p><p>If the user completely quits the app, then the timer will also stop. It will restart again from 0, next time the app is started. So you can&#39;t have something set to 1 day etc, since it probably won&#39;t execute in a real world scenario (no one will have an app running in the foreground for 24 hours or more, unless it&#39;s a super, awesome, mega-addictive, life changing app :)</p>
<p>If the app is only put into the background, I&#39;m not really sure what would happen. But I wouldn&#39;t recommend setting something like 24 hours anyway, because if an app is in the background, the OS can reclaim memory at any time (if required), which could mean your app might force quit and next time the user runs the app, the timer will start at 0 again. This could happen after 5 mins or even after a few hours, it totally depends on how the end-user uses his phone, which you have no control of.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
