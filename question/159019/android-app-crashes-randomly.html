			<h1>Android app crashes &#34;randomly&#34;</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve developed an app that runs on the same code for iOS as for Android. The app works pretty much fine for Android, however sometimes the app crash and restarts.<br>I am very well aware of what im doing when the app crashes, but i don&#39;t see any reason for it to crash.</p>
<p>The app shows some events in a tableview. The user can select events per date. When the app is launched, the events for the current date is shown. Then the user is able to change the selected date in a &quot;filterview&quot;. The filter view is actually HTML-buttons rendered in a webview. When a button is pressed, it fires an event to Ti.App, containing the new filter data.</p>
<p>The user is only able to select dates from today and 7 days forward (a week in total). First time a date is selected, an XHR request is made to the server. Then the data is &quot;cached&quot; local in the phone. The app contains a login screen that is presented before the events screen. When the events screen is closed the &quot;cache&quot; is cleared. To be able to reproduce this issue i have to close the events screen, enter it again (at least one time) and then change the date in the filter view.</p>
<p>Mi first thought was something like that the phone couldn&#39;t handle multiple XHR requests, but i implemented a queue which makes sure only one request can be performed at a time, and it didn&#39;t solve the issue.<br>I&#39;ve used Fiddler to check if there is any bad data returned from the server when the app crashes (the server returns JSON) but all that is fine. Sometimes the app crashes before the XHR request is made. Sometimes after.</p>
<p>I have used logcat to find the reason why it&#39;s crashing, but when the app crashes all i get is:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">D/<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">CrashAnrDetector</span><span class="hljs-params">(  <span class="hljs-number">783</span>)</span></span>: processName: se<span class="hljs-class">.kodfabriken</span><span class="hljs-class">.myapp</span>
D/<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">CrashAnrDetector</span><span class="hljs-params">(  <span class="hljs-number">783</span>)</span></span>: broadcastEvent : se<span class="hljs-class">.kodfabriken</span><span class="hljs-class">.myapp</span> data_app_crash
</code></pre><p>I though maybe debugging the app would help me. However, Titanium tells me absolutely nothing when the app crashes.</p>
<p>How should i continue debugging my app to be able to solve this?</p>

							<div><p>DDMS log result is available on this pastie: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;8454285<br>This gave me no more information than i knew but maybe you guys can see something that i don&#39;t?</p>
<p>I could send the source code to anyone willing to take a look at it. Parts of the code is very factorized so it can be hard to post a complete code snippet here…</p>
