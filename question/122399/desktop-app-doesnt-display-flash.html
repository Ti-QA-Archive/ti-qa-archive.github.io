			<h1>Desktop App doesn&#39;t display Flash</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have created an app that is for the desktop. When I run it on my windows machine I can see my swf files. When I run the same app on Mac OSX (10.5.8) the swf files are not visible.</p>
<p>I have seen posts in here where others have run into the same issue but none of them have a solution, any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>I think this was a problem with webkit, but not sure exactly where the problem was. Your app works fine on Lion, strange enough, but doesn&#39;t on Snow Leopard. At least for me.</p>

							<p>I have this same issue, and it&#39;s a deal breaker. I read somewhere that Flash was working in the 1.0 version of the SDK, but I&#39;m not sure where to get that. I was really hoping it would be fixed in 1.2.0-RC2, but it isn&#39;t.</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve just noticed that FlexPaper which is Flash based is loading but other Flash embeds are not. I&#39;m going to do some more testing, but it may have something to do with the way it&#39;s embedded in the page.</p>

<p>Did you find anything out? My app displays the flash on Lion but not on Snow Leopard.</p>

										<p><p>Strange thing is that it works on Lion, as I mentioned above, but doesn&#39;t on Snow Leopard. I&#39;m not clear why and it is something that needs to be looked at.</p>

										<p><p>I think it needs to be looked at as well. And soon for my case, lol.</p>
<p>I am not a Mac user and although it works fine on Lion I would have to assume that Snow Leopard is the most used OS for Mac at this time until Lion is out a little longer.</p>

							<p>To me this seems like something major that needs to be fixed and I am wondering why it would take them so long to do so.</p>
<p>Have either of you tried using an older sdk? I have created a desktop app about a year and a half ago with flash in it that didn&#39;t have any problems.</p>
