			<h1>include is deprecated in 3.3, so how to use third-party JS libraries?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a number of third-party JS libraries that I use in my app, using include(). They are plain JS, not CommonJS.</p>
<p>So what is the new way to use these libraries? An example is pdfmaker, which has a number of interconnected files. For one-file includes, I have used a brute-force approach of editing the file to include exports.xxx, but that doesn&#39;t work with a multi-file library, and is awful to maintain.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I will take the blame for this as I successfully campaigned for this for some time.  Ti.include should have been removed long ago, read why here; </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tidev.io&#x2F;2014&#x2F;05&#x2F;30&#x2F;sdk-3-3-0-ti-include-deprecated&#x2F;">Titanium 3.3.0: Ti.include() deprecated.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This does mean you will experience some pain if you are still using this technique - but it should be minor as most included files can easily be translated.</p>
<p>You mentioned a specific library - can yu give me a link to it and I may give some help if possible.</p>

										<p><p>Malcolm,</p>
<p>I saw your blog post, but didn&#39;t find it helpful because it had a lot of &quot;you shouldn&#39;t&quot; and no &quot;here&#39;s how.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been using CommonJS in all my code since Alloy came out, and converted all my Titanium projects to Alloy one by one, but there will always be a need to use third-party JS libraries in my apps. I will also need to update these libraries from time to time, preferably just dropping in the new files.</p>
<p>I would prefer to encapsulate them using my own CommonJS wrapper, but I would need include() to do that, and I have done in the past.</p>
<p>So what is your recommended technique to use third-party JS in an Alloy app? The library I am about to use is <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pdfmake.org">pdfmake</a> available <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bpampuch&#x2F;pdfmake">on github</a>. If you can show me how to use that in such a way that I can update pdfmake from time to time, I&#39;d appreciate it.</p>
<p>Regards<br>Thomas</p>

										<p><p>Thank you for your critic of my post.  Keep in mind &quot;you shouldn&#39;t&quot; is true and &quot;here&#39;s how&quot; was outside the scope of the post - it was after all telling you that Ti.include() was going, it was not telling you how to write all your apps in all ways possible.</p>
<p>It did however provide content and links to where you should be looking next - those of course do provide example code.</p>
<p>Once of the reasons I pushed for Ti.include() to be removed is it is a lazy solution for newbies that get stuck in a trap of not reading code, just being glad that &quot;it works&quot; and not caring why.</p>
<p>If you are using Ti.include in Alloy then the problem is worse - many unforeseen issues can arise simply because of this combination.  An understanding of how Alloy (or most frameworks build out) will help with that understanding (not the point of this comment though).</p>
<p> <em>I would prefer to encapsulate them using my own CommonJS wrapper, but I would need include() to do that, and I have done in the past.</em></p>
<p>Sounds like you know what you are doing here then - so no help required.</p>
<p>So after suggesting my post was essentially pointless you are still after help - fair enough.</p>
<p>You say &quot;The library I am about to use is pdfmake…&quot;, I can logically assume then that you have not used this yet?  I am curious if this solution matches your exact needs - for example server print - is that really needed?</p>
<p>I do know that you have not reviewed the code in any way, as if you had you would have seen it is all CommonJS code already.  It is more demanding than you might need - partly due to the &quot;we handle the layout so you do not have to think&quot; approach and the &quot;server side printing&quot; - but are cool - if you need them though.</p>
<p>If you do not need printing and are comfortable defining layout - then <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MrRio&#x2F;jsPDF">jsPDF</a> is the commonly chosen solution. </p>
<p>Let me know if there is anything else I have done that you do not like.</p>

										<p><p>Malcolm,</p>
<p>see my second comment about pdfmake. No, I haven&#39;t used it yet. No, I&#39;m not doing server-side PDFgeneration– if I was, I&#39;d use the NodeJS version and not Titanium.</p>
<p>I tried jsPDF and found it wasn&#39;t flexible enough in its layout to handle the range of inputs I need to convert into PDF.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sorry you felt my factual feedback about your post was a negative comment. None of the links in your blog answered my question.</p>
<p>As I said, the question remains. If I have a third-party JS library, say jsPDF, how do I use it in an Alloy project without using include() and without hacking the jsPDF files? That is the practical help I could use.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been using object-oriented programming and encapsulation for 25 years. I understand the benefits of CommonJS. I just want to find a maintainable way of using third-party code that I don&#39;t control.</p>
<p>Regards<br>Thomas</p>

										<p><p>&quot;But the question remains, and is still important: what is your recommended technique to use third-party JS in an Alloy app?&quot;</p>
<p>Learn how to read code and wrap it. Whilst that might come off as short and harsh - there is no other way to say it.</p>
<p>It is like you asking me &quot;how exactly do I get from point a to point b&quot; without saying where point a or point b is - how can you answer that without that information?</p>
<p>Most good libraries are written using CommonJS, others are often a simple wrap of a function surrounding existing code and then exporting that function.  But now you are reading the code - and working out what it does and you are better off for it.</p>
<p>For all the reasons mentioned in the post - include is bad, you must see that?  You are a developer, so you must understand code, so if you need to tweak something - then do just that.  If you do not understand something - ask, people will help.</p>
<p>You appear to be annoyed that I have helped you and others write better apps - there might be a small amount of pain - but; smaller, more memory efficient, stable apps where you have hopefully read all the code not just your bits - how do you not win?</p>

										<p><p>Malcom,</p>
<p>as someone who has been managing software development projects for nearly 30 years, I find your solution astounding. The whole idea of modularisation and encapsulation is that developers should not need to (and should not) dive into and edit other people&#39;s code. A properly encapsulated software module such as a third-party open-source library should have a clearly defined API with clear documentation, and the code itself should be a black box.</p>
<p>Are you definitively saying that there is no way to use a non-CommonJS third-party JS library in Alloy without using include() or hacking the library code? If that is the case, then Titanium has taken a big step backwards in my opinion because of its lack of extensibility.</p>

<p>Included code is run in your app the moment it is included and will not leave the app memory unless manually cleaned.</p>
<p>Required modules are used as an when, cached on first use and removable from memory by a simply nulling (assuming someone has basic coding skills of course when creating it).</p>
<p>An &quot;open source library&quot; does NOT mean you can use it in any place that supports JavaScript automatically - it can and often does, but not always and assuming anything different is simply ignorant of the JavaScript language, its place within the development world and how it is used with other frameworks.</p>
<p>You are clearly not in this conversation;</p>
<p> <em>Are you definitively saying that there is no way to use a non-CommonJS third-party JS library in Alloy without using include() or hacking the library code?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>You must use CommonJS - NO, never said that at all - anywhere, pointed out that CommonJS is one of those solutions that is now considered a best practice.</li>
<li>Of course you do not have to place code inside CommonJS - not sure what to say here - you have written an App in Alloy I guess, even part way - has all your code been in CommonJS?</li>
<li>No of course not, so how do you think that I either said that or that it could be true or that Titanium or Appcelerator by extension have made you do that?</li>
<li>The conversation, the post, the deprecation is all about Ti.include() being removed so that newbies and those who have yet to realise the short-comings can move up a step</li>
</ul>
<p><em>…then Titanium has taken a big step backwards in my opinion because of its lack of extensibility</em></p>
<p>Now you are insulting Appcelerator, here are a few of the ways Titanium is extensible </p>
<ul>
<li>Alloy</li>
<li>Widgets</li>
<li>Themes</li>
<li>CommonJS modules</li>
<li>Compiled Modules</li>
<li>Native Modules</li>
<li>HyperLoop Modules</li>
<li>Studio plug-ins</li>
<li>CLI plug-ins</li>
<li>Tools like; TiShadow</li>
<li>Modifying the SDK yourself</li>
</ul>
<p>Whereas Ti.include() is not modular - it simply says &quot;open this file and insert this code in-line with this other code&quot; whilst the app is running.  Now you can make the code in one of those files modular - but include itself is not modular.  If you have a modular library, function then treat it and your app with respect and move it somewhere else.</p>
<p>BTW you clearly did not read the post as it explained all the reasons you should not do this and why - after all that you and you still want to use it - then fine, Ti. SDK 3.2.x is the highest you will go.  Apps have moved on, technologies have moved on, techniques have moved, best practices have moved on - getting the picture - Ti.include() HASN&#39;T moved on.</p>
<p>Again the next sentence you will take as an insult - but I am going to believe you are smarter than that.  All seasoned Titanium developers have long since moved on from Ti.include and used one of the more suitable solutions (pick from the list above) to suit each need.  I personally know that 8 of the top 10 experts here - share that opinion. Chances are the other two share the same opinion but I do not know those personally - so not asked.</p>
<p>Now I was going to give you some code examples and tips to convert things, but you lost that opportunity a few derisive comments back.</p>

										<p><p>Malcolm,</p>
<p>from the emotion in your response it looks like I&#39;ve hit a nerve. I suggest you re-read my posts carefully. At no time did I insult you or personally attack you. Take a breath and keep it on the topic, not the person.</p>
<p>My original question still is valid, and you haven&#39;t answered it. I&#39;m sure there are many other people who would like to hear the answer.</p>
<p><strong>How can I use non-CommonJS third-party Javascript libraries in Alloy, without using include() and without hacking the library code? In such a way that I can drop in updated versions of the library?</strong></p>
<p>None of the technologies you mention except CLI plugins will do this (AFAIK) and I really don&#39;t want to develop a CLI plugin. Perhaps you&#39;re aware of one that can package JS libraries into CommonJS?</p>
<p>If you say it is not possible (which you have not definitively done yet) then you are cutting yourself off from an awful lot of open-source functionality, or encouraging practices that lead to maintenance nightmares.</p>
<p>I&#39;d appreciate it if you&#39;d answer the question.</p>

										<p><p>This is getting stupid now and this will be my last response as you clearly have no capacity to read.</p>
<p>The closest thing to any &quot;emotion&quot; from me is utter frustration.  <em>&quot;Take a breath and keep it on the topic&quot;</em> &lt; never gone off topic, neither have I been rude to you - the same cannot be said of you though.</p>
<p>I never said you insulted me or attacked me, not sure where you are getting that from.  Your comments are derisive - but does not mean either of those things.</p>
<p><em>My original question still is valid, and you haven&#39;t answered it</em></p>
<p>Yes your question is valid, but how you have missed the constant attempts to explain to you how to solve the problem is beyond me.  I even offered to help in my answer - but you went down your own conversational path.</p>
<p>I now suspect your expectation is that you will press a magic button and any of the millions of libraries, snippets, modules will all work as you wish in whatever language you wish.  Sorry - this is real-life and you are a developer - who should know that you have to put some effort in.  You should also realise that many JavaScript libraries have dependencies on a web browser - so do you expect those to work without any modification?</p>
<p>Are you suggesting that all the source code out their is perfect and requires no modification?</p>
<p>This the most telling statement of everything you have written so far;</p>
<p><strong>None of the technologies you mention except CLI plugins will do this (AFAIK) and I really don&#39;t want to develop a CLI plugin. Perhaps you&#39;re aware of one that can package JS libraries into CommonJS?</strong></p>
<p>You do REALLY do think that there should be a tool to do just that?  You really think that a tool that will read any code and work out the intention of the developer, fix any structural issues in the code, solves any logic issues and removes any dependencies.</p>
<p>So this is the reason you are annoyed, someone else isn&#39;t doing your work for you?</p>
<p>If you choose to use third-party libraries (we all do) then your selection must be based on;</p>
<ul>
<li>suitability</li>
<li>sustainability</li>
<li>maintainability</li>
<li>quality of code</li>
<li>level of updates (if any required)</li>
<li>capability to evolve when evolution happens</li>
</ul>
<p>Does your mystery tool also package libraries used with twitter and facebook from four years ago - and will it account for the api deprecations as well?  Both Twitter and Facebook expected developers to develop, the need for security and reliability were more important than keeping hold of old methods.</p>
<p>So to again answer your question;</p>
<p>#There is no one-size-fit-all solution</p>
<p>You are a developer; so develop, if your libraries are no longer suitable as everything else has moved on - get new ones, or make your own.  If you need to turn some simple code into a CommonJS - use the example I provided above.  If it is more complicated - LEARN the CommonJS module standard and develop.</p>
<p>If all of this it too much for you - give up.  But do not come here and moan that someone else hasn&#39;t done your job for you, especially as this someone originally offered to HELP you.  Too late now though.</p>

										<p><p>Well Malcolm Hollingsworth was certainly being way too explosive here. Thomas Bisshop was just politely asking a question he didn&#39;t quite get. An answer could just be like &quot;</p>
<p>Non commonJS libs shouldn&#39;t be used at all. But if you insist, then you will have to convert them using the &quot;brute-force&quot; :)<br>&quot; as Dan Tamas provided. That&#39;s all. It&#39;s all convoluted and escalated conversation which meant little. That said, indeed one should understand that JS libraries are not exactly your traditional OOP libraries which you can just plug and play. That&#39;s just the fact one has to be explained to and gets adapted to. That&#39;s all.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you for you comment to this old question Xiang Ji.</p>
<p>This was dealt with, answers provided.  I offered significant assistance and attempted to provide a route to a solution.  The other party demanded a single solution that simply does not exist for a problem that is the developers role to fix.</p>
<p>I am sorry you did not feel I achieved what you believe I should have with the significant amount of information I provided about the subject in a clear and detailed way with examples of why this is simply not possible.  Despite the fact I did actually what you suggested should be said more than once except for the lack of the phrase &quot;…brute-force…&quot;.  </p>
<p>You appear to have missed the fact that I offered to walk through a library and explain what changes to make, or that I gave an example of the simple process.</p>
<p>Dan Tamas is a great guy and someone I call a friend.  His answer stated the banality of the issue, something I tried without success whilst constantly trying to explain how there was no one answer.  Keep in mind my offers of assistance were turned down and referenced article that explained why Ti.include was going was determined to be useless as it failed to explain a subject unrelated to the purpose of the document.</p>
<p>I feel that given the frustrations of trying to help, balanced as always with making sure that those who come later and read questions get all the details - was the best that could be achieved.</p>
<p>But I welcome your criticism and look forward to you detailing each time I failed to live up to your standards point by point.  I do welcome this as it will help me learn and show me how you came to your conclusion that I was &quot;too explosive&quot;.</p>
<p>Awaiting your reply.</p>

										<p><p>I obviously understood what you were trying to explain, and benefited a lot from your comments, as I myself am currently going through a refactoring process to phase out Ti.include() and use CommonJS. However I commented <em>not</em> because I didn&#39;t find your comments helpful, but because I thought your response was quite petulant and that guy who asked the question unfairly blasted. Sure, he was stubborn in insisting that the library work &quot;like a black box&quot;, which of course is not how JS libraries are supposed to work here, as I have also pointed out at the end in my comment. But that was probably because his thought patterns were a bit used to the old day and needed a little bit more concise explanation, which he calmly and politely asked for as I see it. I don&#39;t see where he was being &quot;derisive&quot; or whatsoever, to deserve you employing sentences like &quot;Again the next sentence you will take as an insult&quot;, &quot;now you are insulting Appcelerator&quot; and &quot;you clearly have no capacity to read&quot;. This is why I felt that guy was not done justice to and felt uncomfortable with your response.</p>
<p>I appreciate that you might be the No.1 in Q &amp; A and you certainly have made a lot of contribution to the community, like this answer. But now, you would have the time to write a long post on my question https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;179186&#x2F;how-to-determine-the-cause-of-application-crash proving your &quot;point&quot; and &quot;teaching me a lesson&quot; without deigning to write at least one sentence to <em>actually explain the question</em>. Yeah, of course one cannot ask others to answer his questions for free. But nor does he deserve to be lectured by others with self-righteous terms for petty matters. With such a nearly holier-than-thou attitude, can a helpful community be felt by developers?</p>
<p>I understand you have put a lot of effort in answering this question and again I thank you for what you&#39;ve wrote, because I&#39;ve learnt a lot. But I also thought that other guy was being genuine and had no malicious intent. I commented just to express what I thought, which hopefully would not be perceived as some hostile thing by you.</p>
<p>Regards.</p>
