		<section>
			<p>Am using 3.2.0 SDK, Alloys and android 2.3.3 emulator. My App after installing its showing 19.61MB with only a welcome page in it. Is it because of unstable Titanium version or from 3.2 apps will be that much size only. Please let me know.</p>

							<p>Your application&#39;s size will shrink a little once you package it for the Google Play store, but don&#39;t expect any miracles in that department.</p>
<p>But again, why is this particularly an issue? The app works right?</p>

										<p><p>True, but last time I has this discussion with someone about that, I reminded him that Angry Birds is 46 MB and it hasn&#39;t stopped anyone to install the darn thing on all their devices.</p>
<p>So, the argument is valid on one hand, but most people usually don&#39;t care since it is done in the background anyway.</p>

										<p><p>Hopefully, Ti.Next is supposed to address that by removing the need to pack-in the JS runtime (V8). Which will make apps comparable to their fully native counterparts.</p>

							<p>We came across this png compression named <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pngquant.org">pngquant</a>. &quot;It converts 24&#x2F;32 bitPNG into<br>paletted (8 bit ) PNGs. The conversion reduces file sizes significantly and preserves full alpha transparency&quot;.<br>Which dropped one of our application <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunes.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;homes.com-rentals-homes-apartments&#x2F;id717555947?mt=8">Homes Rental App</a> from 50MB to 20MB or so. Which we tested internally. It also available on the <code>brew install pngquan</code> if you want to give it a try.</p>
