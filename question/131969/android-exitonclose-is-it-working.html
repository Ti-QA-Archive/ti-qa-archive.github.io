			<h1>Android: ExitOnClose is it working?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>While debugging some other issues I came across something that made me wonder if ExitOnClose was working properly.  After closing a window with ExitOnClose set to true should I still see my app in the list of running processes?  I see my app with 2 Processes and 1 service listed after exiting out of the app.  However if I restart the app it does start from the beginning and not resume.</p>
<p>Is this expected?</p>

							<div><p>Another test proves that this is related to me starting the billing service (from the InAppBilling module).  If I dont start that service then the exit does cleanup the process.  Now, I need to figure out how to kill the billing service… ideas?</p>

							<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Android OS manages what app gets killed and which not. Sometimes Android just keeps it in Memory, in case you will start it again, you will get the perception that your app opened faster. </p>
<p>More info <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;android-developers.blogspot.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;04&#x2F;multitasking-android-way.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the link, however my testing has showed a clear difference depending on if I had started the billing service or not. If I had not started the service the application was removed from the task manager.  If I did start it it was not.</p>

										<p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>if the module continues doing web communication in the background, Android won&#39;t kill it. </p>

										<p><p>Yea, I guess the issue is the module doesn&#39;t provide a way to end the service.  So from what I&#39;ve seen once I start it my application wont ever end.</p>

										<p><p>Hello Frank,<br>can you add this issue to the support section of the module in the marketplace? Please do a reference to this question.</p>
