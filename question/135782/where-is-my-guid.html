			<h1>Where is my GUID?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying check out the new ACS service from Ti. All my demo apps are showing in my account section. Is there a way for me to erase my old apps from Titanium?</p>
<p>Anyway, I wish to locate my GUID. I assume this is the unique App identifier? Would this be located in the tiapp.xml file? </p>
<p>You see, I don&#39;t have this. </p>
<p>I erased Appcelerator analytics ages ago - and as a consequence, I have no GUID in my app anymore. </p>
<p>What should I do?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Normally, yes.  </p>
<p>The GUID is generated when a new project is created.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Stephen,</p>
<p>OK.. i found my GUID. I also turned analytics to TRUE in the tiamp.xml file. </p>
<p>After doing this, I still did not see my APP in the Titanium APP section. </p>
<p>What should I do?</p>
<p>Surely I need a GUID for ACS services to work properly? No? </p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>Hi Stephen,</p>
<p>Thanks for the answer concerning the GUID.</p>
<p>OK. I have now a GUID and I changed the analytics parameter to = TRUE in the tiapp.xml file.</p>
<p>Despite this, I still cannot see my app in the &quot;MY APPS&quot; section in Titanium.<br>In fact, I rebuilt the app, cleared the previous build, waited etc.. and it sell didn&#39;t appear in the MY APPS section.</p>
<p>That&#39;s the 1st question - why is this the case? What can I do for my app to appear in the analytics section?</p>
<p>The second question - Dummy test apps I created ages ago are in the &quot;MY APPS&quot; section - how can I erase them?</p>
<p>Many thanks Stephen for your kind and speedy response.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe there is a way to do it with the redesign.  Used to be able to hide them.</p>

										<p><p>Using TiStudio 2.0.1, targeting SDK 2.0.1GA, open your Tiapp.xml file.</p>
<p>There are new options in the tiapp.xml editor.</p>
<p>Click the &quot;Enable Cloud Services&quot; <strong>enable</strong> button.</p>
<p>TiStudio will contact the appcelerator servers,  some keys will be generated and inserted into your tiapp.xml file.</p>
<p>That might just bring your app to life on the my.appcelerator.com site.</p>

<p>I tried that, it didn&#39;t work. I sent an email to Ti support. </p>
<p>No worries.. i&#39;ve been coding the whole day. I&#39;m going to have a break now. Thanks again. I think its really nice to someone answer me on the weekends like this.</p>

										<p><p>E B,</p>
<p>It looks like my.appcelerator.com is being slow to update.<br>You can try to hit the management site directly: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.appcelerator.com&#x2F;<em>your-guid</em></p>
<p>Also remember that emulator and simulator transactions are development, so in the upper right be sure to click development to see that data.</p>
