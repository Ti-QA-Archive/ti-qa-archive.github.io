			<p>In an Android project, I put my images in the traditional folders:</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>My question to you is why?</p>
<p>The process is automatic - as long as you have set the correct multi density values in the <strong>tiaap.xml</strong>.</p>
<p>If you are just trying to confirm that the process is working then you only have to create one imageView that shows a different image to test.  Simply place an image in each of the folders and make one red, another green and so on.</p>
<p>This way if you are testing it will be very obvious.  Then you put images exactly where you to have them.</p>
<p>The folder names based on platform and size are &quot;flattened&quot; when on the device as it manages the path automatically - so what you see when developing is NOT the structure when on the device.</p>
<p>If you want a simple app to confirm things, I found this simple one a while back. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jeffbonnes&#x2F;dipscheck">github.com&#x2F;jeffbonnes&#x2F;dipscheck</a> - should provide you with confirmation and a simple folder structure layout.</p>

										<p><p>First of all, I don&#39;t really like the idea to create different images for any of the folders: I have hundreds of images and I can&#39;t loose time changing any image to test where&#39;s coming from each of the images. </p>
<p>That said, in my app there are strange issues: for example, it doesn&#39;t always load the right image (sometimes they are the right ones, sometimes they are not, and they are bigger or smaller than expected). </p>
<p>Furthermore, I thought it was not necessary to hard-code width and height in my imageViews and Buttons, but it looks like they are required, since if I don&#39;t put them very ofter I can&#39;t see any content (the element is simply not shown).</p>
<p>I must say I&#39;m really unsatisfied with Titanium-Android behavior.</p>

										<p><p>Hi, sorry for the unclear question. Consider I have n copies of the same image, with different dimensions, inside each of the folders. Now, I want to know, when the image is loaded into an imageview from which of that folders is coming from. Problem is at the moment I must write something different on any image to recognize it! This takes too much time.</p>
