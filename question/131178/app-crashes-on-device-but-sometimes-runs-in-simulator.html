			<h1>App crashes on device but sometimes runs in simulator</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have an app that has been working perfectly for a long time that all of a sudden crashes on launch. It crashes consistently on the device, but sometimes I can get it to work on the simulator, but it crashes there too at times.</p>
<p>The error is &#39;Ti.UI.iPhone.systemButton [undefined] is not an object.&#39; That line is a simple function to create a flexible space button to reuse throughout the UI. If I comment that one out, I get a an error of &#39;Invalid Method (createTabGroup)&#39; when it tries to create the tab group. Both functions are unchanged from any prior version that was working.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve searched all over and the only tips I&#39;ve found involve deleting the build folder, which I&#39;ve done about 100 times now along with running Clean both before and after. I&#39;ve tried the nightly builds for 1&#x2F;23 and 1&#x2F;24 as well as 1.8.0.1. I&#39;ve tried restoring the file from a previous version to see if there was some seemingly innocuous change that&#39;s causing the error to appear. All to no avail. Please help! I&#39;m dead in the water with this app right now and I&#39;m actually really close to finishing it. SO FRUSTRATED.</p>

							<p>I seem to have discovered the cause of the problem. I am using ShareKit 2.3 and tried to include the <code>.plist</code> file that says what services to show. Commenting that out (i.e. sticking with the defaults) seems to allow things to work again. No idea why that causes the app to throw those errors, but there it is.</p>

							<p>Can you show us some code that we can run&#x2F;debug with you? </p>
<p>Now I can say that run&#x2F;debug using xcode might be helpful in your case. I experienced the same issue - Works with Simulator, but failed to run on device. I figured out the problem and solved it by run&#x2F;debug using xcode.</p>
<p>Open&#x2F;Run the generated project at: <em>YourApp &gt; build &gt; iphone &gt; YourApp.xcodeproj</em></p>
<p>Best,</p>
