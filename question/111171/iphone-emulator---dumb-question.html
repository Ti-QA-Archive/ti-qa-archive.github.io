			<h1>iPhone emulator - dumb(?) question</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>On the basis that there are no dumb questions, here&#39;s mine!</p>
<p>Can I run the iPhone emulator (only the emulator, no more than that) on a Windows machine? Or is it Mac only?</p>
<p>If the answer&#39;s &quot;yes&quot;, what do I need to do to set it up?<br>If the answer&#39;s &quot;no&quot;, I&#39;ll check my bank balance and think about buying a Mac!</p>
<p>I realise that I need a Mac in order to be able to create code to run on the iPhone itself. I just want to see how my app would look on an iPhone by using an emulator. I already have the Android emulator running OK (if slowly!).</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

							<p>In theory, you need a mac to do that.  In practice, the iphone simulator just has to think it is running on a mac.  Some people have reportedly run OSX as a virtual machine on their Windows box.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t endorse that method and have never tried it, and it should only be done with a real osx license for the virtual machine.  If a person wanted to run both OS on a single box, I think the better approach is a good mac which then runs Windows as a guest, instead of the other way around.</p>
<p>But if you absolutely need to try and do it with your existing hardware, try web searches for things like hackintosh or &quot;virtual osx&quot;.</p>
<p>YMMV.</p>

										<p><p>I agree with Doug in the second paragraph.  My computer is an iMac 21.5&quot; 3.06 GHz with 16 GB of memory.  I run Windows in a VirtualBox VM(free).  Actually, I find that Windows runs better on my Mac than on my Dell.</p>

<p>If you are happy with Doug&#39;s answer (and I think it&#39;s pretty good!), you should mark it &quot;best&quot; so that others may find it easily in future. This is explained in the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.appcelerator.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;contribute.html#participating_in_the_q&amp;a">Participating in the Q&amp;A</a> guide, where you will find other tips for getting the most out of this forum.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

							<p>There are some non-Apple iOS simulators out there for Windows.</p>
<p>Google iOS simulator for Windows and you should get back some results. </p>
<p>However, I don&#39;t know how reliable these are since they are not official Apple. </p>
