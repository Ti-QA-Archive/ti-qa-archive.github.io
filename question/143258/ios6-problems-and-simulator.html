			<h1>iOS6 problems and simulator</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi!</p>
<p>We are closing in on our next release of our app. We got some time over and started working on getting the app ready for iPhone 5 and iOS 6.</p>
<p>Started noticing some problems and downloaded the newest Titanium SDK version which seemed to fix alot of issues with iOS 6.</p>
<p>We still have problems with <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-11030">TIMOB-11030</a>.<br>From what Ive understand the stripped background color is no more supported. In the simulator the background on our tables goes black (even the grouped ones) but when we test the app on our phones with iOS 6 (including iPhone 5) there doesnt seem to be any problem at all, stripped background is the same as before. Anyone have any experience of this and will this be a problem at all?</p>
<p>We also have trouble with <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-9832">TIMOB-9832</a>.<br>In this app we at times remove all the tabs and create new ones. With iOS 6 this gives us a warning according to the case and freezes the app. This only happens in the simulator aswell and works fine when testing on our phones. Will this be a problem?</p>
<p>Quick help will be appreciated since our deadline is closing in.<br>Thanks.</p>
<p>&#x2F; Best regards, Tommy</p>

							<div><p>UPDATE: </p>
<p>I just got informed that the build that was tested last on phones was built for iOS 5 and a new test was done with iOS 6 and the problems are confirmed. Any information about TIMOB-9832 would be welcome since this is our biggest concern now.</p>
