			<h1>Webview not working as desired</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have created an application in which I am using a webview to show some webpages. All the webpages to be displayed in the webview are HTML5 cache enabled, as I want the webpages to be available even when the application is running offline. </p>
<p>The problem which I am facing is that, the webview is not able to show the cached webpages when there is no network connection. But I have tested all the webpages in the browser, and all of them are working fine.</p>
<p>I am facing this problem for Android platform.</p>
<p>This is the code for the webview:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="xml">var webview = Ti.UI.createWebView(</span><span class="hljs-expression">{
    <span class="hljs-variable">url</span>: '<span class="hljs-variable">http</span>://192<span class="hljs-variable">.</span>168<span class="hljs-variable">.</span>1<span class="hljs-variable">.</span>60<span class="hljs-end-block">/fdas</span><span class="hljs-end-block">/service</span><span class="hljs-end-block">/account</span><span class="hljs-end-block">/GetHtmlForm.aspx</span>?<span class="hljs-variable">id</span>=149'
}</span><span class="xml">);
self.add(webview);</span>
</code></pre><p>The very url is working fine in the browser. How should I solve this?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The problem you have is a basic misunderstanding of what the <strong>webView</strong> is and is not.</p>
<p>webView !== web browser  (not the same thing)</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>webView</strong> is a view that renders a single web page at a time.</li>
<li>A web browser is an app that manages the interaction between server and client, handles cookies, displays content in a web view, manages caching by saving remote content locally as required.</li>
</ul>
<p>The difference is similar to a jpeg image and photoshop, the jpeg image is simply displayed where as photoshop can create and display the image.</p>
<p>When you set a header like cache or other cache control settings the server tells the client it can (or should) cache the content locally - that is your job.</p>
<p>If you need true offline pages you should be using <strong>httpClient</strong> to download the html source, then parse this to find all the dependant; images, css, javascript and media files displayed.  You will need to then edit the original source to map the locations of your saved content to that of the original html file.  Then you display the <strong>webView</strong> with the html you tweaked.</p>

										<p><p>Got the point, now the thing is that, if I can keep the css, js and images files in the resources folder, then how can I map them to the online HTML file?</p>

										<p><p>You will need to parse the HTML file using regular expressions to get each type of file pattern, once each pattern is retrieved you will have a set of files to then also download.  Once downloaded you use standard replace to swap out the location with a new version.</p>
<p>I will warn you this will not be easy though, you may find the files you download also have files referenced inside so you have to go through those files as well.  Plus you may have to work out the relative path of a file in relation to the location of the file you are parsing.</p>
<p>I would balance need over requirement.  To get this right you will be spending at least a week if your coding, regular expressions and httpClient queuing experience are high.</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

										<p><p>As I said - this is something that requires a high level of knowledge which also means understanding exactly how regular expressions work and how to write them, how to create per page file structures and how to manage the clean up process, how to deep dive into nested content.</p>
<p>It would take a week to teach someone these techniques before any code was created to solve the problem.</p>
<p>There is no code I could provide in this sort of forum that would give you the level of assistance you are going to need.</p>
<p>I would suggest you start learning <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=regular+expressions&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a">regular expressions</a>, use an <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;myregexp.com&#x2F;signedJar.html">on-line testing console</a> to work out if your patterns match.</p>
<p>Start reading HTML, javascript and CSS source code to determine where each of those files has any file references.  When you have downloaded those files continue looping through the new content until all file nesting has been met.</p>
