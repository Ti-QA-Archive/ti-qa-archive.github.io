			<h1>mac OS X 10.6 compatibility with Ti3.1.0 why can&#39;t I deploy my app?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I was trying to import my project from windows to Mac OS X<br>Im working with Alloy with titanium 3.1.0</p>
<p>I saw in here that i should be using at least 10.7 Mac OS X<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Titanium_Compatibility_Matrix</p>
<p>but i dont really understand why i cannot run my app in this iOS.<br>It seems that the app was compiled and i can turn on emulator on 5.0 (i know it only runs on 4.3)<br>Seems to me the only problem is deployment ? </p>
<p>Is there a way to run my compiled app in an emulator with 4.3 manually?</p>
<p>Notice that ive started working on Mac today for the first time so im very naive on this. Its<br>also the first app im making for iOS so are there any standards or basis rules I should know about?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

							<p>You&#39;re running into some terminology confusion here, along with bumping up against Apple&#39;s app store requirements.</p>
<p>iOS SDK is the software development kit for building iOS apps. iOS is the operating system that runs on the phone. While the numbers share the same generation, they are not related like you&#39;re implying. An app built with iOS SDK 6 can still run on iOS devices as old as 4.3.</p>
<p>Now that we have the first part cleared up, the minimum requirements are Apple&#39;s, not Titanium. Apple dictates that all new and updated apps must support the 4&quot; retina display. Support for the retina display didn&#39;t come until iOS 6 and XCode 4.5.x. XCode 4.5.x will not run on anything older than OS X 10.7. Thus, the chain of minimum requirements.</p>
