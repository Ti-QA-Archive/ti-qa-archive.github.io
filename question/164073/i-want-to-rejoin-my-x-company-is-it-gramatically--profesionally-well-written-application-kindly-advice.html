			<p>From<br>abcd<br>eng_abcd@yahoo.com<br>Mobil No: </p>
<p>Respected Sir,</p>
<p>With due respect I would like to state that I am an X-Jacobs employ, worked in Dubai operating center in 2008-2009, but unfortunately due to massive economic downturn Dubai operating center could not survive &amp; I was also one of the victim of those crises but I had a great time in Jacobs under the supervision of building manger Eng. ABCD. I worked in many companies but found Jacobs a better place to work where all contribute like a team &amp; there is potential growth, advancement opportunities &amp; stability. I have seen in advertisement that Jacobs Doha office has an opening for Engineer &amp; I desperately want to be a part of Jacobs team once again as I had great and valuable  experience in Jacobs in past.<br>My CV is enclosed to provide you with details of my skills and accomplishments, but I am certain that an interview would more fully reveal my desire and ability to contribute to your organization once again. </p>
<p>Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
<p>I look forward to speaking with you soon.</p>
<p>Thanking You,<br>Yours Faithfully,<br>ABCD</p>
