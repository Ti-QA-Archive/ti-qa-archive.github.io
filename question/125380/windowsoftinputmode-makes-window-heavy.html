			<h1>windowSoftInputMode makes window heavy.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>In Android I need to use windowSoftInputMode to prevent loss of initial focus on text fields. My problem is that I have a tab group and I want to open some windows inside tabs, which works fine until I add the windowSoftInputMode property to the lightweight windows because it makes them heavyweight. I tried adding windowSoftInputMode to the parent tab group tab window but it is not inherited by the lightweight children windows.</p>
<p>Suggestions? Or is this a bug?</p>

							<div><p>I need the children windows lightweight so that the tab bar is still visible when the child window is open. For example, I have one tab called Cart, from that tab, I have several windows like any checkout process. </p>
<p>Or to use another example, you have a list in the tab, and then a details window which opens when you tab a row in the table list.</p>
<p>If you do not make the children lightweight they cover the tab bar. If you use lightweight windows, they open in the tab as you would expect and as in iOS.</p>

							<div><p>I think in this case the difference in behavior is unavoidable.  The soft input mode is configured per-activity in an Android application, and a window needs to be associated with an activity to support this.  There would be no way to open a &quot;lightweight&quot; window with the soft input mode configured for it.</p>
<p>Rather than lightweight windows, you might consider using views.  A ScrollableView works well for wizard-style interfaces.  Or, you might embrace the Android UI conventions of new screens appearing in new activities - your Android users will expect to navigate back with the hardware back button.  The &quot;always visible&quot; tab group is an iOS-specific UI construct.  You would need to recreate that in Android manually in any case, but IMHO you don&#39;t need to.</p>
