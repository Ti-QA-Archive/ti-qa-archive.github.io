			<p>I constantly have problems with Titanium working, it will ether not detect any Android SDK platforms under preferences&#x2F;Titanium Studio&#x2F;Titanium even though it recognizes them in preferences&#x2F;Android or when I try to start a new project it doesn&#39;t recognize &#39;node&#39; as a command preventing it from building the project correctly.</p>
<p>I am running Win 7 64.</p>
<p>I have the files in a location without spaces in the path.  I know that I have all the environment variables are defined to the right location for android_sdk, JAVA_HOME, NODE_PATH, NODEJS, and PATH.  Also I know that I am running the current version of Titanium and NodeJS, with Android 17, 16, 8, and 7.</p>
<p>What am I missing or why does it seem that Titanium will never recognize one of these if the other is working.</p>

										<p><p>Sorry for 1 typo mistake above.</p>
<p><strong>add the npm and node directory path to system environment PATH variable</strong></p>

										<p><p>Hi Ashish, Thank you for your suggestion, I tried it and still had the problem.  I did look up what NPM is and determined that you are referring to the folder under …nodejs&#x2F;node_modules&#x2F;npm&#x2F;  That wasn&#39;t clear at first but I got it.</p>
<p>What would your next suggestion be since that did not work and it sounds like other people also have this issue?  Do you think that an older version of Titanium would be a good option?</p>

										<p><p>Older Version has their own bugs, but for the time being to test you can try them, as they are using python script to build and new platform uses node js.</p>

							<p>I have the same &#39;node&#39; problem and finding no definitive answer. I&#39;ve downloaded node.js from http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nodejs.org, however that made no difference and I get a blank screen when running node -v. Can&#39;t understand why info on node.js is not presented in the installation instructions if it is necessary.</p>
