			<p>I&#39;m completely new to titanium so sorry if this is a stupid question.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve downloaded the kitchensink desktop code, and at first glance it looked like ordinary javascript that would be able to run in the browser, but it couldn&#39;t, and I&#39;m assuming (without actuallyy having any javascript experience) this has something to do with the way kitchensink loads topics with <code>Titanium.Filesystem</code></p>
<p>I have a specific application in mind that is pretty simple, it&#39;s basically a GUI for managing some data that can be accessed via a RESTful API on a django server. I&#39;d like to be able to offer the gui both as a website, and possibly later on as iPhone and Android apps. So I&#39;m interested to know if that would be possible at all with titanium? Maybe by simply limiting what features in the API I use? Or is it just a bad idea overall? Thanks</p>

							<p>Currently the MobileWeb SDK is in beta.  The end game is to have a project of javascript code that is used to build native android, iOS and browser (mobile web) applications.</p>
<p>The Javascript code that you see will not run directly in your browser.</p>
