			<h1>Titanium Studio Debugger issue</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi All</p>
<p>I read all the old posts regarding the strange behavior of the Debugger  and I want to share my experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>As a &quot;Indie&quot; licence I have the premium features of the Studio so the debug icon in ON!</li>
<li>I&#39;m on a Mac and Studio version is the 1.0.0.20110527 1822 </li>
<li>the SDK is the 1.7.0.RC1</li>
</ul>
<p>1) I created a blank project in a brand new Workspace and added a few breakpoints<br>2) I launched the Debugger!<br>3) At the first run the breakpoint was ignored<br>4) At the second I received a message regarding the Debugger cannot connect etc…<br>5) starting and stopping the Studio a few time and full rebuild<br>6) than some crashes &lt;terminated, exit value -1&gt;</p>
<p>–than some light–</p>
<p>7) I removed all the breakpoints and I just added one &quot;inside an event&quot; and the debugger started to work a little</p>
<p>8) Breakpoint in the first windows generate crashes and the cursor does not follow the execution in other .js files.</p>
<p>–an experiment–</p>
<p>9) I recreate the Workspace &quot;into&quot; the Document folder and magically everything worked marvelous .</p>
<p>10) I put back the workspace in a different local location and the erratic behavior started again</p>
<p>11) I&#39;m in the process to put back the WS in the Document folder crossing the fingers</p>
<p>Stay Tuned for more experiments!</p>
<p>If someone is so kind to give me any hint to &quot;really&quot; fix this I will appreciate</p>
<p>Vincenzo</p>

<p>It&#39;s important that you update your Titanium SDK to the latest <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Continuous+Builds">Continuous Build</a> 1.7.X to obtain all the fixes with the debugger. If you are updating it using the &quot;Install Titanium SDK from URL&quot; menu item, then confirm that it has properly replaced the previous version, by comparing the old version&#x2F;date&#x2F;hash with the new.</p>
<p>Remember that the  Titanium Studio <strong>Stable</strong> Updates should be installed for <strong>all</strong> users.</p>
<p>With regards to the debugger, Nightly and Beta updates may be installed by Premium customers without affecting debugger functions.  They may also be installed by Standard (non-paid) users who do <strong>not</strong> need the debugger functions.</p>
<p>Note that, Beta updates may introduce important features and increase stability, but they have not been widely tested. Thus, in some circumstances, they may actually reduce stability.</p>
<p>Nightly updates should be installed <strong>with caution</strong> by anyone in production, as they are considered very untested and unstable, and could potentially in rare cases delete your files. That said, I install Nightly updates, and they are <em>usually</em> fine.</p>
<p>Please bear in mind that Titanium Studio is at a pre-release stage of its development, and hence it should be considered unstable until the official release.</p>
<p>After installing the latest 1.7.X SDK, you should clean your build folders before launching the app.</p>
<p>Also, bear in mind the issue described in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Fastdev+Reference+for+Android#FastdevReferenceforAndroid-AndroidemulatorrefusestoconnecttoFastdev%2Ceventhoughit%27srunning">Android emulator refuses to connect to Fastdev, even though it&#39;s running</a>, which is the same for the debugger.</p>
<p>Let me know how you get on.</p>

							<p>Thanks Paul</p>
<p>Now the Debugger seems to works!</p>
<p>I followed your suggestion and I download the new 1.7.0-20110531143120-osx.zip and substituted the1.7.0 directory &#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx</p>
<p>I deleted the build directory of my project, launched the debug icon and…. still wasn&#39;t working. The debugger simply ignored my breakpoints</p>
<p>At that point I repeated the build directory cancellation and subsequent debug launch for 2 more times with the &quot;connection error&quot; and than magically at the third cycle the debugger worked perfectly.</p>
<p>I can live with this until the complete fix!<br>Thanks for your support<br>Vincenzo<br>But the debugg</p>
