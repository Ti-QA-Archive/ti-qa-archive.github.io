							<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>I am using Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) with latest Titanium Studio and it works great.  I had to update the Java SDK (it did it for me when I updated the Titanium Studio) and go to the AppStore and install Xcode 4.1 for Lion.  That was it, no errors compiling and using either Android or iOS simulators.</p>

							<p>Why don&#39;t you just take a walk and stop polluting the QA  with your insults?</p>
<p>Words like &quot;what a crap, WTF&quot; etc makes no service here. Everybody tries its best to bring some contribution to this project, offered for <strong>FREE</strong> so you can make money.<br>Stop trolling and complaining and bring something good to the community and to the project.</p>
<p>And if this does not respond your question, maybe the fact that Lion is not launched yet should make you think a little before throwing your rage on the forum.</p>

							<p>Titanium is the only program that crashs !! what a crap ! all other programms run smoothly, please dudes, STOP the features and START Bugfixing !! </p>
<p>Now i restore the entire harddisk with TimeMachine , back to an old OSX Version (10.6.6) </p>
<p>This is very sad. Because as a developer i wan&#39;t only the newest state of the art version and not old crap. </p>
<p>At this point i&#39;m really frustraded with Titanium. Most of time i have to fix things instead to develop. And the Memory Problem is also still there :-( </p>

										<p><p>you have to get xcode 4.1 + ios sdk 4.3 for lion preview2, this is working for me!</p>
<p>also i guess after migrating to a new mac or updating to a major new os-version like lion, the xcode path settings are somehow lost, i just had to reinstall xcode4 after migrating to a new mac to get titanium developer working on snow leopard again, as the sdk-selectbox never showed any sdk-versions but instead &quot;loading&quot; and &quot;launch&quot; throw some python errors</p>

										<p><p>yes i know, i tend to use and boot from an external usb drive for installing and playing with beta builds</p>
<p>to all interested: titanium developer seems to work with 10.7 pr2, if as mentioned above xcode 4.1 pr2 is installed, however titanium studio doesn&#39;t work for me, it simply beachballs after the application was started, there seems to be an error with the java-libs coming with lion</p>
