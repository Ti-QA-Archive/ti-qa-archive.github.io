			<h1>Animations stuttering if 2 or more are running</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>if I run two ore more animations at once, they always &quot;stutter&quot; in my current app. In my current app I do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Animate one view (taking half of the screen) with one image from right to left</li>
<li>Running the &quot;scrollTo&quot; method on a scrollview which is positioned on the bottom</li>
</ul>
<p>If I run these two things at once, the &quot;scrollTo&quot; method &#x2F; animation stutters. I have to use &quot;setTimeout&quot; to run the view animation on top after the &quot;scrollTo&quot; method.<br>Can I somehow achieve to run both of these things at once without stuttering?</p>

<p>here&#39;s some sample code</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pastie.org&#x2F;2107284">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pastie.org&#x2F;2107284</a></p>
<p>SDK 1.7.1, Ti Studio latest stable release, OSX 10.6.7, iPad 1, iOS SDK 4.2</p>
<p>I notice this behaviour with whatever animation I run, as soon as I try to run 2 at once, there&#39;s stuttering. In this case, the animation of the view on top runs smoothly, but the scrolling of the scrollview stutters.</p>

							<p>Ben,</p>
<p>First things first:</p>
<p>I see that you are trying to animate on the top of the page 2 different views at the same time (one red, one blue). If you are trying to syncronize the two I would advise you to use a Scrollableview with touchenable disabled. OR you can add this 2+ views to a wrapper view and then animate the wrapper view.</p>
<p>AND This particular animation is returning &quot;[DEBUG] ignoring new layout while animating in layout Child..&quot; which as far as i can remmember refers to a view that is not completly loaded yet trying to be animated. (you should do a search on this particular issue)</p>
<p>As a general rule i would never try to create a view and animate it immediately unless i am pretty sure the view is loaded. And you are doing exacly that. </p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>
<p>Daniel</p>

							<p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>thanks for your detailed answer.<br>How do I know when a view is completely loaded? (Don&#39;t know of any event &#x2F; callback to know when a view is completely loaded)</p>
<p>Though I see those debug messages, the app runs perfectly without any problems. I only can&#39;t run another animation at the same time.</p>
<p>The whole concept of my app are views which load &#x2F; unload dynamically. One app has for example 20 pages and they are animated into &#x2F; off screen as soon as the user clicks the referring menu buttons on the bottom. But I can&#39;t pre-load all of them, that would cost too much memory. I have to load them dynamically.</p>
<p>Apart from all that:</p>
<p>I also experience this behaviour when doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>animnate one image from 532x400 to 1024x768</li>
<li>animate a view containing a few images to opacity:0</li>
</ul>
<p>in this case I get no debug messages and don&#39;t try to synchronize to animations…only 2 animations running at the same time. And the image scaling then stutters.</p>

							<p>P.S. ScrollableView is not usable cause I have items inside my views which must be clickable, but the views themselves shouldn&#39;t be movable by the user. But if I set &quot;touchenabled:false&quot; in the scrollableview, the underlying elements aren&#39;t accessible to the user by clicking.</p>
<p>And I tried putting those 2 views inside a container view with width 2048 but then(!) I get a warning that the contained views aren&#39;t ready yet….I can even run the animation with a setTimeout of 1000 or 2000 and I still get the &quot;we aren&#39;t ready yet&quot; debug message…so for some reason it doesn&#39;t work.<br>Apart from that it doesn&#39;t work right now it&#39;s also more complicated &#x2F; unusable with this solution…cause my views should always slide in from right. So I always add the new view at position 1024.<br>But if they are contained in a parent view and the parent view is animated….I couldn&#39;t easily put the next view at left:1024…cause the parent view has moved to the left…right?</p>
