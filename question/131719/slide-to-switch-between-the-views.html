			<h1>Slide to switch between the views</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am developing a mobile app using Titanium. I came across the Google Plus, Tweetdeck, Market Apps for Android. To switch between the tabs they use the slide gesture. Its like the next view simply slides in based on your swipe&#x2F;drag. I would also like to add the same kind to behavior for my app I would like to have it work on both Android and iOS platforms. How can I have it? </p>
<p>I have tried Ti.UI.scrollableView. The problems I faced were</p>
<ol>
<li>The sliding was not as responsive as seen in the above apps.</li>
<li>The view does not move along with the finger drag. It moves after the finger drag is finished.</li>
<li>It seems to take more memory as the application response slows drastically and animations dont appear to be smooth.</li>
</ol>
<p>Kindly let me know if there is any other alternative to implement this kind of experience in the app.</p>
<p>Thanks!!</p>

							<div><p>There is no other built in way to do this in Titanium. You have to fake the look and fill as you are trying right now and if you want your view to move with your finger moves you have to write that code on your view&#39;s touch move event.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks @Christian Brousseau and @The Zero!! Well I have tried the scrollableView but it seems to be more expensive due to the points mentioned in my question. Whereas other applications seem to do this very smoothly without any impact on the resources.</p>

							<p>If you want to be able to move freely between the separate views, meaning that you want to be able have it move along with the finger drag, you&#39;ll need to implement that yourself by handling the <code>touchstart</code>, <code>touchmove</code>, and <code>touchend</code> events of the views and the view that contains them.</p>
