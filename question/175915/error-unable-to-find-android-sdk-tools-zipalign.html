			<h1>error: Unable to find Android SDK tools: zipalign</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>i&#39;ve got a problem: i&#39;ve tried to run my application, but at the beginning of the compilation there is an error that there has never been before: &quot;Unable to find Android SDK tools: zipalign.&quot;. I&#39;ve seen that other people have had this problem, but the only solution that i&#39;ve found regards to copy zipalign from &quot;build tools&#x2F;19.0.1&quot; to &quot;tools&quot; folder but doesn&#39;t work. are there other solutions? Thanks in advance.</p>

							<div><p>Sorry, but i didn&#39;t understand. Maybe is very simple, but If you don&#39;t mind, could you explain what to do? I&#39;ve tried to copy zipalign from &quot; build tools&#x2F;last-version&quot; to &quot;tools&quot; but it still doesn&#39;t work. And what do you mean by &#39;set a symlink&#39;?

										<p><p>Thank you for your answer, but in the SDK which you send to me there aren&#39;t the google apis. Indeed, when i open the SDK manager, there aren&#39;t many things that are in my SDK with rev 23.0.2. How can i add the google apis if there aren&#39;t in the SDK? I hope i was clean. Thanks in advance.</p>

										<p><p>thanks for help, and i hope that you can solve this other problem: when i run my application, titanium launch the emulator, but when it install the apk, the console show me this error: &quot;Failed to install apk on &quot;emulator-5554&quot;. i&#39;ve tried the solution, and i&#39;ìve seen that setting the android version to 2.3.3 could resolve the problem. in fact it resolves, but now the console show me for a long time &quot;Installing apk: D:\backup vecchio\progetti titanium\provaTab\build\android\bin\provaTab.apk&quot;, and<br>it doesn&#39;t happen anything on. if i run the application when the emulator is going, titanium launch another emulator instead of installing the application in the emulator already operating. why with a newest version of 2.3.3 there is the error and why titanium every time opens a different emulator? i&#39;m using the SDK rev 23.0.2. thanks for all. i write this question here for not opening a new topic. if I have to open it to show it to users tell me. thanks.</p>
