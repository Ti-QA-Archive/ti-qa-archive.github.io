<p>I&#39;ve tried including other permissions in the initial call.  I&#39;ve also tried calling reauthorize with the email permission after getting basic data.</p>
<p><em>I have found a workaround</em> – which is to also include &quot;publish_stream&quot; with the email permission.</p>
<p>However, I&#39;d like to only grab the email, since the publish_stream permission requires another access grant for the user and is more invasive than my app needs….</p>
<p>Anyone else found a way to do this?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<div><p>Interesting….. I have seen several issues with the Facebook module, and also filed a <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC-2472">bug report</a>, however as you can see from my code sample, the email permission generally worked for me. Are you sure this user <em>never</em> previously authorized the app? My general comment about this is that the current Facebook module is very flaky if the user changes passwords, de-authorizes and re-authorizes, if app permissions are changed, etc. This module is based on Facebook iOS SDK 3.1.1, and Facebook improved the error handling in 3.2. Hopefully the module will be updated soon (Facebook just released 3.5.3…). I&#39;m actually very concerned about this - since if the login process is stuck the app is basically doomed.</p>

							<div><p>Ya I&#39;ve made absolutely sure the facebook permissions for my app are deleted in my facebook profile.  During my testing, it has worked for the different permission combinations I throw at it… unless I want to get the email permission <em>without</em> requesting publish_stream…</p>

							<div><p>That&#39;s different from what I asked :) It&#39;s possible you hit the issue since you de-authorized the app. Try everything with a brand new Facebook app ID - and I bet it will work. Nevertheless - this unpredictable behavior seems to be a bug, and IMO a very critical one.</p>

							<div><p>BTW - your &quot;workaround&quot; is totally in contradiction with the module (and also Facebook&#39;s) documentation: &quot;The permissions property MUST NOT contain any of the following: offline_access, publish_actions, publish_stream, publish_checkins, ads_management, create_event, rsvp_event, manage_friendlists, manage_notifications, or manage_pages&quot;</p>

							<div><p>Mark, you&#39;re right with a brand new app ID with a previously unauthorized user, works flawlessly.  </p>
<p>This makes testing a nightmare and ya looks like it breaks users who change their password or deauthorize the app via facebook…</p>
