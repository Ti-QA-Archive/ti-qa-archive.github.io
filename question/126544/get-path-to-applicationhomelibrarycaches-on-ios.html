			<h1>get path to &lt;Application_Home&gt;/Library/Caches on iOS</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>since the iOS data storage guidelines indicate that all data that can be regenerated should be stored in &lt;Application_Home&gt;&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Caches, what is the Titanium way to recieve that path reliable for all iOS versions?<br>in Titanium.API.Filesystem I could not find a related constant.</p>

										<p><p>This ticket is now resolved, the fix is in the 1.8.0.1.v20111129200258 build.</p>
<p>A couple of questions:</p>
<p>1) Is look like it is sufficient to set just the folder&#39;s remoteBackup flag to exclude all files in the folder:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// set the application data directory</span>
    PTC.dataDirectoryName = <span class="hljs-string">"PrivateAppData"</span>;
    PTC.applicationDataDirectory = Ti.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory.replace(<span class="hljs-string">"Documents"</span>,<span class="hljs-string">"Library/"</span> + PTC.dataDirectoryName);

    <span class="hljs-comment">// check to see if the directory exists</span>
    <span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> dataDir</span> = Titanium.Filesystem.getFile(Ti.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory.replace(<span class="hljs-string">"Documents"</span>,<span class="hljs-string">"Library"</span>), PTC.dataDirectoryName);
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>( !dataDir.exists()){
      dataDir.createDirectory();

      <span class="hljs-comment">// set the Do Not Backup Flag</span>
      dataDir.remoteBackup = <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>;
    }
</code></pre><p>I then reference my app&#39;s data directory instead of the titanium default.</p>
<p>2) The Documents&#x2F;Preferences folder seems to be getting backed up but I don&#39;t know if Apple&#39;s guidelines allow it.</p>
<p>3) Same for the app log file in the root of the Documents folder; does this need the remoteBackup flag too?</p>
<p>Thanks again for all your help,</p>
<p>Brian Caufield</p>

										<p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have difficulties to understand the process.</p>
<p>My app use local data, not remote. Actually in my Titanium project, all data (images + database is located in Resources&#x2F;images&#x2F;myImages).</p>
<p>Does i have to move manually this folder in another directory or just set the &quot;do not back up&quot; flag ?</p>

										<p><p>Read only data that is installed with your app is fine, this issue is with data that is downloaded by the app based on the user&#39;s request. Before iOS 5.0, you could safely store this data in the app&#39;s Documents folder. That is no longer the case and you now must store app data in a folder that has the &quot;remoteBackup&quot; flag set to false.</p>

<p>The problem is Apple rejected my app while i&#39;ve only local data, no downloading. So no flag on my Resources&#x2F;images&#x2F;myImages ?</p>

							<p>It seems like there is a new flag in <code>Ti.Filesystem.File</code> called <code>remoteBackup</code>. Simply set that always to false and your files are still in the documents directory but not backed up via iCloud.<br>BUT: Note that this actually prevents ALL backups, not just to iCloud.</p>

							<p>The constant <code>applicationDataDirectory</code> within the Filesystem API automatically targets this location for you. You can target a file within that directly like so:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-type">Titanium</span>.<span class="hljs-type">Filesystem</span>.getFile(<span class="hljs-type">Titanium</span>.<span class="hljs-type">Filesystem</span>.applicationDataDirectory, <span class="hljs-symbol">'file</span>.txt');

							<p>Same problem. I have a large read only database in my app that I install the db with Titanium.Database.install. Titanium placed the database in:</p>
<p><code>Library&amp;#x2F;Application Support&amp;#x2F;database</code></p>
<p>Since iOS 5 and iCloud integration the database should be placed in:</p>
<p><code>Library&amp;#x2F;Caches</code></p>
<p>I got an email from Apple that I have to change this in my app but I can&#39;t set the path where Titanium installs the database.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

										<p><p>My problem is the same , only that I don&#39;t want to install the database in that folder but put some downloadable content there. Also I have received an email form an Apple developer that I need to update my App to be compliant with their rules for iOS 5. And since it has been released already I need to urgently update.</p>
<p>@Appcelerator: any updates on the situation? Since all Apps for iOS 5 have to store large content that can be regenerated in the Cache folder in order to exclude it from iCloud as far as I understand there needs to be a way to access that path in Titanium.</p>

							<p>This seems to one of the only threads that is trying to deal with the problems caused by iOS 5 and iCloud updates. My app was just rejected from the app store due to violating these new data storage policies; I have been able to move all the downloaded data and databases to the Caches folder as described above but now I risk having all this data deleted if the device is low in storage space. Apple says that we should create a new private folder and set the &quot;do not back up&quot; attribute (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;ios&#x2F;#qa&#x2F;qa1719&#x2F;_index.html). Has anyone figured out how to do this via Titanium?</p>

							<p>We also need the cache folder for our upcoming release. Apple will not approve it currently, since we put all cached data in the documents folder.</p>

							<p>Is data safe in this location Titanium.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory + &quot;..&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Caches&#x2F;&quot; for say 100s of MB of information? Is there a risk of that data being deleted automatically in some form of cache purge?</p>

										<p><p>In an iOS app the only time the cache would be purged would be if you deleted the app. In which case you would want all app related data purged.</p>
<p>I had to start using this directory after Apple rejected updates to several gallery iPad apps, which download large numbers of full screen images and cache locally. When the iCloud was introduced, the application data directory was targeted for backup, and Apple introduced limits on what could be stored there.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Julian, thanks for your prompt response. That sounds hopeful so, as I was hoping that would be the case - the use of the safety in &#39;cache&#39; has to be taken with great hesitation, because if you&#39;re relying on a file to be there and it&#39;s not, then there&#39;s a problem :)</p>
<p>If the cache is controlled by the app&#x2F;developer, then we&#39;re away laughing - I had Apple call me yesterday telling me I was uploading 9mb to iCloud, even though the app is configured on the iOS Developer Center to not use iCloud. It&#39;s still unticked&#x2F;unconfigured technically, so why is it happening? Any thoughts?</p>

										<p><p>It may just be a case of Apple making attempts to enforce their will on the world as usual. We had the same issue. Our apps were not using the iCloud, in fact the update went in only a couple of days after iCloud went live.</p>
<p>I think it&#39;s just a red flag that pops up when they review the app, because when iCloud is actually configured, the application data directory is backed up.</p>

										<p><p>They&#39;re just… argh.. so annoying. Police state or what. So what if it&#39;s being backed up, it&#39;s the user&#39;s content technically - they fetched it.</p>

<p>They seem to regard the Caches folder as not being sacredly safe (in terms of when iOS is low on space, the cache folders can&#x2F;will be purged to allow for optimisation of storage usage).</p>
<p>The conundrum I&#39;m facing is that I cannot use any version higher than Titanium 1.7.5 because for some reason my createHTTPClient(); won&#39;t fire the .onload() function when in any version higher&#x2F;other than 1.7.5, even when I fully delete the build folder contents to build from fresh.</p>
<p>Does anybody have a solution to this issue - I cannot update to the Titanium version high enough to allow myself to set the file.remoteBackup = false so that I can store files in the &#x2F;Documents folder instead (which would answer all our problems!), so instead, the only alternative I have is the &#x2F;Cache folder which seemingly is not a fully reliable solution.</p>
<p>Any suggestions to fixing the above issue? I&#39;ve tried almost all the solutions mentioned in the Q&amp;As regarding this prob but still no joy :( It won&#39;t download my files for me.</p>
<p>Wisdom is MOST welcomed on this one as it&#39;s a fairly big stumbling block.</p>
