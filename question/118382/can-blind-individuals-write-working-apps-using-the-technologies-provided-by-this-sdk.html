			<h1>Can blind individuals write working apps using the technologies provided by this SDK? </h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I just read about this system for developping apps and it seems very appealing. My only concern is accessibility, though.<br>I am fully blind, you see. I am currently unable to write a working app for, say, IOS, because the interfaceBuilder tool Apple provides is completely &#39; inaccessible&#39; . This means screenreaders that visually impaired people use to access their computers, are unable to interact with this tool in a way that is helpful and even useful to them. This SDK appears to be a very good alternative, but I guess thats where my question comes in.<br>Can blind individuals write apps using this? And also, will these apps be accessible? I&#39;d say Yes to the second question because native UI components are used, but I am quite new to developping and coding in general so I don&#39;t know for sure. Any help or feedback on this topic is very much apreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot,<br>Florian</p>

							<p>The software you need to work are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any texteditor for coding</li>
<li>Titianium Developer for creating the project and compiling</li>
<li>The iOS simulator for testing your application</li>
</ul>
<p>The text editor shouldn&#39;t be a problem.</p>
<p>Titanium Developer doesn&#39;t look compatible with screen readers and the one built into Windows didn&#39;t do a good job. However I think you can work around that and find solutions where you can work with it.</p>
<p>The really tricky part will probably be the simulator that is made by Apple. You could deploy to the unit every time though.</p>
<p>I think Titanium Developer is one of your best options available so give it a try.</p>

							<p>I would note that you don&#39;t have to use interfaceBuilder, anything you can do with it can be done programatically just as well.<br>I think the real challenge will be the testing of the app as peter said the simulator isn&#39;t going to provide you with the necessary feed back I don&#39;t imagine, which means right off you need to join the dev program so you can test on a device.<br>I&#39;m not sure how accessible these touch apps are to the blind, are you an app user at all? do you find the apps you use accessible?</p>

							<p>I myself am an iPhone user and a lot of apps that use the native UI components provided by the IOS SDK are inherently pretty accessible.<br>The simulator won&#39;t be a problem for I have my ways to test my apps on a real iPhone as well.<br>My question is mainlyaimed at titanium developer. How is a GUI created, is it done visually or programmatically?<br> Also let me point out that indeed you can write GUI&#39;s programmatically, but it is a real pain to do so and I would like this to be as painless a process as possible</p>
