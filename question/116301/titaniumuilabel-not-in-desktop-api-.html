							<p>You are correct in you assumption. I was as surprised as you are when I discovered it. </p>
<p>The way it works on Titanium Desktop is quite different. All the UI is made in HTML. In fact, if you launch the Inspector, you will notice that it is exactly the same as the one you find in Google Chrome.</p>
<p><img src="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;documentation-examples&#x2F;gs_inspector.png" alt="Inspector"></p>
<p>Think of it more like a website that can run as a standalone application. The Titanium <em>layer</em> gives you some of the API to access some of the functionality you would need in a normal app. (Menus, System tray, Database, File system access, Process, etc.) There are also APIs for Ajax and JSON, these APIs show better performance than using jQuery for example since they use some sort of <em>&quot;native&quot;</em> calls. (from what I&#39;ve read). You are also not limited to JavaScript, you can easily use other languages like Ruby, Python or even PHP. Keep in mind that runtime libraries will have to be included in your final install and may affect the size on your application.</p>
<p>Since the UI is done via HTML, you can&#39;t expect applications to have full native look&amp;feel. You can, of course, apply a different stylesheet depending on the platform (using the <code>Titanium.Platform.getName()</code> method).</p>
<p>Let&#39;s hope that they will introduce a new mechanism to generate native controls in a future release. But until then, we are stuck with applications that have some sort of &quot;custom&quot; look &amp; feel.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
