			<h1>Disabling button while keeping opacity value to its original value</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, in an iOS project I noticed that if I code <code>myButton.enabled=false</code>, the button is disabled (and this is ok for me), but its opacity is reduced (as if i coded also <code>myButton.opacity=0.5</code>).</p>
<p>Is there any way to disable the button and keep opacity to 1?</p>

<p>yes, you can set touchEnabled property to false to not allow click event.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>This is the normal behaviour of the phone and its operating system, to assist your users you should allow this process to remain as it is designed to provide visual feedback to the user that the button is no longer enabled, it also informs the visually impaired (because of the new state) that this button is now disabled.</p>
<p>You must have a very compelling reason to decide that the visual and actionable state of a button should not reflect the change between enabled or disabled.  The visually impaired should not suffer a &quot;look&quot; effect you are trying to achieve without some fall back.</p>

										<p><p>The reason is compelling. I have two windows: A opens B. B is a very heavy window (no way to reduce its weight&#x2F;size) and on device it takes even 4 or 5 seconds to open. This causes the fact that a user can repeatedly click a button opening many times the window B. So, for a while I disable (I enable them once again when B is fully loaded) all the buttons but I want to keep visually track if the last clicked button.</p>

										<p><p>Opinions vary, but your use case is stop the user from pressing the button whilst the next window is loading.</p>
<p>So visually indicating to the user that something shouldn&#39;t happen (pressing the button) and something is about to happen (new window) should be done.  This is what you would normally do in this situation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Disable the button - so it is obvious they should not click</li>
<li>Place a transparent (or semi-transparent) view over the entire current window - so no objects receive clicks</li>
<li>Show a progress indicator to information the user has a short wait</li>
<li>load and display the window.</li>
</ul>
<p>Users get annoyed when things are slow, but react very well to being informed things are still working - perceived actions are an important UI factor for apps of all kinds.</p>

										<p><p>I would personally hide the button completely and replace by a spinner - then there can be no confusion that either the button has been pressed AND something is in progress.</p>

										<p><p>Nick, this way, you loose a piece of information: the button has a title and if you hide it, you can forget what you clicked.</p>
