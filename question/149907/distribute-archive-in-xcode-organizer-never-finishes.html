			<h1>Distribute archive in XCode Organizer never finishes</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have an iPhone app (built with Titanium 3.0.0 GA, XCode 4.6.1, iOS SDK version 6.1) ready for upload in iTunes Connect. I have used &quot;Distribute - Apple iTunes Store&quot; from Titanium to create an XCode archive. Selecting this archive in the XCode Organizer, the &quot;Validate…&quot; function works (after logging in to my iTunes account) and updates the status of the archive to &quot;Passed Validation&quot;. When I choose &quot;Distribute…&quot; everything looks OK until the final stage, where it seems to be stuck in &quot;Your application is being uploaded&quot; forever (the progress bar looks the way it does before it starts showing completed percentage). Does anyone have an idea of what might be wrong?</p>
<p>The only thing I think I missed when following <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Distributing_iOS_apps">this guide</a>, was that I tried with &quot;Distribute…&quot; once before using &quot;Validate…&quot;.</p>
<p>When I made the app ready for upload in iTunes Connect, there was info about using &quot;Application Loader&quot; (rather than XCode Organizer) for uploading the app, but this app does not seem to want to open an XCode archive. What is the role of &quot;Application Loader&quot; in comparison to using &quot;XCode Organizer&quot;? Is it for doing things that Titanium already has done with the Distribute function?</p>
<p>Regards</p>

							<div><p>I had tried restarting XCode and then the entire computer, but it still looked to be &quot;hanging&quot;. I had given up, but when I returned to XCode just now the app had finally been submitted :o)</p>
<p>Either it is normal that the upload takes a VERY long time, or (more likely) there was a glitch on the Apple server side that they now have fixed.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Mauro, the version number (1.0.1) I have specified in tiapp.xml is the same as what I specified in iTunes Connect (and the app there is in status &quot;Waiting for Upload&quot;).</p>
