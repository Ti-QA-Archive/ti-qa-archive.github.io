			<h1>Store files in applicationDataDirectory instead of resources/images</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, I&#39;m using some icons in my application and many of them will go with the app installer. I have them into resources&#x2F;images folder and when you install the app they are immediately available for use. But in my app there might be new icons needed after a while and I want to store them locally when they come. </p>
<p>Stored data is usually located at applicationDataDirectory and that&#39;s where I would store the new icons. But the problem is that I&#39;d like to use the same path for both the ones that will come later on and the ones that I already have.</p>
<p>So, how can I instead of using the resources&#x2F;images folder use the one that applicationDataDirectory points to? The idea is that when installing the app they would reside there. I can only thing of copying the files manually after first installation. Any hints?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>If you don&#39;t like the idea of copying them over from the install, then you could download them on first run.</p>
<p>I personally think copying them over is a better idea, so the user has a good &quot;first run experience&quot;</p>

										<p><p>Thanks. I deduce from your answer that there is no way to use that location at development time and copying or downloading are the options. Yeah I&#39;ll copy them.</p>
