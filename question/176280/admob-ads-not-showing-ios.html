			<h1>Admob Ads not showing iOS</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m using the latest Admob iOS module provided and today a few hours ago I started noticing that Ads are not being served in my app. I just get a blank Ad space where the Admob ad should be. </p>
<p>Is this happening to anyone else?</p>

							<div><p>Well I&#39;ve asked for help several times in the past month and gotten nothing. So now I have a module that doesn&#39;t work and it&#39;s costing me money. The current module version I&#39;m using is 1.5.0 using the admob sdk 6.4.2.</p>
<p>Building a test Xcode project with the current admob sdk 6.10.0 works. Ads load perfect with my publisher id.</p>

							<div><p>If i was having this big a problem i might try and do everything asked of me, even if you think the need is pointless, keep in mind you have the problem for a while, those who try and help often are simply trying to replicate - to do this they need to know what to replicate.</p>
<p>Whilst you are likely frustrated it is not sensible to take out your frustrations on anyone trying to help.</p>

							<div><p>Same problem here! Titanium 3.2.2, 3.2.3, 3.3.0 with iOS 7. New version of an App was released, but no ads. Older apps in App Store also no ads. All compiled and submitted with module version 1.5.0 of Appcelerator AdMob module. Can somebody build a new module with AdMob SDK 6.9 of 6.10?</p>

							<div><p>We&#39;re having the same problem here. However we updated the module to use sdk version 6.10 and it still doesn&#39;t work on ios, either simulator or device. This started happening around mid august. We were able to check that the fill rates went down, but we have no explanation for it. On android it works as expected. Titanium 3.2.3. Any suggestions?</p>

<li>if there are no ads available, then no ads will be displayed.</li>
<li>you aren&#39;t guaranteed ads (read the fine print)</li>
<li>the module includes a way to know if an ad is ready to display so you can show&#x2F;hide the view (hrm, must be a reason for that)</li>
<li>ads not showing up are not always the module&#x2F;titanium&#39;s fault</li>

										<p><p>Ads not showing up for hours on any device of an app that has a very large install base is not just simply no ads available to be displayed. I have a 99.9% fill rate for over the last year. </p>
<p>I have discovered in some testing that with a test Android app using the latest Admob module I have no problems getting ads displayed in the app. But with the iOS module I get nothing.</p>

										<p><p>Its pretty clear cut whats going on here. Google has ended support and stopped serving ads to the everyone using Admob SDK 6.4.2 which is what the titanium admob module 1.5.0 uses. </p>
<p>I built a test Xcode project using the latest admob sdk 6.10.0 and ads get served just fine with my pub id. </p>
<p>So let just please get the module updated and solve this problem. Ive been asking for months to get this updated. Ive posted questions here and emailed appcelerator. I told them this was going to happen and they said it wouldn&#39;t. Google said they were ending support for older versions of admob.</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve done some more testing. I built a sample test app in Xcode using the latest Admob SDK version 6.10.0 and it works just fine. Ads load no problem with the same publisher ID that does not work on the current Titanium Admob SDK. </p>
<p>That tells me that the Admob Module is now broken.</p>
