			<h1>Install app on iPad, stuck on splash screen</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been struggling with this issue for hours, can&#39;t find a solution.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve made an universal app for iPhone and iPad which works fine on simulator but fail to launch after the splash screen on device.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve try to debug, display things through the console but nothing, it seems like app.js is never interpreted.</p>
<p>I&#39;m using Ti SDK 3.1.0.GA and the latest XCode, building with the Terminal on ML.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot!</p>

							<p>When you build for device with the default &quot;test&quot; deploy type, ANY JavaScript syntax error will mess everything up. I would first create a new project and see if that builds. If so, then I would go back to your app and comment out everything and see if some simple code works.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ll try that but I don&#39;t get why this should affect the app on my device as the doc says deployment type is only used for simulator:</p>
<p>&gt; Type of deployment (test or development). only used when target is simulator.</p>

										<p><p>Which document are referring to? It&#39;s probably incorrect.</p>
<p>As <code>titanium help build</code> states, –deploy-type is settable when –target is &quot;simulator&quot; or &quot;device&quot;. –deploy-type defaults to &quot;development&quot; for simulator builds and &quot;test&quot; for device builds. Generally you don&#39;t want to change the –deploy-type because you want to test the minified and encrypted version on device to get a sense for real world performance.</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s awesome news!</p>
<p>Ha, I swear there was a iOS build bug with app names containing unicode characters. I believe I recently fixed it in 3.1.1.GA. I still have the test case which used the name &quot;testäpp&quot;.</p>
<p>If you wanted to, you could keep the app name &quot;Universite&quot;, try upgrading to 3.1.1.GA, or look into setting the app name using the i18n app.xml.</p>

							<p>Ok so I guess I really needed to ask the question to find the answer…</p>
<p>If someone runs into this issue too, here&#39;s the simple solution:</p>
<p>The problem was that I forgot to set the -D flag in CLI to development, it was building with test by default which apparently doesn&#39;t work on device.</p>
<p>Bad:<br><code>titanium build -p ios -T device -F ipad</code></p>
<p>Good:<br><code>titanium build -p ios -T device -F ipad -D development</code></p>
<p>That&#39;s it.</p>

							<p>Sorry for the late answer. This sounds unusual. By default, when you build for device or distribution, your JavaScript code gets minified and encrypted. The red screen of death should never appear in production builds which gives the appearance that the app has hung.</p>
<p>I would re-run a build, but set the <code>--log-level trace</code> as well as launch Xcode and from the organizer, view the console for your device. Keep your eyes peeled for errors, especially those referencing the app.js.</p>
<p>If you are getting &#39;app.js not found&#39; errors, then usually it&#39;s because of a syntax error in your JavaScript code. In Titanium 3.1.0, this should be reported and the build should fail.</p>
<p>Also, you should be using the <code>--target app-store</code> option if you&#39;re ready to build your app for distribution.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for you answer but I don&#39;t even get the red screen, the app launches, I get the splashscreen but app.js is never loaded. I already checked the console from my device in Xcode, and nothing special appears, no error no nothing.</p>
<p>I also tried to install Titanium on another computer, fresh install with nothing special and the app fails to load too so the error lies in the project folder somewhere.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll try to change the png splash file, maybe it&#39;s corrupt or something even if it displays fine.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

										<p><p>I am encountering the same problem: app works perfectly fine in iOS simulators (both iPhone and iPad) but on either device (new iPad but iPhone 4, both on iOS 7.0.2) the app just stays on the splash screen. I&#39;m on Titanium 3.1.2 and using Xcode 5.0.<br>The Xcode console log for both seem to indicate a successful application boot, but then it just hangs at the splash screen and nothing further gets logged in the console (at least that does not get logged whether the app is currently running or not):</p>

</code></pre><p>Compiling the app with <code>--log-level trace</code> also offered no enlightenment: besides not knowing what to look for, there were no obvious issues. The only warnings were for the deprecated <em>NavigationGroup</em> component and otherwise all seems well (if the messages <strong>&quot;Alloy compiler completed successfully&quot;</strong> and <strong><strong> BUILD SUCCEEDED </strong></strong> can be believed…<br>Alternatively I have tried compiling both with and without the <code>-D development</code> switch, but no avail.</p>
