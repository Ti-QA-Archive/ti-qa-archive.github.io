			<h1>Android Memory leaks</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I got this error message in theandroid&#39;s logcat while scrolling in a table containing imageviews and labels. Those datas are comming from a remote server. It seems that it&#39;s a memory leak issue, but is there a way to solve that in Titanium ?</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[<span class="hljs-link_label">ERROR</span>][<span class="hljs-link_reference">dalvikvm-heap(  375)</span>] 403200-byte external allocation too large for this process.
[<span class="hljs-link_label">ERROR</span>][<span class="hljs-link_reference">GraphicsJNI(  375)</span>] VM won't let us allocate 403200 bytes
</code></pre><p>This comes as an error level in the log but is it really making some troubles in the app ?<br>How to free some memory in that king of case ?</p>
<p>I&#39;m on titanium SDK 3.1 (using alloy framework), testing on android versions : from 2.3.3 to 4.3 and it seems that it appears in most of those android versions.</p>
<p>The images loaded in the imageview are coming from facebook in a small size (180x180).</p>
<p>The app is working fine except that, but I really want to understand if I can solve that kind of leaks and how to do it in titanium ? If someone from Appcelerator have a precise answer, I&#39;m interested in…please :-)</p>

							<p>Before we jump to any conclusion regarding memory. It is important to identify how much memory your application is actually using. </p>
<p>###Here are some thing to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many rows are you displaying at any given time?</li>
<li>Have you used the <code>className</code> property for each row in order to gain performance?</li>
<li>How many controls (Labels, Images, etc.) are contained in each row?</li>
<li>Are you loading the whole set of rows in a single call or are you loading as the user scrolls the table.</li>
</ul>
<p>If all these factors are addressed and you are still experiencing slowdowns, you may want to have a look at the new <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;ListViews">ListView</a> component. Which is way faster than the regular TableView.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Christian for this interesting answer !<br>I load only 10 rows while on app launch, and then update the tableview when the user is scrolling down.<br>I do not use the className property on my rows but ids.<br>My rows are containing 1 imageview and 4 labels</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be looking up to the listview, which is a component I never used :) Thanks a lot !</p>
<p>I think these question of leaks ans garbage collection are really important and insteresting in titanium because of titanium is a cross platform based on javascript… I&#39;m really interested in documentations about that. If someone could give me some articles to read about leaks in titanium…</p>

							<p>After watching <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;29804284">this video</a>, one question comes to me : my app is a 3 tabs app, one with my table view loading 10 first first (with ifinite scrolling next) one with a search view with autocompletion on it, and last with tableview loading when user has facebook connection enabled.</p>
<p>At approximatly 30:00 Rick Blalock recommands to load UI items with a focus event on window tab…</p>
<p>Okay so : in alloy, does that mean that I need to do 1 view for the win, and 1 view for the window content loaded after the focus event ? Or does alloy do that by default ? I did not find any precise answers about alloy leaks improvements…</p>
<p>I think It could be great to have more informations about those kind of issues ? It&#39;s only a suggestion… :-)</p>

										<p><p>Theoretically,  Titanium takes care of memory allocation and release particularly for UIs.  However, if multi-thread is out there, then a potential memory issue would occur.  Consider if you have multi-threading problem in your app such as open window via url</p>
