			<h1>Can&#39;t Run app on android device, but Debug works</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I upgraded to Ti 3.2 yesterday and it all worked great until a point I could no longer run the app on the device (android) except when starting in Debug mode. </p>
<p>I ran it multiple times with the &quot;Run&quot; command without problem. Now it stalls before the first screen appears. When I start the app on the device with the &quot;Debug&quot; option, it starts fine.</p>
<p>I thought my code was &#39;bad&#39; and rolled back to a version from yesterday which I knew worked with the &#39;Run&#39; command but that didn&#39;t help.</p>
<p>The problem with running in Debug mode is that if I exit the app on the device I can&#39;t restart it - it hangs - same problem as when using the &#39;Run&#39; command.</p>
<p>Anyone has an idea what&#39;s going and how to resolve?</p>
<p>Ti 3.20 GA<br>OSX Mavericks<br>Android 4.1</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>So, what exactly is it doing? Does the app not install? Does it install, but freeze at the splash screen? Have you tried building the app from the command line?</p>

										<p><p>Interesting. Would you mind creating a ticket and attaching the non-debug build log? Please make sure you enable trace logging. You can create a ticket here: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;</a>. We&#39;ll start investigating as soon as we can see that build log output. Thank you!</p>

							<p>I found over a dozen ADB  processes lingering in the Activity Monitor. I force quit all of them and was able to start my Android app on device using the &quot;Run&quot; command (i.e. Not in Debug mode). I noticed that every time I launch the app with the &quot;Run&quot; command a new ADB process is created and the previous ADB processes lingers on.</p>

							<p>I ran into this issue a few hours after starting a project.  I thought it was something i coded so i started a new project and slowly migrated files over and ran the project. I&#39;ve updated all of the alloy files and this new project runs as intended.  As some have mentioned earlier, in debug mode the application runs as intended. Should I wait for a fix and continue in debug mode or start a new project?<br>Mac OSX 10.9.1<br>Titanium Studio 3.2.0.201312191547</p>

										<p><p>That didn&#39;t work for me either. What steps did you take? </p>
<p>I copied the APK file in my build dir to the device and then ran the android installer (invoked when I tapped the APK file). When I launch the app it still freezes on startup.</p>
