			<p>What is the recommended way to make multiple httpRequests in successsion? I am trying to aggregate multiple rss feeds into one timeline, I could have anywhere from 2 to 10+ feeds that need to be looped through. Each feed could have up to 25 results. </p>
<p>Simply put, what is the recommended, best practices way to accomplish this? Do I create one global request object that gets called each time a feed needs to be fetched? Or do I create a local request object that gets instantiated each time a new feed is requested.</p>
<p>Currently, I am creating a new local request each time a feed is requested, however it is resulting in seemingly random crashing and seems prone to memory leaks.</p>

							<p>After working with nick, here is the solution I cam up with, the missing piece was to use only one instance of the httpClient instead of creating a new one each time.</p>

							<p>The number one rule in web development performance is reduce the number of http requests. What I would do is set up my own service that handles aggregating the feeds, and then connect to that for the feed. At the very least, I&#39;d use one of those customizable feed aggregators and then fetch the content from that.</p>
<p>That said your xhr objects shouldn&#39;t be leaking so badly that its crashing the app… I&#39;ve got a four tab app that does a http request every focus for two of the tabs and it works fine. So you probably have some workflow issues there.</p>

										<p><p>Setting up my own service is definitely an option. However, I want to make sure that my understanding of handling multiple httpRequests is solid.</p>

							<p>For what you are looking for, I would recommend making the requests in a multi-threaded fashion, fill a database and then fire an event to update the timeline each time a data set is updated. For my apps, I typically take the load off the device and I have written code on a server to aggregate the data and then do one call&#x2F;connection from the device.</p>
<p>You could also use setTimeout to call them at the same time since it will act as a separate thread to my knowledge.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">setTimeout(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span>{    <span class="hljs-comment">// separate thread    },100);</span>
</code></pre><p>I would also check out the suds client. I create objects with get methods to download the data and store it to a database. You could then create a method for the object to display the list.</p>
