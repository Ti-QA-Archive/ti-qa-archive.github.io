			<h1>SQL Table Lock: SQLite error: &#39;database table is locked&#39; any ideas on how to prevent this?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am not sure why this is happening I have already made all my statements as follow:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">dataBase.execute("<span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">BEGIN</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">IMMEDIATE</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">TRANSACTION</span><span class="hljs-string">");
dataBase.execute( ... sql statement(s) ... );
dataBase.execute("</span><span class="hljs-keyword">END</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">TRANSACTION</span><span class="hljs-string">");</span></span>
</code></pre><p>Do I need to close each statement as well?<br>Also my database is in an external file that is referenced with the &quot;include&quot; at the top of the file. Besides that I am also working in a multiple context paradigm. </p>
<p>Any tips are welcome. Thanks</p>

							<p>How is your database included? Is that possible? I think the only possible way is to &quot;install&quot; database. Do you mean you have database connection reference included?</p>

										<p><p>No, &quot;open&quot; and &quot;install&quot; are similar. Are you opening database in included file? Maybe it is opened multiple times and because of that more than one connection is estabilished (transaction fails if other connections locks database table). Now, that is just a guess. :)</p>
<p>I used &quot;BEGIN&quot; (deffered, not immediate, I&#39;m not sure why do you need immediate transaction?) and &quot;COMMIT&quot; with no problem.</p>

										<p><p>END TRANSACTION is an alias for COMMIT.  They are functionally identical.</p>
<p>BEGIN TRANSACTION is the short form of BEGIN DEFERRED TRANSACTION, where the other choices are BEGIN IMMEDIATE TRANSACTION and BEGIN EXCLUSIVE TRANSACTION.  They differ mostly in the timing of when a lock is acquired.  However, when your next code statement after the BEGIN TRANSACTION is an UPDATE statement both DEFERRED (the default) and IMMEDIATE amount to the same thing.  See the explanation in the SQLite <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sqlite.org&#x2F;lang_transaction.html">BEGIN TRANSACTION</a> documentation.</p>

							<p>Does the *.js file included at the top of each window have its own Ti.Database.open() statement?  If so, each window will essentially be a new &quot;user&quot; to the SQLite engine.  Thus if one &quot;user&quot; has done something which locks a table, another &quot;user&quot; (i.e. window) can be blocked from concurrent access.</p>
<p>That is why I had you add the begin and end transaction lines in an effort to flush out locks from implicit transactions.  (See the SQLite <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sqlite.org&#x2F;lang_transaction.html">Begin Transaction</a> docs for what I am talking about.)</p>
<p>Since that did not do it for you (and I expected it would), you may need to try opening and closing the database when each tab is activated.  That is, add a close operation in the window&#39;s blur event, and an open in the window&#39;s focus event.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could route all updates through a single database open by opening in app.js then adding a custom event listener.  In the other windows, setup the desired SQL update statement and pass in the event object to the app.js listener.  It would then take the SQL from the event object and perform the updates from within that single &quot;user&quot; from SQLite&#39;s perspective.</p>

										<p><p>Will dataBase.close() be enough or do I have to close each execute? </p>

										<p><p>A bit off topic but I am confused between the &quot;include&quot; method and the &quot;require&quot; method.<br>My only background is LUA which is very similar to javascript and uses the &quot;require&quot; method with modules. I found some info about &quot;require&quot; from the CommonJS standard. </p>
<p>Would it be better to &quot;require&quot; the database and then define it as exports.database to access it? Or would that still cause the same issue as the &quot;include&quot; method.</p>

										<p><p>When the dataBase.execute() is for a SELECT and thus a result set, best practice is to close the result set when you are done with it, such as after a loop over the result set.</p>
<p>When the dataBase.execute() is for an INSERT&#x2F;UPDATE I don&#39;t think there is any reason to do that because there is no result set.</p>
<p>But even if you do not close a result set prior to closing the database, SQLite should be releasing any locks and invalidating a result set once you close the database.  So to answer the question, I think closing the database should be enough.  But I prefer explicitly closing result sets when I am done with them.</p>
