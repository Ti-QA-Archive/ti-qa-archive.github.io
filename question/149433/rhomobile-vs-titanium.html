							<p>I think Rho is more close to PhoneGap  - a webview to which some native capabilities (like the gps) are exposed. (this is what I figured out at a first glance on their website)</p>
<p>Titanium on the other hand creates truly native UI and drives the logic behind with JS.</p>

										<p><p>Pros and Cons on RhoMobile:</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ol>
<li>Great support by motorola and rhomobile team. Really big plus, they&#39;re fast and know what they are doing.<ol>
<li>It&#39;s easy to learn. I found Ruby very easy to learn and if you want, you can avoid it almost entirely and do just the basics. The framework is also very straightforward and simple and using any library usually just requires calling a function.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Supports out of the box a lot of devices hardware features (camera, barcode scanners, etc.)</li>
<li>Rhohub, Rhoconnect, RhoGallery, check them out, they work great and gives a lot of value to the platform.</li>
</ol>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rhostudio (still) sucks. It&#39;s a tool that lacks all the great features of any modern IDE. Luckily you can develop using any other editor (like Sublime text) and use the command line. I use Rhostudio just for building and some quick editing to avoid the command line.</li>
<li>Like every framework, when you want to do something it&#39;s still not prepared to do, it&#39;s a pain. </li>
<li>Check the features and libraries already included and make sure it has everything you need. It allows you to write extensions but that&#39;s not really what you are looking for.</li>
<li>Building and deploying (not using rhohub) for windows mobile and blackberry can be a pain if it doesn&#39;t work like described in the documentation.</li>
<li>A lot of outdated documentation. Many things doesn&#39;t go as described in the documentation, or you can&#39;t find the detail you want on something. That&#39;s when the support in launchpad and google groups shines.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t know why but i constantly get that feeling that mobile cross-platform development it&#39;s still not there yet but it&#39;s getting there…</li>
</ol>
