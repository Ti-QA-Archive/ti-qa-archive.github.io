			<p>Titanium sdk 2.0<br>iphone sdk 5.1</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My app was rejected today for the following reasons:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">We found that your app offers In-App Purchase/s that can be restored but <span class="hljs-keyword">it</span> does <span class="hljs-operator">not</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">include</span> <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Restore"</span> feature <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> allow users <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> restore <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> previously purchased In-App Purchase/s.

To restore previously purchased In-App Purchase products, <span class="hljs-keyword">it</span> would be appropriate <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> provide <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Restore"</span> button <span class="hljs-operator">and</span> initiate <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> restore <span class="hljs-built_in">process</span> when <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Restore"</span> button is tapped.
</code></pre><p>This is how i implemented the inapp:</p>
<ul>
<li>display upgrade button</li>
<li>hide upgrade button if purchase is completed. </li>
</ul>
<p>What is the best solution to this? Do you think it would be accepted if i dont hide the upgrade button? Or is it required to display restore button?</p>
<p>If not, how can i direct the restore button to restored previously transactions in storekit?</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

							<p>If you delete the app off of your phone, install it again, does your upgrade still hold? If they don&#39;t have the upgraded features and don&#39;t have an option to upgrade again (which is where the restore should happen), that seems like it might be the issue. Otherwise I think what you have described should be fine.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Matt,</p>
<p>When you delete the app and install again, the upgrade button reappears, so you can restore the purchase again using storekit module.  This works fine.  When you click on the upgrade and when it is successful, the upgrade button becomes hidden and all the upgrade features become available.  </p>
<p> My previous apps hides the upgrade button and they were approved, so I don&#39;t understand why Apple decided against this one.</p>
<p>I think i&#39;ll have to keep the upgrade button visible for now and reupload.  I will post the result maybe in a week - it normally takes that long to review.</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s pretty strange then. I have a couple of apps that also function basically in that manner, and they were approved fine. Good luck.</p>
