			<h1>Passing a variable when closing a window to  the previous window</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi everyone, i think i have a small problem. I&#39;m sure isn&#39;t a big issue but i haven&#39;t find a nice workaround for that.</p>
<p>I have tabgroup based navigation layout (one single tab with tabbar hidden). So basically you can open many level windows and you can return to the previous one.</p>
<p>My question is that isn&#39;t a nice way to come back to the previous window with a variable when closing current window? </p>
<p>I have a textfield on a window, onclick opens a new window, select a value from there, close that window and come back to that value in the previous window to complete in the textbok. It&#39;s simple. </p>
<p>Isn&#39;t a more simple method then add a focus event to the parent window and get a persistent data that was set on the new window? </p>
<p>I mean it&#39;s something simple, a windows opens another one, when closing it come back to the previous window with some data. </p>
<p>Thanks a lot.</p>

							<p>One way or the other, you need to notify the existing window that something in the world has changed and it needs to take action.</p>
<p>Even if there was a magic callback on closing a window that passes variables back to an existing object, you will still need to demand action of some sort from the object.</p>
<p>Enter events.  You mentioned the focus event on the existing window and that is one option.</p>
<p>The other is to create an <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;latest&#x2F;Titanium.App-module">app level event</a> that calls a function to update your existing window. </p>
<p>Either way your persistant data (stored in a App.Property or in a global variable) has to be brought to the attention of the other objects somehow.</p>

										<p><p>The problem with a focus event on the window, is that the focus event would be fired when the window is initially created and interacted with or on a tab change.</p>
<p>You should add a close event to your sub window that calls the function to update your first window.</p>

							<p>hi lonut,</p>
<p>you can use your custom event listener instead of <strong>focus</strong> event of your current window</p>
