			<h1>Is it possible to use a C++ library inside Titanium mobile ?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>Assume we already have a C++ library for doing some complex calculs, we are wondering if it&#39;s possible to use this library inside Titanium mobile (for iPhone and Android).</p>
<p>Maybe we are wrong but we thing it should be possible thanks to Titanium custom modules ?!</p>
<p>This is for client work so we basically need to have one single answer, YES or NO. If it&#39;s possible we would like to know how to call C++ code inside our app (code exemple would be appreciated).</p>
<p>Thanks for your time</p>

							<p>Yes, this is possible, you need the NDK kit and a lot of patience but its possible. I have a native module (C&#x2F;C++) running in Android callable from Titanium.</p>
<p>Note: I&#39;m using Mobile SDK 1.6 (from the continuous build server) and you must have both your standard Android SDK and NDK environments installed and working before anything else.</p>
<p>Instructions would be a bit long winded but I&#39;d recommend you get the Android NDK and build the hello-jni example. </p>
<p>You can then change the code around (in the jni directory) for whatever you&#39;d like your native funcs to be, but you need to take the libs directory (that the NDK builds) and turn this into a JAR file</p>
<p>ie: jar -cf mymodule.jar libs</p>
<p>This will take the armeabi directory and your .so module and suck it all into a JAR file. (Note that its &quot;libs&quot; with an &quot;s&quot; whereas below its going to be &quot;lib&quot; with no &quot;s&quot;)</p>
<p>You then copy that mymodule.jar into your Titanium module (you did follow the instructions on this site about creating your own custom Ti module for Android right?). You put this in your Ti modules &quot;&#x2F;lib&quot; directory.</p>
<p>This means when you run &quot;ant&quot; and build your Ti module it&#39;ll include your Jar file. Simple quick way to test is of course &quot;ant run&quot; which (if you have the sim up) will kick of the example&#x2F;app.js code to unit test your module. It also means in your Java class (the Ti module will create this for you, it extends KrollMOdule) where you call your System.loadLibrary(&quot;whatever&quot;); it&#39;ll be able to find it.</p>
<p>Of course you have to make sure your C functions and Java functions have the right declarations, but if you copy the hello-jni java code and c code you&#39;ll be fine. If not, ping me, what took me hours was figuring out how to get that lib bundled so if you work through and understand building a NDK and building a Ti module then hooking the two up is easy with the &quot;hidden step&quot; above.</p>

										<p><p>I am trying to make a module for QCAR AR for Titanium but QCAR also involves cpp code.

							<p>Hi Chris..<br>I wanted to include a .so file in my module. I was able to get the .jar file of the libs folder through the steps provided by you.. but I am getting another error in the LogCat<br>07-20 16:08:55.792: E&#x2F;AndroidRuntime(6144): java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Couldn&#39;t load scanditsdk-android-3.1.12: findLibrary returned null</p>

							<p>In theory it should be possible by building your C++ code with the Android NDK, and exposing it via JNI to Java, and thus to Titanium. We haven&#39;t officially tested this route, but I personally have some experience using the NDK, so you might stop by #titanium_dev if you need pointers.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;d be interested in this too.. looks like this is my &#39;weekend&#39; task to see if I can do it. Would need to use the NDK to x-compile ARM code and, as you say, use the standard Java&#x2F;JNI methods to get access to the lower C&#x2F;C++ funcs.</p>

							<p>No, it is not possible because Android custom extensions must be programmed in Java. Thats not an Appcelerator decision but rather the way Android was written.</p>
