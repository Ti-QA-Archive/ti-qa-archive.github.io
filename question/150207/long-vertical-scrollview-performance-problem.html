			<h1>Long vertical scrollview performance problem</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I&#39;m having serious trouble with scrollview performance and wondering if someone has experience on this can share his strategic solutions.</p>
<p>I am developing a pinterest-like app with 2-column scrollview which is the container for a large number of pin boxes.<br>Each pin box consists of views, imageviews and labels (the appearance somewhat looks like pinterest&#39;s pins), and the data is queried from remote server. The list can auto add more pin boxes when scrolling near the end (each update queries 15 pins).</p>
<p>The performance breakdown occurs when the pin boxes are being added to the scrollview, which shows a terrible lagging if I try to scroll up and&#x2F;or down. I&#39;m fixing it for weeks and could just improve a little performance, and FYI, the app on android suffers less performance issue than on ios (still suffering though) :(</p>
<p>The code is somehow too complicated to be posted here (or at least I cannot seperate essential parts that deal with the problem), so just the strategies are more than enough :)</p>
<p>FYI:<br>Titanium SDK 3.0.2, Alloy 1.0 (I made the list and the pinbox as widgets)<br>iPhone 4S with iOS 6.0.1, Samsung Galaxy S2 android 2.3.3</p>
<p>Some thoughts:<br>I&#39;m wondering if too deep view is the main impact on performance. My pin box is a 4-layer depth view, which is added to the bottom view of a 4-layer depth scroll list.</p>
<p>I have tried not loading image into the view (just layout the box frame), but the performance is not improved much, so memory might not be the problem.</p>
<p>I&#39;m also trying to add a bunch of 15 boxes into the list at once instead of one by one as of now, havent done yet but the code is more and more complicated because I have to calculate the  each columns&#39; height to determine where to add the box to, and the height is not determined until it is laid out (I am using an invisible temp view, and the work is being continued…)</p>
<p>I&#39;m also thinking of loading just a part of the scrollview and make necessary parts swap in&#x2F;out but have not a clue yet how to implement it.</p>
<p>Really hope to find some advice from the pros here :)</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

							<div><p>Basically, I&#39;m making a 2-column list that consists of many views called &quot;tagbox&quot;. Tagbox will be added when the list scroll to its end and into the shorter column.</p>
<p>Problem is that on android this is working fine, the lagging can be ignored, but on iOS the list suffers from terrible lag occurring each time it&#39;s adding more views, causing users to be unable to scroll (in a moment). It is terrible on real device and can be noticed on simulator.</p>
<p>How can I solve this performance problem?</p>
<ul>
<li>Titanium SDK 3.1.0, Alloy 1.1.0</li>
<li>iPhone 4S with iOS 6.0.1, Samsung Galaxy S2 android 2.3.3</li>
</ul>
<p>I have minimized my original code to the test code below, pull if you want to test ;)<br>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cuongnx&#x2F;taglist_test.git</p>
<p>Thanks :)</p>

							<p>Instead of using a scrollView, have you tried using a tableView?  I think you&#39;ll have much better performance using tableViewRows.  You can still make it looks the same as a scrollView, meaning, removing all the default styling.</p>

										<p><p>Also, when using a tableView, you just have to set the rowHeight and not worry about where you are going to place your next view.  You just append it to the bottom of the table.  :)</p>

										<p><p>Do you mean to make 2 tableview sitting next to each other and scroll synchronously?</p>
<p>My scrollview have 2 vertical-layout columns, each column contains views with different height (so no row in my opinion).<br>How can I implement this kind of layout using tableView?</p>
