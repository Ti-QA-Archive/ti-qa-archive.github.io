			<h1>Light Titanium MVC framework + OOP ... again</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi everybody,<br>I apologize for asking a question already posted a lot of times but I already red all the posts and tryed all the framework suggested in the answers (Backbone, PureMVC, Adamantium, mcv,… ) without really finding what I am searching for.</p>
<p>I am looking for a lighweight MVC framework to better structure my Titanium Mobile applications. </p>
<p>I think my requirements are very common:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to have a framework that extendly uses the CommonJs pattern</li>
<li>I need to have a hierarchical controller structure with a main controller that take care to route actions to sub controllers </li>
<li>A controller must be able to easily have a reference on every element of the view and its model</li>
<li>I need an OOP approach that enables me to multi instantiate a view in different context and attaching it to different controllers</li>
<li>I need a navigation controller that easily integrates with the main application controller and can access and modify the stack of the open windows </li>
</ul>
<p>I think that more than just the MVC framework itself I need some architectural patterns and blueprint to apply to my apps.</p>
<p>Right now I developed a pretty large app, refactoring it a couple of time according with the increasing amount of info (community, tutorials, …) that I continously gather around but I still experience some memory leaks, unpredictable crashes and so on. </p>
<p>Does anybody have some suggestions to share? I also read somewhere that a solution on this matter (mvc + oop patterns) is in development  from the Appcelerator team. Am I wrong?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Alessandro</p>

							<p>Hi Alessandro. I don&#39;t know is anyone from Appcelerator working on OOP + MVC features, but it would be nice to have something like that. If they are, then it&#39;s pity they didn&#39;t ask people from community for ideas and feedback.</p>
<p>Anyway, in the past there was couple of ideas how to bring OOP feature to the Titanium and most of them are similar ideas (you can search Q&#x2F;A with new search mechanism, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find interesting stuff). You can see basic idea here (idea is to wrap Titanium object with JS native ones):</p>
<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;1333884">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;1333884</a></p>
<p>Here is one more idea (mine :) ):</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;2799582">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;2799582</a></p>
<p>it&#39;s basically the same idea, but mine solves the problem of getting particular element (without using slow linear search through all elements of some component).</p>
<p>To build (M)VC, you need to separate component creation logic and functional logic. So, in view part you just create dummy UI look, in controller part you add functionality (using events) to that dummy UI look. Simple as that.</p>

										<p><p>Ah yes, there is small bug in that OOP approach and I think it won&#39;t work fine without some fine tuning (I haven&#39;t test it). I&#39;ll keep the solution for myself for now since I plan to release my framework that will have OOP capabilities. -_-</p>

							<p>Hi Ivan,<br>thanks a lot for your answer. I agree on the idea, I&#39;m going to keep up working on my solution and share it as long as it will be available. As I am planning to start from scratch, if you have some code to share it would be really useful :-)</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Alessandro</p>

										<p><p>At the moment no. I can share you ideas and help you with your code, but my code is a mess at the moment. My app will soon be rewritten and reorganized and then I could share my work.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m gonna propose my framework. It supports the navigation between pages with animation.</p>
<p>I built a Facebook-menu-alike app as an example. It works on both Android and iOS.</p>
