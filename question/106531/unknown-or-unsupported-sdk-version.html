							<div><p>I am getting increasingly frustrated at the instability of the platform in general.  I have been coding for well over 20 years and I&#39;m finding that there are A LOT of instabilities.  I get errors when the launch exits. I can purposely make changes to cause the system to display errors, and it won&#39;t.  Now, the above &quot;unsupported&quot; platform message.  I closed the Developer and reopened and everything ran fine.  Why only after a reboot?</p>

<p>This can happen when the simulator is started before the iphone SDKs are loaded. If this continues, clear out the build files and try again.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>Paul, I&#39;m curious based on what you just said.  I have just run my application, found that I needed to change a link location for a webview. (i.e. a reference).  I changed it in the program, then re-ran. Same result… An HTML page with no styling.  I changed the reference to something completely off the wall, an unrelated directory,  and re ran. Same result… the webview rendered, but with no CSS styling.</p>
<p>It&#39;s sometimes like Titanium Developer isn&#39;t picking up changes to the source code. No matter what you change, nothing changes on output. You mention to clear out the build files…. do they have to be cleared EACH time you make a change to the source and want to test?</p>

<p>Regarding your webview, you seem to be speaking about an unrelated issue. If so, would you explain that in a new post?</p>
<p>Is the &quot;Unknown or unsupported SDK version: loading… &#x2F; [INFO] Application has exited from Simulator&quot; error resolved now?</p>
<p>No, you don&#39;t need to delete the build files each time. However, when you experience a problem, it&#39;s a good place to start. After a while you learn when it&#39;s likely to be helpful.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

										<p><p>Paul, I think that the unsupported SDK issue, certainly may be a transient one and is as you say.  However, I have, in another question on the board, chronicled about the errors that are occurring each time I stop the simulator.  In the console I get a couple of irritating python errors that are being thrown by the developer, no matter what project is run (Including Kitchen Sink).</p>
<p>Question, though, when you say to clear the build files, I&#39;m unsure of what that means. There is a BUILD master directory. But under that there is an iPhone directory with a Build subdirectory also.  Which one do you usually clear?</p>

<p>Sorry I didn&#39;t explain clearing the build directories before. See <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;104161&#x2F;31-to-42application-stopped-workin#184101">this post</a> for information. You only need to worry about clearing the files related to the platform you are having the problem with.</p>
