			<h1>I need some event-oriented approach advice</h1>

			<p>I&#39;m getting bogged down in and extremely frustrated with a segment of Geolocation-centric code I&#39;m trying to write. I&#39;m creating a tableView that lists facilities and their distance from the user&#39;s current location. </p>
<p>In order to do that:</p>
<ul>
<li>I need to read in an XML file loaded from the web via XHR that contains the list of facilities.</li>
<li>I need to get the user&#39;s current location.</li>
<li>I need to iterate over each location in the XML file.<ul>
<li>I need to flesh out a bunch of row data (labels and views)</li>
<li>I need to <code>forwardGeocode</code> from the facility address to get the long&#x2F;lat</li>
<li>I need to update the row label that displays the distance info. I create it initially with a value of &quot;Calculating distance…&quot; since the geolocation APIs are asynchronous.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Event-oriented thought doesn&#39;t come naturally to me, so I keep finding myself in this cascading hell of callbacks and I&#39;m trying to both clean up and get the code to work. All of the individual pieces work, but the whole unit doesn&#39;t because I don&#39;t have the timing right.</p>
<p>The code isn&#39;t trivial, so I&#39;ve created <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;1367590">a gist</a>. I&#39;d love some additional eyeballs to help me through the growing pains with this one. I&#39;ve about lost my patience with it.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>A possible approach would be like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>start your geo location in app.js and store the location in a property (getcurrent or location event).</li>
<li>read ur xml file (why xml? on android is dead slow) and make your UI stuff with placeholders for distance (&#39;Retrieveing distance…&#39;). While doing this push all the labels u need updated into a array, with the facility address as well.</li>
<li>after all is rendered create and execute a function &#39;get_distance(point)&#39; that will make the forward geo and on success will calculate the distance to the stored location and call itself again with the next point in array (if any).<br>Of course all the above if there is a location stored, else a 2 sec timeout will call it again.</li>
</ul>
<p>This way the only callback will be after the forward geo. And you have the UI made without waiting the gps to lock (can take minutes sometimes)</p>
<p>Makes sense?</p>
<p>PS. Just an idea :)</p>
