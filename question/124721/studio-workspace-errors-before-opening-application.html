			<h1>Studio Workspace Errors before opening application</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I was building an app and an update downloaded into my version of Studio - it was 1.0.5 (probably from the beta server)</p>
<p>After the quit and restart, i began to see errors pop up in a small window every time I ran the debugger, and then every time the project was built.</p>
<p>Then after a couple of restarts and more work, I was faced with this message <em>every time</em> I went to load up my default workspace:</p>
<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;skitch.com&#x2F;spiritquest&#x2F;fu1x8&#x2F;titaniumstudio">Popup Image</a></p>
<p>The log file is lengthy and hefty, and I copied the last session instead of the whole file, which contains <em>lots of data</em> going back weeks&#x2F;months.</p>
<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raw.github.com&#x2F;gist&#x2F;15a397ca3aeab395d107&#x2F;3478e2c1d23e955c137f92a2165b247b2ca2b345&#x2F;studio-log-error.txt">Gist of log entry</a></p>
<p>I can no longer access the old workspace, I can however create a new workspace and had to do that so I could continue working on my project, but I am at a loss as to what to do now, perhaps I should import the old projects into a new workspace, but I&#39;d rather not.</p>
<p>Anyone have some ideas ? If you need more information please let me know. I tried reverting back to my 1.0.4 build, but that hasn&#39;t made any difference, I tried to copy the .metadata directory to a fresh workspace, but that caused errors, so something in the .metadata folder has caused this.</p>

							<p>Hi Ket :)</p>
<p>This may be caused by <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.eclipse.org&#x2F;bugs&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=149121">this</a> eclipse bug. Hence, it appears that there are two possible solutions, explained in the bullet points below.</p>
<p>Important: Copy your whole workspace first, so that you are not risking your original files when you attempt these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rename the file <code>workspace\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.core.resources\.root\nn.tree</code>, where <em>nn</em> is a number, and reduce it by 2. As an example, if you have the file <code>82.tree</code>, rename it to <code>80.tree</code>, and restart Studio</li>
<li>Delete the file <code>.metadata&amp;#x2F;.plugins&amp;#x2F;org.eclipse.core.resources&amp;#x2F;.snap</code>, and restart Studio</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me know which, if either, of these work.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>I tried <strong><em>step 1)</em></strong> and it made no difference.</p>
<p>I then tried <strong><em>step 2)</em></strong> (removing <code>.snap</code>) and that got me back into my Workspace. The only problem was that all my projects listed within the workspace had disappeared.</p>
<p>I re-added&#x2F;imported the project I am working on, and began to receive similar build errors (numerous errors) during the build - which indicates that the particular projet I am working on has some corrupt metadata in it - the app itself works well in the emulator as expected, it is just a rash of build errors that pop up that seem to cause the problem.</p>
<p>With regards to my other projects (20 odd) I am happy to import them back in, the workspace customisations are all present and so I am happy about that.</p>

<p>The team are eager to try to get to the bottom of this, with your help…</p>
<p>By &quot;build errors&quot; do you mean Titanium SDK build errors, or errors relating to TiStudio?</p>
<p>You already have my address. Would you object to sending me the following?</p>
<ul>
<li>tarball of project</li>
<li>whole studio log file</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully this will help us reproduce the issue.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>Am sorting this out for you now. I have taken 2 screenshots of the popup build errors that show when I open the project:</p>

<p>Just to conclude this thread, I regret that there is unlikely to be a way for us to prevent this issue from happening altogether. </p>
<p>It looks like it is normally caused by some sort of crash or other situation, where the product was interrupted in saving workspace data (I.e. power loss to the computer, permissions, full disk, corrupt disk segment etc). Normally it doesn&#39;t cause a problem to this extent, but it can on rare occasions.</p>
<p>Studio is built on top of 3.6 currently, though we do plan to update to 3.7 at some point (no ETA there). It appears they made the message better (if not reducing the occurrence altogether) in Eclipse 3.7. </p>
<p>So, to reiterate, deleting the .snap file will remove the projects from the workspace and resolve the error. Then they can be imported back in which, although is not ideal, is easy-enough to do. Note that the only metadata we have is in a .project file.</p>
<p>Sorry this isn&#39;t a full resolution to the issue, but I hope has been enough to get you working again.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
