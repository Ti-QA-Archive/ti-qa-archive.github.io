			<h1>Urban Airship Push not working in App Store, works on Ad Hoc</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Ok I could really use some help on this one. I am totally lost now and going on 2 updates to the App Store which have not resolved it. I thought for sure this past time I had it working.</p>
<p>Basically I am using the REST version of Urban Airship, not the module available via Appcelerator. I am using these examples, though I have modified them a little:</p>
<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Push+Notifications+with+Urban+Airship+%28app.js%29">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Push+Notifications+with+Urban+Airship+%28app.js%29</a><br><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Push+Notifications+with+Urban+Airship+%28urbanairship.js%29">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Push+Notifications+with+Urban+Airship+%28urbanairship.js%29</a></p>
<p>I have two Urban Airship apps, one for production and one for dev, as recommended by them. Everything works fine on dev.</p>
<p>Here is the part that is driving me crazy. I finally was able to get an Ad Hoc version working perfectly on all test devices using the production Urban Airship app, Ad Hoc distribution provisioning profile, and production APNS certificate. Figured everything was good. And once again when I submitted the app, obviously using the App Store distribution provisioning profile, I am getting nothing and no new device tokens are being registered.</p>
<p>Anyone have any ideas on what could be going on? Is it Urban Airship? Titanium? My code?</p>

										<p><p>I did clear it up, but I had sooo many problems with push notifications around this time that I can&#39;t say for sure what I did. However, based on <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;148135&#x2F;no-reply-from-tinetworkregisterforpushnotifications">this post</a>  I made, I would say that rebuilding the Provisioning Profile is what worked for me:</p>

										<p><p>Yeah, the provisioning profiles part is the hardest I think. But once it is done it works perfectly</p>
