			<p>I&#39;d like to customize it so that it doesn&#39;t always install in iTunes &#x2F; cause my phone to sync when I want to do a device-install…  and, I&#39;d like it not to close Simulator when the app exits…  does anyone know which files I&#39;d edit?  I tried iphone.py but it didn&#39;t seem to change it…  thanks in advance!  </p>
<p>Btw using 3.0.0GA</p>

										<p><p>Talking about Titanium installation script files, and looking for behavior like Xcode app  deployment.</p>

										<p><p>Ashish,</p>
<p>I know exactly what he was asking. And my answer still holds.  APPLE dictates (through silence) how the simulator is to be used by developers and specifically how device installs are to be handled outside of xCode.</p>
<p>The scripts kill the open simulator because APPLE only allows one instance of the simulator to run at a time. (there used to be hacks that have since been abandoned, utilizing multi-user configs).</p>
<p>To even push a binary onto the simulator outside of  xCode is already a hack&#x2F;shim in itself (ios-sim).</p>
<p>So again, if you don&#39;t like the way Titanium (and other 3rd party development environments) have to work with the Apple Development environment, take it up with APPLE.</p>

										<p><p>I should also mention the legal constraints placed upon Apple Developers and their partners that restrict the reverse engineering of Apple&#39;s secret regarding the xCode to Device and xCode to simulator communication.</p>
