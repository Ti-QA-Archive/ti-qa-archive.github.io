			<h1>How to add files to git ignore list in Titanium Studio?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have some files in my project that are either programatically generated or are the ones whose changes are not supposed to go back to repository (like config files). I would like to add these files to git ignore list so that it does not ask me for staging those files again. How do I add them to the list from Titanium Studio?</p>

							<p>Studio will use the .gitignore file from within your project. You can simply flip over to the terminal tab in your project, open the .gitignore file, make you changes, and save the file. When you use the built in git functionality, your new .gitignore file should be respected.</p>

										<p><p>I just followed your steps and created a .gitignore file. It got created in my project directory. But no change. It is still suggesting me to stage those files. </p>
<p>I created .gitignore file with a single line as follows. Just to see if it will mute the suggestion of file <code>siteConfig.json</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">siteConfig</span><span class="hljs-class">.json</span>
</code></pre></p>

										<p><p>You shouldn&#39;t have had to create that file. If your project was a proper git repo, then the default file should have already existed. The idea is that when you use the built in git functionality in Studio, it doesn&#39;t do anything different than if you were using git on your system, ie: from the command line. So you can manage your git repo in the same manner as you would a non Studio based project.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Anthony, This is the first time I am working with git. I am not much aware of it&#39;s commands. I created one repository at github.com and then in studio I used the File &gt; Import to checkout the project. I was unable to find .gitignore file any where in the project.</p>
