			<p>Are there any advices on how to capture app state, runtime errors, stack-traces, etc when user gets stuck with a Titanium App ? I&#39;d like to code a mail message to Support that &quot;automatically&quot; gathers all info available.</p>

							<p>Hi,<br>i recommend you to use some kind of tracking system, like google analytics or flurry, they&#39;ll provide you to track uncaught exceptions, etc. There plenty modules floating around on github and the marketplace.</p>

										<p><p>Hey Malcolm,</p>
<p>tbh I think I misinterpreted the question. When i read it again, i think I&#39;m really missing the point when the question was asked in a testing context. My mind was set to production-mode today ;) </p>
<p>Nevertheless I use Google Analytics in a way to gather information about errors  in an production environment. I use GA Events  to capture some of this errors in a different error categories, i use ids,to contextualize errors and pass some information trough the label and value variables. Of course I cannot trace it down to a single user, or get any more details. But often the native Stacktraces are helpful for me too, after a little research in the ti source and jira.</p>
<p>The method you outlined in your answer interests me lot, is there any example out in the wild?<br>I would be very helpful for testing one of my current projects and would save me precious time. </p>
<p>Thank you very much</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Other than the obvious - test, test and more tests there are a few simple things you can do.</p>
<p>This idea is based on logging those things that do not work or fail to complete;</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a CommonJS module that will store and event name and the time&#x2F;date</li>
<li>Call this function each time you start a process that is expected to be completed by the app itself and return the internal process id.  Consider using a local database to store this information.</li>
<li>Once the process has completed remove the log entry passing back the process id.</li>
<li>Consider including a type parameter to aid your future log detection.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any entries still in the table must have failed to complete.</p>
<p>When the app starts up check if the log table has any entries, if there are any, build up the email contents from the rows of the log table offer the choice to the user so they can email it.  Obviously only add this option for testers (the app has not been deployed to the app store).</p>
<p>The aim here is that you log a process that would be started and stopped in your own code block.  Think press a button, so log the start, do something and then log the completion.  This should not be used for things that do not start and stop in a single process - so not when you add three buttons and then later when they are clicked as there is no association between the start and stop of the processes.</p>
<p>Whilst you can have the Google Android service tell you about uncaught errors - chances are the log information is so indiscernible that it will not help much.</p>
<p>Google Analytics and Flurry only log getting to somewhere and then somewhere else - they will not tell you a process failed unless you parse that information afterwards.</p>

										<p><p>Another thing to consider is app testing, check out TiMocha.  It allows you to create a module that tests modules and process inside the app - you say what things should be and then it tests against it, change those values and test again.</p>
<p>The idea is that you open CommonJS modules, widgets, controllers and more, then set values - confirm they are set, run the methods and functions, confirm the changes expected have occurred.</p>
<p>You create these scripts and then add to them as you build the app.  Re-run the tests often to make sure all is well.</p>

										<p><p>Yeah, not quite what I was looking for, but your answer gave me some insights, like creating a debug option so that the user can set it and then app would send all the logs to a backend. Will think about it.</p>

										<p><p>The self created logging solution works particularly well for Titanium apps as it points out which section of your code and obviously any device features being requested caused an issue that stopped the app from functioning. </p>
<p>For example if you extended the example to include manufacturer, mode, screen size and density as well as free memory and other useful things in the email then you could work out if the camera code you have fails every time on a Samsung S3 when the memory is less than 10% but everything else works - this gives you a real starting point to work with.</p>
<p>With Android devices being one of the most fractured platforms around - every assistance helps out.  Whilst device crash logs can be useful - they often reference things that developers have no direct knowledge of as they are system underpinnings we have no control over.</p>
