			<h1>Communicating from a WebView to Titanium in MobileWeb</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Is it possible to communicate asynchronously from a WebView to Titanium? I have done this successfully in the past, using Ti.App.fireEvent(), but in a new Alloy project in Titanium 3.0, it no longer works. Yes, I&#39;ve read these docs, but they seem to be out of date:</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Communication+Between+WebViews+and+Titanium</p>
<p>I have tried this when running the app in local &quot;preview in web browser&quot; mode, and when the app is served from a web server. The WebView is loaded from a HTML file inside the Titanium project, so according to the docs, Titanium should be available.</p>
<p>The problem is that, in a script in the WebView, Titanium is always undefined.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

							<p>We are aware of this problem for a little while now and have filed a ticket: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-10323">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-10323</a>. I suspect it has something to do with the onload event, but I need to do some tests and that might be a long while before I get around to it. :(</p>

										<p><p>Chris, thanks for the quick answer.</p>
<p>We have three large projects held up by this at the moment, tearing our hair out, working around it with server-side PHP and browser plugins, but it&#39;s a lot of work and very fragile. So I&#39;d really appreciate it if you could expedite a solution.</p>
<p>OTOH, if you could give Titanium access to browser features such as WebSockets and WebRTC, without having to use a WebView, then this bug wouldn&#39;t matter…</p>
<p>Just FYI, MobileWeb functionality is required for our projects, so solutions that use iOS or Android won&#39;t cut it.</p>

										<p><p>As of 3.2.3.GA, this is still not fixed. Ti.API.info() inside a window.onload script in the WebView on MobileWeb gives a reference error, Ti not found.</p>
<p>The bug report says this is closed and fixed, but I still get this error. What&#39;s going on?</p>
