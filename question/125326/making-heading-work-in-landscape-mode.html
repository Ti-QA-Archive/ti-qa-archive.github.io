			<h1>Making heading work in landscape mode</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am currently blocked regarding the Geolocation Heading change listener. I have an application that shows to the user, in augmented reality, the position of points in the vicinity. The problem is that the application takes for granted that the tablet is held in portrait mode, even though I force the mode to landscape.</p>
<p>How can I make the listener know that the device is held horizontally ?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Clément</p>
<p>PS: Titanium SDK 1.7.1, Android SDK 2.2</p>

							<p>I am actually working on a very similar project with augmented reality and placing points of interest on the screen. From my own experimentation and some research, it appears that just adding 90 degrees and taking that new number mod 360 results in the correct heading. If there is a better way or I am incorrect, I would also love to know.</p>

							<p>I stumbled against the same issue. I found that David Riggleman&#39;s answer is almost correct, but not completely so. It depends on how exactly you hold your camera in landscape: there are two possibilities for that!<br>If the camera is held such that the left hand side of the telephone&#x2F;tablet is closer to the ground than its right hand side, then David&#39;s answer is correct. But if its RHS is closer to the ground than the LHS, then you have to subtract the 90 degrees.<br>Or, in other words,<br>if (heading.z&gt;15) {realheading = heading.x + 90;}<br>if (heading.z&lt;-15) {realheading = heading.x - 90;}<br>The 15 is an annoying criterium that seems to work.<br>Is there anyone who can tell the equations when you hold your angle at an oblique angle, between portrait and landsscape?</p>
