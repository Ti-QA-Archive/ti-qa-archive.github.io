			<h1>Titanium.jar not found by Eclipse???</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,<br>I am still trying to resolve an issue that I am having with module developement and I haven&#39;t received very much assistance with my other question so I thought I would ask a different quesiton since I noticed another problem.  I am using Titanium Studio, build: 2.1.2.201208301612 on a Windows 7 64 bit pc.  I created the Mobile Module Project by going to File &gt; New &gt; Titanium Mobile Module Project.  Then I imported the project into Eclipse and added my java code.  Lastly I RClicked the build.xml file and selected run as to build.  The first error that I noticed was that the src directory was missing a java folder (my other post).  I noticed another error before that error today that it is looking for the Titanium.jar file in an Eclipse directory.  The error states &quot;Caused by: java.io.FileNotFoundException: C:\eclipse\plugins\org.apache.ant_1.7.1.v20100518-1145\lib\titanium.jar (The system cannot find the file specified).&quot;</p>
<p>My question is how do I resolve this error do I need to install Aptana plugin for Eclipse as I came across this mentioned while Googling?  Can I just copy the titanium.jar file over to where it is missing?  Or is their an installation step that I have messed up and is causing the problem?  </p>
<p>On a side note could someone explain to me why is it so difficult to get everything installed?  I mean other software you run the installation and it works but with Java, Android and now Titanium I have had to go over there and make sure this is set and come back over here and set this as well as uninstall and reinstall.  What is the big difficulty in creating a package that installs everything that you need or is it just that I am an idiot (as is so many others who&#39;s posts I&#39;ve come across trying to just get the environment right to develop for days at a time)?  Is it the complexity of the platforms that they are being installed on and if so why doesn&#39;t other software face this same problem?  I would just like a little more insight in to this so that I can better understand what I am doing wrong and need to do to fix and prevent the problem in the future.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any insight&#x2F;assistance that is provided.</p>

							<div><p>as for your installation problems, I dont know what issues you were seeing, but we held a hackathon a few months ago and successfully installed all of the tools on 15 windows laptops with no problems by following the directions on the wiki.</p>

							<div><p>Thanks for the reply.  I have been able to get past the error by putting the titanium.jar file into the eclipse folder.  I got another error after that saying that a doc folder did not exist so I added that manually and finally got past that error as well.  I am sure I probably didn&#39;t set something right but I have not idea what and really don&#39;t want to go back through another install (at least not at the moment).  However now that I have added the module into my app in Titanium I am getting a python parsing error on the file descriptor.  Can you provide me with some assistance with this or should I start a new thread?<br>[ERROR] [2012-09-03 16:59:21,358] kill: error: [Errno 9] Bad file descriptor.</p>
<p>Oh and how do I review the build path for the project?<br>Thanks,</p>

							<div><p>I would start a new thread and include more of the build log output. Also if you have a github account it might help to put the code somewhere so one can try to run project and see you exact errors</p>

							<p>i would suggest going into the properties for the project and looking at the Java Build Path Dialog and see what the path is for the Titanium.jar</p>
