		<section>
			<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>Just as it writes in the title the forwardGeocoder method isn&#39;t working anymore no matter what valid address do I pass in as an argument. It used to work until today. I&#39;m using iOS SDK 4.3 and a iPod Touch 2nd gen with iOS 4.2.1. Both of them worked really nice until now.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>I also had the same problem so I implemented the code below:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">xhr = Titanium.Network.createHTTPClient();
                <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> query = CleanSQL(street.value) + <span class="hljs-string">' '</span> + CleanSQL(city.value) + <span class="hljs-string">' '</span> + CleanSQL(lblState.text) + <span class="hljs-string">' '</span> + CleanSQL(zip.value);
                xhr.open(<span class="hljs-string">'GET'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/geo?output=json&amp;q='</span> + query);
                xhr.onload = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>)
                </span>{
                    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> data = (<span class="hljs-built_in">JSON</span>.parse(<span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.responseText).Placemark);

                    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(data != <span class="hljs-literal">undefined</span> &amp;&amp; data != <span class="hljs-literal">null</span> &amp;&amp; <span class="hljs-built_in">JSON</span>.parse(<span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.responseText).Status.code == <span class="hljs-number">200</span>) {
                        LT.Customlat = data[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>].Point.coordinates[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>];
                        LT.Customlon = data[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>].Point.coordinates[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>];

                        <span class="hljs-comment">//.....</span>

                    } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
                        alert(<span class="hljs-string">'Unable to locate address. Please try again.'</span>)
                    }

                }
                xhr.send();

							<p>The forward Geolocating feature currently relies on using a single (Appcelerator) account that is registered with the service. It is being used by so many apps now that it is frequently consuming all its daily allowance of requests. See here http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;132687&#x2F;reversegeocoder-production-ready</p>

							<p>Not only it is failing due to their limits being reached; I noted a change in the results format that started breaking my application last week.<br>When you start looking at how geocoding is implemented and the lack of SLA available; you get to the conclusion this was a poorly implemented feature they added just to have some geocoding available. </p>
<p>There are violating terms from google and yahoo: They both required their geocoding api requests to be used in conjunction with a Map, which Appcelerator can&#39;t guarantee by exposing an abstraction (as a end user, you don&#39;t know which provider is being used, and you don&#39;t care, but that makes no one but Appcelerator accountable for the terms violation).</p>
<p>No disclosure, no SLA and breaking changes on their service (check this thread: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;133548&#x2F;reversegeocoder-is-returning-a-different-format ) = FAIL.</p>

										<p><p>I can&#39;t really tell. I only develop for Android. But in the geocoding space, the data has to come from a service provider that holds the GIS system with the geocoder, etc. Google, Yahoo, MapQuest has their own geocoders, and they expose that data through webservices. Most of these webservices has specific terms and limitations, some are limited by ip (google), others by application by requiring the developer to obtain an AppKey you have to include on the request, etc. Both google and yahoo are pretty clear on the fact that they let you use the geocoder if used in conjunction with their propietary maps only.<br>I&#39;m not sure how Apple deals with this, if they are exposing this on their API.<br>I can only see 3 serious ways to do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using an open data provider like OpenStreetMap; which is what I believe Appcelerator is doing now. I haven&#39;t checked in details but it seems that this data doesn&#39;t include city nor house number.</li>
<li>Using a licensed data provider, with a business account. This is really expensive, especially if Appcelerator is giving this feature away for free; and especially given their potential number of requests.</li>
<li>Implement their own GIS geocoder, which might include buying licenses for ESRI or any other solution out thereâ¦ which are also expensive.</li>
</ol>
