			<h3 id="version">Version</h3>
<p>I use 1.7.6 because it supports everything and doesn&#39;t have major bugs. It&#39;s much faster than 2.1 for me , and my application size is just <strong>2MB</strong> (unlike 15MB with the new version).</p>
<h3 id="window-control">Window control</h3>
<p>Appcelerator windows are bad. They don&#39;t even support <strong>DOM copying</strong>. Let&#39;s say you want a menu , and you don&#39;t want to rewrite it for every window. Not possible. </p>
<p>So i managed to make my own window system. It has a function which decides when to delete UI elements from the screen , when to remove them from RAM , when to add new UI elements. It also has events for the back button and it has activity events making it seem perfect.</p>
<h3 id="design">Design</h3>
<p>I used a custom manifest to specify the target version , which is 4.0 (ICS). So i have a great holo theme. For older versions , i made fallback ICS pngs so it looks the same.</p>
<h3 id="maps-gps">Maps+GPS</h3>
<p>I don&#39;t use the native maps because they aren&#39;t supported by tablets that don&#39;t have Google APIs in them (you can see that if you run standard emulator , not Google APIs one). That means app crashing. I used the Google Static Maps API which generates a PNG for some coordinates. That , plus a touchmove event deciding when to scroll a PNG.<br>The GPS has a fix , it makes 3 passes to make the precise location.</p>
<h3 id="dragging-ui-elements">Dragging UI elements</h3>
<p>Since in the most versions of Titanium the touchCenter variable is undefined , i made my own interpolation. It drags so smooth.</p>
<h3 id="fastest-http-image-fetch">Fastest HTTP image fetch</h3>
<p>I use custom XHR to load an image , then i use a module which creates a new thread to save the image+return it , and uses the titanium proxy to interact with my app.</p>
