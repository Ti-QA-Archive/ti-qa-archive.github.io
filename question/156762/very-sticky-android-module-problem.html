			<h1>Very Sticky Android Module Problem</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I created an android mobile project with Ti. Studio. I created a module project with Ti. Studio. I placed a &#39;module&#39; node in the mobile project&#39;s tiapp.xml file indicating the module id. I added a third party .jar file to the module file by placing it in the module&#39;s \lib file per the docs. I added a &#39;classpathentry&#39; to the module&#39;s .classpath file for the .jar file per the docs. I &#39;built&#39; the module project in Ti Studio.<br>I created a &#39;modules\android path in the mobile project&#39;s root per the Q&amp;A Appcelerator forum. I then placed the module project&#39;s folder inside that path, i.e., projectID&#x2F;modules&#x2F;android&#x2F;modulefolder. I placed a &#39;require&#39; statement at the beginning of my mobile project&#39;s app.js file. I then &#39;built&#39; the mobile project with Ti Studio and got no errors. I then ran the project by selecting &#39;RUN&#39;&gt;&#39;ANDROID DEVICE&#39; in Ti Studio. On the device after the mobile project loads, I get an error message, &quot;Requested file not found, &#39;com.example.moduleid&#39;&quot;. If anyone has any idea why this might be happening, I would appreciate a response. Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

<p>did you write the proxies for the module? Check <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Android_Module_Development_Guide">this</a>.

							<p>Ranjith. As I stated in the post, the module folder was placed in the projectid&#x2F;modules&#x2F;android folder per the documentation.<br>Mauro. I&#39;ve read this article many time and I remember that it talks about proxys AFTER the module instructions have finished and the module has been created. So, I mostly ignored the proxy section. After all, why do I need a proxy for a simply module project particularly when 90% of the module creation documentation doesn&#39;t even mention it?  However , I will read through the proxy section and see what I can learn. Thank you both.</p>

										<p><p>Whoops! This is not the article I thought it was Mauro. It doesn&#39;t mention a thing about proxys relative to modules. In fact, this is the main documentation that I&#39;ve followed time and again to create module projects, but I still get the error : Requested module not found&quot;. I think this is proven by my description of the steps I took to create my module and add my .jar file in the original post. Any additional ideas will be greatly appreciated. I am out of ideas. Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>Sorry Mauro. I overlooked the fact that you linked two articles for me to check out. I&#39;ve read both before but re-read hoping to find something that will finally solve this problem for me. I read through the proxy section and still don&#39;t understand why or how I need it. I only created a module to be able to include a third part .jar file whose methods I could then access from the main mobile project. In other words, I&#39;m doing nothing else with the module and the code (app.js) is of no consequence for me. Do you still think I need a proxy based on this information or perhaps you can enlighten me as to why I need one. Any information you can provide will be greatly appreciated as I&#39;ve been at this problem for a very long time. Thanks.</p>
