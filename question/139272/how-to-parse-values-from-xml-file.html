<p>The  Open Society Foundations work to build vibrant and tolerant democracies whose  governments are accountable to their citizens. To achieve this mission, the  Foundations seek to shape public policies that assure greater fairness in  political, legal, and economic systems and safeguard fundamental rights. On a  local level, the Open Society Foundations implement a range of initiatives to  advance justice, education, public health, and independent media. At the same  time, we build alliances across borders and continents on issues such as  corruption and freedom of information. The Foundations place a high priority on  protecting and improving the lives of people in marginalized communities.<br>Investor  and philanthropist George Soros established the Open Society Foundations,  starting in 1984, to help countries make the transition from communism.&amp;nbsp;  Our activities have grown to encompass the United   States and more than 70 countries in Europe, Asia, Africa  and Latin America.&amp;nbsp; Each Foundation  relies on the expertise of boards composed of eminent citizens who determine  individual agendas based on local priorities.<br>BACKGROUND<br>Launched in 2008, the Global Drug Policy program (GDPp) aims to shift the  paradigm of drug policies around the world from today’s punitive approach to  one rooted in public health and human rights. Broadly speaking, such reform would  reduce reliance on criminal justice systems to address problems associated with  drugs or drug use, ideally limiting criminal sanctions solely to those offenses  involving harm to others and eliminating criminal penalties for mere drug  possession; ensure that penalties for crimes associated with drugs or drug use  are proportional; provide appropriate care for those seeking treatment for drug  dependence; and take into account the livelihoods of those implicated in  illicit crop production.<br>GDPp is a  grant-making program that supports organizations worldwide in advocating for  rational, evidence-based policies at the national, regional, and international  level.<br>The  Senior Program Officer will be involved with grant-giving and reports to the  Program Director.
