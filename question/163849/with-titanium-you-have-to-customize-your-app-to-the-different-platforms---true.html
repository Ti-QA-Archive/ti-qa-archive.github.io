			<h1>&#34;With Titanium you have to customize your app to the different platforms&#34; - TRUE?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>since I&#39;m a newbie to this app development thing I&#39;ve checked before the Internet about the different app developer opinions. One opinion which pops up very often is &quot;With Titanium you have to customize your app to the different platforms&quot;. As reason for this they mention that Titanium creates NATIVE code and not web views. And the APIs on the platforms implement if differently. I hope I remember those reasons correctly. Otherwise please correct me. So when this statement is true what can I, not very comfortable with Javascript, do that I don&#39;t have to change my code for every platform? Is there a solution to make this step more comfortable for me?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for answer.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The problem here is the phrase &quot;cross-platform&quot;.</p>
<ul>
<li>Appcelerator is a native cross-platform solution that uses JavaScript to achieve this</li>
<li>Many others are cross platform but only because the apps work on different platforms but mostly do not honour native UI.  Instead (as you note) are based on web pages rather than actual native elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you create an Appcelerator Titanium app you are creating a true native cross platform solution.</p>
<p>Most of the code you are going to create will be the same, irrespective of the platform or platforms you are targeting.  This is because the actual logic of the application will be the same.  So when you create a table of rows that is the same for each platform, create a window or a button that code is the same.</p>
<p>I am going to restrict this conversation to just iOS and Android to make examples simple.</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS has a navigation controller, Android does not</li>
<li>Android has an action bar, iOS does not</li>
<li>iOS has button bars and toolbars, Android does not</li>
<li>Android supports intents, iOS does not</li>
</ul>
<p>However they both support;</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows</li>
<li>Views</li>
<li>Buttons</li>
<li>Images</li>
<li>ScrollViews</li>
<li>ScrollableViews</li>
<li>and many more</li>
</ul>
<p>The important thing to take into account is that the users of each platform expect it to work the way that platform is designed to work.  So a good developer honours that and tweaks the application to suit those differences.</p>
<p>Many of the tweaks are nothing more than a few lines of code to make each work with respect to each platform.  Some however take more effort, that effort will pay off in the long run as your app will not feel rushed or cheap.</p>
<p>If you are finding your way as a new user, then the best thing to do is not to worry about the differences in UI and some in the core platform interfaces - but instead focus on getting things to work.  Once you have got the basics sorted then you can revise your code if required to make the most of each platform.</p>
<p>If you are not as comfortable with JavaScript as you think you should be then take some time to get the basics down as knowing the more important things such as this will make your life much easier and faster;</p>
<ul>
<li>Variables</li>
<li>Functions</li>
<li>Loops</li>
<li>Strings</li>
<li>Arrays</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many site on the web to help with this.</p>
<p>Welcome to the platform and I hope you enjoy it as much as the rest of us.</p>

										<p><p>Malcolm, you speak about Javascript tutorials on the Internet. I used w3schools.com, but I think they don&#39;t go deep enough to grab everything about Javascript. Do you know it, what do you think? And would there be a better free resource you know about?</p>

										<p><p>We have all cut our teeth on w3schools, you are correct though - it shows each command but nothing about how to use those commands.</p>
<p>This is one worth checking out;</p>
