			<h1>Attach a SQLITE DB from SD Card</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi - This is a follow to a question I posted in comments of another question but probably best suited for its own question.</p>
<p>I need to access a SQLITE DB thats outside of the app directory sitting on SD Card.  I have used getDirectoryListing and getFile and a string with details to the full path to successfully get the file.  When i alert out the details i get:</p>
<p>pathToDB = [object TIFileProxy] |<br>nativePathToDB = file:&#x2F;&#x2F;mnt&#x2F;sdcard&#x2F;Android&#x2F;data&#x2F;com.myapp.testapp&#x2F;database.db</p>
<p>However, if I do an exists() check on pathToDB, it comes back false and if I try to do a db.execute(&quot;attach &#39;&quot; + pathToDB + &quot;&#39; as db2;&quot;);  or<br>db.execute(&quot;attach &#39;&quot; + nativePathToDB + &quot;&#39; as db2;&quot;);  both give me error messages saying that it cannot open the database.</p>
<p>I&#39;m testing on Android 2.2 with latest Titanium SDK and this is my first time trying to access a file from the SDCard. If anyone can help tell me whats wrong that would be a huge help!  Thanks so much in advance.</p>

							<p>I have never gotten the ATTACH command to work despite the thread quoted in your other question.</p>
<p>However, at one point when I was perusing lighthouse tickets, I saw a reference to adding support for the Ti.Database.open() command to accept a file object instead of a string, and then open that file in read-only mode.</p>
<p>That has not made it into the docs, and I have never tried it, but see what happens if you do this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> pathToDB</span> = Ti.Filesystem.getFile( ... );
<span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> db</span> = Ti.Database.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>(pathToDB);
</code></pre>

										<p><p>Hey Doug - Thanks for the quick response and thinking.  Just tried your suggestions: var db = Titanium.Database.open(pathToDB);</p>
<p>and got this error:</p>
<p>Wrapped java.lang.NullPointerException</p>
<p>Its weird.  I would think seeing pathToDB = [object TIFileProxy] would mean there is a file there.  So why would the open statement think its null?</p>
<p>Thanks again, if you have any thoughts I&#39;m willing to try anything!</p>

										<p><p>Well, the null pointer exception does not necessarily mean pathToDB is null.  It means the open() method is not properly handling that as a value.</p>
<p>This usage is not documented in the official APIs yet, and I can&#39;t find the ticket where I saw a note about adding support for it.  So I am not even sure what syntax was supposedly being added.</p>
<p>Did you also try:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> db</span> = Ti.Database.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>(pathToDB.nativePath);
</code></pre></p>

										<p><p>Oh, you might be on to something. I didnt try it because (I&#39;m a noob) and I thought it was simply a string not a reference that could be used.  But when I did I got an error.  This time</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">IllegalArgumentException <span class="hljs-keyword">File</span>: <span class="hljs-keyword">file</span>:<span class="hljs-comment">///mnt/sdcard/Android/data/com.myapp.testapp/database.db contains a path seperator</span>
</code></pre><p>But at least with the full string that i passed in, I used Ti.Filesystem.separator.  So I&#39;m not sure why I&#39;m seeing this error.</p>
<p>You&#39;re awesome for continuing to help.</p>

										<p><p>It looks to me like the nativePath idea isn&#39;t going to work.  However, in your <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;122833&#x2F;accessing-open-and-query-existing-sqlite-db-on-sdcard">other</a> question the responder pointed out the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_mobile&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;android&#x2F;modules&#x2F;database&#x2F;src&#x2F;ti&#x2F;modules&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;database&#x2F;DatabaseModule.java">source</a> of the java class Ti uses for the database open and install methods.  If we look at lines 49-60, it certainly looks like the android database.open first checks if the object passed is a TiFileProxy object.  When it is, it appears to get the absolute native path to it then try to open it in read only mode.</p>
<p>So I think my first suggestion to try open(pathToDB) was the right idea.  The fact it did not work suggests that code does not work correctly now.</p>
<p>Alas, this is not a documented feature (that I can tell) so I&#39;m not sure what to suggest from here.</p>

										<p><p>Doug - You were CORRECT! I had an issue with one lagging separator left over that I just missed.  I&#39;m sorry if it made you doubt your suggestion.  I cleared everything out, double-checked and it works.  I&#39;ve successfully opened and queried the DB from the SD Card.  Thank you so much for your help.</p>

										<p><p>Glad it worked for you.  But remember too that SD card access will be slower than internal memory.  Also, due to the technology used, SD cards have a more limited usage lifespan.  I think the bigger (only?) problem is writes, so maybe repeatedly reading the file is not a problem other than performance.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the advice, I really appreciate it.  I&#39;ll be sure to consider performance and maybe do some a&#x2F;b testing.  For now, i only need Read only, which is great, but I&#39;m sure write access will be needed at some point.  Really appreciate your help and thx again.</p>

							<p>Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve been using successfully for SQLite ATTACH:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// Attach another DB to this one, with an alias.</span>
Database.prototype.attach = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(dbpath, dbalias)</span>
</span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> dbfile = Ti.Filesystem.getFile(<span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.getDBDir(), dbpath).nativePath;
    <span class="hljs-comment">// strip off 'file://' if present</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (dbfile.indexOf(<span class="hljs-string">'file://'</span>) == <span class="hljs-number">0</span>)
    {
        dbfile = dbfile.substr(<span class="hljs-number">7</span>);
    }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (!IS_ANDROID)
    {
        <span class="hljs-comment">// iPhone installed DBs always have .sql suffix, and ATTACH isn't aware of this.</span>
        dbfile += <span class="hljs-string">'.sql'</span>;
    }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.handle.execute(<span class="hljs-string">"ATTACH DATABASE \""</span> + dbfile + <span class="hljs-string">"\" AS "</span> + dbalias + <span class="hljs-string">";"</span>);
};
</code></pre><p>This is part of a wider Database class.  The missing, but referenced, members of the Database class are:</p>
<ul>
<li>getDBDir() : just gets the current DB &#39;install&#39; directory, as a string pathname.  You could just use your SD card directory in its place.</li>
<li>handle : just a standard Ti DB handle, for the database to which we want to attach the new DB.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

										<p><p>As far as I can tell, I&#39;m able to attach another database, but when I try to do <code>database2.tableName</code> it gives me an error:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-literal">no</span> such <span class="hljs-attribute">column</span>: database2.tableName
