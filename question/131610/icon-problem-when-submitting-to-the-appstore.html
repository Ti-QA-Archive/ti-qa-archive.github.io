			<h1>Icon Problem when submitting to the Appstore</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,<br>since this morning when I try to validate my archive, it says that appicon.png must be 57x57 and it is 0x0.<br>Something strange I have all icons in all size in my ressource&#x2F;iphone folder. But not all seems to be copied in the ressource build folder.<br>Copying the files manually doesn&#39;t seems to solve the problem.<br>How to solve this</p>

							<p>Please see here. The issue is with the 10.7.3 OS X update. This blog has a workaround for the issue: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.manbolo.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;02&#x2F;02&#x2F;macosx-10.7.3-update-breaks-ios-app-validation</p>
