			<h1>Geolocation</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I just updated to the latest SDK.  I am trying to get geolocation to work.  I did the geofix, but it didn&#39;t do anything.</p>
<p>The GPS icon does not show on the phone emulator.  Maps does not even work.</p>
<p>GPS is checked under the phone settings in the emulator.</p>
<p>Is there anything else that I need to do, or this a Titanium bug?</p>
<p>I found a blog post saying I may need to edit my Manifest, but the Manifest in Titanium does not look the same.</p>
<p>I hope someone can help.  Thank you.</p>

							<div><p>I deployed the kitchen sink to my phone and geolocation does not work there. Geolocation on my phone works for Maps.  Everything else in the Kitchen Sink works so I do not think there was an install issue.  In my mind this kind of proves Titanium geolocation is broken.</p>

							<p>So finally after realizing it was a bug I updated to Titanium 1.7RC1.  So now geolocation finally works when testing Kitchen Sink on my phone.  So this was definitely a bug in the previous version.</p>
<p>It still does not work on the emulator even though I telnet in and geo fix.  It would really be cool if that worked, but at least I can move forward now.</p>

							<p>Update:</p>
<p>I located the remaining bug.  I am not sure if it is Google or Titanium. There was some extra text in the AVD field for GPS.</p>
<p>Here is the fix:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to &quot;SDK Manager &gt; Virtual devices&quot;</li>
<li>Find the AVD you want to use and click &quot;Edit&quot;</li>
<li>Make sure the field for Use GPS = yes</li>
</ol>
<p>On my AVD it had some additional info about the camera. Once I cleaned up the fields the &quot;geo fix&quot; telnet started to work.</p>
