			<h1>Http Connection problem</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Today my app was accepted in App Store:D. But for the first time I had an big problem. My application does not receive any data from http connection. I&#39;ve tested my app again on my device and simulator, and everything is perfect. Then I return to the app installed from App Store, and again no change.. It just won&#39;t download any data.<br>Do you have any advice? Or someone had the same issue like mine?<br>I&#39;ve tested on iOS 5.1, iOS 4.2. The SDK is 1.8.1.<br>Thank a lot!</p>

							<p>Have you checked your connection? 3G or Wifi?<br>Does it work in the simulator?<br>have you asked someone else to test it?</p>
<p>Please provide more info - like maybe the name of the app so someone else ca get it and test it.</p>
<p>Also you could maybe provide us with some code for your HTTP Client so we can see if you have made a mistake.</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve tested on 3G and WiFi, from iPhone 3G, iPhone 4.<br>The app name is  Transport Urban. If you can test it would be great!<br>I&#39;ll put some here but this is a strange thing, because from simulator is working, from testing devices again works great, only from AppStore I have this problems.<br>Thank a lot!</p>

							<p>Just a long shot but one thing that I got bitten by recently was a function call failing only on a release build but not in a dev&#x2F;adhoc simulator.  The path names to included or required modules is CASE SENSITIVE ONLY on a release build.  Check that your file names are exactly the same case as your include&#x2F;require statements.</p>

										<p><p>Seriously?  That is completely messed up.  How in the world do you test for that?  We use dozens of require statements throughout our codebase…  I can&#39;t imagine a good explanation for why this situation exists.</p>

							<p>I can confirm that &quot;loading stations&quot; is failing to complete.</p>
<p>To help you debug : If you plug your device in to your machine and launch XCode, then open the Window&gt;Organizer, you should then be able to select the &#39;Console&#39; for your device while it is plugged in.  You will then be able to see what is going on.</p>
<p>I just did this after installing your app from the AppStore. </p>
<p>From what I can see there are repeated errors occurring due to an &quot;AdSheet&quot; </p>
<p>It highly likely that when you tested the app that these do not get enabled in development, but do different things when the app is &quot;released&quot;.</p>
<p>Check your ad banner setup. That it probably what is causing it to hang, since they both use the network connection in some way. </p>
<p>PS: I can also see a lot of warnings about deprecated animation settings you have used to slide the top bar up and down.</p>
<p>Hope this helps. My money is on the ad banner solution you are using which is breaking it.</p>

							<p>Thank you all for your prompt response! I will try to see what is happening with that adsheet.;)<br>@George Georgiou: Iti multumim pentru apreciere!</p>
<p>What is funny about this thing is that they(Apple) didn&#39;t say a thing. And they accepted the app after testing about 2 hours. Anyway, I will try and test it again, and again..:))</p>

<p>When I was born, Dan Petrescu, was a star in the making, and my parents liked the sound of the name they decided to call me Dan. And this is the only relationship with him:D</p>

							<p>As I promised, now that my app is in Store, i can tell you what went wrong.<br>The problem wasn&#39;t at the http connection, it was when I create the annotations.<br>All the details are in JSON format. So the latitude and longitude were parsed as string instead of float. Big bug!!<br>Second I&#39;m using the rightButton property like this: <code>rightButton : Titanium.UI.iPhone.SystemButton.DISCLOSURE,</code>. Here the app crash. So I put at the begining of the <em>app.js</em> this code : </p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> img_test</span> = Ti.UI.createButton({
    style : Titanium.UI.iPhone.SystemButton.DISCLOSURE
})
</code></pre><p> and the everything goes well…</p>
<p>If you could update the app an test it and give a positive review, it would be great!<br>Thanks a lot!</p>
<p>P.S.: I also wait any suggestion from you.</p>
