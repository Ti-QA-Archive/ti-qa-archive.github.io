		<section>
			<p>I have a database of about 17,000 records, and need to find the closest points to my location, so I thought of java script, which would be slow to check all records.</p>
<p>Any way to setup a SQL statement to do this?</p>

							<p>Assuming all of your records have coordinates in lat&#x2F;lng form, you could try a WHERE clause where you first limit your search to coordinates within a bounding box (+&#x2F;- a delta value from the user&#39;s position). If that applies, you could add a distance argument to your SELECT statement and use the squaring portion of Pythagorean&#39;s theorem to find <em>relative</em> distances, then order by that (since SQLite can&#39;t do square roots). </p>
<p>In other words, your clause might look like:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> *, ((( lat - myLat) * (lat - myLat)) + (( lng - myLng) * (lng - myLng))) <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> distance
<span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> locations
<span class="hljs-keyword">WHERE</span> lat &gt; (myLat - .<span class="hljs-number">1</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">AND</span> lat &lt; (myLat + .<span class="hljs-number">1</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">AND</span> lng &gt; (myLng -.<span class="hljs-number">1</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">AND</span> lng &lt; (myLng + .<span class="hljs-number">1</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">ORDER</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">BY</span> distance
</code></pre><p>If you need to display true distances you&#39;ll probably want to take these results and then write Javascript to put the lat&#x2F;lng values into a <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.movable-type.co.uk&#x2F;scripts&#x2F;latlong.html">Haversine formula</a>. </p>
<p>And like others have said, 17k+ records may still take a long time, but if you absolutely need to do it within the app this should manage.</p>

										<p><p>Did you adjust all of the variables to include your specific column and table names? Note that the columns lat, lng should reflect your latitude and longitude columns in the database, myLat and myLng are variables that are associated with the user&#39;s GPS location, and locations is the database table in question.</p>

							<p>If you need to search through more than 17K records, I&#39;m afraid no SQL statement can help you out. </p>
<p>Another approach would be to <strong>pre-calculate</strong> all the distances between each locations and simply retrieve this value when doing your research. But that would imply you store <strong>17 power 17th</strong> records in a single table. So the performance hit would be quite considerable for a mobile device.</p>
<p>For such a large volume of data, I&#39;m afraid the best course of action would be to rely on a server component that does that calculation for you. </p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

										<p><p>I know there is a way, just need to find out how. SQL is designed for large data volumes, so can be done.</p>
<p>Found one way to add sql distance, but might only apply to iPhones.</p>

										<p><p>SQL can manage large volumes, but you seem to forget that you are running that same SQL engine <strong>on a mobile device</strong>.</p>

										<p><p>Well I will give it a shot, and see. Never know.</p>
<p>PS: Why has appcelerator ignored requests to have custom functions for sqllite ability in Titanium, they love to do that for some reason.</p>

										<p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>With the Custom Functions: if you want to have special access to sqlite, just create a module that does exactly what you need.</p>
<p>SQL Query: There are different ways to get geospatial distance calculated across SQL (depending on the vendor, version and such of the SQL engine being used). There are some commercial options <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;4708704&#x2F;web-service-to-find-nearby-points-of-interest">here</a>, but in general the best way to accomplish this would be using a webservice, since some heavylifting is needed. </p>
<p>Best,</p>

										<p><p>As @Christian stated, 17k records is a lot to search through with one query.  Why not write a custom method for querying the data in batches?  Like every 5k, see if the speed improves, if not, try 1k at a time, etc.</p>

										<p><p>â¦also, have you looked into MongoDB?  One of its specialties is dealing with Geospacial data.</p>

										<p><p>For all those doubters out there I have it filtering 17k records really quite fast. So can work, too bad no support for sine, and cos on sqlite side. Come titanium make it easy for us, not harder.</p>
