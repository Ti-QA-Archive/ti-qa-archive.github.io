			<h1>Neither android emulator or android device run works</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I can&#39;t believe I have spent two weeks trying to get a sample app, kitchensink, to run either on the emulator or the device. I&#39;m beginning to think I&#39;m wasting my time. I cannot continue to ask for answers here.I&#39;ve got to be able to answer most of this stuff on my own.  Proper documentation should provided. However, one more time I will ask for assistance from you kind folks on why I&#39;m having my current problems.<br>Win 7, android 2.2, Java sdk 1.6, Google apis 2.1. When I run to android emulator, the emulator screen is displayed with the keyboard on one side and date&#x2F;time, speaker and lock icons on the other and I suppose I&#39;m seeing a running trace of the emulator via the Titanium Android Process screen. But it never shows kitchensink display.<br>When I&#39;ve run to android device in the recent past, it displays red screen with &#39;A&#39; in a triangle, then a list of labels and text boxes where the text boxes are filled with an error message. Plus, one time the myfirstapp app caused a continuous stream of small font text to be displayed on my phone, right justified, always changing. That state still exists on my phone! Now I want to try the android device again since a path or two has been corrected, but when I select RUN, the &#39;Android Device&#39; selection is no longer present in the popup window!!! Help please or please refer me to some solid documentation that includes potential error meanings. As always, thank you in advance. I appreciate it.</p>

							<p>I have installed kitchen sink on an s3, and all I did was get the kitensink project, and told it to install on the s3, using the default settings for building an andriod version. Seems to work fine.</p>
<p>Why not just build a simple app using the built in templates. This may prove to be easier than using someones elses code to start with.</p>
