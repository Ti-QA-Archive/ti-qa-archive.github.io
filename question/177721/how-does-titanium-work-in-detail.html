			<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>i would like to read an appcelerator certified aritcle about this whole build and compile process. Like, what is really compiled to which file and what does the js runtime really runs? I´ve found a bunch of articles on stackoverflow but was wondering if there´s sth in the appcelerator docs or homepage?</p>
<p>Would love to read about it!</p>
<p>Best regards</p>

							<p>Dino,</p>
<p>This is dated, but the approach and architecture described in this video has not changed. You can take a look at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;video&#x2F;28822084">this</a>…</p>
<p>The first 8 mins or so goes through the architecture and an overview. As I said, it is a couple of years old, but the architecture and approach haven&#39;t changed, but some of the information is outdated (for example, at that point, blackberry support was in Beta, has since been released. The presentation is using the 2.1 SDK, now we&#39;re on 3.3…MANY CHANGES). However, if you are interested in the &#39;build and compile process&#39; it does a pretty good high level overview.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Ray! </p>
<p>Indeed i have a question :) </p>
<p>For example.. (lets stay in the iOS area to not mention everything twice ;)) </p>
<p>When i declare a button (or any other ui component) in the .xml file Titanium compiles the component to a .js file which is afterwards mapped to a precompiled .c file? So at runtime, when i declare a new Button instance in a controller, from what is that object created? From the core library staged on the device or from the compiled resource? </p>
<p>Or maybe im totally confused ;)</p>
<p>Thanks anyway!</p>

										<p><p>Dino,</p>
<p>I&#39;ll try to answer what I <em>think</em> your question is. The object that is created is from the device, not the compiled resource. For example, last year when iOS7 was released, there were many changes, including the removal of the &#39;rounded rectangle button&#39; that we saw all the way up to iOS6. iOS7 buttons don’t include a bezel or a background appearance. The thing is Titanium just asks the OS on the phone to create a button… If you are running your app on iOS6, you see the bezel (outline) on iOS7, no outline. So, the object is NOT compiled into your code, just the call to the button and the core library on the device returns the correct native object. </p>
<p>Does that answer your question?</p>

										<p><p>Yea that clear things up. </p>
<p>So my function call from the .js file is directed to the compiled .c, which mapps it to an os call?</p>

										<p><p>Not exactly. I had forgotten about an article that had been written a while ago that describes how Titanium works. Here is the snippet. Full article is <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2012&#x2F;05&#x2F;comparing-titanium-and-phonegap&#x2F;">here</a></p>
<p><strong>How Titanium Works</strong><br>There’s quite a bit happening behind the scenes in a Titanium application. But basically, at runtime, your application consists of three major components – your JavaScript source code (inlined into a Java or Objective-C file and compiled as an encoded string), the platform-specific implementation of the Titanium API in the native programming language, and a JavaScript interpreter that will be used to evaluate your code at runtime (V8 for Android, or JavaScriptCore for iOS).</p>
<p>When your application is launched, a JavaScript execution environment is created in native code, and your application source code is evaluated. Injected into the JavaScript runtime environment of your application is what we call “proxy” objects – basically, a JavaScript object which has a paired object in native code. Colloquially we will often refer to “JavaScript land” and “native land” in a Titanium application, as they are kind of parallel universes to one another. The proxy object exists both in JavaScript land and native land, and serves as the “bridge” between the two.</p>
<p>In your JavaScript code, when you call a function on the global Titanium or Ti object, such as var b = Ti.UI.createButton({title:&#39;Poke Me&#39;});, that will invoke a native method that will create a native UI object, and create a “proxy” object (b) which exposes properties and methods on the underlying native UI object to JavaScript.</p>
<p>UI components (view proxies) can be arranged hierarchically to create complex user interfaces. Proxy objects which represent an interface to non-visual APIs (like filesystem I&#x2F;O or database access) execute in native code, and synchronously (or asynchronously for APIs like network access) return a result to JavaScript.</p>
<p>Hopefully this helps directly address two common misconceptions about Titanium – at no point does Titanium require the use of a web view component. The developer can create a web view as a native UI widget, but the web view is not used to evaluate Titanium source code. Nor is JavaScript code cross-compiled to Objective-C or Java in Titanium. Your JavaScript source is evaluated at runtime.</p>
<p>Hope this clarifies it.</p>

										<p><p>Ray I´m sry that i have to unlock the question again..</p>
<p>Since Titanium supports building nativ Blackberry Applications, are they compiled the same way as an Android Application but hooking in the blackberry´s sdk build?</p>
