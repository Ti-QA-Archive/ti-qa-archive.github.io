							<p>I have used ACS extensively over the last two years… Works great as with Titanium, love it, love it, love it! However, I have experienced frustration because of a couple of drawbacks:<br>1) I find is that if you need to provide any kind of web-based front end, it can be pain. For example, I have had a couple of projects where I wanted clients to be able to manage their own data in ACS and created a web based portal for them to do that. It&#39;s a little painful.<br>2) Reporting and data access. It would be nice to be able to access the data in ACS from some of the reporting tools that exist out there but are designed mostly for a SQL database. Again, just adds extra steps to extract&#x2F;manipulate data.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for that Ray. My project will require a web front end to mirror the app features. It&#39;s a social project so would need to mirror chat and messaging like twitter &#x2F; Facebook etc etc. Can you elaborate on the issues you had please?!..</p>
