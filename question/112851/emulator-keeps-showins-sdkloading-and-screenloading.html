			<h1>Emulator keeps showins SDK=loading... and Screen=loading...</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have installed titanium and all other requirements per the installation guide. When I go to create a new project, I get no options under my &quot;Run Emulator&quot; screen. If I download the KitchenSink example and import it in, I am getting SDK=loading… and Screen=loading…</p>
<p>Does anyone know what I am doing wrong? I am on Windows 7.</p>

							<p>If you have only one Android SDK installed, try to install another SDK with a different version. That could  be a solution for the SDK loading message error. </p>

<p>Would you provide the following information, please?</p>
<p>Follow the instructions at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.appcelerator.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;installing_on_windows.html#install_diagnostics_for_windows">Install Diagnostics for Windows</a>. Copy the output and paste it to your preferred <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;">pastebin</a> service. It&#39;s important that you do not modify it <strong>in any way</strong>, as this could mask problems with your configuration. Do <strong>NOT</strong> paste it here! This is because the system will change the formatting.</p>
<p>Also, please create and share a screenshot of your android installed packages.</p>
<p>Lastly, state your OS, and the processor and RAM installed to your system.</p>
<p>Then I will help you further.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Zelda</p>
<p>It may appear like you have exactly the same issue, but everyone&#39;s system is different. Please would you post the following to a new question?</p>
<ul>
<li>your symptoms</li>
<li>the URL of the pastebin where your diagnostics output is</li>
<li>a screenshot of your android packages</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I will help you.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>Hi Rehman</p>
<p>Please don&#39;t answery your own questions; use the comment facility instead. :)</p>
<p>About your issue, don&#39;t worry about the python or scons &quot;not found&quot; errors - these are only required if you wish to compile Titanium.</p>
<p>Your system configuration looks pretty good, but there are a couple of things you need to correct:</p>
<p>You have a duplicate of <code>C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Windows Live</code> in your <code>PATH</code>. It should <strong>not</strong> be before the Windows system paths, so remove the <strong>first one</strong> of these.</p>
<p>You need to add the following to your system <code>PATH</code>, immediately after your path to JDK.</p>
<ul>
<li>C:\path\to\android_sdk\tools</li>
<li>C:\path\to\android_sdk\platform-tools</li>
</ul>
<p>You have not configured your <code>android_sdk</code> environment variable, which should be set to the location of your android sdk (the directory that <strong>contains</strong> the <code>tools</code> directory).</p>
<p>You have not configured your <code>JAVA_HOME</code> environment variable. On your system, it should be set to <code>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_24\</code></p>
<p>Have you performed the workaround for the missing adb, as per the end of the section named, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.appcelerator.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;getting_started.html#preparing_for_android_development">Preparing for Android development</a>? You must do this.</p>
<p>Again, please provide a screenshot of your android installed packages.</p>
<p>Once you have taken this advice, create another pastebin of your diagnostics output, and I will advise further.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Paul. I will correct what you pointed out but I was able to run the emulator after adding the correct path for %android_sdk%, and also adding python to the correct path.</p>
<p>Sure Zelda, feel free to message me on facebook and I can help you setup as well. Although, Paul here is much more helpful and knowledgeable then me :).</p>

							<p>Thank you Paul! I just posted my log into pastebin, here is a link, http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;fUpxyrcP. The problems that I see is with the following</p>
<p>C:\&gt;python -V<br>&#39;python&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.</p>
<p>Other then that, I found an error with my android_sdk path so corrected it and will restart my machine to take effect.</p>
<p>If there is anything else that could be problematic, please point it out. Thanks,</p>
