			<h1>If Apple&#39;s Appstore review process does not work for you - use cloudebug&#39;s DYNAPP </h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>If it is not acceptable for you to wait days (sometimes - weeks!) until your app&#39;s update is being reviewed by the Apple&#39;s Appstore - cloudebug&#39;s DYNAPP is for you (www.cloudebug.com).</p>
<p>With DYNAPP you can create <strong>native Titanium apps</strong> which, just like web pages, can be updated at any time (even if they are already published and available in the Appstore), and still are true <strong>native Titanium apps which can use full Titanium SDK!</strong></p>
<p>See more details in this post:</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s great what you have done achieved. However, bearing in mind this is the 4th &quot;question&quot; you have posted advertising your service, it&#39;s starting to appear quite spammy. I hope you will agree, there is no need to keep duplicating the same information.</p>

							<div><p>the reason for the 2nd post was a very simple one: to help people to find this post based on the search they&#39;re using.</p>
<p>i did not realize that this can be considered spam, because the subject is very relevant.</p>
<p>but, based on your comment - i will not post more that 1 post on a given subject anymore.</p>
<p>apologies to those who is offended - no pun intended…</p>
