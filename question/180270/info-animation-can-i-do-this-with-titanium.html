			<p>Hi, I like some of the animations in this app: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.peekcalendar.com&#x2F; (see video, eg around sec. 00:06). Is there any possibility to do this with Titanium? Could you eventually tell me how? Any code example?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>You can but it takes effort and planning.  The code below id a VERY simple example of how you can have two bars that can be reveal and concealed.</p>
<p>There is no reason why this could not be created using the Alloy framework, </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var duration = 500<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
function reveal() {
    var angle = 0<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    var matrixTop =  Ti.UI.iOS.create3DMatrix()<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    matrixTop.m34 = 1.0 / -1000<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    matrixTop = matrixTop.rotate(angle,1,0,0)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    var matrixBottom =  Ti.UI.iOS.create3DMatrix()<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    matrixBottom.m34 = 1.0 / -1000<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    matrixBottom = matrixBottom.rotate(angle,1,0,0)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

    var animTop = Ti.UI.createAnimation()<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    animTop.transform = matrixTop<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    animTop.duration = duration<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    var animBottom = Ti.UI.createAnimation()<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    animBottom.top = 50 + barHeight<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    animBottom.transform = matrixBottom<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    animBottom.duration = duration<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

    imgTop.animate(animTop)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    imgBottom.animate(animBottom)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
}
function conceal() {
    var angle = -90<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    var matrixTop =  Ti.UI.iOS.create3DMatrix()<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    matrixTop.m34 = 1.0 / -1000<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    matrixTop = matrixTop.rotate(angle,1,0,0)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    var matrixBottom =  Ti.UI.iOS.create3DMatrix()<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    matrixBottom.m34 = 1.0 / -1000<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    matrixBottom = matrixBottom.rotate(Math.abs(angle),1,0,0)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

    var animTop = Ti.UI.createAnimation()<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    animTop.transform = matrixTop<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    animTop.duration = duration<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    var animBottom = Ti.UI.createAnimation()<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    animBottom.top = 50 + -barHeight<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    animBottom.transform = matrixBottom<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    animBottom.duration = duration<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

    imgTop.animate(animTop)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    imgBottom.animate(animBottom)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
}

var barHeight = 100<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
    backgroundColor: '#fff'
})<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
var imgTop = Ti.UI.createImageView({
    anchorPoint: { x: 0.5, y: 0 },
    height: barHeight,
    hires: true,
    image: "http://placehold.it/500x" + (barHeight * 2) + "/00c600/ffffff&amp;text=Top",
    left: 35,
    top: 50,
    width: 250
})<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
var imgBottom = Ti.UI.createImageView({
    anchorPoint: { x: 0.5, y: 1 },
    height: barHeight,
    hires: true,
    image: "http://placehold.it/500x" + (barHeight * 2) + "/c60000/ffffff&amp;text=Bottom",
    left: 35,
    top: 50 + barHeight,
    width: 250
})<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
var btnReveal = Ti.UI.createButton({
    bottom: 20,
    left: 20,
    title: 'Reveal'
})<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
var btnConceal = Ti.UI.createButton({
    bottom: 20,
    right: 20,
    title: 'Reveal'
})<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

btnReveal.addEventListener('click', reveal)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
btnConceal.addEventListener('click', conceal)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

win.add(imgTop)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
win.add(imgBottom)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

win.add(btnReveal)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
win.add(btnConceal)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

win.open()<span class="hljs-comment">;ddEventListener('click', reveal);</span>
btnConceal.addEventListener('click', conceal)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

win.add(imgTop)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
win.add(imgBottom)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

win.add(btnReveal)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
win.add(btnConceal)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

win.open()<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>It is up to you do take this further.  You will need to take into account of the items above and below these bars when animating as you will need to nudge up and down elements that follow.  It is likely you would create a ScrollView as the parent and these &#39;sections&#39; would be added as child Views with the expand bars inside that.</p>
<p>But as I say - this is for you to work out.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this will ONLY work on iOS as Android currently has no support for 3D transformations.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Malcolm, first of all THANKS for the code: I&#39;ll test it tomorrow and eventually &quot;take it further&quot;.   :-)   One more question: I red some interesting things about Hyperloop. When Hyperloop will be released, could Titanium use 3rd party iOS animation frameworks (the way XCode does)? By the way, I discovered a product that resambles Hyperloop concept in some way</p>

										<p><p>Read the comment (rather long) I gave here that does its best to clearly explain the whose and the where&#39;s of hyperloop that are relevant here;</p>

<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2013&#x2F;10&#x2F;introducing-hyperloop&#x2F;">Introducing Hyperloop</a></li>

</ul>
<p>The aim of hyperloop (or HAL as the current naming scheme) is to allow you to move beyond those elements exposed in the Ti API and should choose to explore those very native parts.  Whereas the Ti API means to provide a common ground with some obvious platform specific differences - HAL will let you use all of those available on a platform by platform basis - if you choose.  Keep in mind these means you will be creating apps that in some section explore what is very unique to each platform.  So you will need to decide how far you go and do you reach so far for each platform.</p>
<p>Good times coming.</p>

										<p><p>I would be interested to see how they eventually do this huge leap from a web app based platform with a wrapper, to the same thing with actual native controls and deeper API access.  Their roadmap is a long way off though.  Appcelerator has had public betas of their solution for over a year now.  Even having time to work through the issues caused by the direction swap of Apples core bridge library.</p>
<p>The warning about having to build out future platform APIs that exceed the Titanium APIs was just to confirm you (and anyone else ready this) does not think anything will be magically extended all other platforms at the same time.</p>
<p>I clearly like this platform and the future looks to be rewarding me for that.</p>

										<p><p>I like Titanium (I don&#39;t care about Alloy too much, but it&#39;s a matter of taste  :-)  ). I agree with your comment about that platform and I would be interested in another thing too: how they eventually deal with the Apple hardware (&quot;Mac machine is not required&quot;)</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t already, browse the stuff on their github repo.</p>

<p>It all feels like a tool to push more purchases of their inflated UI libraries.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Stephen, I&#39;m NOT related to Telerik, I discovered them two days ago!   :-)   Anyway, I&#39;m currently not interested in cross-platform apps: I use Titanium simply because I can reuse my skills, avoid Objective-C and care very little about what Apple anytime changes in XCode or the way you develop apps (storyboards, etc.). So, what I&#39;m looking for is fundamentally this: &quot;Additionally, our near-term plan is to use HAL to create a new module SDK that will allow devs to extend Titanium in JavaScript (for iOS, Android and Windows) with full access to native APIs. This will also make it easier for you to start using Hyperloop capabilities in Ti.current sooner rather than later.&quot; (Appcelerator&#39;s blog 19th december, 2014). I did not browse the github repo, I simply red what they wrote at their nativescript website (this is the image where I found it: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;d585tldpucybw.cloudfront.net&#x2F;sfimages&#x2F;default-source&#x2F;productsimages&#x2F;NativeScript&#x2F;vibe&#x2F;devices.png?sfvrsn=2)</p>

										<p><p>I step away for a few moments - and come back to this.</p>
<p>As far as I understand it the CURRENT Telerik solution can compile iOS apps on Windows as the app created by the developer is simply code that runs inside a shell app that someone else created.  Either that or the submission process handles that part on the devs behalf.</p>
<p>With what I have read recently (and more today) this option goes away with the new solution as this option is removed due to the requirements going forward.</p>
<p>Either way; I am happy with I am, and more importantly where things are going with Appcelerator.</p>
<p>Also when you come to review the code I provided; the question can be marked as answered - that part hopefully will show you exactly what you need to start off your own animation needs.</p>
