			<p>i tried to update a custom tableviewrow by adding touchstart&#x2F;end events, however this doesn&#39;t seem to work</p>
<p>how do you change the color of label elements inside a custom tableviewrow if the row is selected? also there is a bug where in a grouped tableview the rounded corners are lost when selecting the first&#x2F;last row of the table</p>

							<p>Try setting the <code>highlightedColor</code> property on each label.</p>
<p>The rounded corners bug is a known issue - hopefully it will be fixed soon.</p>

							<p>thanx, missed that property.</p>
<p>yes it&#39;s a bug, but it should have been fixed long ago, at least before releasing a 1.0 to the public … i&#39;m working on my first project for a customer at the moment, and already found 3 display bugs, that are critical. let&#39;s say you get a design from your customer, how should i tell him, that rounded corner tables aren&#39;t possible, because of a bug that&#39;s not yet fixed by the framework&#39;s developer, that i praised to my customer as cheaper and less time consuming when it comes to developing his iPhone app?</p>
<p>i would pay 200 bucks for professional support if they fix those bugs, do you have experiences with the paid option. is it worth for getting bugs fixed quickly?</p>
<p>i also have an image on the row, that should get the opposite color value when the row is highlighted, how would you solve this? is changing the rows objects properties possible by  using a touch event at a tableviewrow? i tried getting the elements by using e.source, but it didn&#39;t work</p>

							<p>If your project is for a commercial client, you should probably take the time to code your own solution into the Titanium source.  Even with some custom tweaks, Titanium still allows for significantly faster development than coding the whole app in objective C, and it&#39;s still free.</p>
<p>The need to implement some custom tweaks doesn&#39;t change the fact that your client is still getting the best deal available (subject to your personal rates and experience).</p>
<p>I agree that the bug should have been fixed long ago, but if that had occurred, no doubt we would presently be complaining about some other bug that went unfixed because they were fixing rounded corners. :)</p>
<p>My experience with Titanium Professional is limited to the trial period offered before the public release.  Whilst my particular experience was somewhat disappointing, I think most serious developers have been quite satisfied.</p>
<p>There is one thing that can be said with certainty - the Titanium crew are prioritising paid support requests over the questions posed in this forum.</p>
<p>Regarding images in rows, except for chevrons and accessory views, images are not usually changed upon highlight.  If you want to implement this kind of change yourself, you can use <code>e.row.children[i]</code> to access the <code>i</code>th object added to the row (starting from 0).</p>
<p>By the way, if you do take the time to fix the rounded corners bug, please share it with the rest of the community!</p>

							<p>thanx, didn&#39;t know about the children object. so touchstart&#x2F;touchend should work too?</p>
<p>i will buy the professional account in the not too distant future as i have some projects in the pipeline, however i&#39;d like to know, if monthly payment means, that i can quit it let&#39;s say after one month, and rejoin two months later</p>
<p>also i think there should be a ability to add this kind of information you both gave me in this thread directly to the api-documentation, as searching in the forum is not very userfriendly</p>
