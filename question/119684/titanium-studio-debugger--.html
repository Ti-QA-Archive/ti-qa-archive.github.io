			<h1>Titanium Studio Debugger - </h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I have just recently downloaded and installed Titanium Studio on Mac OS 10.6.  The first thing I did was &quot;Help&quot; - &quot;Install Titanium SDK from URL&quot; and gave it &quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;RC&#x2F;mobilesdk-1.7.0-osx.zip&quot;.</p>
<p>I created a new project (iPhone) and did not change any of the code.  When I run my test project, it runs properly, but I cannot launch the debugger. When looking at the &quot;Progress&quot; tab at the bottom, I see a message stating &quot;Waiting for debugger to connect&quot;.  The iPhone simulator opens and the default splash page is displayed.  I guess it eventually gives up and the simulator closes.</p>
<p>Here is what I get in the Console when that happens: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;1902323</p>
<p>Any ideas where I should look next?  Am I missing a step?  Thanks for your help!</p>
<p>-Mike</p>

							<div><p>OK, I may have gotten a hint here.  I installed the new RC of Ti Studio, and now I get this message in the console: &quot;[DEBUG] Connecting to debugger: 172.16.193.1:52237&quot;.</p>
<p>That IP is for a VMWare virtual machine running on my computer.  It&#39;s the last IP listed in an &#39;ifconfig&#39;.  The debugger process is certainly not running on that IP.  Is it possible to specify the host&#x2F;port for the debugger?</p>

							<p>I was having the same issue this week.  Found out if you close the project, open it back up, and clear the build folder - it works.  Note that if you just clear your build folder it wont work.  If you just close and open the project it won&#39;t work.  Have to do all the above.</p>

							<p>Wait, am I to understand that the &quot;solution&quot; to this issue is to re-install everything? I did that once and it worked, BUT I accidentally clicked the &quot;debug&quot; button and now it&#39;s happening again =(</p>
<p>I was hoping to not have to re-install again. 2 weeks into this and no solution? What if I click &quot;debug&quot; again while moving too quickly (it&#39;s a habit from PHP dev using Aptana 2)</p>

<p>Ok, so it looks like all I had to do was move everything in &quot;Resources&quot; out, create a new project, then drag it all back in.</p>
<p>I have also customized my toolbar in studio to not show the debug button, so now I should be good (made this this long w&#x2F;out debugging so it&#39;s not a big deal).</p>

							<p>Guys, please be aware of the following tickets:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TISTUD-378">Install Titanium SDK from URL downloads but does not install SDK</a></li>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TISTUD-381">Incorrect permissions for Titanium SDK files after &quot;Install Titanium SDK from URL&quot;</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So, for me, the resolution was:</p>
<ul>
<li>delete the existing Titanium 1.7 SDK from the filesystem and then &quot;Install Titanium SDK from URL&quot;</li>
<li>set execute permissions on all .py files inside the SDK directory installed in the previous step</li>
<li>close emulator</li>
<li>restart TiStudio</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;d be interested if this works for you.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>It&#39;s best to open your own question rather than add to an existing one.</p>
<p>Have you followed the recommendations in my previous posts?</p>
<p>Have you used the &quot;Check for Updates&quot; function of TiStudio to ensure you have the latest version?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Please could you tell me which update sites you have enabled (Stable, Beta and&#x2F;or Nightly)?</p>
<p>Would you also please send your Premium Customer email address to community [at] appcelerator.com and mark it for my attention, in order for me to confirm that your account is enabled to use the debugging feature when using the Beta and Nightly updates (I am sure it is, but I would just like to check). Note that Stable updates are not affected by this change.</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

<p>I am still looking into this. Would you please tell me the mobile platform that the debugger is not working for?</p>
<p>Are you running TiStudio, the debugger and the emulator in a virtual machine? Please tell me what the guest and host OS is.</p>
<p>Also, which one of these OSes are you running TiStudio on?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>Everything runs on OSX 10.6.7. VMWARE and Parallels are installed because I have some<br>WIndows C++ developments going on.</p>
<p>I have found strange things. Seems to me that the project (hidden) settings are messed up.<br>I hade a look on the build folders of iphone and android after I selected the menu-item<br>Project-&gt;Clean.<br>Both folders were NOT empty!.<br>So I created a new project and copied my Resources into that projects: &gt; voila iphone debugging works (most of the time).</p>
<p>Where are those hidden settings of a project to check?</p>

<p>On my system, <code>Project &amp;gt; Clean</code> does delete all files and folders inside of the <code>&amp;lt;PROJECT&amp;gt;&amp;#x2F;build&amp;#x2F;android</code> directly, at least.</p>
<p>Would you clarify your question, &quot;Where are those hidden settings of a project to check?&quot; please - I am not quite sure what you mean.</p>

<p>Just updated TS today and the CB verion of SDK. Everythink is working well now.</p>

							<p>To Mike, the OP, would you please do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>launch an app using Titanium 1.7. Make a note of the Ti SDK build version &#x2F; hash &#x2F; date</li>
<li>close the simulator</li>
<li>make sure your environment adheres to the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Titanium+Compatibility+Matrix#TitaniumCompatibilityMatrix-iOS">iOS</a> section of the Titanium Compatibility Matrix</li>
<li>uninstall TiStudio, and reinstall ensuring that only the Stable Updates site is enabled. Update TiStudio to the latest Stable build</li>
