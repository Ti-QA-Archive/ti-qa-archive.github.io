			<p>Hi Community,</p>
<p>After a recent update from a few weeks back, I&#39;ve been using Titanium Studio and randomly without any warning my screen will go a strange color and the CPU fan goes crazy. It&#39;s only happening when Titanium Studio is open and has happened 3 times over the last 2 days.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also not immediately, but rather happens after an hour or so.</p>
<p>I look at http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Crashes_and_Freezes which says create a  JIRA ticket, but no link to where to do that.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated as to how I can log this with JIRA.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Greg</p>

<p>Before opening a ticket, be sure to search the JIRA to see if another has already been reported.  Duplicates waste man-hours.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Stephen, thanks for this. Had a look and could not find anything similar. I also suspect a hardware issue. Thought about what changed over the last week and the only thing was having bought an external Samsung 23 inch screen. Did notice it doing something strange last week but moved on.</p>
<p>The result of the crash however has been the file I was working on in Titanium Studio becoming empty, except for a couple of tabs on the first line. Very strange. Noticed this on the last 2 crashes which is odd.</p>
<p>Going through a process of elimination to discover what is possibly causing it.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll still submit the ticket though I think, as that is one of the items to at least eliminate.</p>

										<p><p>Ok, further tests have revealed this is hardware and more specifically when I have my external screen plugged in. Thanks for pointing me in that direction. Definitely avoided wasted man-hours.</p>
