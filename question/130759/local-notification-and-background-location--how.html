			<h1>Local Notification and Background Location – how?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve been researching this topic for a while, but I still didn&#39;t find any working solutions for this.</p>
<p>I have the following problem: I have to notify people at interesting places while my app is in the background.</p>
<p>I want to do this by download the list of interesting places to the memory, then by using Background Location (the <code>location</code> entry in the tiapp.xml) do the calculations on every location event callback. This works fine. What does not work is the Local Notifications, which somehow disappear shortly after displaying them.</p>
<p>On this forums I&#39;ve found that the problem is caused by the program does not have any references to the notification. I&#39;ve tried every trick: putting the scheduleLocalNotification in the app.js, making the returned var global, setting timeouts. The closest thing to working was my own solution, which used the bg.js to display the notifications. The problem with this is that bg.js runs only for 10 minutes (via Task Completion background run method).</p>
<p>Please tell me that there is a solution, only I did not find it :)</p>

										<p><p>Push notifications do work, yes. The problem with them is that you have to communicate with your server to display a single alert. I don&#39;t want to bother my server with tasks which can be done entirely on the phone too.</p>
