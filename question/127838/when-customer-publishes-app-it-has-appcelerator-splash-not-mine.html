			<h1>When customer Publishes App, it has Appcelerator SPLASH, not mine.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have been developing 3 apps for a company, designed new icons and splash screens - passing zips of the Debug-iphoneos&#x2F;App Folder (zipped), the customer has seen their new icons and splash.</p>
<p>However, when they upload the content of that folder to the app store it shows the appcelerator splash instead of mine.</p>
<p>So, I built a full blow distro, found the app in xcode, and clicked the share, save to disk - this time it made an .ipa file, so I zipped and sent to the customer, and same thing happens - the app store shows it as having the appcelerator graphics not mine.</p>
<p>Q. Is there another folder or file I should be changing other than<br>    &#x2F;project&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;*</p>
<p>Q. Which should the customer deploy the Debug-iphoneos&#x2F;App Folder, Debug-iphone&#x2F;.ipa file, or should I always do the distro, go into xcode and save to disk and deploy that .ipa file?</p>
<p>Thanks for any assistance!<br>Ozz</p>

							<p>First,</p>
<p>Check out this post <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;105471&#x2F;short-ipad-iphone-image-size-guide">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;105471&#x2F;short-ipad-iphone-image-size-guide</a>.</p>
<p>In general, images are a bit tricky.  When you publish to the App store, you need to make sure that the images listed in the TiApp.xml matches the image file names.  Once you have the names matched up, it should be pretty straight forward.  The easiest way may be to make sure your clients artwork is named the same, but that is not required.</p>

										<p><p>Ozz,</p>
<p>This post is the one I meant to link to.  It has better description of file names.  <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;116776&#x2F;complete-list-of-standard-artwork">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;116776&#x2F;complete-list-of-standard-artwork</a>.  In this post, for icons, are named starting with &#39;Icon&#39;.  You can start you icon files with other names, but they must all be the same.  For splash screens, must be named Default&lt;options&gt;.png</p>
<p>TiApp.xml must have the correct icon file name in it.</p>

										<p><p>Hey Tim,</p>
<p>That doesn&#39;t seem to be the problem. My filenames match those, and I did not chant tiapp.xml, so my appicon.png matches. However, the user says after submitting to the apple store, it is showing the appcelerator splash as the app cover - if that helps disclose anything? When I dig around in the folders after doing a build, I do find that the appcelerator graphics are in the build&#x2F;Resource and build&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;iphone folder - not mine. And I cannot simply copy the files there, as everytime I build it removes the build tree and starts a new build tree.</p>
<p>What ways can the customer be trying to upload? I tried the itunes connect way, and I see that I can upload the icon and screenshots by hand. However, the customer never came back to me for an icon 512x512, so that makes me think he is trying to upload from some other screen?</p>
<p>When I deploy these apps ad-hoc, everyone sees their icon, and splash screens. Maybe I am deploying the wrong way??</p>
<p>Thanks!<br>Ozz</p>
