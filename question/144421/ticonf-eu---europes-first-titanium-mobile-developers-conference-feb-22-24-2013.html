		<section>
			<p>tiConf 2013 is the first Titanium Mobile development conference to be held in Europe. We&#39;ve got a city - the beautiful Valencia in Spain, and a venue - the amazing Astoria Palace hotel, right in the heart of the historic quarter of the city. The event runs from February 22nd, 2013 with the talks and workshops running over the weekend of the 23rd - 24th.</p>
<p>If you haven&#39;t already, then head over to <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;2013.ticonf.eu">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;2013.ticonf.eu</a> and check out our speaker list and the current agenda. With at least 2 Top-10 Q&amp;A experts presenting, as well as a bunch of other well known Titanium identities, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll agree that the quality of presentations is already quite exciting. We&#39;ll be bringing you more speakers profiles over the course of the next couple of months as well as a few &quot;special guests&quot;.</p>
<p>In addition to that, there will be some fantastic socialising opportunities in the form of a free social day on Friday 22nd February (the day before the event) in which you are free to bring along your partners and family for a free afternoon picnic in the park. We&#39;re also running a fully guided Tapas Night on Saturday 23rd - tickets are €42 and include both drinks (wine&#x2F;beer) and Tapas at three different venues in the old city. Tickets for this are limited and your partners are welcome to attend, so please book early to avoid any disappointment.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;2013.ticonf.eu">Earlybird tickets are now available from only €129.</a> We hope to see you there in February!</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Boydlee</p>
