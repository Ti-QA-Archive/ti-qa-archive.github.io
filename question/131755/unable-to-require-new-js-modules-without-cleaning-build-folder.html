			<h1>Unable to require() new JS modules without cleaning build folder</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>When ever I write a new module, then try to use require(), I get a script error informing me that it is unable to find the file.<br>If I click project-&gt;clean, then run the iOS simulator, it will run without issue. Because it can take anywhere between 2 and 5 minutes to rebuild after I use clean, I would REALLY like to not have to do that whenever I write a new file.</p>
<p>I am using build 1.0.8.201201262211 of titanium studio on OSX (just updated it to see if that would fix my problem, no luck!)</p>

							<p>George, you don&#39;t need to do a &quot;full rebuild every time&quot;.  Whenever you introduce a new source file or image to a project, you will need to do a &quot;Clean&quot; one time by going to the Project menu and choosing &quot;Clean&quot;.  Thereafter, as you change that new source file, you do <strong>not</strong> need to clean again.</p>

							<p>Yeah sometimes TS does not compile new source files, or not copy new added images ( actually really :) ). So for new files created, you need to do a clean&#x2F;build to make sure it works :)</p>
