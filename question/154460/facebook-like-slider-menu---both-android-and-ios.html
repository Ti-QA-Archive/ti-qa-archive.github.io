		<section>
			<p>Hi,<br>I a building a mobile project where I want a Facebook like slider menu, both for Android and iOS. In<br>GitHub I have found projects which work great for iPhone but dont work with Android. I have been trying<br>for weeks now but without much success. I want a solution which works for both Android and iPhone.     Can anyone share some information on the same.<br>Thanks a lot!</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m really happy to see the menu widget has been updated for android. This really should be the accepted answer. This is an alloy widget. Appersonlabs&#39; code is good for non alloy apps– or alloy if you want to do everything in a controller :&#x2F;</p>

										<p><p>Hi Muhammad, I have imported the project in Titanium Studio and when I run it on my iPhone<br>simulator. I get a red screen with a &quot;Home View&quot; written on it.<br>I can&#39;t see any sliding menu. I have tried clicking on the screen but nothing happens.</p>
<p>Sorry if I am being silly but as I am new, I would appreciate if you could help me as it does not seem to work for me. Thanks.</p>
