			<h1>How to determine the cause of application crash</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>For non-crashing error handling, we can use <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dbankier&#x2F;TiLogCatcher">LogCatcher</a> which will inform us of the corresponding Javascript code which was causing the problem. </p>
<p>However, if an application crashes, then there is obviously no time for the logger to log Javascript errors. </p>
<p>It seems that the only option is to incorporate packages like <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.acra.ch&#x2F;">ARCA</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.testflightapp.com&#x2F;">testflight</a> to get back the <em>native</em> stack trace&#x2F;crash report etc., which might not be very helpful since in <strong>Titanium</strong> there is a <em>Javascript</em>-native translation going on.</p>
<p>Is there any way to determine the cause of application crash even out of such information? </p>
<p>Or is there a way to locate the problematic section of Javascript even in the event of application crash? </p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<div><p>In case you are wondering why so many questions are going unanswered and those that are may not have suitable answer it is because of things like this;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;176290&#x2F;include-is-deprecated-in-33-so-how-to-use-third-party-js-libraries#answer-280868">include is deprecated in 3.3, so how to use third-party JS libraries?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Both the author of the question and your comment have shown many of us old guard that giving up a significant proportion of our free time to try and help those with questions is no longer worth the time and effort.</p>
<p>When the community started it was a great place where people came together and asked and got answered, shared and received.  I am now and probably will be for some time the highest ranked expert here.  This is despite having given up a while ago due mostly to the rudeness and unwillingness of newer developers to accept they have to do something, learn something and evolve.</p>
<p>If you check my record you will see that I have the highest rate of accepted answered questions of any expert.  You will see that many people would ask the questions knowing what time I was around to answer them so I would be able to provide them the answer.  I gained a lot of praise for my efforts.  All I ever asked for was an occasional thank you.  I got more - which was nice.</p>
<p>However over time things changed and instead questions become demands, comments became self serving or simply their to annoy.  Desperate attempt s to help even the most inconsiderate questions authors become harder.</p>
<p>So we stopped.  We come back every once in a while as I did this weekend to offer assistance to those who are worthy when I have free time.</p>
<p>That is NOT to say those helping right now are not doing a good job.  But when I and a few others were committed to assisting 7 days a week - there was rarely an unanswered question.  Rarely did a question not have detailed code  with comments or links to code examples already provided.</p>
<p>So conclude; you have the community you and others have asked for - not the community I and others were part of.  It used to be kind, it used to be polite, it used to be helpful.  Then it was not.  If it ever changes, I will come back.</p>
<p>In case you are wondering why you are getting this - re-read your last comment on the linked question.</p>
