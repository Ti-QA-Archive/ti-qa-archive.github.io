							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Yes it is a standard tableView with the style property set to the grouped setting.  Then you add sections of small numbers of rows, some sections have footer views with labels inside.  Some of the rows are custom tableViewRows so you can add a switch or caption in addition to the title.</p>

										<p><p>Ah ok specifically in ios7 you are seeing an error - I thought you were asking how to achieve it.</p>
<p>This may be a bug, as soon as I am near my dev machine (about an hour) I will try and report back.</p>

										<p><p>Having done a lot of research on this subject since your question I have found out a few things;</p>
<ul>
<li>This is not an error</li>
<li>This is by design</li>
<li>The new grouped view IS this one</li>
<li>The grouped table view with rounded corners is only in the iPad settings app the iPhone version is the new format as are all other tables</li>
<li>The iOS settings app presentation of a grouped view is not a standard view</li>
<li>This may be a restricted property that is not yet public or simply a custom table</li>
</ul>
<p>There is more information on tableView styles including the grouped one in the following set of slides; tables are slide 33 onwards;</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for confirming this, Malcolm. I too was wondering about the same thing a moment ago and came across this. I guess I&#39;ll have to use background images for rows to make it look like the ones in iPad&#39;s settings app. Although, given the beta status, it may change? (It has changed once before if I am not mistaken)</p>

										<p><p>No problem, annoying I agree.  But it looks like you are now meant to use the edge to edge style if you do wish to follow the UI guidelines.</p>
<p>Quick tip, ideally comments are added to the answer provided; you are NOT being told off.</p>
