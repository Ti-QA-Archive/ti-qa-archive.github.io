			<h1>How do i use my app to send pictures to a DropBox account</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>First of all, i already wanna thanks everyone who tried to help me.<br>So this is what i wanna do from my app i will have a shortcut to take pictures, then rename this pictures with a specific name start, like title1, title2, title 3. After this is done the real problem that im trying to found a solution is how to send this pictures for a specific DropBox account, all hidden inside the code of the app because it will be a default account for the app, </p>
<p>Note:without having to login on the app screen, maybe somewhere in the code i can put the password and e-mail.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>If you are trying to use dropbox to host files from your app will rather than your app users connecting their drop accounts then you are very likely going to be breaching the terms of dropbox.  This is because drop box is ot designed to host files for your app, it is used to transfer files in and out of dropbox accounts rather than hosting.</p>
<p>You should instead look at something like ACS (Appcelerator Cloud Services), Amazon S3 or your own web space.</p>
<p>Dropbox is not the solution for this problem.</p>

										<p><p>Its not really hosting,its like…, in my app the user do an inspection and them send the inspection file to the pc where the users get their inspection precessed and their respectives inspection reports, but sometimes the users like to take pictures of their inspection, so what i wanted to do is just to take this pictures and send to a dropbox account so i can get them on the computer and put on the reports.</p>

										<p><p>So you are hosting the files, I know it may not seem like it, but if the files are all going to your account and not the users own accounts - you are hosting in your account.</p>
<p>Better you know now and get to choose if you use DropBox than find out later and have the problem in a live app.</p>
