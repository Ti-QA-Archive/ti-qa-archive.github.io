			<h1>Heavywindow vs lightweight window, when should we use one and when the other?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello everyone :) </p>
<p>I&#39;ve read a lot about the two types of window in Android.<br>But, is one better suited than the other? In which situation?</p>
<p>A heavywindow is a new Android activity with a new javascript context. A lightweight window is  &#39;just&#39; a new container that takes the whole screen.</p>
<p>Still, I don&#39;t understand what all that really means for my app!?<br>I can work more or less the same way with one or another. Except that heavywindows have more properties or &quot;gadgets&quot; like the action bar.</p>
<p>According to the Android API Reference, an activity is &quot;a single, focused thing that a user can do.&quot; I could say the same of a lightweight window too!</p>
<p>The only problem I&#39;ve seen with lightweight window is when the app is closed. The user will probably not get back the app with the same state it had when he opens it again.</p>
<p>Regarding performance, is there a difference?<br>If iOS has only one kind of window there must be a real good reason that Android has two.</p>
<p>I was wondering if someone could clarify the use of light and heavy windows. </p>
<p>Thank you :)</p>

							<p>The Android System gives you some opportunities when working with Activities (heavyweight windows).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It creates a back stack of Activities. That means, when the user navigates through you App like:<br>from <strong>Activity A</strong> to <strong>Activity B</strong> to <strong>Activity C</strong> and so on, he always can go back in his navigation history with the back button</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you start another App (I should better say an Activity of another App) via an Intent (e.g. for sharing Content or scanning a barcode), then the Activity Stack will bring the User back to your App&#39;s Activity through the back button</p>
</li>
<li><p>This also allows other Apps to start your App when you define <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Android.Intent">Intent</a> Filters for your Activities</p>
</li>
<li><p>You have control over the Activity Lifecycle of heavyweight windows by reacting to its events (start, stop, pause, resume, destroy, create) </p>
</li>
<li><p>When you create <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Android.Menu">OptionMenus</a>, then you have to use heavyweight windows since each menu belongs to an Activity</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That are some reasons for heavyweight windows that just came to my mind, probably there are more.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you very much, I understand better.</p>
<p>I suppose that in general, we would use a heavywindow:</p>
<ul>
<li>if some functionality&#x2F;activity needs to be available outside our app</li>
<li>if we need to save its current state. </li>
</ul>
<p>Then, for &quot;simpler&quot; screen, we just go with a lightweight.</p>
<p>I was wondering if there was some impact on the memory.<br>In my particular case:</p>
<p>I have various parts of my app where a scroll of images is present. This takes a lot of memory.<br>Does using heavyweight or lightweight window change something?</p>
<p>Let&#39;s say a stack of 4 activities (heavywindows) with a lots of images</p>
<p>vs</p>
<p>the same but, a stack of 4 lightweight windows (so they run in the same activity) </p>
<p>(I guess I&#39;ll just do the test.)</p>

										<p><p>Yes, it really depends on your needs. In most cases you can just go with lightweight windows.</p>
<p>Note, that there is always at least one activity available that you can use for saving states, optionsMenus and those things. This Activity is accessible from every lightweight window with <code>win.getActivity()</code>.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think that the window type influences the memory. There are other techniques to improve memory usage when working with images. See the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Best_Practices_and_Recommendations">recommendations</a> for example.</p>
