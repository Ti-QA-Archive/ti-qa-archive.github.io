							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Short answer; there are no best practices (short cuts) to support all devices and all resolutions - simply too many - especially when you include everything Android.</p>
<p>Longer answer</p>
<p>If you are building an app and you care about how it looks on multiple devices you need to spend time working out how you are going to design the app and how it will work across multiple aspect ratios as well as platforms and screen sizes.</p>
<p>I have answered some similar questions in the past which will be helpful in part for this question.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;148337&#x2F;how-to-achieve-same-layout-for-android-and-iphone-using-titanium#answer-256884">How to achieve same layout for Android and iPhone using Titanium</a></li>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;149743&#x2F;images-in-android#answer-258910">images in Android</a> (also iOS)</li>
</ul>
<p>But you have to realise that ranging apps from 240x320 (320x480 if we are being sensible all the way up to and beyond 2560x1600 cannot be done without serious thought and planning.</p>

										<p><p>@Alberto - I am confused by your comment on <strong>dp</strong> as an unsuitable unit of measurement.</p>
<p>40dp (or much better - tweak the tiapp.xml system unit value to dp) will be the same on all devices - dp takes into account the scale factor so a smaller device will appear differently to a tablet but the content space is the same.</p>
<p>We use dp for all apps on all devices on all aspect ratios on all platforms all from the same alloy TSS files - all look great - no tweaking required.</p>

							<p>Not sure if this is the best practise, but that&#39;s what I do:</p>
<p>I usually divide the styling for 4 different targets:</p>
<ul>
<li>android phone</li>
<li>android tablet</li>
<li>ipad</li>
<li>iphone</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#39;s necessary because there are big differences betweeb the four of them, not everything usually works using simple dp.</p>
<p>I create a style sheet for each page, for each target:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">androidPhone \ homepage<span class="hljs-class">.js</span>
androidTablet \ homepage<span class="hljs-class">.js</span>
iPhone \ homepage<span class="hljs-class">.js</span>
iPad \ homepage.js
</code></pre><p>in the styling file (homepage.js) I have something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> theme = {
    labelText : {
        height : <span class="hljs-string">"150dp"</span>
    },
 ...

<span class="hljs-built_in">module</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">export</span> = theme;
</code></pre><p>Then in the page I want to skin I get the device:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> device</span> = deviceUtils.getDeviceName();
</code></pre><p>then get the right styling files, and apply the styling with _.extend</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">label</span> = Ti.UI.createLabel(_.extend(theme.labelText,<span class="hljs-comment">{
...</span>
</code></pre><p>this will ensure that I get the right dps no matter what kind of device I use.</p>

										<p><p>@Alberto take a look at Alloy for your next project - it will greatly simplify what you have here.</p>
<p>You are able to denote platform and form factor in the tss stylesheets and when using the app.tss you can set global styles for common elements in your app.</p>
<p>If you have not yet taken a look or not recently - &quot;jump in the waters great&quot;.  Seriously though - it will greatly reduce the time taken to achieve your one separation - which is not a bad implementation btw.  Plus underscore is automatically included - even though you would not need to use it for the same reason above when using Alloy.</p>

										<p><p>thank you, I&#39;ve been postponing Alloy for quite a while. Unfortunately where I work there&#39;s the motto: &quot;it works, don&#39;t touch it&quot;. So, most of our apps have been already developed the old way. Not sure if all the modules that we purchased work in alloy either..</p>

										<p><p>We had the same thoughts - having been using Titanium for well over 4 years - we have some old and some large projects and we even have some old large projects.  We decided to take the plunge just a few short months ago on a very large project and took the opportunity to not only move to Alloy but refactor at the same time.  </p>
<p>This was feared at the start - but it was very easy in part because Alloy makes you think about structure as you go.  We created a test simple function app to see what everything did before going into a real project - this was very valuable time spent.  We now think of each main app section as a different widget - this really helps us break up an app that has a significant number of sections.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Alloy is not a new Titanium - just a framework to separate and structure your code (plus more - but unrelated to this).  When you compile the app it process the Alloy framewrok code into Titanium code and then run as it previously would have done.  So modules work exactly as they did before - no need to get new ones or pay more money, you are still using Titanium you are just using it better, faster and when you plan a little creating many in-house reusable widgets and code.</p>
<p>Alloy is great and we have Tony Lukasavage to thank for that - he is the main behind Alloy and a great bloke.</p>

							<p>I totally agree with Malcolm here but here are my two cents anyway.</p>
<p>Supporting all form-factors of both platforms is one of the biggest complications in cross-platform development. I think implementing the UI is that part of Titanium development where you stop to work on a single code base. It is not a simple configuration thing.</p>
<p>As Malcolm said, there is no real &quot;best practice&quot; but there are a few things I experienced that became part of my personal best practice.</p>
<p>When we developed an App for iOS and Android that should also support tablets we started to design multiple versions of each part of the UI. As mentioned above, single code base works better for the logical part of your app turns out that the first point in my best practice is <strong>splitting UI and logic</strong> (MVC).</p>
<p>I also adopted platform-specific navigation patterns. Sure, there were a lot of UI elements that works fine on every platform, especially contents. Creating re-usable and <strong>modular UI components</strong> is another best practice for me. Alloy is a great help at this. You can work with widgets, separate re-useable stuff in controllers, decide wich to use on what platform, form-factor etc. Alloy is awesome! When doing it right, you could start developing for one and add views for other platforms or form-factors later.</p>
<p>Another technique that is definitely a best practice, primarily on Android, is using <strong>density dependency</strong>. That means using an abstract unit <strong>dp</strong> globally wich will be converted to the same physical size on target devices (both, iOS and Android). You will find good answers in this Q&amp;A about this topic. (Also for using <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;154054&#x2F;font-size-for-android#answer-264843">font sizes</a>)</p>
<p>When it comes to graphic assets, there are solutions to <strong>provide multiple images</strong> for every screen (link in Malcolms answer).</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure there are quite a lot of other things that I forgot to mention. There is no secret recipe, no universal solution for this. There are so many things to care about, so many banana skins. I hope the essence out of those answers you got here are a starting point.</p>
