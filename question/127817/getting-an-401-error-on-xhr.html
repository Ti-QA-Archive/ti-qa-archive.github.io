		<section>
			<p>We have a piece of code doing basic http authentication. when I run on SDK 1.7.6 and SDK 4.3 version, everything works fine. When I run it on 1.7.6 and iOS 5 sdk it doesn&#39;t work. I get an 401 error. I just downloaded SDK 1.8.0 and tried to run the code against 4.3 and 5.0. The code doesn&#39;t work against any of these SDK. Has anybody experienced this before or seen it before ?</p>

							<p>I tried the latest build and also the build which was specified but no luck. Has anybody figured out why this is happening ? I had read on JIRA that there was an underlying isue with the library which appcelerator was using and were planning to replace that. Does anybody know if that&#39;s happening any time soon ?</p>
