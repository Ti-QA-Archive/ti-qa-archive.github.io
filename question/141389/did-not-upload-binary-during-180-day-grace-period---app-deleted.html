			<h1>Did not upload binary during 180-day grace period - app deleted.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>During development of my app that uses in-app purchases, I had to use itunes connect to create the app name, create my products, and create a test user, but all within a Development Provisioning Profile.  Recently I received an email from Apple indicating the following:   &quot;You did not upload a binary for your app, XXXXXX, during the 180-day grace period. As a result, the app has been deleted from iTunes Connect.<br>This app cannot be restored, nor can you use the App Name or SKU for any other app under your account in the future.&quot;    Is it true that I cannot use the same App Name when I create my Distribution Provisioning Profile and identify my App Name?</p>

							<p>I called Apple Support and after explaining my situation in great detail, they granted me a one-time extension. Expecting my app name to be restored in the next few days.</p>
<p>I understand that they&#39;re trying to prevent name-squating, but apps being developed with in-app purchases require establishing the name during development and 180 days is not always enough time to complete the app.   I read about a few loopholes, like uploading a partially development binary which resets the clock, but I prefer to avoid that route.  Instead, next time I&#39;ll create a unique name for the app while in development, maybe adding the suffix &quot;dev&quot; or something.</p>
