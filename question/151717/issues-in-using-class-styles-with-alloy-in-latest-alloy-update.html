			<h1>Issues in Using Class Styles with Alloy in Latest Alloy Update</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all-</p>
<p>Has anyone seen issues in the latest update to the Alloy framework (released the week of April 22, 2013) in using classes within tss files?  I use classes extensively to style my application, and upon upgrading my framework, I noticed that my views suddenly changed dramatically.  Upon investigation, it appears that my class styles are no longer being applied from my tss files to my views.  If I take the same properties from my tss files and apply them inline in the controls, the styles apply, or if I change the classes to ids, the styles apply, it is simply when I have a view, with a corresponding tss file, the class is not taking styles and applying the styles (such as top, backgrounds etc of a view for example).</p>
<p>Has anyone else upgrade and seen this behavior?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for any help</p>
<p>Talk soon<br>Chris</p>

							<p>I think this was a regression (sorry) when I was solving <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;ALOY-434">ALOY-434</a> in Alloy 1.1.0. I&#39;m fairly certain that it is resolved in 1.1.2 which we are testing this week. Could you do me a huge favor and test your app against the alpha version we are currently testing? It would be great to have your app as another data point to confirm out testing. </p>
<p>You can download the 1.1.2 alpha via npm like this:</p>
<h3 id="on-mac-or-linux">on mac or linux</h3>
<pre><code class="hljs">sudo npm install -g alloy@<span class="hljs-number">1.1</span><span class="hljs-number">.2</span>-alpha
</code></pre><h3 id="on-windows">on windows</h3>
<pre><code class="hljs">npm install -g alloy@<span class="hljs-number">1.1</span><span class="hljs-number">.2</span>-alpha
</code></pre><p>Please give 1.1.2-alpha a shot and let me know if it solves your issue.</p>

										<p><p>No problem.  I have to have our Help Desk do the install…I live in the unfortunate world where we do not have admin access on our boxes, but I should be able to get this done today and try out the fix.</p>

										<p><p>Hi there Tony-</p>
<p>I just had the alpha release installed and tested out the class fix and confirmed that all looks good to go with that fix.  Once installed, classes within the tss files again take affect within the views as expected.  Thanks for pointing me to the alpha fix!</p>
<p>Talk to you soon<br>Chris</p>

										<p><p>Quick side note to this conversation that I am noticing (and not sure if this is residual from the 1.1.1 release, or the alpha release)…since the upgrade, I am also noticing that on the ScrollViewer control, I no longer see the actual scroll &#x2F; dot elements at the lower portion of the view.  The control works as normal, but the dots no longer display.  I was using this mod previously to style&#x2F;color the elements, and re-added it into the new deployment, but this only added themability to the control…even without it, I should at least get the paging nav elements.  Just wanted to FYI</p>

										<p><p>Hi Christopher, </p>
<p>could it be possible for you to provide us a runnable sample code that we can use to narrow down your issue?<br>Which Titanium SDK are you also using?</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback!</p>

										<p><p>Also note specifically if this scrollview issue is a direct result of the alloy upgrade, or if its something that occurred when you updated to TiSDK 3.1.0. I&#39;m inclined to believe latter, but details would be good.</p>

										<p><p>Hey there…actually, disreguard…I think it may be just a quirk on my machine.  I had dropped my mods into the new sdk, and had not seen the pagingviewcontrollers at all, after a night away, a reboot this morning, all is back and well.  Sorry about that, but not a clue. :)  All is well again, and thanks.</p>
