			<p>My boss wants to give the user an option to toggle between to app names.  For example, let&#39;s say the default name is &quot;Cool Kids App&quot;.  My boss wants to give the user the option to change the display name of the app to &quot;Chill Kids App&quot;.  Is there anyway to change the label (i.e. the manifest file) from within the app itself (i.e. user clicks button to change name)?  Or would the only way be to upload the same app under the alternate name?</p>

							<p>Hi Ronald,</p>
<p>Unfortunately changing the app name at runtime isn&#39;t possible. And as for submitting two of the same apps with a different name, that isn&#39;t possible either, especially in the Apple app store - Apple will reject duplicate apps.</p>
<p>Maybe you could help us understand why you&#39;d like this behavior? Don&#39;t forget that in the submission process you can define tags, so users could still find your app with either &quot;cool&quot; or &quot;chill&quot;.</p>

										<p><p>I currently have it set so that the user can find the app using both search terms.  The problem is that our company is really 2 separate companies working as one and my boss wants the app name to change based on which sub-company the client&#39;s data is related to.  Thanks for the reply.  I figured it was not possible.  I just wanted to make sure before I told my boos.</p>
