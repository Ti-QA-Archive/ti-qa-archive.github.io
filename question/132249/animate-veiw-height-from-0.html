			<h1>Animate Veiw Height From 0</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m having serious issues with what should be a very straight forward problem in Titanium Mobile 1.8.1.</p>
<p>I have a view with height 0. I then wish to animate that view to open up and display the contents. If this was jQuery, I&#39;d be able to use .slideDown(), or .animate({height: 0px}) with no trouble. For whatever reason, I&#39;m unable to recreate this effect in Titanium Mobile?</p>
<p>When the height either starts as 0, or ends up that way after an animation from open to close, I&#39;m unable to get the height to anything from 0. The only way I&#39;m able to even approximate this is using a height of 1, which then causes the view to slide to the top of its container and is not a height of 0 which is what I ideally need?</p>
<p>Surely I can&#39;t be the only one to try and recreate jQuery&#39;s slideDown animation?</p>
<p>Any&#x2F;all help is appreciated!</p>
<p>ise</p>

							<p>Solved it! I need to animate the top to it&#39;s original position, which in my case is 0 as I&#39;m using layout vertical. This then animates the height of the box and keeps it where it is at the same time!</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">wrapper</span><span class="hljs-class">.animate</span>(<span class="hljs-rules">{
    <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">height</span>:<span class="hljs-value"> fullHeight
</span></span></span>});
<span class="hljs-tag">wrapper</span><span class="hljs-class">.animate</span>(<span class="hljs-rules">{
    <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">top</span>:<span class="hljs-value"> originalTopPosition
</span></span></span>});
</code></pre><p>Thanks people for their efforts.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your response Nick!</p>
<p>Not sure that&#39;s quite what I&#39;m suggesting. I have a detail view with a height of 0 mixed amoungst a list of links. When the full detail link is clicked, I need to view holding the detail to expand within the list so that everything is still visible. Wouldn&#39;t your method just cover over everything? And then what if the height of the detail view is larger than the view it&#39;s contained within?</p>
<p>The best example I can think of is an accordion effect that I need to replicate?</p>

							<p>To create view hide animation you may use animation in this manner  </p>

										<p><p>Again, not quite sure this is what I&#39;m after. Having a slide in effect is very easy and your answer is one example. What I&#39;m after is having a hidden box, with elements all around it in one big scroll view. Then when you click on one of those elements, a box expands just below it to reveal details. If you then scroll past that box, you get the rest of the elements, just as you would using jQuery slideDown().</p>
<p>I&#39;ve almost got there myself already (using a closed height of 1px), but now the top is moving up the page as the height animates.</p>

							<p>Just a quick update for whoever may stuck in this problem.</p>
<p>If you have other element whose position depends on the one to be collapsed, you may find that element suddenly jump to its final position without moving gradually with the one performing animation.<br>That&#39;s because animation will not actually check the property of the element(if you check the element.height, you will find it doesn&#39;t change that value, even the animation finishes!!) So other elements&#39; position will be reset at the moment the animation starts.</p>
<p>I ended up completely rewrite my own animation function using setTimeout, instead of using animation function… Hope there will be better solution for it though.</p>
