			<p>I need to fire off several tasks each time the app starts - mainly http calls, for example to grab the latest data the user has entered on the website and to synchronize their mobile initiated items to the website.</p>
<p>I&#39;d like to do these asynchronously so the UI is not frozen while they happen. What&#39;s a good way to do that?</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;117199&#x2F;how-to-create-multithreading-in-mobile-sdk">This earlier question</a> suggests creating a new window to run the async tasks in, and another question suggested using setTimeout. </p>
<p>setTimeout doesn&#39;t appear to work (still freezes the UI). I was about to try the new window method, but wanted to see if there are other ways of achieving multi-threading or background tasks.</p>

							<div><p>can you post a code example for event based model you used? because as far as I know setTimeout is javascript &quot;threading&quot;.</p>
