			<h1>onerror not fired when using HttpClient over 3G</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Tech stuff out the way first:<br>Using iOS 4.3, on iPhone 4, Titanium Framework 1.7.1</p>
<p>I have written some basic code which sends an HTTP GET request to a URL and retrieves some JSON data, all pretty straight forward.  I have assigned both an onerror and onload event to the HTTPClient and in the simulator everything works as expected.  However, as soon as I run this on my iPhone over a 3G data connection the onerror event is never fired (over Wifi it works fine).  The onload event does fire over 3G.</p>
<p>Upon inspection using onreadystatechange, it appears that somehow over my 3G connection when I am retrieving a URL that does not even exist (invalid domain &#x2F; port etc), I am getting a response back with a status code of 503, and some HTML in the responseText.  See <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;imageshack.us&#x2F;photo&#x2F;my-images&#x2F;715&#x2F;photokf.png&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;imageshack.us&#x2F;photo&#x2F;my-images&#x2F;715&#x2F;photokf.png&#x2F;</a> for a screen shot of the response, is the network operator somehow providing this response?</p>
<p>Here is the very simple code I am using to replicate this issue:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> loader = Titanium.Network.createHTTPClient();

loader.onload = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{  
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> data = <span class="hljs-built_in">eval</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'('</span>+<span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.responseText+<span class="hljs-string">')'</span>);
    alert (<span class="hljs-string">'Loaded data records #'</span> +  + data.length);
};

loader.onerror = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{ alert (<span class="hljs-string">'Error: could not load data'</span>); };

loader.onreadystatechange = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">e</span>) </span>{
    alert (<span class="hljs-string">'State: '</span> + loader.readyState + <span class="hljs-string">' HTTP Status: '</span> + loader.status + <span class="hljs-string">'\nResponse: '</span> + <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.responseText);
};

loader.open(<span class="hljs-string">"GET"</span>,<span class="hljs-string">"http://this-url-does-not-exist/some.json"</span>);
loader.send();
</code></pre><p>onerror is never fired in this example above.<br>However, onreadstatechange is fired 4 times with the following readyState values:<br>1st. READY_STATE_OPENED = 1;<br>2nd. READY_STATE_HEADERS_RECEIVED = 2;<br>3rd. READY_STATE_LOADING = 3;<br>4th. READY_STATE_DONE = 4; Also, loader.status is 503, and the responseText has some HTML in it which you can see at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;imageshack.us&#x2F;photo&#x2F;my-images&#x2F;715&#x2F;photokf.png&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;imageshack.us&#x2F;photo&#x2F;my-images&#x2F;715&#x2F;photokf.png&#x2F;</a></p>
<p>So why is onerror never fired?  My current workaround for this is to not use the onerror event at all and simply to check within onreadystatechange for readyState == 4 and loader.status != 200.</p>
<p>Can someone shed some light as to whether I am doing something wrong, or is there a bug in the framework which is causing this?  Or is my network operator perhaps doing something odd to the response which is fooling the HttpClient into never firing either onerror or onload (which inevitably is still a bug as one should fire).</p>

							<p>onerror will work if you fail to connect. switch off 3g and see it happen. A 500 response is still a avalid response. Nothing went wrong with the request justnwith the returned status.</p>
<p>to clarify onerror is for when something went wrong with the http request locally. not on the server itself.  So yes you have to handle you status returns in the code.</p>
<p>hope this explains it.</p>

										<p><p>Trevor, thanks for the explanation, however whilst 3G is on when I send a request to a domain that does not exist, I should be guaranteed a request error.  The fact that something involved in the request is returning a 500 response means that something in the mix is acting incorrectly as this type of request should raise onerror.</p>
<p>Also, assuming onerror is not called when there is a response from the server, surely onload should be called.  It is not either.  Neither onerror or onload are called.</p>

										<p><p>ok I think that the onload does go but the eval of this.responsetext fails verify by just putting an alert around.</p>
<p>the responseText does not exist in a status 500 error so what I found was the app just hung until I put validation in. try catch around the open and send to catch any strange errors the first thing on the onload is to check the status.</p>
<p>Hope this helps I went round in circles a little with this first time I used it.</p>
<p>would post code but machine is booted will be later if you need examples.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m pretty sure the onload does not fire, that eval has not caused an error.</p>
<p>If you look at the screen shot I originally linked to, you will see that responseText does exist, that&#39;s the weird thing.</p>
<p>If you do have some code, please do post and I&#39;ll try it out and see if it solves the issue.  In the mean time, I will post my work around solution in here which ensures onload and onerror is always called.</p>

							<p>Whilst my own answer is not necessarily a fix for the problem, it is an effective work around which ensures onload or onerror is always called.  Note however that onerror is called if there is an HttpClient connection error (e.g. it cannot even connect to a server), or if HttpClient gets a response but the response HTTP status code is an error.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> loader = Titanium.Network.createHTTPClient();

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> onload = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{  
    Titanium.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">'Loaded successfully'</span>);
};

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> onerror = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{
    Titanium.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">'Could not connect to server or server responded with error status code'</span>);
}

loader.onreadystatechange = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">e</span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (loader.readyState == <span class="hljs-number">4</span>) { <span class="hljs-comment">// READY_STATE_DONE</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-built_in">Math</span>.floor(loader.status/<span class="hljs-number">100</span>) == <span class="hljs-number">2</span>) { <span class="hljs-comment">// 200* status codes are successful</span>
            onload();
        } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
            onerror();
        }
    }
};


loader.open(<span class="hljs-string">"GET"</span>,<span class="hljs-string">"http://what-ever-URL.com/"</span>);
loader.send();

										<p><p>nice work around. will post code. but on a status 500 the eval will fail.. It did take me a while to prove that and will be open to be corrected on that. You do need to put the try catch around the code or it will fail ungracefuly.</p>

										<p><p>Yup, you&#39;re right, status 500 will fail, however onload was never fired in the tests I ran.  That was just work in progress code, so I should have left that irrelevant bit out.</p>
