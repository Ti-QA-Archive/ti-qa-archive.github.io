		<section>
			<p>Hey guys, I&#39;m new at Titanium, and I&#39;m having a quick look at the framework itself.<br>Surfing on the net, I found this http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.slideshare.net&#x2F;vince.baskerville&#x2F;anarchist-guide-to-titanium-ui-8389770.</p>
<p>It&#39;s impressive how well crafted and cool the App is.<br>Is this possible only using a lot of html,css and webviews?<br>Or am I missing something?</p>
<p>I&#39;m asking this because with a quick overview I learned that using conventional Titanium APIs and Calls, is it possible to build Apps that looks 100% native, but in this way you haven&#39;t much UI customization possibilities. </p>
<p>Thanks in advance,<br>Mathew</p>

<p>Though it&#39;s possible to use html+css in webviews, this is not common practice in Titanium - for this just use PhoneGap ;-). The provided API allows you to achieve pretty much anything you want, with varying degrees of effort. You can either use standard native controls, or create customized views. Moreover, if you want to create specialized native components (e.g. for leveraging specific target OS features, or existing libraries) you can do it creating native modules.</p>

										<p><p>I think Olivier has given you the best answer.</p>
<p>Titanium at its basic level offers you native controls, something that html&#x2F;css&#x2F;phonegap combos will not.  This native components will run faster than engineered solutions built with html&#x2F;css in a web view (essentially what phonegap does).</p>
<p>However, using prototyping, you can can create your OWN objects based upong NATIVE components and create a non-standard, custom design.</p>
<p>Which is exactly what TripLingo did.  When Vince says break the rules, he wasn&#39;t kidding.  Their app works.  Its UI works for what the app is supposed to do, facilitate language learning on a limited screen, in your hand.  To do that, they had to create a custom UI that DOESN&#39;T match the iOS design suggestions.  However, they have 16 separate apps in the App Store based upon this design with thousands of happy customers.  It must have worked.</p>

										<p><p>Came across this rather old post, and wanted to add a bit of new history if I may.  Had an opportunity to learn from Vince first hand since this time in a saturday workshop he did in Atlanta.  While it was NOT Titanium centric, but UX oriented, had a blast (even as a crungy old programmer) working with some creatives.</p>
<p>Changed the way I think about my work.  If you ever get the chance to take a workshop with Vince, I HIGHLY recommend it.</p>
