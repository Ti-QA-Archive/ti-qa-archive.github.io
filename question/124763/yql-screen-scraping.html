			<h1>YQL Screen Scraping</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>This is essentially a follow up question to <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;124330&#x2F;yql-help">this one</a>, but once I finally got some results from my YQL query, they weren&#39;t in the format I was necessarily expecting and now I&#39;m not sure how to deploy them (or even whether I <em>can</em> deploy them in the way I was hoping).</p>
<p>My goal was to perform a targeted screen scrape of the HTML on a given URL and then present that as a view in my Titanium app. It seemed sensible enough to use YQL to get the DOM component I was after, but I&#39;m not sure how to deal with the JSON result. Is there a way to simply drop that in as a webview or I have to somehow reconstruct the HTML from the JSON?</p>
<p>Maybe there&#39;s a better way that what I&#39;m doing? This is all brand new to me, so it&#39;s entirely possible that I&#39;m going about this all wrong.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<div><p>Perhaps sharing the JSON result will make it easier to help you. And yes, if you can get HTML from your result then you can just drop it into a webview and display it in your Titanium app.</p>

							<div><p>Unfortunately, even when I alert the JSON returned, it&#39;s large and I can&#39;t copy it all from the emulator. Imagine an HTML page with all of its tags, attributes, values and content split out into JSON and you can pretty much imagine what I&#39;m looking at. :-)</p>

							<p>This may sound a little Rube Goldberg but I would query my own webservice that uses PHP CURL with preg match, then echo the results in JSON so I could control things server side. That way, if the HTML you are scraping changes, you can change things server side without having to recompile and update the app.</p>
<p>The flow looks like:<br>Your App —GET&#x2F;POST—&gt;PHP Server—-JSON—&gt;Your App</p>
