							<p>yeah, we get the point. But the patch doesn&#39;t always work. </p>
<p>The only way I could get mine to work was to nuke titanium and trash both &#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium and ~&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium then reinstall the application. And finally apply the patch and re-import my applications. Only then did it work.</p>
<p>Need a bit of patience on this as its a big issue obviously.</p>

							<p>Fixed: remove iphone beta SDK completely, download current SDK release (not beta) reinstall and relaunch appcelerator. yeah, I gave up on SDK 4.0 I have no time to play around and fix something that someone else should fix.</p>

							<p>I was stuck with the same issue for hours then i got the solution. Here is what worked for me:</p>
<p>Copy your project directory. </p>
<p>Now remove the project from Appcelerator and delete the source (make sure you did make a copy of your project directory first)</p>
<p>Create a new project in Appcelerator with the same name and other credentials as the one you were trying to run</p>
<p>Now open Finder and copy just the necessary files in the Resources folder from the Old Copy of your Project to the new one</p>
<p>Make sure you edit tiapp.xml to reflect your settings in the new project</p>
<p>Now hit launch for Run Emulator </p>
<p>This worked for me. I did try nuking Titanium and its directories earlier so I did have a fresh copy on Appcelerator and also patched the LibTiCore.a file as mentioned in one of the other tutorial for the os4.0 compatibility.</p>

							<p>I have to ask the question - WTF with all of the patching and backdooring? Why can&#39;t the Titanium team have everything you need on one page with detailed instructions ready to go?</p>
<p>I understand that if you&#39;ve been using the Titanium app for a while and it works for you. Yippee. Get over yourselves and show some love to those that are just now entering the Appcelerator world when Apple has done a major upgrade, which I guess forces Titanium to do one. If the iPhone SDk isn&#39;t jiving with the Appcelereator SDK, THEN FREAKING SAY THAT AT THE VERY BEGINNING!! Don&#39;t make it sound all rosy that you can download this SDK, download that SDK and produce your first app shortly there after. </p>
<p>It&#39;s frustrating as hell to down load an app that tells me one thing and then I have to go in an rename this, delete that, alter this and move something else just for the damn app to work. </p>
<p>FIX IT and make it work so those of us that are new don&#39;t have to find a thread buried in your forum that says, &quot;Oh yea, you need to do the following just so you can view the Kitchen Sink.&quot;</p>
<p>If I am off the path, flame away. But if I am even close to be right, then do the right thing to do is acknowledge that there is a problem and fix it. Hell, maybe even do one of the fancy Vimeo videos showing a walk through showing the setup of the Titanium (which version) and the iPhone SDK (the correct version) and anything else that is needed just to get up off the ground.</p>
<p>I&#39;m like the rest of you - got a great idea that I want to see come to fruition in the Apple App Store, but cannot even get off the ground due to the emulator not working.</p>
<p>Where did I go wrong?</p>
<p>Thanks for your time,<br>Tommy</p>
