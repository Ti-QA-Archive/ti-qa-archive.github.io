			<p>Yes we all know that jasmin-titanium exists thats great; last commit was about 11 months ago; and it works; but not with require, and there is no official documentation on testing which is just insane; and every example application even the NEW community APP has NO TESTS!! If there is a testing in the pipe line I would really like to help out if I could; just give the community just a little help on testing their applications; surely titanium want people to create great applications that dont break on every release of titanium; or put your testing framework you guys are working on in the market place and i will buy it; throw me a testing bone here guys;</p>

							<p>I guess the problem is that no solution for automatic testing is good for everyone. Titanium-jasmine works fine, but it runs on the emulator (which may be good for more complex integration tests - eg. integration between JS and native modules - but not much for quick unit tests). For unit testing I&#39;m using <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mhevery&#x2F;jasmine-node">jasmine-node</a> as a quick headless test runner, coupled with <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sinonjs.org&#x2F;">Sinon.js</a> for mocking, etc.</p>

										<p><p>yep thats cool for my models that is good; however I use absolute require in my project as ios was having problems with relative require;</p>
<p>so how do you get absolute require working? as in titanium absolute will be the Resources path in the nodejs world this is different did you patch require?</p>
<p>titanium-jasmine is not really working with require. if someone wants to show that magick I would be most greatful;</p>

										<p><p>Actually I&#39;m not having problems with relative paths in require, which version of the SDK are you using? It&#39;s also true that I try to keep my modules mostly independent from each other and test them singularly, so maybe I (luckily) didn&#39;t incur in such kind of problems…</p>

										<p><p>thanks for reply; yep i have a model lets just say post and that has a user that is requires; I use absolute throughout my requires; as this is a nice approach; I know I am always at Resource Dir; simple; in node world module will set the require path to [&quot;&quot;] if it is absolute; It always seems me that is testing in titanium is a hack; it is just sooooooo disappointing that they think testing is something that does not have priority. they will do when future updates keep breaking apps and the developer will not know of the break until their users tell them</p>

										<p><p>So a possible solution would be to use a path convention that makes both tools happy, even if it &quot;looks&quot; less nice - in such cases I&#39;m for the pragmatic approach ;-)</p>

										<p><p>Totally agree.  Been using titanium-jasmine but integrating it with our ci build server was painful and hacky.  We&#39;re now looking to switch our apps over to the CommonJS requires style rather than the current Ti.include style and so are looking at how to get our tests updated.

							<p>Hi Richard, </p>
<p>I thought it would be worth to just let you know that I probably found a workaround to the problem with relative paths in ios and testing with jasmine-node wrt the comments to my <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;133195&#x2F;testing-please-just-give-the-community-a-little-help-on-testing#answer-232379">other answer</a>.</p>
<p>First, require() implementation on iOS is completely buggy at the moment, as reported in several tickets in JIRA. Here&#39;s one for all: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIDOC-514">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIDOC-514</a>.</p>
<p>Now the workaround for this specific scenario consists in the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>don&#39;t use relative paths in require in Titanium (but you are free to use them in your jasmine specs run through node)</li>
<li>Say you have module a.js in directory <code>Resources&amp;#x2F;app_modules&amp;#x2F;mod_a&amp;#x2F;</code> and module b.js in  <code>Resources&amp;#x2F;app_modules&amp;#x2F;mod_b&amp;#x2F;</code>: all requires to a.js throughout your app should be done as <code>require(&amp;#39;app_modules&amp;#x2F;mod_a&amp;#x2F;a</code>). The same for references to b.js</li>
<li>In your jasmine specs just use relative paths as usual</li>
<li>Now the trick is to set the <code>NODE_PATH</code> environment variable to point to the Resources directory of your Ti Project, just like: </li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="hljs">export <span class="hljs-variable">NODE_PATH=</span><span class="hljs-string">"${PWD}/Resources"</span>
jasmine-<span class="hljs-keyword">node</span><span class="hljs-identifier"> </span><span class="hljs-title">Resources</span>/<span class="hljs-operator">spec</span>
</code></pre><p>supposing you are in the root directory of your project. This obviously could be encapsulated in a shell script or makefile.</p>
<p>I hope you&#39;ll find the hint useful as it has been for me.</p>
