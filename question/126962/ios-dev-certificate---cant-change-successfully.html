			<h1>iOS Dev Certificate - Can&#39;t Change Successfully</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I renewed by Apple dev package and got my &#39;new&#39; Dev certificate.  Installed it per the instructions, and it appears in KeyChain and Xcode organizer.  Created my App ID and dev prov profile and Ti Studio seems to recognize it.  I try to run my app to device and get &#39;System Exit 65&#39;.  Occasionally (every few run attempts) an error appears in the Studio console saying I have more than one Dev certificate.  I check KeyChain and the old, expired one (same id as new one) is there, so I delete it.  I run again and get Exit 65.  I check Xcode Organizer and it shows two of them, but you cannot select either one to edit or delete.  Occasionally after a few more run attempts, my deleted certificate has returned to KeyChain. This cycle has happened  few times where the old cert reappears - cannot get app to run to device in any of the runs. </p>
<p>Any ideas?   Thanks.</p>
<p>(Ti Studio 1.0.4.2, SDK 1.7.2, Xcode 4.02, SDK 4.3)</p>

							<p>try doing a clean project. This will empty the build directory and should enable the code to compile.</p>
<p>If this fails.</p>
<p>Firstly remove the certificate from Xcode and then remove the certificate from studio build. Build the app and delete on first screen. Then cancel the build.</p>
<p>Download the certificate, then drag it into Xcode.</p>
<p>Then build your app again and when it asks for the certificate open the downloaded one.</p>
<p>and continue to build the app.</p>
<p>Hope this explains ok.</p>
<p>T..</p>

										<p><p>Yeah, I have been cleaning the project incessantly from the beginning.</p>
<p>What do you mean by &#39;remove the certificate from studio build&#39;?  Is that a specific folder name?  Are you referring to the &#39;app provisioning profile&#39;?  I&#39;m talking about the &#39;developer certificate&#39;.  The provisioning profile is the one you drag to Xcode, where the certificate opens in KeyChain.  My issue has been that my .cer file has been showing the old and the new one, since I renewed by Apple dev membership.</p>
<p>Separately, since my earlier post I did delete all provisioning profiles in Xcode Organizer, which had been associated with my previous dev certificate.  That seems to have solved the old dev cert from returning in KeyChain, but I still it in Xcode Organizer and can&#39;t run the app to device.</p>

							<p>Okay, resolved it.  When I ran the project in Xcode (which I should have tried along time ago) it gave me a more specific error message…telling me exactly where the two dupe certificates were…one in my &#39;logins&#39; keychain and the other, old one in my &#39;system&#39; keychain.  Previously, I had just deleted the old one that was appearing in &#39;login&#39;.  Once I deleted the &#39;system&#39; keychain&#39;s old certs, that did the trick.  Serenity now.</p>
