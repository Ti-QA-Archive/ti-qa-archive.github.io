			<h1>The real meaing of execution context</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hi, I think that in the official Titanium documentation there is a not exact use of the term &quot;execution context&quot; and this causes (surely in my case) confusion. From Titanium point of view seems that execution context means  &quot;process within Javascript code runs, having its own global scope&quot;. You can verify that when in the documentation read that every window opened using url property creates its own execution context (with its own global scope). So an execution context is similar to the html web page that contains javascript code: every page of an internet site is like a single application and without using special tecniques (like cookies) those web pages can&#39;t share its variables. But this explanaition of execution context seems to be uncorrect (see, for example, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ryanmorr.com&#x2F;understanding-scope-and-context-in-javascript&#x2F;">this</a><br>Is there anyone able to answer once and for all in a clear and simple way to these questions:<br>1) in which way execution context and scope differ?<br>2) if I create a new &quot;execution context&quot; using url property (I know it is a terrible idea but I wish to understand) I create a new global scope for that window so I have two  independent &quot;global scopes&quot;? Also the new one lives for all the life of the app?<br>3) How can I create static variables and passing them between Alloy Windows?<br>Thanks for the attention.</p>
