			<h1>view.toImage() no longer showing children</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a function in my app that pulls an image from a secured server, places it in a view with several pieces of information, then uses the toImage() function to generate an image that I can safely post to Facebook without having to send a URL that contains access to the server. This was working fine for me in the past, but once I brought in Titanium SDK version 2.1.3 it stopped showing the contents of the view to photograph. Any ideas as to why this is no longer capturing the children within the view? Thanks for any replies.</p>

							<p>This was actually being caused by one thing and one thing only. For some reason setting layout to vertical on the view I was turning into an image cause it&#39;s contents to not show up. Once I commented out the layout line on the view, it worked perfectly.</p>
