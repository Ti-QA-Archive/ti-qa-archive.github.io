			<h1>App Store submission Export Compliance- what is the right approach</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am trying to submit my App to Apple- but I am asked about the export Compliance. Since we are using the Ti.Network functionality&#39;s with https it seems that we are required to request a export license from BIS. </p>
<p>I really need help on answering the following questions:</p>
<p>Does your product implement encryption algorithm(s) that is(are) proprietary or yet be accepted as standards by international standard bodies(IEEE, IETF, ITU, etc.)?</p>
<p>Does your product implement standard encryption algorithm(s) instead of or in addition to accessing or using the encryption in iOS?</p>
<p>Please could someone from Appcelerator provide the technical details of the implementation within Titanium (iPhone?). So that we can answer those questions correctly.</p>

							<p>Might I suggest you read Stephen Lombardo&#39;s article (2009) that addresses how to work through the process of getting yourself &quot;properly stamped&quot; by the US government.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;zetetic.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2009&#x2F;08&#x2F;03&#x2F;mass-market-encryption-commodity-classification-for-iphone-applications-in-8-easy-steps&#x2F;">Mass Market Encryption CCATS Commodity Classification for iPhone Applications in 8 Easy Steps</a></p>
<p>Then read Tige Phillip&#39;s article from earlier this year (2011) on what may have changed since Stephen posted his article:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tigelane.blogspot.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;01&#x2F;apple-itunes-export-restrictions-on.html">Apple iTunes export restrictions on apps</a></p>

							<p>Sending information over https is forcing the data to go through a secure channel from SSL, therefore it falls under the U.S. Government requirement for a CCATS review and approval</p>

										<p><p>Matt is correct in the statement that SSL (HTTPS) requires a CCATS review.  The ongoing argument has been whether individual apps, that utilizes the iOS built in SSL are required to have a SECOND set of CCATS documentation.  If the apps use code that is already covered by Apple&#39;s CCATs paperwork, then in theory, the app themselves should not require additional registration.  However, as the USG is terrible at making anything they touch very clear, the rule of thumb has been to register each application on its own to ensure one has covered their one back side.</p>
<p>As Apple now asks very specific questions regarding the type of encryption in your application, it appears as though they (apple) are leaning towards apps being covered by the OS&#39; broader registration.</p>
<p>Stefan&#39;s question still remains regarding his &#39;technical query&#39; rather than the &#39;legal answer(s)&#39; he received. (that includes my answer as well)</p>
<p>Always be vigilant in your development, always careful to cover your tail, lest you go to prison for a bad xor obfuscation shift. <em> </em>cough<em> </em></p>

							<p>Thanks for this- does this mean the &quot;implement encryption algorithm&quot; is an accepted standard by ITU?</p>
<p>And does the implementation of https mean that we are using the encryption in iOS or are we &quot; implement standard encryption algorithm(s) instead of or in addition to accessing or using the encryption in iOS&quot;</p>
<p>Sorry just trying to find out about the actual implementation with regards to Titanium.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
