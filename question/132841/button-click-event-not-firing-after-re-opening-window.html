			<h1>Button click event not firing after re-opening window</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>We&#39;re working on a mobile iPad app for IOS 5. The app is set up using navgroups. We have a main page which opens a secondary page when a button is clicked. The secondary page contains buttons for editing text (i.e. the user can type text which will appear on a label and the buttons allow the user to change font styles, size, color, etc… of the typed text). There is also an imageView in the window. Everything in the window functions normally when it is opened the first time. After clicking on the left nav button to go back to the main page and then subsequently re-clicking the button to navigate back to the secondary page, the button event listeners won&#39;t respond. The window looks normal but clicking the buttons this time does nothing. We have put Ti.API.info(&quot;I&#39;m here&quot;) printouts in the button click event listeners to see if they are being called and nothing is printed out in the log. Has anybody come across this problem yet or does anybody have any idea what&#39;s going on? My first thought is that the window isn&#39;t closing properly but I&#39;m not sure why it would cause a problem like this.</p>
<p>Problem occurs in both ipad simulator and ipad 2 device. No errors are shown. Titanium SDK version: 1.7.3. iPhone SDK version: 4.2.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help</p>

<p>can you share us some sample code that replicates the issue so that we can help you the best.</p>

							<div><p>Hmmm…I tried to make a simplified version of our code to post on here but I couldn&#39;t get it to replicate the problem. I&#39;d rather not post my full code on here and it wouldn&#39;t really be practical to ask someone to look through it all. I guess I will continue to debug and update my findings as I go along. Thanks.</p>

							<div><p>Ok. I have finally figured out what was causing the problem (though I&#39;m still not sure why). The problem was with the zIndex property on the buttons. When I removed the zIndex property, the code started functioning normally. Here is some sample code to illustrate. </p>
<p>app.js</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">//first <span class="hljs-keyword">window</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> nav <span class="hljs-keyword">group</span>
var win = Titanium.UI.createWindow({  
    title:<span class="hljs-string">'win'</span>
});

var navGroup = Titanium.UI.iPhone.createNavigationGroup({
    window: win
});

//second <span class="hljs-keyword">window</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> open
var win2 = Titanium.UI.createWindow({  
    title:<span class="hljs-string">'win2'</span>,
    url: <span class="hljs-string">'win2.js'</span>,
    backgroundColor: <span class="hljs-string">'gray'</span>
});


//button <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> open second <span class="hljs-keyword">window</span>
var win2Button = Ti.UI.createButton({
    title: <span class="hljs-string">'open win2 button'</span>,  
    width: <span class="hljs-number">200</span>,
    height: <span class="hljs-number">60</span>
});

win.add(win2Button);

var main = Ti.UI.createWindow({orientationModes: [Ti.UI.PORTRAIT, Ti.UI.UPSIDE_PORTRAIT]});
main.add(navGroup);
main.open();

win2Button.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(event){    
navGroup.open(win2, {animated:true});
win2.navGroup = navGroup;
});
</code></pre><p>win2.js</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> win = Titanium.UI.currentWindow;
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> navGroup = win.navGroup;

<span class="hljs-comment">//this is the button that causes problems</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> myButton = Ti.UI.createButton({ 
    width: <span class="hljs-string">'20%'</span>, 
    height: <span class="hljs-number">60</span>,  
    zIndex: <span class="hljs-number">100</span>,  <span class="hljs-comment">//this line causes problems. if deleted, code works fine</span>
    title: <span class="hljs-string">'My Button'</span>
});

win.add(myButton);

<span class="hljs-comment">//this is only called when the win2 is opened once, not any subsequent openings of win2</span>
myButton.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span></span>{
    Ti.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">'im here'</span>);
});
</code></pre><p>So to reiterate, when the button in the first window is clicked, win2 opens fine and the button in win2 works properly. Clicking the left nav button to go back to the first window works as it should also. Then clicking the button on the first window again to go back to win2 works properly. However, clicking the button in win2 the second time when the window is reopened will NOT work. Deleting the zIndex property of myButton in win2 solved the problem for me. Not sure if this is a bug or something I&#39;m doing wrong but at least it works now.</p>

							<div><p>I will try it on 1.8 when I get home later. I originally did no use 1.8 because it was giving me problems when loading my apps on the apple devices. That is, the code runs fine on the simulator but when I load the code on the device (iPad 2), the splash screen comes up and then the app suddenly closes. I have seen others that have experienced the same issue but I did not see if there was a solution yet.</p>

							<div><p>I ran the sample code using sdk ver. 1.8.1 and the bug appears to be fixed. Like I said though, I can only test it in the simulator as I cannot get code written using the 1.8 sdk to run on the device.</p>
