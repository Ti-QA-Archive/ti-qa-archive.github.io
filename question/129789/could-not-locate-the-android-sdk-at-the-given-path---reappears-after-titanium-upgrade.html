			<h1>Could not locate the android sdk at the given path - Reappears after Titanium upgrade</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>like many developers, i was stuck (some weeks ago) with that error when trying to configure my Titanium studio freshly installed (1.0.6 with SDK 1.7)</p>
<p>I could fix it after hours of browsing the forums ; i think only the &lt;android-7&gt; in android sdk &quot;tools&quot; folder was missing for Titanium.</p>
<p>Yesterday came the last Titanium update (1.8.0 with Studio update as well), and now my Android SDK configuration (in studio) is not working anymore.</p>
<p>Could you please provide more detailed information about what Titanium Studio is checking &#x2F; expecting &#x2F; so we could verify those points ?</p>
<p>If not, is the previous version (for Titanium Studio, 1.0.6) still available for download anywhere ? I would prefer to downgrade my installation rather that loosing time not developing my App … (more than 1 day lost by now).</p>
<p>I will keep you aware of my progress (if it works again :) )</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jerome</p>

							<p>API level 8 is the minimum SDK requirement for 1.8 - downloading that version with the Android SDK manager should be all that you need to do.</p>

										<p><p>I understand and i have seen that in prerequisites (thanks for trying to help)<br>Actually, i had the following API levels installed : 3 &#x2F; 4 &#x2F; 7 &#x2F; 8 &#x2F; 10.</p>
<p>I am still really interested in the checks Titanium is doing : a specific executable ? jar ? ability to run adb ? android.bat ?</p>

							<p>OK, after removing Titanium Mobile, full reinstalling, problem remains the same.<br>I notice the link on the Titanium Dashboard, for installing Android SDK Tool.</p>
<p>One can download and install a dedicate version of Android Tools &#x2F; Platform, in a new folder.<br>Which i do. And it is now OK.</p>
<p>Hints : </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Probably an upgrade of Android SDK Tools and Platform is not compatible with Titanium Mobile (or the opposite :) ).</p>
</li>
<li><p>My current working version contains SDK Tools Rev 15, SDK Platform-tools Rev 10, SDK API level 7 and 8.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do not upgrade to some higher version of SDK Tools and Platform-tools</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I am happy again now.</p>
<p>Happy Christmas !</p>
<p>J.</p>
