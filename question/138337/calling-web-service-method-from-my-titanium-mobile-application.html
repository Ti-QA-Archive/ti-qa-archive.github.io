			<h1>Calling web service method, from my Titanium Mobile application</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all.</p>
<p>Im trying to do a very simple task. (at least i think it is very simple)<br>I have created a normal asp.net webservice using Visual Studio on a windows machine.<br>The webserice contains 1 method which takes an integer as argument, and returns the number multiplied by itself. Looking like this:</p>
<p>[WebMethod]<br>public int Multiply(int number)<br>{<br>    return number * number;<br>}</p>
<p>I have also created a simple iPhone&#x2F;Android application using Titanium Mobile. For this purpose im using a mac running OS X version 10.7.3.<br>The Titanium SDK is version 1.8.2.</p>
<p>Now all i want to do is to call this &quot;Multiply&quot; function from my app.</p>
<p>So my questions is:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Can i take my webservice and copy it to my Mac computer and having it running locally on this (similarly to IIS on windows) ? Or does it need to be available online on the web in order for me to contact it ?</p>
</li>
<li><p>How do I invoke this webservice method from my Titanium app?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope someone out there can help me, as I am quite new to this (obviously)</p>
<p>Regards,<br>Martin</p>

							<p>It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve messed with ASP.NET web services, but it looks like there are some techniques you can use to access them from client-side Javascript.  See <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;weblogs.asp.net&#x2F;jalpeshpvadgama&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2010&#x2F;08&#x2F;29&#x2F;calling-an-asp-net-web-service-from-jquery.aspx">this example</a> and <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;encosia.com&#x2F;using-jquery-to-consume-aspnet-json-web-services&#x2F;">this one</a>.</p>
<p>It looks like you have to set some attributes of your web service to allow JSON-serialized data (I think the default for ASP.NET web services is SOAP), and there are some special considerations in the way you make the HTTP requests.  Those articles have a lot of detail.</p>
<p>Note that if you&#39;re not using jquery in your app (and I don&#39;t recommend bringing such a large framework into your Titanium app), you&#39;ll have to use the HTTPClient to make the requests (as opposed to the $.ajax method used in the examples).</p>
<p>As to running your web service on your Mac, the easiest thing to do would be to run a virtual windows machine with IIS.  I can&#39;t imagine how you would possibly get .NET web service code to run on a Mac, unless you used some sort of Mono-based solution, which sounds like going down a rabbit hole.</p>
<p>Good luck – you&#39;ll have a fair amount of learning to do, but once you get the pieces in place to make the first web service call, everything will be easier from that point forward.</p>
