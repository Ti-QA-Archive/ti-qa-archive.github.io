			<h1>Re-Installing app issues with emulator and SD Card in use</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I lost all my afternoon trying to figure out what was happening with my code since nothing seems to do almost any effect. It turns out that the code was only deployed if when i restart the android emulator. You can imagine how much time i lost.</p>
<p>My sd card seems to be in use right from the start but my app is still installed…<br>and I get this message</p>
<p>[ERROR] Timed out waiting for SDCard to become available (60s)</p>
<p>So I found this solution but I dont think it fixes anything<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;131668&#x2F;timed-out-waiting-for-sdcard-to-become-available-60s#244599</p>
<p>I&#39;ve checked the task manager found an &#39;adb.exe&#39; and tried to terminate it before relaunching but i still get the same error.</p>
<p>I&#39;m using alloy&#39;s version 3.1.0</p>
<p>Any ideas on what might be causing it or how to solve it?</p>

							<p>Hello,</p>
<p>for some reason you have an issue with permissions on the file that handles your simulated SD card. Please remove the Emulator and let Titanium create another automatically for you.  </p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro</p>

										<p><p>So I&#39;m still not sure what happen, but I&#39;ve deleted all the emulators (not only the one i was using) and i&#39;ve restarted the pc. Everything seems normal for now, but just to make sure I&#39;ll leave the topic open for some time so I can provide more feedback in the event the problem repeats again.</p>
