							<div><p>Hi Tony,<br>Thanks for your reply and Alloy is quite amazing!! I love it.</p>
<p>Sadly my app on 1.4, looked very weird and my app is very complicated, so those might be edge cases or animations &#x2F; views within views or me not knowing how to properly set up Alloy 1.4.<br>Also I&#39;m using about 6 other plugins so those also might have issues with the Alloy 1.4.<br>This is why I didn&#39;t want to write any specific issue. What was visible that images didn&#39;t showed on the background of my main view.</p>
<p>Basically I am after Backbone 1.0+ so my collections will be faster.<br>My issues is that table view binded to a collection works very slow, especially if when the request for new items had returned from server.</p>
<p>I was hoping that newer Backbone (smart set from fetch calls ) will improve this significantly.<br>Any tips how to speed up such bind &#x2F; table view as it looks and feels very bad and I really want to use the bind and not manage this myself.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Some point in the future.</p>
<p>If that seems vague it is meant to be.  There are no public road maps for upcoming versions.  This is less about not wanting to be transparent and more about the complexities of making changes, updating features, removing bugs and managing all the parts that make up Titanium.</p>
<p>So in short there are no firm public dates, there are internal dates they aim for (I am not privy to these and if I was would not be able to share them) but as I say other factors affect things all the time.</p>

							<p>Long story short, no we don&#39;t have proposed release date at this point. The master is <em>always</em> semi-stable though, so if you are seeing issues with it, please report them with <strong>details</strong>. Also, just to help troubleshooting, don&#39;t lump together things as Alloy 1.4.0 bugs if they could perhaps be Titanium bugs (like if you updated Titanium and Alloy at the same time).</p>
