			<p>Hi, in the Titanium.UI.iOS.createNavigationWindow docs, I found this kind of window is not meant to be added to other windows. That&#39;s ok, but I found the Facebook iPhone app does a very strange thing: to reach the chat window, it moves the entire navigation group to the left and displays (uncovers) a window that apparently is under the navigationWindow. How they do this thing? Can Titanium do the same?</p>

										<p><p>Problem is: I don&#39;t understand how they did. In my app the NavigationWindow is the one ApplicationWindow calls when the app runs. How I create the second top level window?</p>

										<p><p>open the Nav window (ensure its zIndex = 1) and then in either its&#39; <code>open</code> event, or immediately after in code,  open your Window (zIndex=0), now attach a behaviour to the navwindow to slide it left on tocuhmove</p>

										<p><p>I tried this before posting and after your comment: this doesn&#39;t work. On Nav &#39;postlayout&#39; I open a generic window with a zIndex=50, while the Nav is 100. The newly opened generic window completely covers the nav, ignoring the zIndex.</p>

										<p><p>To achieve the slide menu functionality,looks same on both Android &amp; iOS, i implemented a manual code<br>using a single window &amp; views to control everything as i tried many ways to include NavigationWindow<br>&amp; one or more windows in Alloy,which did not work at all..<br>The problem was exactly the same as you stated in your first comment.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Prashant, in the meantime (I don&#39;t use Alloy!) I found two ways to achieve a similar result. </p>
<p>FIRST ONE: I created a &quot;middle&quot; Window the app launchs when it loads. When this window loads its content it&#39;s invisible: this same window opens the navigation window. IF I open the nav this way, if I use simply open() the nav opens but I can&#39;t see it (I know it opens because I can read the Ti.App.info coming from there). If I open this window with modal:true it opens correctly. </p>
<p>SECOND ONE: directly in the app.js I open two top level windows, one containing tha nav, the other one the &quot;popunder&quot; (I don&#39;t know how to call it). This works too, even if I &quot;like&quot; (!) the first solution more (if it would work without modal:true, it would be better).</p>
<p>Maybe there&#39;s a better way to do anything…</p>

										<p><p>@London Moe, if you want then i can send you the snapshots of how i implemented this feature.<br>It includes two menus on both left &amp; right side.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Moe, i think it will be useful to write the manual code to perform the NavigationWindow task as NavWindow is nothing but a connection between the two windows &amp; i think that we can achieve this functionality manually.<br>Moreover, if we do this task manually then it will be same on Android platform too..complete cross-platform :)</p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t use neither Android nor Alloy: nothing against Alloy, but I&#39;ve no time to learn it and (last but not least) it forces you to think the app better. So, why I can&#39;t use it? Because I create apps in a fast changing scenario, where they change entire features any 5 minutes (too chaotic to program it with Alloy)</p>

										<p><p>@London, be cautious about using the postlayout event as this event can go in an infinite loop if anything changes the content of &quot;popunder&quot; window dynamically.<br>e.g. displaying images coming from webservices etc.</p>
