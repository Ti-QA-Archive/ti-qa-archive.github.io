			<h1>Android webview crashes -- they&#39;re not your fault</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Just in case you were wondering about seemingly random but persistent crashes of your Android webview-based app, particularly when restarting, here is some potentially good news:  it&#39;s probably not you.</p>
<p>For instance, fire up KitchenSink (in this case on a Nexus S running 2.3.4, the app built with the 2.1 SDK&#x2F;Titanium 1.7), go to Base UI &gt; Views &gt; Web Views &gt; Local URL.  Hopefully it displays fine.</p>
<p>Then cause the app to close.  NOT by force-stopping it from Settings &gt; Applications[1], but by opening enough other applications to use up memory.  An Android engineer at Google explained to me that there&#39;s very little ceremony to that sort of close:  it&#39;s basically akin to kill -9.</p>
<p>Now reopen KitchenSink, and navigate back to Local URL.  If you&#39;re seeing what I&#39;m seeing, the app will crash.</p>
<p>The output from logcat includes multiple entries that look like:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">E/<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">TiBaseActivity</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-number">10988</span>)</span></span>: java<span class="hljs-class">.lang</span><span class="hljs-class">.RuntimeException</span>: Can<span class="hljs-string">'t marshal non-Parcelable objects across processes.</span>
</code></pre><p>and</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">E/TiUncaughtHandler(<span class="hljs-number">10988</span>): (main) [<span class="hljs-number">26</span>,<span class="hljs-number">9530</span>] Sending event: exception on thread: main msg:android.view.WindowManager$BadTokenException: Unable to add window -- token android.os.BinderProxy@<span class="hljs-number">40514928</span> is not valid; is your activity running?; Titanium <span class="hljs-number">1.7</span><span class="hljs-number">.0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">2011</span>/<span class="hljs-number">03</span>/<span class="hljs-number">31</span> <span class="hljs-number">12</span>:<span class="hljs-number">08</span>,<span class="hljs-number">6</span>cae16
E/TiUncaughtHandler(<span class="hljs-number">10988</span>): android.view.WindowManager$BadTokenException: Unable to add window -- token android.os.BinderProxy@<span class="hljs-number">40514928</span> is not valid; is your activity running?
</code></pre><p>Not to be impolite, but the response from that same Android engineer at Google when I sent him the adb bugreport and logcat output was: &quot;good grief; Ti is crapping its pants all over here&quot;.</p>
<p>So what does this mean?</p>
<p>It means that any Titanium-based application running on Android that gets auto-closed by the system (or closes for another reason, such as a crash) while a webview is open will crash (again) on restart.[2]</p>
<p>Has anyone else run into this, and managed to come up with a workaround?</p>
<p>KT</p>
<p>[1] Force Stop from Settings &gt; Applications seems to do a more thorough job of cleaning things up.  I&#39;m looking into how it differs at a system level from the memory-freeing close.</p>
<p>[2] I haven&#39;t investigated this thoroughly enough to say whether or not there are circumstances under which this is happening.  But this is the one that&#39;s affecting me, so that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been looking into.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s easy for those of us without first-hand, hands-on experience of the source code to be quickly critical of software, simply because it does not behave the way we would expect. Particularly if a certain bug exists that prevents us from easily completing our work, we can often make quick judgments, and assume that the core developers don&#39;t really know what they are doing.</p>
<p>In my experience though, with the countless packages I&#39;ve used over the years, there are sometimes reasons why the software behaves the way it does that can be rationally explained.</p>
<p>Hence, there is a solution that you can use to address the issue you&#39;ve described, which is explained <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Maintaining+a+Custom+AndroidManifest.xml#MaintainingaCustomAndroidManifest.xml-EnsuringAndroidshutsdownappscleanly">here</a>. Note that, as there are drawbacks to enabling it, its use is at the developer&#39;s discretion.</p>
<p>I hope this clarifies the situation.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, Paul.  I appreciate the measured response.  On the other hand, trust me that there&#39;s no quick judgment involved here, but instead weeks of (fruitless) debugging.</p>
<p>Are you able to replicate the crash as described?  And to fix it with the addition of android:alwaysRetainTaskState=&quot;true&quot;?  I can do the former, obviously – i.e., replicating the crash – but adding that parameter to a custom AndroidManifest.xml for KitchenSink doesn&#39;t fix the crash as described.</p>
<p>Thank you also for the explanation and link.  However, this is not a common experience with Android apps in general.  They tend to respond uniformly well to being killed by the system.  If Titanium is doing something architecturally that is not considered well-behaved by Android standards, then that&#39;s another issue entirely.  (And I&#39;m going to have to go with the opinion of the people who develop Android as to what the proper behavior should be.)  If there are known situations where, due to the way Titanium is architected, these problems are predictable and prevalent then it&#39;s not unreasonable to think that (a) perhaps the default behaviour should be the defensive, non-crashing one under those circumstances; or, better (b) that misbehaving aspect of Titanium should be re-architected&#x2F;refactored to work properly.</p>

										<p><p>KT, thank you for trying my suggestion, and for ticket <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC-57">TC-57</a> that you have raised. I will attempt to reproduce the issue on my systems and report back when I have had an opportunity to speak with the core devs about it.</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience.</p>

										<p><p>Anything new on this?  These are plaguing me left and right… I found this <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-3158">TIMOB-3158</a> and this <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-4357">TIMOB-4357</a> and both apply to me…  My app runs good on IOS so far but Titanium on Android is getting a huge black eye. I&#39;ve tried the above fix but no dice…</p>

							<p>Just to make sure you guys (Appcelerator) aren&#39;t going down the wrong path, what Google told me re: android:alwaysRetainTaskState was:  &quot;This manifest attribute has nothing to do with actual task shutdown.  It&#39;s just about a memory optimization and clearing task stacks back to their home state when they&#39;ve gone unused.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;d add this as a comment on JIRA but for the life of me I can&#39;t figure out how.</p>

							<p>As another interesting indicator, it&#39;s notable that the simple webview-and-textarea example I put together for <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;121264&#x2F;textarea--webview--hang">this bug</a> doesn&#39;t seem to exhibit this (or at least it seems that way in my testing).  So somewhere between what that example is doing and what Kitchensink is doing might be the problem.</p>
<p>At this point I&#39;m looking at whatever workaround I might stumble across.  Obviously one can&#39;t ship a professional application with this sort of flakiness on display.  If I find anything interesting, I&#39;ll update here since others are having this problem as well.</p>

										<p><p>Other things I&#39;ve learned:  Upon relaunching the splash screen behaves differently, as per <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC-107">this bug</a>.  Also, going back to the app after a period of inactivity sometimes unpredictably results in a white or black screen.  The latter in particular is hopefully somehow related to the above issue and can be fixed when (when!) that is, because otherwise it&#39;s yet another black mark on the professionalism of the app.</p>
