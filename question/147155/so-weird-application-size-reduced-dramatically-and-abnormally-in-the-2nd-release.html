			<h1>So weird: Application size reduced dramatically and abnormally in the 2nd release</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>This is the 2nd time I release my IOS application. My first release built with Ti 2.x had a size of 9.6MB, however the 2nd release built with Ti 3.0 has only 4.8MB (Distribution - Apple iTunes Store). </p>
<p>All looked fine in Titanium Studio, including coding, building, running in simulators and installing to the iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p>I even published the application successfully to App Store.</p>
<p>The Ad Hoc distribution is even smaller, but it can be installed into my iphone successfully.</p>
<p>It&#39;s now waiting for review, but I&#39;m afraid it can&#39;t work in the customer&#39;s device.</p>
<p>any suggestion to investigate this issue is welcomed.</p>
<p>and thank you in advance.</p>

							<p>Hi Xiong, </p>
<p>perhaps this is the reason for the smaller file.</p>
<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-11313">Studio : Ipa file size varies to a large extent in 3.0 build</a></p>
<p>&gt; comment from the ticket: <em>The size reduction is due to the fix of removing extra iphone folder from application package. These resources are already included into the top structure of the app.</em></p>
<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>Matthias</p>
