			<h1>Native javascript modules and supporting Obj-C methods</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Is it possible to write a javascript module - but also have methods in Obj-C?</p>
<p>For example, I&#39;d like to update <a href="jsOAuth">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bytespider.github.com&#x2F;jsOAuth&#x2F;</a> to use more of the titanium framework that I currently have it doing. Specifically I&#39;d like to write a HMAC_SHA1 method in Obj-C but be able to call that method from my existing javascript code.</p>
<p>Whilst I realise that I could:</p>
<ol>
<li>rewrite jsOAuth exclusively in Obj-C</li>
<li>leave it alone as it works</li>
</ol>
<p>I feel that there are advantages to this approach.<br>Firstly there are already OAuth libraries in Obj-C, I don&#39;t want to reinvent the wheel.<br>Secondly, I think there would be a performance boost by having the native crypto libraries in iOS to the hashing work.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

							<p>You can create your own native iOS module with the methods you need and call them from a javaScript module. This is possible, if this is what are you asking. But note that you can&#39;t mix both languages, you still need a native module done with Obj-C and compiled using the titanium build.py for modules and require it from titanium.</p>

<p>This I knew, loosely I wanted to mix and match to gain the benefits of both. If I have to I&#39;ll write each as separate modules, I&#39;d just rather not have dependencies on anything other than the core Titanium framework</p>

										<p><p>What you&#39;re asking for is basically a module. Your JavaScript is running in a JS runtime, and is never translated into Obj-C (if I&#39;m not completely mistaken, I think the JS is encoded on distribution, but it&#39;s still running through the runtime), so it wouldn&#39;t make any sense to be able to mix them.</p>

										<p><p>Marcus: You may have gotten confused in my intent. Currently Titanium does&#39;nt support much in the way of cryptography, at least in the community version. Whilst I have written some cryptography algorithms in javascript I think they will be slow in comparison to a Obj-C solution.</p>
<p>So I was proposing that rather than writing the crypto methods as one module in Obj-C and the library that uses them in javascript, which would create an ugly dependency, it would be better to bundle some Obj-C method along side my module that it could access via js.</p>
