			<h1>UTF-8 , unreadable characters in TableView.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I wanna read from XML file (fetch RSS feeds) &amp; display in a TableView</p>
<p>but when I tried it, it represented in unreadable character (as squares)</p>
<p>my app in arabic, so the squares represent the arabic character. </p>
<p>I tried these:</p>
<p>*I opened my JS files and switched from ASCII to UTF-8 encoding. I use UltraEdit for the conversion (File &gt; Conversion &gt; ASCII to UTF-8 Unicode Editing). but,nothing changed.</p>
<p>*(Titanium.Codec.CHARSET_UTF8) returned runtime Error (can not read property &quot;CHARSET_UTF8&quot; from undefined)</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>Thank you for reading. If you can help, it would be much appreciated.</p>

							<p>Nourah, did you try outputting any other Arabic text to the screen?</p>
<p>I&#39;m asking because I think the issue might be with the version of the emulator you&#39;re running, rather than your code. Remember that versions prior to 2.2 didn&#39;t even have an Arabic font in them.</p>
<p>I tried to run your code, and it showed up alright http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;q5iWU.jpg (this is as good as it would appear on a 2.2 emulator). The only change I did was to remove the &quot;strip_tags&quot; function because I wouldn&#39;t have been able to run the app without strip_tags.js.</p>
<p>So it&#39;s one or the other: either the emulator version, or the strip_tags function. I would also advice that you think about testing on an Android device with proper Arabic support. Sadly the emulators still aren&#39;t there in terms of Arabic support.</p>

<p>I have CyanogenMod 7 running on mine, that has great Arabic support. Assuming you&#39;re in Saudi, anything Jarir or STC sell most likely has proper Arabic support (except for the Galaxy S 2, I think). There are also plenty of 3rd party Arabization libraries with many online tutorials on how to install them (CE4Arab would have most of them).</p>

										<p><p>What version of Android are you targeting?</p>
<p>I would suggest you test directly on a device that you know supports arabic.</p>
