			<p>This is very very strage! I wrote a very simple app for Android (target 2.3.3). I use Windows 7 64bit. When i launch the app the first time it seems to work well but if I exit and relaunch it appears this message: &quot;Sorry! The application NAME APPLICATION has stopped unexpectedly. Please try again.&quot; So i try again and it works. After I exit another time and that error message appears again! And so on… Why?!? Thanks in advance.</p>

The missing information is critical to reproducing problems in a test environment and often indicates other factors that cause the undesirable outcome you are experiencing.</p>
