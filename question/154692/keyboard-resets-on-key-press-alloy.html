			<h1>Keyboard Resets on Key Press (Alloy)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a textfield. The keyboard comes up fine, but if the users switches to the alpha&#x2F;punc and presses a key then it switches back to default. This is very annoying. How can I make sure the keyboard stays in the last user state while on the same field?</p>

							<p>Found the issue…looks like someone else had the problem and found this to be the solution..</p>
<p>The issue appears to be that with every character you type, when it repaints the textField, it also refocuses it as well, causing it to revert to the initial alphabet mode. In order to stop this from refocusing, you need to fully define both the width AND the height of the textField. This stops it from &#39;resizing&#39; all the time(even when it&#39;s not) which stops it from having to repaint the entire component and thus stops it from refocusing.</p>

							<p>and using Alloy Framework.  If you create an alloy app and just one field. you can duplicate it pretty easily. So lets say you have an email address of test123@test.net after you press a 1 2 or 3 you have to change the keyboard back to alpha&#x2F;punc.</p>

										<p><p>ok. Let me try to explain this better. When your on a field and you press the .?123 key on the keyboard it will switch the keyboard to alpha&#x2F;punc. After you hit a key it switches back to the default keyboard. So if you have to enter a few numbers in sequence you have to keep tapping the .?123 key to switch to the numeric&#x2F;punc format.</p>

										<p><p>Yep - I get you. This isn&#39;t happening to me on the app I just tested where I declare my textField like this;-</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var postCodeTextField  = Ti.UI.createTextField({
                <span class="hljs-string">autocapitalization :</span> Ti.UI.TEXT_AUTOCAPITALIZATION_ALL,
                <span class="hljs-string">hintText :</span> <span class="hljs-string">'Postcode or Place Name'</span>,
                <span class="hljs-string">height :</span> <span class="hljs-number">24</span>,
                <span class="hljs-string">width :</span> <span class="hljs-string">'80%'</span>,
                <span class="hljs-string">color :</span> <span class="hljs-string">'#FFEC8B'</span>,
                <span class="hljs-string">backgroundColor :</span> ui.theme.backgroundColor
            });
</code></pre><p>I&#39;m just wondering if you add this to your view manually instead of by Alloy, does the same problem occur ?  That way we can identify if its an Alloy issue or something else ?</p>
