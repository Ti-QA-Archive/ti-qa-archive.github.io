			<p>Running desktop SDK RC1.2.6d on Lion.</p>
<p>Trying to upload a file with HTTPClient.sendFile.</p>
<p>First problem, the onsendstream never fires. Since I&#39;m trying to implement a progress bar for the upload this would be very useful but it never fires.</p>
<p>Second, my php script on the server, &quot;handleUpload.php&quot; receives data but I don&#39;t know what to do with it. If I do a print_r of the $_REQUEST variable I get an array (as expected) but <em>everything</em> (including the array keys) is gobbledygook (I assume it&#39;s binary). So how do I handle that uploaded file in the PHP (or other language) script on the server?</p>
<p>Thanks, Mike</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, Dan. The example in the bug report didn&#39;t fire the onsendstream event either. </p>
<p>I tried your suggested method with the request header. It sends the data and the file and completes in about half the time my prior method took so that&#39;s nice.</p>
<p><strong>But</strong> the onsendstream event still doesn&#39;t fire.</p>

<p>See my note in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIDESK-696">TIDESK-696</a> as I see there is a throttle on the events to limit CPU cycles. It is currently set to 250k and I just built a version that is set for 8k. I need to test it first but will be glad to upload it so you guys can try it if you like.</p>

							<p>OK. But the file I&#39;m uploading is over 250k. I even went to one that was 1.5M and the event still never fired. I&#39;ll try RC6e and post a follow up.</p>

<p>Even after changing that and building an SDK, I&#39;m still not getting the events fired. Still looking at it, amongst a mountain of other tasks…</p>

										<p><p>Dan, Mike,</p>
<p>I think I just figured out what the problem was, and currently I am leaving this at 250k for events, since it sends an event also after it is done.</p>
<p>I&#39;d like you both to test this if possible, but have named it so that we don&#39;t confuse this with the builds currently out. RC6d is on the packaging server, and before I go to the trouble of building and releasing an RC6e, I&#39;d like for you guys to test this, and also to see what else I can get into RC6e before I build and upload those to the servers.</p>
<p>What I found was a condition above the call to RequestDataSent, inside of the progress callback for curl. By moving that call above the condition, I do get the notifications. As I said, for the time being I&#39;m leaving it at 250k, and can change that later if this doesn&#39;t work, or we could add a value that could be set by the caller…but before I do any of that, let&#39;s test this out first.</p>

										<p><p>Cool. Yeah, I think 250kb is fine. Anything less than that is usually going to upload quick enough that intermittent updates aren&#39;t really necessary.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll try this test now &amp; get back to you shortly.</p>

										<p><p>Worked like a charm. You rock.</p>
<p>Will you be able to get this modification onto the packaging server soon? The app I&#39;m working on is in beta now &amp; if I were able to put a functional progress bar into the app for file uploads before public release the client would be very happy.</p>

<p>I can get it on the servers soon, but need at least a couple days as I&#39;ll need to package all of them back up again. I&#39;m trying to get the updatemanager working, a few have complained about that.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll go ahead and push this up to github. Good that it works.</p>

<p>Yes it will, but was having some problems cherry-picking it earlier. I will apply this to the v1.2-windows branch if need be, but 1.2.0.RC5e will include this.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll post when I get it on both cloud and packaging servers. I&#39;ll try and do that later tonight, possibly, but still need to get linux and win32 built.</p>
