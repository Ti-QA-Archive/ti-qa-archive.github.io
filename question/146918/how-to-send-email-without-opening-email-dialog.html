			<h1>How to Send email without opening Email dialog,</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi Everyone,<br>I am creating an app in which I am creating objects in ACS. My requirement is that I want to send an alert email when user0<br>has successfully created the object. Using the  <code>Ti.UI.EmailDialog();</code> method I can do this but the user will have to send the message by himself first dailog will open and then after pressing send button he would be able to send which is exactly not what I want. I want that email must be sent automatically when I press the button to create the object in ACS. My english is little bad. I have tried to explain.<br>Thanks in Advance.  Hope you understand my problem.</p>

							<p>There is no way to automatically send an email from the device itself. If you want to send email confirmation, you&#39;ll have to send a request off to a server and handle the email messages yourself.</p>

										<p><p>Just like you would do on a website. Someone signs up and you send an email. You would need to build a small system which you could send some parameters to which would send an email.</p>

							<p>No, You can&#39;t send email directly, email can only be send if email dialog is open and when user press Send button. There is no other option to send email.</p>
<p>Other option is to send the email to your server and from there you can send email to user.</p>
