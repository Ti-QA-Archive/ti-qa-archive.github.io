			<h1>Titanium SDK 3.1.2 very slow - Any tips?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I just updated to the latest SDK 3.1.2.  None of my apps would work because of a bug in which some files were moved from the developer tools folder.  This was apparently fixed in this version so I had to up my apps to use the latest SDK and fix all the compatibility issues, such as Facebook.  Finally I have my app running again, but it takes 15 minutes to compile every time I make a change.  Needless to say it is not usage in this current state.  Does anyone have any tips how I can set this up so that is compiles faster?</p>

							<div><p>Another thing that is driving me nuts about this is that the emulator now opens in a command window.  It used to debug to the Studio&#39;s window and I could read the text much better.  So if something was making this slow that I could fix on my own… I would never know.</p>
