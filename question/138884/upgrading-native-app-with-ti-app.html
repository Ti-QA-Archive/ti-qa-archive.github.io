			<h1>Upgrading Native App With Ti App</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>We have one Native ipad app already on apple app store . But we decided to obsolete Native app and development the same in Titanium to make ti cross platform. Now we are ready with our Ti app. Need to upgrade the Native app with TI app. Though, we dont have any thing specific which we want to retain during the upgrade procedure. The new Ti app in itself will have all the things to run it independently. There is no native setting or configuration we want to keep. The Ti app will installed perfectly on new device but we want to know how can we delete the old Native app? Is Ti expose any such method to clean it up the old native app directory? Is there any impact on new migration? What could be best way to cleanly migration from Native to Ti without affecting or manual intervening the end users.</p>

							<p>If you upload this app as a newer version in iTunes connect, with the same app bundle id (your com.yourcompany.yourapp string), the app will replace automatically the old one. </p>
<p>i.e. Your native app was version 1.0, name the Titanium version as 1.1 and upload to appstore.</p>
