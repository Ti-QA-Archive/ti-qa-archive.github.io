			<p>I am trying to submit my app to the app store but I am receiving this error: This bundle is invalid. The key CFBundleVersion in the Info.plist file must contain a higher version than that of the previously uploaded version.</p>
<p>This app has been submitted and has worked fine before. I have set up version 1.3 in my app and also itunesconnect since the previous version was 1.2.</p>

										<p><p>I can&#39;t believe they are not fixing this ASAP. I have a app update that I can not release because it always defaults to 1.0. I can&#39;t even manually find a way to edit the file since the build rewrites everything each time.</p>

							<p>For people who still got this problem.</p>
<p>1- When you build your app inside the build-&gt;iphone directory copy the generated info.plist file to the root project directory(where Tiapp.xml resides).</p>
<p>2- Edit the info.plist that you just copied into the root directory, simply manually change the value for CFBundleShortVersionString(to whatever version you need).</p>
<p>3- Save the file (the one in the root directory) and rebuild your project, the auto-generated info.plist will take the data in your amended file.</p>

										<p><p>As far as I can tell the problem is fixed in 2.1.1. The problem I was having involved a more complex issue. When you change the version in the Tiapp editor it makes the build and bundle match what you have there. If you are updating an existing app, view binary details of that app in iTunes Connect. Whatever the bundle version  is there, your updated app must be higher. So you must change your version in tiapp editor to be higher. If you are unsure what it is actually outputting, open the info.plist in the build folder that is created upon building your app and see what the string says there.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ll have to look when I get to work tomorrow, but in iTunes connect if your bundle version is 10301 then the only way to submit, WITHOUT making any custom edits, is to change your version in the Tiapp editor to be 10302 or higher. 20107 should work. However if you really want to keep 2.1.7 then you will need to edit the info.plist using a custom method which I am unfamilar with.  Remember that the version displayed to the end user in the app store is whatever you type in when adding a version in iTunes connect. No one will ever see what you type in in Ti Studio. To make things easy I suggest you just change your version in Ti Studio to 20107 NOT 2.1.7 and be done with it.</p>

										<p><p>You can&#39;t change them separately. They are one in the same in Ti.  One easy way, if you don&#39;t want to do strange custom info.plist files is open the project in Xcode and change it in Xcode and build your archive there.  Like I said, I am not familiar with creating a custom info.plist file, but some say you can copy the one in your build folder and moving it to the root after editing and and Ti should use that, but I can&#39;t comment cause I don&#39;t know.  I suggest you just open the built project in Xcode and then package to archive format for app store submission at that point. In Xcode you can edit build and version independently.</p>

										<p><p>What if his clients wants it submitted correctly?  Even if the end user won&#39;t know, it can complicate tracking, paperwork, testing etc.  he&#39;s working for a client… They may not understand or care what Ti can or can&#39;t do. They may want the binary submitted correctly.  I think the easiest way is to archive through code where you can change the version and bundle separately.</p>

										<p><p>Lee, &#39;correctly&#39; is relative.  The only reason they have a 10000+ build number is because thats the arbitrary number that was created by PhoneGap or whatever system they used before.</p>

										<p><p>I know and agree, but you aren&#39;t giving him a solution to his question which is how to change the bundle&#x2F;version. Your workaround does work from an end users perspective, but if I were managing a project in SVN and tracking things such as builds it would be crappy to go from 1.3.1 to 20107 even if it&#39;s only on paper.  His clients may also not understand or care about his excuse.  Just trying to be helpful. Ti really needs to allow the ability to edit all fields in the plist even if they are redundant&#x2F;arbitrary. If you can change it in Xcode you should be able to change it in studio.</p>

										<p><p>While we sit around discussing it, he hasn&#39;t released, the JIRA ticket suggesting the two keys be unbound from each other, and a field be put into the TIAPP.xml editor to allow a separate build has not moved forward.</p>
<p>Check Github, you will find its my code that got us able to actually submit to Apple after the change over, and my suggestions for separate&#x2F;extended build numbers rejected.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t have skin in this game (or money on the table for that matter).</p>
<p>He and his client are out because they can&#39;t agree on a number (ironically, not $$). Client management is an entirely different discussion that requires stiff drinks and baseball bats. <em>grin</em></p>

										<p><p>If you want a quick and dirty fix, in Tiapp.xml, make your version 20107.</p>
<p>In the TiApp.py file of the SDK version you are currently using, around line 460 or so, change:</p>
<p><code>app_version_ = CFBundleShortVersionString.split(&amp;#39;.&amp;#39;)</code></p>

										<p><p>I didn&#39;t see only around 45 lines in tiapp.xml which is inside 1. <code>\mobilesdk\win32\2.1.1.GA\all</code> 2. <code>\mobilesdk\win32\2.1.1.GA</code></p>
<p>Are you on Windows? How do you have a win32 directory on your mac install?</p>
<p>I gave you a solution that I tested here.</p>
<p>In your tiapp.xml, make the version the 5 char long integer.  Make the changes to tiapp.py ni 21.1.GA,  build out your iOS build and the results will match what you asked for.</p>
<p>This is my last post on the subject, I&#39;m unsubscribing from the thread.</p>

							<p>Having a similar issue though different. I am building a 2.0 version of my app. Currently my app, in the app store, is 1.0.xx. The info.plist is updating correctly, it reads 2.0.0 for the Bundle version however I am still getting the error.</p>

										<p><p>What also may help is that my previous version of the app was built using PhoneGap. However, it&#39;s a version error so that shouldn&#39;t make a difference.</p>
