			<h1>in-app Purchase state changed, no do something</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am working with the in-app purchasing with Titanium 1.7.3 and Android.  I have everything working as far as the in-app products being published and merchant accounts and everything.  My question is, if I want to say download a file from a remote server once an in-app product is bought, where do I put it.  Below is a sample of my code.  I put it in the event listener for:</p>
<p>Ti.InAppBilling.PURCHASE_STATE_CHANGED_EVENT</p>
<p>When an in-app product is purchased, it returns &quot;0&quot;.  So I figured that once the purchaseState has changed to &quot;0&quot;, I should go ahead and download my file.  My code is not downloading the file.  Any ideas?  I have no problems downloading files from a remote server.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Ti.InAppBilling.addEventListener(Ti.InAppBilling.PURCHASE_STATE_CHANGED_EVENT, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(e.signedData != <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>) {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> response = Titanium.JSON.parse(e.signedData);
        Ti.InAppBilling.confirmNotifications({
            notificationIds:[response.orders[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>].notificationId]
        });

        <span class="hljs-comment">// 0 means the purchase was successful</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> purchase_success = [response.orders[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>].purchaseState];
alert(<span class="hljs-string">'XXX =='</span> + purchase_success);
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> ( <span class="hljs-string">'0'</span> == purchase_success ) {            
            download_file();                    
        }
    }
});

							<div><p>Put in some <code>Ti.API.log()</code> to see where the code is stopping. Is the download_file() function executed at all? If the error is in the download_file() function, you&#39;ll gonna have to post it.</p>

							<div><p>Hey Sindre, thanks for the reply. I am running this on the device only because the emulator cannot run certain functions I am doing.  When I run the sample code from the ti.inappbilling example on my device, at this point where I have my alert is where I get the value &quot;0&quot; returned (meaning the purchase went through).  So I figured this is the appropriate spot.  When I use this exact same code and actually buy something from the market, it does not even hit my alert.  One thing I should mention is the email account I am testing this with is the same email I have as a test account email through https:&#x2F;&#x2F;market.android.com&#x2F;publish&#x2F;editProfile.  Not sure if this is causing it to stop either.</p>
<p>I was wondering if anyone is even using in-app purchasing in their apps.  I know the Android market has been having issues like crazy finding in-app products.</p>
