							<p>Hi</p>
<p>It is entirely possible to create this and be pixel perfect and without using a series of images (sorry Rainer).</p>
<p>The problem though is it is a little hard to explain and it is all about layers and rectangles - seriously.</p>
<ul>
<li>Layer 1, background, image of the colour gradient circle</li>
<li>Layer 2, rectangle same height and 50% of layer 1 that covers the left hand side of the image, change the anchorpoint to 1, 0.5, image is the uncovers shaded white empty view</li>
<li>Layer 3, rectangle same height and 50% of layer 1 that covers the right hand side of the image, change the anchorpoint to 0, 0.5, image is the uncovers shaded white empty view</li>
<li>Layer 4, rectangle same height and 50% of layer 1 that covers the right hand side of the image, change the anchorpoint to 0, 0.5, image is the right side of the colour gradient circle</li>
</ul>
<p>Initially ;</p>
<ul>
<li>Layer 1 = visible, never moves</li>
<li>Layer 2 = visible, never moves</li>
<li>Layer 3 = visible, moves</li>
<li>Layer 4 = hidden, never moves</li>
</ul>
<p>The process;</p>
<ul>
<li>Rotate Layer 3 from 0 to 360 degrees representing 0 to 100 percent.</li>
<li>at 180 degress set Layer 2 = hidden, layer 4 = visible</li>
</ul>
<p>The logic;</p>
<p>The layers act as masks that cover the image as it rotates, when the percentage gets to 50% you swap which masks are shown to manage the correct reveal.</p>
<p>You can add the handle as another layer on top of the others.</p>
<p>Using this technique you can have very smooth rotations and very precise positions, but it may take some time to understand the logic.</p>

										<p><p>The easiest way to understand it is to take a square sheet of paper and cut it in half, place both sheets of paper on a surface so they look like the original square of paper.</p>
<p>Make a mark in the middle right of the left side and the middle left of the right side, you should have two marks that touch each other in the centre of the two pieces of paper.</p>
<p>Now rotating the right half clockwise whilst keeping the two marks touching, you slowly start revealing the surface you placed the two sheets on, you should notice that reveal looks like a pie slice that get bigger.</p>
<p>As you continue to rotate the right side (leaving the left side static) you will fin one covers the other.  This is why you then have the other masks hide and reveal so they can show fake versions of the background so the right top right edge of the rotating section is masked off and does not cover the background.</p>
<p>As I said complicated to get your head round first time - but try it with paper and you will see exactly how it comes together.</p>
<p>Gives great visual results.</p>

							<p>OK, I&#39;ve updated Ronnie Swietek&#39;s awesome code to support Android -</p>
<p>A) No usage of AnchorPoint (so it&#39;ll work seamlessly on Android, even on the buggy Titanium SDK version that broke Android&#39;s AnchorPoint support).</p>
<p>B) Better usage of borderRadius - on my Nexus 5, with an xxhdpi resolution, the views where not shaped out as circles (but as rectangles with round corners) - so I&#39;ve used <code>Titanium.Platform.displayCaps.logicalDensityFactor</code> for scaling it up properly.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how you came up with this ingenious way of drawing the circular progress bar, but it made me cut pieces of papers (like you suggested) to figure out how this works :-D</p>

										<p><p>This is an awesome module apart from the fact that you cannot control the time it takes to animate.  If you setup a timer and send it updates every .5 second (or less to get it looking smooth) it actually takes more processor than the accepted answers method.</p>
<p>Having said that, if you don&#39;t want a smooth timed movement, this is perfect for circular progress meters.</p>

							<p>Alright so after a day or playing with this I managed to get a working example using Malcolm&#39;s idea. A couple things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have not tested on android</li>
<li>This is not animated as I did not need it for my needs. To make it animated, look at the second to last line in the function <code>layer3.transform = Ti.UI.create2DMatrix().rotate(angle);</code> You should be able to animate the rotation angle.</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>First, thank you Amaresh for unlocking the thread.</p>
<p>I wanted to post an update to why this code that I provided did not work on android. Apparently, for <code>iOS</code> you use anchor point on <code>views</code>. On android, you must use the anchor points in <code>Ti.UI.Animation</code></p>
<p>That&#39;s all fine, except anchor points no longer worked for android as of <code>Ti SDK 3.2.0</code>. I posted a bug report yesterday <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC-3854">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC-3854</a></p>
<p>I was able to get this code working on android in <code>Ti SDK 3.1.3</code>, but we obviously want it to work with the latest SDK. I guess all we can do is wait.</p>
