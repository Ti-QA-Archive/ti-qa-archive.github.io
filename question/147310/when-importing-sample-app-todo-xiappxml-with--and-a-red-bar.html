			<h1>when importing sample app: todo xiapp.xml with * and a red bar</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Strange thing happened: when i import the sample app: todo, the developer is changed into tlukasavage (…) and the tiapp.xml file appears in a red bar and an asterix appears next to the resources map and near master. I&#39;ve never seen this before and deleted titanium and installed it again, did&#39;nt help.<br>Is this a bug or a virus?</p>

										<p><p>well, if you aren&#39;t actually using git, doesn&#39;t mean much.</p>
<p>My guess is that when the default sample project was pulled from the github repo hosting it, your system sets up that project with the origin and details of the hosting site.  But since oyu dont have write access to that repo, really doesnt mean much.  I&#39;m also guessing that the tiapp.xml was changed automagically to match the sdk version on your system, which may not have been the version in the repo.</p>
