			<h1>512x512 iTunes icon - is this for marketing</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,<br>When uploading your icons&#x2F;screenshots to iTunesConnect.com -&gt; it asks:</p>
<p>&gt;A large version of your app icon that will be used on the App Store. It must be at least 72 DPI and a minimum of 512x512 pixels (it cannot be scaled up). It must be flat artwork without rounded corners.&gt;</p>
<p>That means I can submit something larger? What&#39;s meant by flat artwork?<br>Is this meant to be an oversize png file of your appicon or can it be something more useful with a bit more information?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>A PNG version of your app icon will suffice. You need to create a 512x512 version in Photoshop (or Pixelmator) and save as PNG or JPG. There are also several apps in the Mac App Store that let you drag&#x2F;drop a PSD file and it creates all of the required versions for you…</p>

							<p>Someone gave me a -1 vote? why is that?</p>
<p>Only Photoshop or Pixelmater? I used Art Text with GIMP - that should be OK, no?</p>

										<p><p>No I just assumed Photoshop or Pixelmator. Any graphics software will work. The -1 was probably because this information is available on Apple&#39;s website and could easily be found by searching :)</p>
