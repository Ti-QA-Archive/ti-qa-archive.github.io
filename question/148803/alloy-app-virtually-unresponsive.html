			<h1>Alloy App Virtually Unresponsive</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have an Alloy app that does everything extremely slowly.  Has anyone had similar issues with Titanium or Alloy?  Initially I thought it was just the simulator, but now on an iPad, amazingly, its even slower.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>I sent an HTTP request to a server….it takes literally 5-10 minutes to return.  And its not the server because I can get instantaneous responses from the server using other utilities.</li>
<li>Rendering passes are visible.  I can see labels go through multiple layouts of text, I can see images start with the default no-image icon, then resize, then load an image and then resize again.</li>
<li>Various groups of data load and present themselves one at a time when it should be no problem to load and display them all at once.</li>
</ul>
<p>Needless to say, Alloy is utterly useless for me unless I can resolve these massive performance issues.  I have no doubt that some of my processing is very intensive and is part of the problem, but there is no way it accounts for all of this.  I mean 10 minutes to return from an HTTP request?  Thats nuts.  Any help would be appreciated.</p>

							<div><p>@Tony - These may very well be general Titanium issues, I wanted to tag Alloy just in case.  I did not create a pure Titanium version of this system first….I went with Alloy to save time with the help of MVC.  So this is my first significant foray into both Titanium and Alloy.</p>
<p>I have made the same network request using the CocoaRestClient on my machine.  I have also accessed the same website in the iPad browser and confirmed that the same data transfers virtually instantaneously.  The server logs also appear to show response times of ~150ms.  So it seems very unlikely that the problem comes from outside Titanium.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not really sure what code to include.  The speed issue is happening everywhere.  I&#39;ll include the HTTP request in case that reveals anything.  Otherwise you&#39;ll have to let me know what kind of stuff you think you need to see.  Also, notice in the code below that I specify a timeout of 5 seconds.  Yet this request <em>literally</em> takes 5-10 minutes to return.  I thought maybe it was taking a long time to parse the JSON so I stuck that log statement as soon as the &quot;onload&quot; runs.  Turns out it takes that 5-10 minutes before ever parsing the JSON.  I&#39;m totally confused about this whole thing.</p>

							<div><p>After Ricardo&#39;s comment I checked for updates and sure enough there was a newer version of Alloy.  I updated and found that everything sped up dramatically.  BUT I do still have a couple issues that I would appreciate some input on:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>It seems that rendering passes of all text are visible.  Every Label starts by rendering itself vertically (like 1 letter per line) and then re-renders itself correctly.  Having this happen visibly with every Label makes the UI un-usable until they have all rendered correctly, and its really ugly and bothersome.  Has anyone witnessed this?</p>
</li>
<li><p>I have a vertical scrolling list (not an official table, just a ScrollView with a vertical layout).  Within that scrolling list I have a lot of information panels (aka rows).  So much so that the vertical scrolling is a bit laggy.  Is there any way to optimize this kind of thing in Titanium?  In Android I would create custom views for these panels so that Android could efficiently recycle them, but I&#39;m not aware of any similar functionality in Titanium.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In a more general sense, but similar to issue #2, is there a way to break up rendering so that Titanium&#x2F;Alloy doesn&#39;t try to push a whole set of data to the view in one frame?  It takes probably 10-20 seconds for my vertical scrolling list to render because of how much stuff is in it….if possible, I&#39;d like to break this up into phases so that it does not block IO.</p>
</li>
</ol>

							<div><p>First off, what TiSDK version and what Alloy version are you using?</p>
<p>What would be helpful is if you could reduce the problem down to the smallest possible collection of code that exhibits the problem. No extra pieces, just the bare minimum that can run and reproduce the problem. This will often unearth the root of the problem to yourself. From there we can test on our end to see if we get the same results. That would mean we&#39;ll need the URL and&#x2F;or dummy credentials to test. Connections with a remote server in particular are really hard to help with since there&#39;s so many variables involved, so the more you give us, the better we can help.</p>

							<div><p>OK, glad to hear the speed ups happened with the update.</p>
<p>With regards to #1, can you give us a small test case that exhibits that? I&#39;ve not seen it personally, but perhaps you have a case we can work with.</p>
<p>WRT to point 2 and 3, you are always going to have performance issues rendering a lot of rows all at once. Have you considered a &quot;load more rows&quot; type of interface? This is a common scrolling interface now and will make for a better user experience. In terms of reusing rows, Titanium will do this for you automatically, but only with the TableView if you use the &quot;className&quot; attribute on your rows. You may also be interested to follow the progress of the new ListView API that will be introduced in the future, which is meant to drastically improve the performance of list-type UIs: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;community&#x2F;Titanium+ListView+Specification">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;community&#x2F;Titanium+ListView+Specification</a></p>

							<div><p>@Tony - I think I am now up to date with Titanium.  I believe the SDK is 3.0.2 and Alloy is up to 1.0.  As I mentioned above, the network request issue seems to be resolved with that update.  Unfortunately, I think I have too much stuff going on to boil things down to a neatly packed function that presents the issue.  Its more the integration that seems to be the problem.</p>
<p>Are there common rendering optimizations used by titanium&#x2F;alloy developers?  Are there any pitfalls that I might want to avoid in terms of numbers of views, complexity of views, amount of data being bound at a given time?  Any mistakes that developers seem to make routinely that leads to poor performance?  I would really like Titanium to work out as a solution for building this app, but I&#39;ve got to be able to figure out how to get near-native quality performance out of this thing….and like I said, I can&#39;t really just post the whole app here.  If this were Android, I&#39;d know how to leverage the View APIs to get things running smoothly, but I don&#39;t have that deep of knowledge about what is available in Titanium&#x2F;Alloy nor how things are being done under the surface….</p>

							<div><p>I understand.  Here is a video which displays 2 things: vertical text rendering as well as the length of time it takes to render that long vertical list.</p>

<p>With regard to loading more rows on request - is there a way to instruct Alloy to do that with a Collection?  Maybe I have to build that logic into the View myself to only construct Views 1-X?  I&#39;m currently getting the data back from the server, parsing it out, and then throwing it in a Collection.</p>
<p>With regard to using className in the TableView, how does that connect to Alloy binding?  I have something like 5+ different &quot;types&quot; of &quot;rows&quot; that need to appear in the table:</p>
<ul>
<li>DocumentModel -&gt; DocumentRowView</li>
<li>VitalsModel -&gt; VitalsRowView</li>
<li>NotesModel -&gt; NotesRowView</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can that use-case be handled with the currently available hooks in terms of recycling?</p>

							<div><p>className is entirely separate from Alloy and its collections, it is specific to Titanium TableViews allowing them to leverage row recycling. It in no way impacts the collections per se. There is nothing built in to Alloy to explicitly handle &quot;paging&quot; of rows, but you can leverage the &quot;dataFilter&quot; attribute of the bound table to show only a certain subset of the collection&#39;s models. A todo sample can be found here that makes use of it in the index view and controller: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;alloy&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;test&#x2F;apps&#x2F;models&#x2F;todo">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;alloy&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;test&#x2F;apps&#x2F;models&#x2F;todo</a></p>

<p>Also you are not showing any table view code that I could see here so I think your problem has very lillte to do with Alloy and might be an architecture&#x2F;implementation issue.</p>

							<div><p>@Aaron, I don&#39;t know how I&#39;m supposed to show you this code.  I have a whole lot of code going from a web service to models to collections to subviews to the tableviews that contain them.  Am I supposed to paste my entire application?  How about instead you just point me to <em>any</em> resource that explains what not to do with Titanium and Alloy and TableViews.  It would be a lot easier to check against known &quot;architecture&#x2F;implementation issues&quot; than to migrate my entire application to this Q&amp;A feed.  The problem is, I can&#39;t find any significant documentation on Titanium or Alloy that goes beyond the most painfully simplistic examples.  Short of trying to figure out how the insides of Titanium actually works, I&#39;m running out of ideas for how to correct this huge performance issue.</p>

							<div><p>Matthew, Aaron&#39;s asking for a test case. Putting your whole app in here would be beneficial to no one. Generating a small test case is not an unreasonable request. It helps you narrow down the issue, determine if it&#39;s an issue with Titanium&#x2F;Alloy or your code, and makes it much easier to digest for us trying to help.</p>
<p>In terms of general knowledge regarding TableViews, check the wiki doc that covers it in detail: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;TableViews">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;TableViews</a></p>
<p>Some off-the-cuff tips, which is the best we can do without code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use &quot;className&quot; on TableViewRows to reuse rows in your TableView</li>
<li>Use setData() to assign the data to a table, don&#39;t repeatedly call append or insert row functions. The former is much faster.</li>
<li>The more complex the rows, the slower the render time. This is not the unique to Titanium, but you should be conservative with the amount of items you put on each row.</li>
<li>The more rows you try to show all at once, the slower the performance.</li>
<li>Again, as mentioned earlier, The ListView component in development will provide more performance improvements.</li>
</ul>

							<p>With regard to the extremely slow network request, followed by extremely slow rendering, I followed Ricardo&#39;s advice (see comments on original question) and checked for available updates.  After updating Alloy to version 1.0 those major speed issues were resolved.  </p>
<p>The application now runs the network request and begins rendering data within a more reasonable ~4 seconds.  I&#39;ll try to optimize on my end to get that number lowered further.</p>
