			<h1>ACS admin user</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>It appears that the Appcelerator guys have just recently introduced an admin user concept in ACS, making it possible to change custom objects that the admin may not be the owner of. Apart from that, there&#39;s not a lot of documentation about the admin role at this point, since it&#39;s so fresh. Does anyone know:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>what privileges the admin user has? (A concrete example: I need to be able to delete users via the API - preferrably without logging them in, as I don&#39;t know their password, but if I can&#39;t do that, I&#39;d like a way to get their passwords so I can log them in and THEN delete them.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>the parameters needed to use them? (In my above example, I am calling the REST interface.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An example call would be awesome. Thanks in advance.</p>

							<p>Hi, We just added setting app user to admin on our website. we are still working on enabling admin access to all objects and adding documentation.</p>
<p>Right now if you logged in as admin user, you can update&#x2F;delete custom object and places. We will make it available for all objects soon.</p>
<p>It currently can&#39;t delete other users but we will have it soon, basically you first login as admin user, then call user delete and pass in user_id of the user you want to delete. If you could email me at wkong@appcelerator.com and I can let you know as soon as it is available.</p>

										<p><p>Actually it is already there. Can you please logon to cloud.appceleartor.com, edit your app users and set one of them as admin, then login as that admin, you should be able to delete other users by passing user_id</p>

										<p><p>got cloud.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;index and goto your app and manage users. click on a user that you want to promote as admin, in the expanded view of that user, you should see a button to make the user admin</p>
