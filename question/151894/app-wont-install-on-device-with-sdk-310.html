			<h1>App won&#39;t install on device with SDK 3.1.0</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve been using SDK 3.0.0 for a while, but started getting App.js not found randomly. Obviously App.js is there. So I read that it could be an SDK issue, so I went up to 3.1.0 which gives me this error during build:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-list">[<span class="hljs-keyword">ERROR</span>] :  ** BUILD FAILED **
<span class="hljs-list">[<span class="hljs-keyword">ERROR</span>] :  The following build commands failed:
<span class="hljs-list">[<span class="hljs-keyword">ERROR</span>] :      PhaseScriptExecution Pre-Compile <span class="hljs-string">"build/POS Anywhere.build/Debug-iphoneos/POS Anywhere-universal.build/Script-DABB369F12E8CB280026A6EA.sh"</span>
<span class="hljs-list">[<span class="hljs-keyword">ERROR</span>] :  <span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">1</span> failure)</span></span></span></span></span>
</code></pre><p>I don&#39;t really care if it&#39;s 3.0.0 or 3.1.0 .. I just need one of them to work. I should say that this app will install and work just fine on the simulator in either sdk.</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to instal on an iPod touch, not sure of generation.</p>
<p>Tried deleting and redownloading the provisioning profile, which didn&#39;t do anything. I do have an ad hoc certificate and a development certificate for this app. I&#39;m trying to install with the Development certificate. And it was working fine until about an hour ago.</p>

							<p>My similar issue was fixed by spending hours combing over files for commas and semicolons, as explained here, http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;146809&#x2F;device-error-script-error–invalid-method-createtextfield-passed-to-uimodule . </p>
<p>Though what differed in my own project was that the problem seemed to be caused by an extremely long, pre-defined array that I was using to supply temporary data to my app for testing,<br>ie <code>var myArray = [&amp;#39;string1&amp;#39;, string2&amp;#39;, etc.. ];</code><br>The array was long enough that the strings in the array stopped changing color when encapsulated by quotation marks.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the reply. I was afraid of this.. is there any way to find out what file? I think I know the last changes I made before it stopped working, so that will narrow it down. It just blows my mind that I&#39;ve been working on this project for about a year and never had this issue before. You&#39;d think if it was something simple I would&#39;ve made the error before. And the fact that it builds just fine for the simulator was leading me to believe it wasn&#39;t code related.. I guess I&#39;d just like to know for a fact that it&#39;s because of the code before I go on a wild goose chase.</p>

							<p>Hello,</p>
<p>you are having problems with your certificates. Build your app for simulator, then close the simulator, open the xcode project and try to install your app from there to the device, the xcode&#39;s organizer will try to automagically configure your device for testing.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s kinda what I was thinking. The curious thing is that it has installed on this device for about 2 weeks. It&#39;s just bizarre that it all of a sudden doesn&#39;t want to install on the device.</p>

							<p>I figured it out. For me, I was missing a closing brace on a function. You&#39;d think that Titanium would&#39;ve complained and not let me build it with a syntax error. It neither showed up as a red flag nor told me where the error was. I went through all the trouble of upgrading my xcode and ios sdk to 6.1 only to find out it was a stupid mistake like that. Eventually found it through trying to build in xcode which gave me the file and line that was broken. Thanks for everyone&#39;s help.</p>
