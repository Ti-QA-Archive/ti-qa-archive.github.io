			<h1>Android EventListeners not being removed</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I am currently working on a project wich has a lot of work with math functions. The only way to implement it was to use Ti.App.fireEvent and Ti.App.addEventListener.</p>
<p>While in iOS it is working fine, when I started the conversion to Android, I started having problems and I narrowed the possible causes down to ONE..:</p>
<p>When I am creating a view I am adding an eventlistener to every Row of a table so that I can do some calculations, and when I close this window, these Eventlisteners wont be removed automatically like iOS (since this window is CLOSED everything that was created in it should be removed just like iOS does).</p>
<p>This way, when I open this window again, the event listeners are being created once again, and when I do the same calculations, they are done TWICE.. I thought removing manually the eventlisteners but some of them CANNOT be removed (because of the structuring of the program, they cannot be seen in the scope when the window closes so that I can remove them)..</p>
<p>This project is really big and took me months to implement to iOS so I dont want to rewrite it from scratch for android (this is supposed to be the good thing that appcelerator provides against native coding).</p>
<p>So what do you suggest? Any ideas? I would provide some code but since we are talking about thousands of lines in dozens of files for doing a calculation, it wont help at all.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Firstly Ti.App is application level, so it doesn&#39;t matter hwere you create it it is tagged to the application not the window.</p>
<p>If the event isn&#39;t firing twice on IOS then I think IOS might have a bug.</p>
<p>Now unfortunately that is really as far as I can go .. as you have provided no code of how and where the event listener is added.</p>
<p>But.. giving you some advice Add the Ti.App event listener either in app.js or in the main controller (don&#39;t know your application architecture). Only add it once. The fire event will find it … you should not be adding application level events on individual windows unless you absoolutely have to …</p>

										<p><p>I do not know if the issue is on the android or on the iOS but one of them does not work as expected and this makes it hard to create multiplatform apps..</p>
<p>Also, I ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO use the ti.app.event inside an individual window since it uses local variables to do core calculations that are very essential to the application..</p>
<p>I would not have used Ti.app.event if there was another way to handle some events that are not predefined in titanium&#39;s API but since it is impossible to predefine every possible event, we have ti.app.event to cover the rest..</p>
<p>Also, I could try erasing the previous eventlisteners every time I create new BUT the functions DO NOT EXIST in the scope of the NEW window..</p>
<p>I have to wonder though.. WHY does iOS work as every logical person would think it should and android wont??</p>
<p>Oh, also for the code, as I said, I would provide some but we are talking for thousants of lines in every function and dozens of functions in every JS, and a couple of JS in every window.. It would take me days to explain what it does and why I need Ti.APP.events and how do I use it..</p>

										<p><p>We don&#39;t need to see your whole code base..</p>
<p>Please provide the way you are creating the event listener and fireing the event.</p>
<p>We could then suggest how to fix the problem.</p>
<p>At the moment the only way is to remove the event listener … but without seeing how you are implementing it, cannot say why it is not being removed.</p>

										<p><p>I am creating a view using a function and adding an event handler on it but I am also adding an application level handler inside the function so that I have access to some local variables that I use in this function and be able to change them later or use them later..so it is something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">export</span>.FuncName = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">e</span>)</span>{

    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> myView = Ti.UI.createView({
        ..
        ..
    })

    myView.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>,<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">e</span>)</span>{
        ..
    })

    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> myFunction(){
        ..
    }

    Ti.app.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'doThis'</span>,myFunction);

    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span>(myView);
}
</code></pre><p>And after I close the window that contains this whole view and I reopen it later, the event listener hits twice..</p>
<p>(Don&#39;t check the syntax, I dont have the code with me right now so I just wrote a sample of it)</p>

										<p><p>yes when you close a window it does to remove application eventlisteners. so when you en the window again it will dd the event listener again thus there being two.</p>
<p>the first thing you should do is add a close event listener on the window and remove the application event listener you have here..</p>
<p>Then add a flag within the window to keep track if it is added as you don&#39;t want to remove it unless it has been added, unless you add it everytime the window is opened. then you won&#39;t need the flag to check.</p>
<p>If you need the event listener still active when the widow is closed, then adding it in the window is to the right place to do it.</p>
<p>Ope this explains it now.</p>
