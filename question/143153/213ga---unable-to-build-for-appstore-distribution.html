			<h1>2.1.3GA - Unable to build for AppStore distribution</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>All right folks, I&#39;m completely lost. I&#39;m on the latest GA release 2.1.3 and trying to build my app for AppStore distribution. I am perfectly able to build it for Simulator and for AdHoc but when I try to build it for AppStore, the bottom falls out of Titanium. Here&#39;s a quick recap:</p>
<p><em>) I run Titanium 2.1.2.201208301612 with 2.1.3GA SDK
</em>) I use Mac OSX 10.8.1<br><em>) XCode version 4.5 (4G182)
</em>) I have all my certificates and profiles in place, imported into XCode, Titanium recognizes them all right<br>*) Every prerequisite seem to be take care of… Of those I know about, at least :)</p>
<p>Now, when I build for AdHoc, everything goes well and I get my drop file, just as expected. When I try building for AppStore, Titanium crunches files for a bit and then pops up XCode - as it should - BUT… there is nothing in XCode. Nada. No Archive created, no error messages, nothing that would indicate any problem, not a hint… I tried pretty much anything I could think of but I can&#39;t get XCode to build the darn Archive from Titanium… Any help is greatly appreciated!</p>

							<p>Dont use Titanium for this.  Do it the right way and use Xcode itself.  Just open your build&#x2F;iphone directory and open the project from there directly in Xcode.  Set your correct Release provisioning profile, then Archive, and it will take care of the rest.</p>

							<p>Well… what do you know folks, after much poking around, I found that XCode 4.x seems to have a bug where it completely ignores its own preferences and stores Archives at the default location, regardless of what you put in the Preferences. It looks like this bug only affects Archives, the Snapshots and Derived Data go to the folders you specify but Archives are <em>always</em> stored at the default location. When it finally dawned upon me to check that folder, I found all my Archives built and packaged nice and snug waiting for me… </p>
<p>On the related note, after looking at what gets built through Titanium, I would agree with Josh - if you are preparing for release, then do Titanium build first, then jump into XCode and adjust the settings and add missing files, icons etc. until it passes validation. In my case, it took me quite a few tweaks as Titanium seems to blissfully ignore a number of launch screen files, icons etc. so I had to copy them over by hand and then add to the final build.</p>
