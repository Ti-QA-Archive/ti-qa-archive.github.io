			<h1>Running my .apk or .app in android/iOS emulator or with AppGrader.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, Is it possible to run my .apk or .app in Titanium Studio? How do I do this? The Kitchen Sink demo has a xml file, but my .apk is one file, and my .app has many folders and files, but no xml files. Help please, maybe this program isnt designed to do what I would like it to do, which is view what my app would look like on the iphone and android, and also have the appgrader plugin  tell me how my apps stack up!! Thank you all in advance.</p>

							<p>Titanium Studio is an IDE built for writing Titanium apps. An .apk file is a completed app that you install on your phone. If you want to see what your .apk looks like on device, install it on your device or into the Android emulator.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you for the response. When i load in the kitchen sink app it has an xml file which the emulator WILL run, but my completed apk is only one file, and the emulator does not want to run it. My developer also made an iOS version and the emulator will not run that one either. It is an .app folder. I would be going thru my developer for this to work, but i wanted to be a bit more knowledgeable before reviewing my app with them again.</p>

										<p><p>The xml file is for describing a Titanium app. I assume that since you&#39;re here, the app you&#39;ve got is a Titanium app right? Second, the kitchen sink is source code, not a compiled app. When you take source code and compile it into an app, the end result is an .apk for Android or an .ipa for iOS. You CANNOT take an .apk file and open it in Titanium Studio to show you the source code or to deploy. Titanium Studio is for the SOURCE of the app, not the built app iteslf. An .apk is meant to be run in an emulator or device, which has nothing to do with Studio unless you have the original code that the app was built with. This is the same for iOS.</p>
<p>If you want to install an .apk into the Android emulator, you first need to make sure that you have all the Android development tools and then you just need to run:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">adb <span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">install</span> [apk <span class="hljs-keyword">file</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">name</span>]</span>
</code></pre><p>For iOS, you need to make sure that the app was provisioned to run on your device, then install your .ipa into iTunes. Once its in iTunes, you can sync your phone with iTunes to put it on your device. You CANNOT run an .ipa in the Simulator. The only way to run an app in the Simulator is to compile the source code yourself to launch into the sim.</p>
<p>From the sound of it you do not have the source code for your app. Without that, Titanium is not going to do you any good. Titanium Studio is used for actually creating the app, not finding a way to run an existing app.</p>
