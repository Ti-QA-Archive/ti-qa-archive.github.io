			<p>Dear All Ti Geek!</p>
<p>I have one issue when I try to submit my app version update to app store, my app icon is missing and version is showing as unspecified. What I wondering is last time it is working fine with XCode 3 and Titanium SDK 1.5.1. </p>
<p>I have tried for my next version update with Xcode 4 and Titanium 1.6.2.</p>
<p>Then I got like this kind of problem and worry to submit to apple.</p>
<p>My issue is same as here also:<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-3421</p>
<p>Please give me some advise. </p>

							<p>I had this issue too, and found there were 2 problems that could both be fixed with a modification to builder.py.  Turns out XCode 4 needs a short version string CFBundleShortVersionString and an IconPaths array of icons to be displayed in the organizer.  builder.py is usuually located in</p>
<p><strong>&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx&#x2F;1.7.0&#x2F;iphone</strong></p>
<p>I am using version 1.7.0 of the sdk, so you may have other directories such as 1.6.0 or 1.6.2</p>
<p>builder.py needs the following replacement in the distribute_xc4 function</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    #
    # 6/5/2011 SAM
    # xcode 4 added two new items that need to be in the bundle
    # CFBundleShortVersionString - the short version to <span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">show</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> organizer
    # IconPaths - an <span class="hljs-built_in">array</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> icons <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> be used
    # this code assumes your <span class="hljs-keyword">version</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> x.y.z <span class="hljs-keyword">format</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">only</span> displays x.y dropping <span class="hljs-keyword">off</span> the <span class="hljs-keyword">long</span> z part
    # this does <span class="hljs-keyword">not</span> seem <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> affect the submit process, just the organizer display
    shortversion = project_info_plist[<span class="hljs-string">'CFBundleVersion'</span>].<span class="hljs-keyword">split</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'.'</span>)

    archive_info = {
        <span class="hljs-string">'ApplicationProperties'</span> : {
            <span class="hljs-string">'ApplicationPath'</span> : <span class="hljs-string">'Applications/%s.app'</span> % <span class="hljs-keyword">name</span>,
            <span class="hljs-string">'CFBundleIdentifier'</span> : project_info_plist[<span class="hljs-string">'CFBundleIdentifier'</span>],
            <span class="hljs-string">'CFBundleShortVersionString'</span> : <span class="hljs-string">'%s.%s'</span> % (shortversion[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>], shortversion[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>]),
            <span class="hljs-string">'IconPaths'</span> : [<span class="hljs-string">'Applications/%s.app/icon.png'</span> % <span class="hljs-keyword">name</span>]
        },
        <span class="hljs-string">'ArchiveVersion'</span> : <span class="hljs-built_in">float</span>(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>),
        <span class="hljs-string">'CreationDate'</span> : datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(<span class="hljs-keyword">time</span>.mktime(<span class="hljs-keyword">time</span>.gmtime())),
        <span class="hljs-string">'Name'</span> : <span class="hljs-keyword">name</span>,
        <span class="hljs-string">'SchemeName'</span> : <span class="hljs-keyword">name</span>
    }</span>
</code></pre><p>You&#39;ll see I&#39;ve add some comments at the top, a shortversion variable, and CFBundleShortVersionString and IconPaths entrries to the archive_info structure.</p>
<p>In order for this to work, you will need the following entries in you Resources directory.</p>
<p>icon.png<br>icon@2x.png</p>
<p>Be sure and edit you tiapp.xml file to change your icon names in there too.</p>
<p>Hopefully, The Titanium folks will roll this into their next release and pull the icon name from the tiapp.xml file to do it properly.  I was happy to go with the brute force technique to get my app to show up in organizer properly :)</p>

							<p>To get the version number to reappear you need to add the property &quot;bundle versions string, short&quot;  to your info.plsit and make its value that of your app&#39;s version number. </p>
<p>On the icon issue, I find it best to drag and drop it into the &#39;wells&#39; of Xcode&#39;s Summery tab. You can also place a hi-res version of your app&#39;s icon or lunch images too if you wish.</p>

										<p><p>thanks for your reply. Actually, I think there is bug between xcode 4 and Ti 1.6. I have tried so many time but no luck for me. So, I remove xcode 4 and re-install xcode3 stable version and then all are working fine. :)</p>

							<p>What I want to know is, does this no icon and no version cause a problem with uploading to iTunes connect? My package verified OK (validates), but doesn&#39;t have icon or version in Organiser version 4.0.2.</p>
<p>Is this just visual to Organiser?</p>

							<p>AFAIK, the displayed icon and version number issue are &quot;just for show&quot; and do not affect app store submission.  Seems to be just an organizer display issue, albeit an annoying one.  As always, make sure you install it on a real device and if it looks good there, you should be OK.</p>

										<p><p>I have tested it throughly on a number of devices via &#39;run on device&#39; and in the emulator. This is a killer of a bug at the last final stage. I guess if there were problems then iTune connect &#39;preflight check&#39; would have picked them up.</p>

										<p><p>Let me share some thing about it. </p>
<p>1) Icon and version are missing issue.<br>From my experience, this is bug between Titanium and xCode. As u know there are some headache at xCode 4. I think xcode 3 is more stable for Titanium. Last time I tries so many time for that issue. No luck at all. Finally, I reinstall xcode 3 then combine and submit directly xcode. After you built successfully, you can open your project from xcode and can try like this.</p>
<p>2) I want to know are you using Titanium Developer console or Titanium Studio IDE? Because I also cannot make for &quot;Run on iso device&quot; from Titanium Studio. I don&#39;t know what is wrong? When I tried from Titanium Developer console, it is totally working fine and I can install on devices. Really strange and funny!!!  </p>
<p>So normally, when I get xcode project after built, I tried some installation or submit staff from xcode directly by opening that built project.</p>
