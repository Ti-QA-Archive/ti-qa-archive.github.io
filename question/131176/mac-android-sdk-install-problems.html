			<h1>Mac Android SDK install problems</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m having noob issues getting started here and I really want to get going with titanium. The issue is I unzip the android-sdk-macosx onto 10.7 (not 10.7.2), then through terminal run android upgrade etc,etc. </p>
<p>Everytime it gives me sdkmanager.jar not found. I found it elsewhere on the computer, copied it in, and then of course got an error that it couldn&#39;t locate another jar file (I knew it wouldn&#39;t work, I was just frustrated). I&#39;ve been told java comes with the updates, and indeed I see it as an installed update. I also download the jdk7 from oracle&#39;s site even though it&#39;s marked in beta as a preview. </p>
<p>Basically the SDK I get come with the tools dir and an empty platform and add-ons dir. The video tutorials I see on AppU have much more. </p>
<p>If anyone has a clue as to what I&#39;m doing wrong please help. I presume the android-sdk is looking in a wrong path for the jdk as I found the 1.6.029 java files installed through software update, but have no clue how to change that path.</p>
<p>Please help me out, I&#39;ve spent way to many hours diagnosing this nonsense that is prohibiting me from even getting started.</p>
<p>Thanks!<br>Will</p>

							<p>In terminal are you doing &quot;android upgrade&quot; or &quot;android&quot;? For me it was just &quot;android&quot;, and that launched the Android SDK Manager which lets me install the required packages.</p>

							<p>I tried both. android alone or with any parameters gave me the same error. It&#39;s basically as if the tool can&#39;t find java (I&#39;m assuming), but I don&#39;t know how to point it there.</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s odd that it wouldn&#39;t find java since it&#39;s installed and the path is setup by default on OSX. Does all it say is &quot;sdkmanager.jar not found&quot; or is there more to the error message? You may have better luck on stackoverflow for this issue since it isn&#39;t Titanium related.</p>

							<p>nah just that. I found the file elsewhere and copied it to the tool directory, and didn&#39;t get the error anymore, but then of course I got errors about other files missing. Generally I need to know how to adjust my path to include my java sdk cause it doesn&#39;t seem to be in there. If anyone knows how to do that I&#39;d be much obliged.</p>

							<p>Forget it guys. Thanks for your help. I knew I installed it months ago but haven&#39;t had the time to go back to it. I am just going to use that one…They must have done something to a newer version…cause it was NOT that hard when I did it the first time.</p>
