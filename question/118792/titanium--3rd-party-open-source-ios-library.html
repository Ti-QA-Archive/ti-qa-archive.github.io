		<section>
			<p>Hi,<br>I found a third party open-source iOS library called OpenEars that does text to speach on the iPhone.<br>It is designed to work with xcode and objective-c. I was wondering if there is any way that I can make a Titanium app that uses that capability.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>@Shlomi, it&#39;s been about 10 months since you asked your question.  Were you ever able to use OpenEars successfully on iOS?  If so, how were its performance characteristics on small vocabularies?</p>
<p>I&#39;m considering an app that needs local speech recognition with no Internet connection for a fairly small vocabulary (the numbers 0-100 &amp; about 30 other words).</p>
<p>I&#39;d also like to have it work on Android, and I found<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cmusphinx.sourceforge.net&#x2F;sphinx4<br>which is a Java implementation of CMU Sphinx.  Have you used that successfully on Android?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Matthew</p>

										<p><p>Hi Matthew,</p>
<p>No, I didn&#39;t have success with it. at the time I was researching this issue I wasn&#39;t developing objective-c modules. But lately I&#39;ve been more into it - maybe I&#39;ll give it another shoot in the near future.</p>

							<p>Yes, what you need to do is put the obj C code inside a custom module, and call it from your javascript.  The guide on how to do that is <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Module+Developer+Guide+for+iOS">here</a>.</p>

							<p>I successfully created a custom module for OpenEars text to speech and voice to text.  It was a little tricky but worked out nicely.  The developer of OpenEars (Halle of Politepix) needs to give you permission though if you include it in your app.  Building a Titanium module is outside of the OpenEars license. This is why I did not share the module.</p>
<p>If you get Halle&#39;s permission, feel free to contact me and I will help.  Politepix may also be developing a Titanium module also.</p>
