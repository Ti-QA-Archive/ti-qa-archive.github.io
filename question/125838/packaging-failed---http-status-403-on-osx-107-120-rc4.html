							<p>Paul,</p>
<p>There were some versions of Studio that had problems importing existing projects and&#x2F;or possibly creating them. I think it has all be fixed in 1.0.5.</p>
<p>Which version of Studio are you using?</p>

										<p><p>Paul,</p>
<p>That should be ok with 1.0.5. I just added RC4 to the packaging servers and tested it. AFAICT it is working with RC4 to package now.</p>
<p>I think the 403 error was a non-functioning bucket on the cloud which was fixed. are you still having a problem?</p>
