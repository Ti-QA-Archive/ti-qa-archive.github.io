							<p>Well kitchen sink seems to have errors. Titanium uses jslint to validate the javascript before it compiles it, and sometimes you get this.</p>
<p>You could try  to disable jslint as per this post<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;27621&#x2F;just-started—want-to-use-googles-closure-tools</p>
<p>or to fix the errors in KS :)</p>

							<p>Hi Tamas,</p>
<p>thank you for replying so quickly, the errors are:</p>
<p>[WARN] JavaScript compiler reported &quot;Extra comma.&quot; at examples&#x2F;views.js:14<br>[WARN] JavaScript compiler reported &quot;Missing semicolon.&quot; at examples&#x2F;views_zindex.js:87<br>[WARN] JavaScript compiler reported &quot;Function statements cannot be placed in blocks. Use a function expression or move the statement to the top of the outer function.&quot; at examples&#x2F;web_views.js:210<br>[WARN] JavaScript compiler reported &quot;Extra comma.&quot; at </p>
<p>there are many more lines or very similar [warn] type comment at the end of the list is:</p>
<p>[WARN] JavaScript compiler reported &quot;Missing semicolon.&quot; at main_windows&#x2F;base_ui.js:74<br>[INFO] One moment, building …<br>[INFO] Titanium SDK version: 1.4.0<br>[INFO] iPhone Device family: iphone<br>[INFO] iPhone SDK version: 3.2<br>[INFO] Performing clean build<br>[INFO] Detected custom font: comic_zine_ot.otf</p>
<p>then Titanium sit there a does nothing, I don&#39;t know if it is relevant but the Titanium developer application window is not &#39;moveable&#39; if you click on the top bar you cannot move it around the screen or between monitors.</p>
<p>SDK is set to 4.0<br>Filter is set to Info</p>
<p>Anything else I should be looking for?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Pete</p>

										<p><p>Those [WARN] errors should be just that: a warning not a failure, so they shouldn&#39;t affect execution as far as i&#39;m aware. The warnings themselves are just a result of slightly sloppy code. For example if a javascript function contains a single line of code, its not absolutely necessary to put a semi colon at the end - it will run just fine. Similarly in website javascripting in general (not talking about Titanium for a second), leaving a trailing comma at the end of a set of array elements will be fine in many browser while IE often throws errors. Its just a discrepancy in syntax checking strictness.</p>
<p>Fixing the Warnings may solve things though, and they&#39;re easy to fix. The fact that these errors remain in the &#39;official&#39; examples is just disappointing.</p>

										<p><p>Hi David,</p>
<p>thank you for replying, with all your points fair enough - I was getting tried up in knots with it, stepped away for awhile, installed it all again this time with Profiles and Dev certificates and it runs wonderfully on my iPhone but not in simulator - nevermind…</p>
<p>I can begin to glimpse the power of this method and am going to spend sometime learning how to do it. I have had your reply and another in a matter of minutes which is very much appreciated, thank you…</p>
