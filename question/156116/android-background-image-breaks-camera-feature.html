			<h1>Android Background Image Breaks Camera Feature</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am working on an app which is causing me an issue. In a previous post I mentioned that I had an issue with using the Camera to capture and image and replace the placeholder on a form. After several test I finally figured out what is causing the issue, which leads me to this post. </p>
<p>I have a default.png image located in the resources&#x2F;android&#x2F; folder. I also have 3 folders in the resources&#x2F;images&#x2F; called HI, Medium, Low that targets the different screen sizes.</p>
<p>If I add the default.png image to the Hi, Medium, Low folders with the respective size for each folder, the camera capture and replace function stops working. </p>
<p>Can someone please suggest what I could do to fix this issue? Please keep in mind that when I add the default.png into the Hi, Medium, Low folders I am cleaning the project and rebuilding. The apk has been tested on the Samsung Galaxy S3, Motorola Droid, and Motorola RazrM so that shows me that the issue is not the device.</p>

							<p>After several attempts to fix the issue it seems I finally got this work. I created a new app and checked the images folder. Since my app is only vertical I took all the folders that contained the vertical default.png and copied those folders into my app then I removed the Hi, Medium, Low folders and created the apk. The camera function worked the way it should.</p>
