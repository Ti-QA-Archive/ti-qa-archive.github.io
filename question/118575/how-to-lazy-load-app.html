			<h1>How to lazy load app?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Titanium SDK version: 1.6.1<br>iPhone SDK version: 4.2</p>
<p>I am looking for ways to make my app faster. Every now and then I hear people saying that doing &quot;lazy loading&quot; speeds up the app.</p>
<p>My simple question is, what is lazy loading exactly and how can I use it in an app? It would be perfect with a small example. Some talk about using setTimeout. How is this done in practice?</p>
<p>Thankful for all input!</p>

							<p>Hi there Daniel,</p>
<p>One tactic you could use is breaking your app into more contexts&#x2F;js files, although this would introduce a bit more complexity as you&#39;d need to manage the transfer of data between screens more. The added advantage is it breaks your code into more clearly defined units.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a tableview which when clicking rows opens a new window, if you create a js file for that window, it won&#39;t be run until the user taps. Any pertinent data required by the new window can be attached to it when it is created.</p>
<p>Basically the processing has to happen sometime, and it&#39;s a balance as to how much is done &#39;up front&#39; and how much is spread over the rest of the app.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>Chris</p>

										<p><p>according to my logs .. this is not true.   All of my .js files are being loaded before the first screen&#39;s .js is displayed.    All the .js files are being loaded (and run apparently) first.</p>

							<p>off the top of my head have the bare minimum code executed in the main execution path, then set a timeout for the rest…???</p>
<p>psuedo code:</p>
<p>entry:<br>-set background-<br>-draw minimum elements-<br>-setTimeout maybe 100-250ms delay-</p>
<p>timeout:<br>-load actual ui-<br>-pull dynamic content-<br>-blah blah blah-</p>
<p>In theory it would only execute the bare minimum to get into the app, then once it is loaded start doing the rest of the heavy lifting… in theory the perceived loading time will be less because you&#39;ll spend less time on the initial loading screen.</p>
<p>I may be completely wrong but makes sense to me…</p>
