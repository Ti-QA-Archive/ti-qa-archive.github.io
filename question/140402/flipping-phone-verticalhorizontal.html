			<p>Hi all</p>
<p>Wondering if there&#39;s any add-on and&#x2F;or suggestions&#x2F;resources on how do handle&#x2F;design for mobile when someone flips their phone horizontally or vertically?  Our understanding is we have to design the app so it can be able to be viewed either vertically (which I assume is the default) or horizontally.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

							<p>Hi Sean </p>
<p>In an ideal world yes designing an iPhone app to accommodate portrait and landscape orientations is the ideal situation.  However you should first ask yourself would your app benefit from being used in both orientations. If the honest answer is no then stick with one.</p>
<p>There are many apps that lock into one or the other, apple themselves produce several that ONLY work in one or the other.  See tha cards app and iMovie as examples.</p>
<p>A better way is to think could aspects of my app benefit, if you show charts the detecting a user swapping to landscape could mean the chart only showing up on half the portrait screen could take up the whole landscape view.  See apple shares app for example. Easy to implement and adds great benefits for the user.</p>
<p>So think more about the end user benefits rather than worrying about making EVERYTHING rotate.</p>
<p>If this is for the iPad then you should consider the use case is more likely to be swapping between orientations.</p>

							<p>Hi Malcolm thanks for the response.  Are there any tools&#x2F;resources that can show us how to design portrait&#x2F;landscape (or any tools that allow you to do both at once)</p>

										<p><p>Not so much resources, it is more about thinking the right way to achieve it.  The best way I found is to spend time with other apps that have similar aims. Obviously do not copy, but lots can be learnt from interaction.</p>
<p>Once you done that you should play with laying out views etc, making sure to use either dimensions that anchor to sides and also To.UI.FILL AND Ti.UI.SIZE.</p>
<p>And use the event listener for orientation that way you can show and hide views as required.</p>
