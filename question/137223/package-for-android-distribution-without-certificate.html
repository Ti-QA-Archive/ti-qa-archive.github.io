			<h1>Package for android distribution without certificate</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;d like to package my Android app for release to the Market.<br>However, I&#39;m not the publisher of the app, just the developer and my client doesn&#39;t want me to know his private key for signing the application for distribution.</p>
<p>Is there any way to get an unsigned app in &quot;distribution mode&quot;?</p>
<p>I already know that I can take the apk from the build folder, but that apk is in DEBUGGING mode, so that&#39;s not the best solution.</p>
<p>If there is no possibility to do this, could someone scalate this as a feature request?</p>
<p>Regards,<br>Jose</p>

							<p>This might help you.<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;guide&#x2F;publishing&#x2F;app-signing.html#releasecompile ( the ant part )</p>
<p>I never tried to to run an unsigned app on a device, but you ca try to send it to the client and he will sign and zipalign to submit it to playstore.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your fast answer Dan.</p>
<p>Yes, that is what I saw in the official docs, but does that command work for titanium built apps?<br>That would be the procedure to publish the app.</p>
<p>I also saw this: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.appcelerator.com&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;APP-835248&#x2F;tickets">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.appcelerator.com&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;APP-835248&#x2F;tickets</a> but I think the certificate is a must to get it working.</p>
<p>When you develop for city councils you have to face certain bureaucracy and procedures, and one of them is not sharing any &quot;private&quot; information.</p>
<p>BTW, I think an unsigned app won&#39;t run in a device</p>

										<p><p>Install on their computer the sdk and teach them how to do it themself.<br>I was thinking to do this and build a wrapper around the build.py script that will ask them the key. This way they will be able to sign and zipalign the apk without giving this data to you.</p>

							<p>I understand you&#39;re working on an app that was already released on the market, but was not developed by you ?</p>
<p>As Christian said, you can&#39;t export an app without signature.</p>
<p>There are three options :</p>
<ul>
<li>Use your customer&#39;s keystore</li>
<li>Create a new one</li>
<li>Send your code to the customer and let him export the app with his keystore</li>
</ul>
<p>If your client does not want to give you his keystore + password, tell them you&#39;ll have to create a new one. But creating a new one will not update the old app, it will create a new one. You client has to make a choice about this.</p>

							<p>You cannot publish an unsigned application on the Android Market. Every single application on the market must be signed for security purposes (makes sense when you think of it)</p>
<p>But you simply want to distribute your app to our customer (usually for testing), you can send him the <strong>unsigned app</strong> so he can install it on his device. You can send the file by mail, Dropbox or any other means you see fit.</p>
<p>####You can find the app file at the following location:<br><code>[APP_DIR]&amp;#x2F;build&amp;#x2F;android&amp;#x2F;bin&amp;#x2F;app.apk</code></p>
<p>In order for this to work, you have to keep one thing in mind</p>
<ul>
<li>Your customer must allow non-market applications on his device. (in the applications settings)</li>
</ul>

<p>I need the android in &quot;relase mode&quot; but unsigned, the app in the build folder is in debug mode.<br>The client will sign the app before publishing to the market.</p>
