			<h1>Troubles with Android - About to give up</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Ok, I am about to give up on Appcelerator with simple tasks developing for Android.  Using Windows Vista 64bit.  Simple tasks like an alert box doesn&#39;t even work on my Android simulator.  Got Kitchen sink to run OK.  I have tried simple things like a swipe between image views. Didn&#39;t work.<br>Click button alert. Didn&#39;t work.<br>Load alert on page enter. Didn&#39;t work. Showed up for a 1&#x2F;2 second then disappeared once the window loaded.<br>Even tried to load it onto my Android OS2.1 phone. Errored out.<br>Not sure what is wrong.  I sure can&#39;t afford $200 and there are no real examples of full simple code in the documents, their beginning 100 series videos or anything that show a full application simply done start to finish.<br>The stuff I have seen in videos are done for iPhone. All around the web are Appcelerator videos written for iPhone. Tried using the same code which seems should work. Such as a button alert but does not work on Android. Using Titanium 1.3.0, Android emulator 2.1 and tried the recommended 1.6.  Of course I am using Windows and can&#39;t do iPhone.  Really? I know why.<br>Most likely there is no hope for this one. Struggling using a PC for development when this product was obviously built for a Mac, which I use at home. Can&#39;t afford $99 dev license for Mac Dev.<br>Will someone please put together a series of videos for us lowly poor beginner developers trying to make it. Maybe some done on a PC so I can develop at my job.<br>What is the deal with the Android issues too?<br>Thanks</p>

							<p>I&#39;m sure others will jump in. But &quot;windowing&quot; is more involved on Android than on iPhone. It&#39;s important where you create visual items so they show up on the correct Windows (Android Activity, for heavyweight windows) Android has the concept of a task stack which does not exist on iPhone. </p>
<p>Android is not at feature parity with iPhone yet, but we strive to improve that with each release.</p>

							<p>Don,<br>Thanks for the quick response.  I finally got the simple dialog to work checking out the Kitchen sink app.  This may start me off.  My main issue is pulling in JSON from an external service, but I need to test on my local due to firewall issues.  Can anyone point me in a direction that can show a bit of simple code. I like the stringify option built in and would like to use that.<br>I guess Android plays better with views than windows based on some searching around.<br>Still their are no good resources on the web for Appcelerator developing for Android.  I will do what I can and share simple ones.<br>Question: Do the Appcelerator video series that is paid for address Android development?  Or does it lean mainly with iPhone application development.  I would look into scrapping some money together to view the series but I need to know for sure that it will be valuable enough for the money, time and effort.<br>Don&#39;t get me wrong.  Appcelerator is one of the easier and better products out there. Especially making an all in one package for iPhone and Android and soon Blackberry. It is just the amount of work it is taking to develop for more Android stuff is becoming a pain.<br>Thanks again and any help, direction of resources or suggestions are appreciated.</p>

							<p>Hi,</p>
<p>To answer your question about iPhone development on Windows, I&#39;m sorry to say that this is impossible due to Apple&#39;s requirements that their XCode development tools which Titanium relies on for iPhone dev are not available for Windows.</p>
<p>Basically, you can&#39;t develop native iPhone app on Windows. This is nothing to do with Titanium&#x2F;Appcelerator.</p>
<p>:(</p>
<p>K</p>
