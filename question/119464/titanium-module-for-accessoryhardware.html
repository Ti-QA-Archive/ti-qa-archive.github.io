			<h1>Titanium Module for (Accessory)Hardware</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello everyone.</p>
<p>I have an app which uses the LineaPro barcode and credit card reader. LineaPro comes with it&#39;s own Objective-C API so it&#39;s very simple to use on the iPhone.</p>
<p>Now I want to rewrite this app with Titanium and keep using LineaPro.<br>Since LineaPro is an iPhone&#x2F;iPod-only accessory, there is no need for it to work on the Android.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been doing some research on <strong>Titanium Module development</strong> but couldn&#39;t find anything about developing a module to interact with an existing (Obj-C)API for a <strong>hardware</strong>. Or maybe write my own (Obj-C)API to interact with this hardware and a Titanium Module to use this (Obj-C)API.</p>
<p>Is it possible?</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the link to LineaPro&#39;s website so you know what I&#39;m talking about.<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ipcprint.com&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;</p>

							<p>Hi Bernardo,</p>
<p>I have a working enterprise grade app written in Titanium Developer for my current company.  I wrote a custom LineaPRO Titanium Module for the Linea by following Appcelerator&#39;s excellent documentation on doing so.</p>
<p>This is all you need.<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;doc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;module_sdk</p>
<p>Be sure when you build your module you are including Linea&#39;s libLineaSDK.a</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>Paul</p>

										<p><p>Hey Paul! Thanks for the tip! </p>
<p>So you were able to use Linea&#39;s library without having to rewrite everything?<br>I was hoping I could do that and save some time. Just link to the methods in the library and have them working instead of having to create my own.</p>
<p>How was the experience and could you share how long did it take?</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

										<p><p>Has Doug stated below, it is really simple and straight forward to set up.  There is no need to rewrite anything.  Just find which Linea methods you want to use and load them into your Ti Module.  Good luck and feel free to ask questions! :)</p>

							<p>Yes, it is very possible to use the existing Linea Pro library.  Like Paul, I also wrote my own objC module to act as a wrapper to their library, and fire events I could catch in my titanium application.</p>
<p>Even though at the time is was the first iOS module I had created for titanium, I found it very straight forward.  But I&#39;ve been a developer for over 30 years in a variety of languages.</p>
<p>YMMV.</p>

							<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am trying to use Linea SDK in a custom module and call it in the main app. My issue isin establishing basic connection with the Linea SDK and thus the hardware</p>
<p>I am using the following code in the custom module startup method<br>linea=[Linea sharedDevice];<br>[linea addDelegate:self];<br>[linea connect];</p>
<p>When I try to get connection status through method -connectionState, the state is alwaysdisconnected.</p>
<p>Any clues???</p>
