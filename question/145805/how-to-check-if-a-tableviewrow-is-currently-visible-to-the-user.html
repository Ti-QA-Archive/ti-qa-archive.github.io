			<h1>How to check if a tableviewrow is currently visible to the user?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Not the .visible value, but visible to the user within the scope of the screen. I am loading a bunch of images in a large tableview (one image per row), and I want to preroad low-res images first, and update the row that a user is currently viewing with a higher resolution. I guess facebook is also doing somehting like that, the images are really blurry when initiated.</p>
<p>Good ideas are welcome.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure that this is what Facebook is doing in their mobile app. I&#39;m pretty sure that the images they are using are simply progressive jpgs. Probably so they can display the image as soon as possible and have it resolve as data is downloaded. So, trying to duplicate this functionality using multiple images is probably not going to have the desired outcome.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>If your low res images are the same physical dimensions of the the high-resolution version then I you may need to be aware they take the exact same memory footprint when displayed.  This is true even if you have a JPEG with 99% compression and a PNG without any compression or palette reductions.  The files sizes will be very different but in memory all images are WxHxRGB or WxHxRGBA.  Plus a small amount of bytes for image type info.</p>
<p>Examples;</p>
<ul>
<li>JPEG image with 99% compression 50x50 = 7,500 bytes</li>
<li>PNG without Alpha 50x50 = 7,500 bytes</li>
<li>JPEG image without compression 50x50 = 7,500 bytes</li>
<li>PNG with Alpha 50x50 = 10,000 bytes</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are using remote images then this is all handled for you automatically;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var row = Ti.UI.createTableViewRow({
    className: <span class="hljs-string">'standard'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-variable">height</span>: Ti.UI.SIZE,
    <span class="hljs-variable">width</span>: Ti.UI.FILL
});
var img = Ti.UI.createImageView({
    defaultImage: <span class="hljs-string">'localfile.jpg'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-variable">height</span>: Ti.UI.SIZE,
    <span class="hljs-built_in">image</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'http://somedomain.com/somefolder/somefile.jpg'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-variable">width</span>: Ti.UI.SIZE
});
row.<span class="hljs-built_in">add</span>(img);
</code></pre><p>If you are using local files for the higher resolution versions the ignore the <strong>defaultImage</strong> and make sure you set the <strong>className</strong> property of the <strong>tableViewRow</strong>, this will allow the OS to cache your rows for you, automatically removing and adding in and out of memory on the fly.</p>
<p>You should not need to handle this yourself unless you have some very complicated or extremely long table.</p>
<p>If you do have a very complicated table then make sure all the common row styles have the same <strong>className</strong>.</p>
<p>If you do have a very long table list then consider partial loads, load more, paging, drill down tables or other techniques as very long table may not be optimum for your users.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Malcolm, thanks for you reply!</p>
<p>I am loading remote images data from a json feed, with an remote image url included. The default&#x2F;initial tableview shows 15 items and I am appending 15 rows automatically on scrolldown (when you reach the bottom). I also have a the same className defined for all rows (for loop).</p>
<p>The low resolution images don&#39;t have the same dimensions though. The jpeg&#39;s are 50% of of the original width &amp; height, so they will be loaded a lot faster on 3G.</p>
<p>I was planning to stretch them up in the imageView, and loading the hi-res image when visible to the screen. This should prevent users from seeing the defaultImage, which I think is ugly. Can this be done?</p>

										<p><p>OK a few things going on here, I will try to answer each one;</p>
<ul>
<li>Low res JPEGs will take less bandwidth but the exact same amount of device memory when displayed as they will still occupy the same physical space.</li>
<li>I understand you want to make things faster for users but you the bandwidth reduction is a compromise and one most users do not have a big problem with.</li>
<li>Given the fact the images are thumbnails, the actual bandwidth saving is nominal given the small physical dimensions of the images</li>
<li>You will actually be increasing the bandwidth by requiring two connections and two files for every single one.</li>
<li>On 3g connections can be a bigger delay than bandwidth from a single connection.</li>
<li>The default image can be changed easily, set the property <strong>defaultImage</strong> (example above) to a local image you design (then it will look as you want it to) </li>
</ul>
<p>I think you may be trying to solve a problem by causing others.</p>
<p>All the big apps use remote images with a custom default image and let the OS handle the task of showing and hiding when rows are in view and if required housekeeping the memory when they are out of view.</p>
<p>I would (and do) concentrate on providing fast hosting for the images, this may be a high availability server or a CDN service - this is where those improvements really come in.</p>
<p>The other thing to consider with your approach is that users may jump straight through the table and whilst you are trying to load images that were triggered by them coming into view they are now already out of view.  The OS handles this sort of thing for you.</p>
