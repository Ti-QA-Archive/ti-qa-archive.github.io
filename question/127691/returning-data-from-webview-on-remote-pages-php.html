			<h1>Returning Data from Webview on remote pages (PHP)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I never actually asked the question… I ended up solving it through research on various threads that eventually lead up to a solution.  So Here&#39;s one method:</p>
<p>This post refers to v1.7.2 and firing events no longer supported on remote pages to due security concerns. (I believe this happened prior to 1.7.2, but the code below works on v1.7.2)  I looked at various options to grab data on a returned .php generated page.  I don&#39;t want to use local pages for simplicity of changes being made on server.  Here&#39;s one solution to grabbing data from within a returned HTML page.</p>
<p>PHP code that injects invisible information on a user displayed page (I put it in the body):</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">echo <span class="hljs-string">'&lt;PARAM id="foo" value="'</span>.<span class="hljs-variable">$someDynamicValue</span>.<span class="hljs-string">'" valuetype="data"&gt;'</span>;
</code></pre><p>Code to grab the value in Titanium:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">webView.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'load'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> element = webView.evalJS(<span class="hljs-string">"document.getElementById('foo').value"</span>);
    Ti.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">"element=["</span>+element+<span class="hljs-string">"]"</span>);
});
</code></pre><p>If there is a better way to do this, I&#39;d love to know.</p>

							<div><p>Didn&#39;t really try it, just a thought, but would it be possible, to get webpage source code through HTTPClient and then load that content into a webview and do what you need to do.</p>
<p>Not saying it would be better, just my 0.02$</p>

							<div><p>Absolutely.  It probably is better to do it that way in many if not most cases.  I mention in a comment below why I felt it was a better approach for my needs: having the page also render properly if I&#39;m going through the webapp side of the product.  I posted the solution in case it better fits someones needs than the standard HTTPclient method. (I didn&#39;t mention it above because I try to keep the Q&#x2F;A part short, I have a tendency to be verbose. :)  I should also add, I only needed one value returned, but if returning a complex data package I would probably look closer at creating an HTTPClient method that would work in both Titanium and through client JS in a browser.</p>

							<p>Or you can use PHP to rende&#x2F;echor JSON. I did that with my app when reformatting data from various API-s. You just parse JSON in your app. Voila&#39;</p>

										<p><p>Agreed.  If you don&#39;t need to display content to the user, I would think what you mention is a better solution. I had created a little Q&#x2F;A for that a while back: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;82851&#x2F;json-http-request-working-example-here</p>
<p>In the case of what I posted, I need to also display formatted content to the user and the response has to be something a normal browser client can handle.  It could still be done through Javascript, but I felt this was a simpler approach rather than building a separate way to handle the request&#x2F;response and building the webView, then also providing this mechanism in Titanium and in a web client.</p>
