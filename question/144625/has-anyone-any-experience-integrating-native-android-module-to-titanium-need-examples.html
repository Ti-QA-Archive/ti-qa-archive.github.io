			<h1>Has anyone any experience integrating native Android module to Titanium? Need examples</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>According to <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;doc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;android-custom-modules">this article</a> there should be a possibility to &quot;import&quot; native Android module into Titanium. Unfortunately I do not have any experience working with either Java or at least Eclipse and not sure if I can follow all the steps there, but think I should be able to at least copy&#x2F;modify&#x2F;paste existing code&#x2F;solution.</p>
<p>So I&#39;m wondering if anyone &quot;imported&quot; native Android module to the Titanium successfully and can share a code, so that I can use it as example&#x2F;reference&#x2F;base etc? I need to port <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.google.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;android-wheel&#x2F;">Android Wheel</a> module, as native picker&#x2F;spinner has almost zero customization capabilities.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>take a look to the official ModDevGuide example, has been my best source code example for modules I&#39;ve ever found</p>
<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_modules&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;moddevguide">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_modules&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;moddevguide</a></p>
<p>But this will require at least a minimum Java Knowledge and patience… good luck :)</p>

							<p>I will save you a lot of trouble. If you have no experience with Java and native Android development. There is little to no chance you will manage to get it to work. Even by copying and pasting as you suggested, there are pretty complex computing principles at play when developing modules and native Android.</p>
<p>Just setting up your machine for native module development could provide quite complicated and there will be no way for you to know (for sure) if the errors are coming from your code or your setup.</p>
<p>Also, after looking at your Android wheel example, this a component destined to be used with native apps. And converting such a component to a module will require knowledge on how Titanium works (natively) under the hood.</p>
<p>Of course, you could contract someone to develop it for you for a fee. With relatively simple instructions, you can get it setup in your applications and use it using JavaScript.</p>
<p>Hope this clears it a little more for you and good luck.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, I will consider an option to hire more experienced resource for this task. Do you have an idea on what is the optimal bet for this task and where is the best place to find such person? Here, oDesk etc?</p>

										<p><p>Well, if you have a <strong>firm</strong> contract offer (and dedicated budget), you could push it on a service like oDesk,</p>
<p>You can also contact me through DevLink once the bet is online. I can pass it around to developers I know that do contract work.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks. No, I do not have any firm offer. I&#39;m dealing with this as part of my hobby, so the decision whether to contract anyone would be based solely on the budget developer will request and my readiness to spend this budget, rather than playing with that on my own (again, this is part of the hobby).</p>
