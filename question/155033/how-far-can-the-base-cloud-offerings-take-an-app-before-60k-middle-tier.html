			<h1>How far can the base cloud offerings take an app before $60K middle tier?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Based on my understanding, it&#39;s free and the next step up is $60,000 a year ($999 named user&#x2F;mo - requiring a one year commitment and five users) .. so basically how much revenue could one generate off the provided cloud services?<br>It makes sense if I make an app that becomes really popular one would want to get some could SLA services and more. Is it reasonable that an app would be generating multitudes of the necessary $5k a month before one would reach the first pricing tranche?<br>Is it better to just avoid the Appcelerator platform in case your app &quot;blows up&quot;?</p>

							<div><p>None taken! Thanks for responding - I&#39;m really trying to get an understanding here.<br>I don&#39;t have a feel for how big or popular an app could become before hitting the limit of the free cloud services. Does that make sense? Is the free stuff enough to get to Angry Bird level (using that as a watermark)? Halfway there? A quarter?<br>Basically, looking at the number of emails, API calls, push notifications, etc. - if an app&#39;s revenue model was advertising based; my fear is it wouldn&#39;t be generating enough revenue to cover the costs.</p>

							<div><p>Appcelerator generously provides:<br>5M push notifications<br>5M API calls (I&#39;m not sure what this is)<br>20GB of storage<br>100,000 emails per month</p>
<p>if any of those are hit, we&#39;re supposed to sign up for Appcelerator Platform, right?<br>Could an app generate enough revenue to cover $5k a month with that level of service?<br>Maybe I&#39;m missing something, but from reading that page I think there&#39;s no overage costs; you have to upgrade.<br>I just need to be sure. There are other options of course, such as urban airship for push notifications and Heroku for big data and analytics - etc.</p>
<p>5M push notifications is a lot; so is 20GB of storage. 100k emails is pretty good; but if you sent a welcome email to every registered user, plus a confirmation, that&#39;s 50k registrations (or less if you reserve some for password resets or something).</p>
<p>Hopefully I&#39;m making my question clearer.</p>

							<p>Hi Michael</p>
<p>really, there is not enough info to answer your question fully.</p>
<p>You have not provided any info about the app. The free offering from APPC is plenty to generate a good income, but as it purely depends on what your app does, depends on if you will make money.</p>
<p>the offering is per account so yes it&#39;s for all your apps not just one.</p>
<p>Also I believe their is an interim offering of a single user for $5k a year,, which provides further services, and you can always contact Appc to discuss your specific requirements.</p>
<p>T</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s reasonable. There&#39;s nothing about that on the plans and pricing.<br>As far as the app - it&#39;s more about picking a platform for an &quot;app to be named later.&quot; :)</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;m alone in examining platforms with the idea of creating multiple apps in the future for general release and for clients. From that perspective, the appcelerator platform (NOT Titanium) appears challenging from a cost perspective. I&#39;m sure there are many businesses it&#39;s easily justifiable for, I&#39;m just a one man shop. But it&#39;s good to know there&#39;s an option, but there are no details.</p>
<p>Like I mentioned before, I can use other third party solutions for things like push, storage, database, email, and analytics… it&#39;s just more work as there&#39;s no ACS to take advantage of.. as I understand it.</p>
<p>So basically - If you&#39;re a one man shop, use the plethora of 3rd party providers and roll your own code to use their API and avoid ACS UNLESS you&#39;re confident you will generate enough revenue to justify the costs. It&#39;s a cost &#x2F; benefit thing I guess to consider $500 a month.</p>
<p>Too much app interaction could cap out the services too fast, depending on how the app is designed.</p>
<p>Of note - I&#39;m uncertain it&#39;s the best approach to expect a customer to have a specific application with completed workflow &#x2F; communication design in hand for them to be able to determine if they should choose the Appcelerator Platform over its competitors.</p>
<p>I completely understand there are costs - so I&#39;m not criticizing. </p>
<p>I&#39;m sure many, many customers design their apps ui, and how it will work in the back end before contacting Appcelerator. I&#39;m probably in the vast minority in that I&#39;m examining the platform from a cost &#x2F; benefit perspective; evaluating it from the perspective of the opportunity is presents to ME, as an app &#x2F; app services entrepreneur.</p>
