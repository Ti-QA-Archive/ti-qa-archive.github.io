			<h1>Ti.App.Properties.setList reference</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I was playing with managing data for the app I&#39;m working on and was considering creating a Ti.App.Properties list for carrying around data in one place rather than using a number of individual Ti.App.Properties.</p>
<p>What I&#39;d like to be able to do is to be able to dynamically change different contents of the list object. For example, if I had this…</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-constant">Ti.App.Properties.</span>setList(<span class="hljs-string">'session'</span>,{
    <span class="hljs-string">'color'</span><span class="hljs-symbol">:<span class="hljs-string">'red
,    '</span>length<span class="hljs-string">':300
,    '</span>height<span class="hljs-string">':180
});</span></span>
</code></pre><p>The above is just hypothetical data to illustrate what I&#39;m considering…</p>
<p>Basically I&#39;m wondering if there is a way to easily create a &quot;session&quot; object (setList property) by reference so that I could change the values as such:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// I want a reference so I can change the values as such...</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> session = Ti.App.Properties.getList(<span class="hljs-string">'session'</span>);
session.color = <span class="hljs-string">'green'</span>;
</code></pre><p>Now, I&#39;d like that to be it – so if I read out Ti.App.Properties.getList(&#39;session&#39;); I&#39;d see that the color was now green…  I&#39;m just not sure how to do this or if it can be done… but to do this the way that I know how to do it poses more problems as it would require getting the value and then setting it back after the change…</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var session = Ti.App.<span class="hljs-keyword">Properties</span>.getList(<span class="hljs-string">'session'</span>);
session.color = <span class="hljs-string">'blue'</span>;
Ti.App.<span class="hljs-keyword">Properties</span>.setList(<span class="hljs-string">'session'</span>, session);
</code></pre><p>But this method of reading the session object, changing it and then rewriting the whole object back the the list has a problem if&#x2F;when multiple items are being edited at the same time. For example, if the session is being edited by two different areas of the app at the same time, say color is being set from green to blue and height from 180 to 100, the one that finishes last will be saved, but the other will be written back to it&#39;s previous value.</p>
<p>I&#39;m guessing that this idea of using a single object like a master multi-purpose &quot;session&quot; property in a Ti.App.Properties.setList item won&#39;t work as I&#39;d like, but I figured it is worth asking, as I like the potential tidiness of it.  Thoughts?  Ideas?</p>

							<p>Hi Trevor </p>
<p>Good news you are right twice - bad news not how you want.</p>
<p>You are right to ask, you never know - even if, like you have - spent a good amount of testing and trying before asking.</p>
<p>And you are right that the properties however are set and forget rather than variables.  You are storing a copy of the variable &#39;by value&#39; (a snapshot) rather than by reference (updateable as you want).</p>
<p>You will need to set the list property each time you make a change.  You could do this inside the safety of a CommonJS module, by safety I mean nail the functionality in there and then call your custom update call that handles the x lines of code to safely set the changes.</p>
<p>The list property is very useful, just not as perfect as you would have liked.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
