			<h1>Map v2 with older play services</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m finding that trying to use the Maps v2 module will crash an app completely on play services that are not completely up to date. </p>
<p>On a test device, play services v4.0.34 (924341-34) will cause a crash.<br>Updating play services to v5.0.84 (1259630-034) fixed the issue.</p>
<p>The problem here is that I can&#39;t assume everyone using my app will have newer play services. Considering that the maps module has been around for a while, it seems likely that the older play services worked at one time.</p>
<p>Is there a documented way to support some of the older play services so users who are not updating their phones will be able to run my app with Maps v2?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Short answer; No.</p>
<p>Longer answer;</p>
<p>Use this to check if the google services are available before you attempt to add a map.  This will then make sure no errors occur, and the app is stable.</p>

<p>This method also returns a value that explains the reason it was unsuccessful.  You can then inform the user what they will need to do to sort the problem - or to explain that; things have moved on and newer versions are now needed to use newer features.</p>
