			<h1>Deployment is not using proper directory</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I first installed Titanium Studio 1.0.2 on Windows and used Deployment to upload edited files to a web site on Linux - worked fine.  I then upgraded to 1.0.4, and when I uploaded files, they were placed in the directory shown as the &quot;Remote Path&quot; in the Connection window and no longer in a subdirectory of that path. I just upgraded to 1.0.7 hoping this would be fixed, but alas, when I upload a file that is in any subdirectory on my local site, that file is placed in the Remote Path directory.  How can I get the old proper behavior working again?</p>
