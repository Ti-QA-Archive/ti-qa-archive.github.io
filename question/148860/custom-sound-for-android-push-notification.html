			<p>Can I use mp3 file as a push notification sound for android (when sending them through ACS)? If no, what type of files are allowed? </p>
<p>I tried to use an mp3, but when the notification comes, it looks like something else is played, just a regular very quiet beep.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>Thank you for your comment! I am still not sure how to properly process the notifications on the device. I.e. I call the notify rest service from the server, then there is a callback event listener on the mobile app that listens for the notifications. Here is what I currently have in this function (basically, it just shows the toast notification):</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">onNewOrderPushed</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{
        Ti.API.debug(<span class="hljs-string">'Received a new push message'</span>);
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (config.isAndroid) {
            <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> toast = Ti.UI.createNotification({
                message: e.payload.message ? e.payload.message : <span class="hljs-string">"New order has been received"</span>,
                duration: Ti.UI.NOTIFICATION_DURATION_LONG
            });
            toast.show();
        }
        loadOrders();
    }
</code></pre><p>Should I add some sound logic here? Or is it supposed to play automatically since I already set the sound in the rest service?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

										<p><p>I haven&#39;t used ACS, so I&#39;m not sure about how you&#39;ve set your sound in the REST service.  Perhaps that sound property is passed down in the <strong>e.payload</strong> ?  At any rate, it seems a bit strange to me to specify a sound on the server side.  Why not do that in the client application?</p>
<p>Further, I would probably not use a toast (<strong>TI.UI.Notification</strong>) as my notification method.  Toasts are very transient in the android world.  You may have a good understanding of this already, and you may have your reason for selecting a toast.  If so, forgive me.</p>
<p>But I would suggest that you use <strong>Ti.Android.Notification</strong> instead.  That creates a true system notification that will show up and stay in the notification bar until it is acknowledged by the user.  It is  a much more robust mechanism for alerting the user.</p>
<p>When you call <strong>Ti.Android.createNotification()</strong>, you can specify a sound parameter, which is a URL to a sound file on the device.  You will be affected by the bug I linked to in my original answer, but in that JIRA ticket, Arthur Evans presents a workaround.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, the sound file name is passed in the payload (payload.sound is the attribute). May be I&#39;m missing something or misunderstand, but here is how I understand the push mechanism:</p>
<ol>
<li>User launches the app, app registers for push notifications</li>
<li>User closes the app</li>
<li>Push notification is send from the server to the app</li>
<li>Push notification is displayed in the tray (utilizing CloudPush module for android). User may launch the application if they tap on it. However, if the sound is not played at the moment, user may not even notice the notification. For the purposes of my app, I need user to immediately notice the notification as soon as it is delivered.</li>
<li>For sound to be played by the callback function, the application should be running (if in background, be active), if the application is not running, the sound is not played.</li>
</ol>
<p>So I would prefer to do all the logic on the server + utilize the CloudPush module rather than create additional code in the callback function that may or may not be executed…</p>
