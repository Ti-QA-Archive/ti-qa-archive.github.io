			<h1>[ERROR] :  Project failed to build after 311ms</h1>

		<section>
			<p>I have had a &quot;Request module not found&quot; problem for months now. I&#39;m not sure what happened, but suddenly I started seeing &quot;failed with exit code 1&quot; and the above error together when I &quot;run&quot;.So I reinstalled Ti Studio and Android SDK. Still got the error. So, per some answers on this forum regarding this problem, I copied aapt.exe, dx.bat and dx.jar from build-tools to platform-tools. No change in the result. So I created a new default project with no modifications. When I  built it and &#39;run&#39; it  I don&#39;t get the first line , i.e., &quot;failed with exit code 1&quot;, but I still get &quot;project failed to build after xxxms&quot;. This , as I said is with a mobile project created by Ti Studio!! This is a giant step backwards. Any help will be appreciated</p>

							<p>Hi,<br>It&#39;s the step that we have to do what you did. But, did you try upgrading the Titanium Studio ?</p>
<p>Also, trying wiping out the Android Emulator, Incase it&#39;s still using the old one.<br>I will ask you try to run this shell script by placing this in a file (save in a file as wipeEmulator.sh and run as<br><strong>cmd &gt; sh wipeEmulator.sh</strong> )</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-shebang">#!/bin/sh</span>
rm -R ~/.android/avd/*
rm -R ~/.titanium/*.sdcard
rm -R ~/.titanium/*.lock
</code></pre>

										<p><p>Thanks for your response, Ranjith. I believe I&#39;m already using the latest ti studio at 3.1.1.GA? Tried executing your script in DOS and it errors out indictating that &quot;sh&quot; is not a recognizable command.. Just to give you a little background, I&#39;ve been using Ti Studio to compile and run my application for a long  time. I didn&#39;t encounter errors &quot;requested file not found&quot; when I added a module project. So I&#39;ve been searching and trying different suggestion in order to eliminate that error.  Then I started getting the &quot;exit 1 &quot; error along with the &quot;Project failed to build&quot; error. So I created a default module project but still get &quot;exit 1&quot;. After re-installing Ti Studio and Android SDK I still get the Project failed to built error but not the exit 1 error. Any further assistance will be appreciated.</p>
