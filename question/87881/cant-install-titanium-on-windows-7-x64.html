			<h1>Can&#39;t install Titanium on Windows 7 x64</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi guys, i can&#39;t install the Titanium appcelerator on my PC with Windows 7 Professional x64. While downloading of SDK files it fails with a message &quot;Download Failed&quot;. On my another PC with Windows XP SP2 the installation process completed successfully (i&#39;m using the same internet connection for both PC). I believe the issue isn&#39;t my internet connection, because i was trying to install the Titanium from other place, but have failed.<br>Thanks for any help on this issue.</p>
<p>&#x2F;Gennady</p>

<p>What about downloading the package to the XP machine and then transferring it over the local network or using a flash disk?</p>
<p>It&#39;s not the ideal solution, but this seems to be an issue with your machine rather than a Titanium problem.</p>

							<p>Thank you, Hal, for the reply.<br>My first idea was the same as yours. But from where i can download the full setup package? I have tried all links, but they&#39;re all leads to the Titanium Developer.msi which is an Internet setup package and which i already have.</p>

<p>Did you manage to resolve this?</p>
<p>If not, try disabling your antivirus software and possibly your firewall, although remember to reenable them when the update is complete.</p>
<p>Also, are you behind a proxy server? If so, follow the instructions <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;installing_on_windows.html#titanium_diagnostics_for_windows">here</a></p>

							<p>Thanks for the reply, Hal.<br>I&#39;ve solved the problem by myself a few days ago. Just have rebooted the system in a safe mode with a network support. And the Titanium was successfully installed. I guess the problem was in my ESET antivirus software, but the disabling of antivirus software doesn&#39;t resolve the issue when the Windows is in an ordinary mode. I think because the core process of antivirus left and is prevented the normal installation of Titanium. </p>
<p>So the solution was, the first is to disable the antivirus software, the second is reboot the Windows in the safe mode and install the Titanium.</p>
