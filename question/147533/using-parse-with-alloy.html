			<h1>Using PARSE with Alloy?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Has anyone tried using www.parse.com with Alloy yet and have any success?  How would you install and reference the framework within your project? I found 2 web pages related to parse and titanium so I wondered if anyone has it working with Alloy and have an example?</p>

							<p>Thanks Aaron I actually got parse working in Alloy and I couldn&#39;t believe how easy it was. I like parse for the GUI for the database on the server side and it has lots of neat functions with geocoding that I want to try out. I&#39;m building a bunch of functions for a really good sample app so people can see how easy it is to use in alloy and i will upload the project for people to see and play around with parse using titanium.</p>

										<p><p>Just curious what functions that you are finding for parse.com that does not exist in Appcelerator Cloud Services? I think that both are great solutions, just did not realize there was a difference.</p>

										<p><p>These may or may not be in the appcelerator cloud services but I just couldn&#39;t find them. I want to be able to get objects that are in a certain radius in miles and return only those points on the server side. Ex I have 4000 records in the database and want to return only records that are within 5 miles of my current location. Parse will allow me to put in a distance variable and return only 20 records instead of having to return all the records and figuring out which ones are within that range on the device. </p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if its just my preferance from doing client&#x2F;server and web apps for so long but the GUI on parse&#39;s website seems more intuitive to me and I can create tables and relationship fairly easily with no coding required using the data browser. I can create cloud functions fairly easily and essentially have &quot;stored procedures&quot; that I can call from the cloud. On the appcelerators cloud services I goto the app management and I see groups of data to manage such as chats,collections, data files, photos…etc.. but Im not sure on how to exactly use them. Essentially I just want to be able to create tables of structured data and tables of unstructured data (pictures, files, music..etc) that I can setup with relations all on the data management side and then easily add, remove,update, and call from code. </p>
<p>Appcelerators cloud services may have more features to offer but at a glance I dont see the side by side pros and cons for each. Its too bad theres no classes or demonstrations in NY for the appcelerator cloud services because ideally you would want your development software and dbms to always be in sync as far as support and compatability. My work will not send me to california no matter how many times i ask lol. Parse just seems very intuitive and required very little research to get started with the data storage aspect so I could concentrate on the coding side for the app.</p>

										<p><p>you can do that in ACS… geoQuery support <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.appcelerator.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;search_query#geo">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.appcelerator.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;search_query#geo</a> might not be clear, but it is there</p>

							<p>PARSE would be in &quot;native land&quot;. So you would need to create proxies: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;video&#x2F;52765326</p>
