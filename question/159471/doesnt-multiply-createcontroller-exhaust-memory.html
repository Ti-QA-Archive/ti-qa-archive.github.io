			<h1>Doesn&#39;t multiply createController() exhaust memory?</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I was wondering whether I should implement alloy controllers to be singletons. Sometimes user navigates back and forth between same screens. When he hits back, it&#39;s fine as he navigates to previous screen instance but when he tries go to forward, he clicks a trigger that creates new controller for the 2nd screen. For instance:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">-<span class="hljs-function"> (</span>inside screen1<span class="hljs-function">)</span>: hits trigger button: creates<span class="hljs-instruction"> new </span>instance of screen2: jumps to screen2
-<span class="hljs-function"> (</span>inside screen2<span class="hljs-function">)</span>: hits back button: goes back to screen1
-<span class="hljs-function"> (</span>inside screen1<span class="hljs-function">)</span>: hits trigger button: creates NEW<span class="hljs-instruction"> instance </span>of screen2: jumps to screen2
</code></pre><p>Now what happens with previous instance of screen2? Does it lie in memory unused? If I didn&#39;t store it&#39;s reference, I won&#39;t find it again.<br>Disadvantage of using a singleton would be that sometimes we don&#39;t want to keep old data and we have to add method to purge i.e. textfields but I&#39;m still not sure if creating Singletons is not an overkill.<br>Is it common practice to destroy controller every time we leave it (hit back button) by using <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Alloy.Controller-method-destroy">Destroy()</a> method?</p>
<p>Thanks for your comments!</p>

							<p>Can I answer &quot;It depends&quot; and be done? :o)</p>
<p>It really depends on your needs at that point in that application. createController() on its own doesn&#39;t exhaust memory. If you&#39;re going to repeatedly need a controller, and have it preserve state, then creating a singleton probably makes sense. If you have different conditions, then it wouldn&#39;t make sense.</p>
<p>Regardless, you&#39;ll want to profile the memory use of your app to make sure you&#39;re not leaking memory. Instruments on OSX is best for this. Monitor&#x2F;DDMS is a less helpful tool (a limitation of Google&#39;s tooling, not Appcelerator&#39;s). Either way, you want to see objects being released and memory use not growing needlessly over time. Correct any issues you find or your users will find them and give your app low ratings (or just uninstall it).</p>
<p>(To answer your specific question about screen2 object, if you don&#39;t store a reference to it when you create it, that object will be destroyed the next time JavaScript garbage collects memory.)</p>

										<p><p>So far when I needed to preserve any information I was simply passing it as an argument(s) when creating new controller. Usually I don&#39;t have to pass anything further than to next screen only. Optionally I could add the same data to some global variable and then nullify it when not needed.</p>
<p>Correct me if I&#39;m wrong but I thought that only objects that equal <code>null</code> are collected by garbage collector. If I don&#39;t nullify old <code>screen1</code>. How does JS know that it&#39;s collectable? (just curious) :)</p>

										<p><p>Variables are collected <em>only when there are no references to them</em>. Setting a variable to null will reduce the amount of memory used by that object. But if something still refers to it, the variable won&#39;t be collected.</p>
<ul>
<li>Never store variables in the global scope (there&#39;s always a reference to global variables)</li>
<li>Always declare variables using the <code>var</code> keyword (otherwise you&#39;re implicitly creating a global variable)</li>
<li>When possible, wrap variable declarations in functions so that those variables can go out of scope and be collected.</li>
<li>Try not to declare variables at all when instead you can just instantiate inline. For example:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// don't do this</span>
$.button.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{
  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> fooWindow = Alloy.createController(<span class="hljs-string">'foo'</span>);
  fooWindow.getView().open();
});

<span class="hljs-comment">// when this does the same thing without creating a variable</span>
$.button.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{
  Alloy.createController(<span class="hljs-string">'foo'</span>).getView().open();
});
</code></pre><p>(Of course, those are wrapped in a function, so the first technique doesn&#39;t necessarily create a problem. It&#39;s just the code example that popped into mind for &quot;just instantiate inline&quot;)</p>
<ul>
<li>Use CommonJS modules, so that as many variable declarations as possible are wrapped in the module. Later, you can null out (or let the module instance go out of scope) and automatically mark all its child objects as ready to be garbage collected.</li>
</ul>
