			<h1>Tabgroup &#34;add&#34; view not working; used for customization</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>lastest build 2.0.1; ios</p>
<p>I used to be able to override the tabs in a tab group very nicely via adding a container view to the tabgroup;</p>
<p>this functionality has now disappeared not matter what you add to the tabgroup it is not shown; I can only assume this is not on purpose as overriding the tab groups is surely a common use case; </p>
<p>I have tried various methods to try to get this to work; ie zIndex but nothing is working</p>
<p>any help</p>

							<p>Don&#39;t know what you mean by overriding tab group, but to add tab you have to use &quot;addTab&quot;.</p>

										<p><p>I mean make look different; </p>
<p>yep me knows how to add a tab to the tab group</p>
<p>before you could add a view to the tabgroup; make the view the same size as the tabs and you then have a customised looking tabgroup; </p>
<p>you still can add a view however the view is not shown; this is what has changed from 1.8</p>

										<p><p>Yeah, probably is ignored.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t know, probably your best bet is to emulate tab group with basic views. Try to find how other devs managed to solve that.</p>

										<p><p>seems strange that they decided not to let tabgroup to be able to add views;<br>firstly is massively easier to just add a background view and then add buttons in as any animations or anything that one needs to do to the tab group remains; ; doing you own tab group and then hiding tabs means height problems as manually need setting on the window; generally a crap decision not to allow tabgroups to add a view; how many application creators actually want to customize a tab group; I would say  many many many; I know what implementation is easier and more maintainable;</p>

										<p><p>I believe they&#39;ve done that because of parity between platforms.</p>
