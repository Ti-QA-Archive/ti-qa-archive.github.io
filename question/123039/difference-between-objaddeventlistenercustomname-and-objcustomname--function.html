							<p>One is event listener, other object method. The difference is that event listener function is triggered by some event (click for example), while object method is called from your code.</p>

										<p><p>thanks Ivan but when you get into the custom (non click) events aren&#39;t they basically the same?</p>

										<p><p>Event handler function is function as any other. Only difference is argument passed to it. Which one is faster … well, I don&#39;t know. You can write performance test to see, but that irrelevant in overall application performance.</p>

							<p>Another difference is that with addEventListener as the name implies is that you are adding new event listeners to a list of event listeners. So you can have multiple interested parties listening in.</p>

							<p>Not to forget that cross execution context events with bundled data is the only way to pass data between execution contexts in titanium Mobile. So you fire events and set eventlisteners on the receiving execution context.</p>
<p>eventlisteners are perfect for dealing with asynchronous execution flow. For example, you do an AJAX or database call and need to process the data so it can be consumed by tableviews, or anything. Returning the data from an AjAX or DB method and passing it to a UI constructor might fail due to synchronization issues, but you can fire en event with data from inside the method and have Ti.App.eventListener deal with the data. Of course you could have methods on the original AJAX ro db call, but I find that it makes the code less maintainable, by mixing UI with data stuff. And as Shamsul mentions, you can have multiple eventlisteners subscribed to the event, even in different execution context.</p>
<p>Regarding performance, I guess the difference might be negligible. Under some circumstances it can be the only safe way of keeping execution flow from synchronization trouble…</p>
