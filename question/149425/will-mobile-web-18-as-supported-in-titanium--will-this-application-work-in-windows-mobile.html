							<p>Titanium Mobile Web 1.8 is really old. There&#39;s been significant improvements since 1.8 was released. The current version is 3.0.2.</p>
<p>In any case, Titanium Mobile Web does not support Windows Phone 7. We do however &quot;run&quot; on Windows Phone 7.5 (Mango), but functionality is severely limited. The biggest limitation is that Windows Phone 7.5 doesn&#39;t support w3c touch events, so UI elements such as TableView, ScrollView, ScrollableView, and gestures don&#39;t work at all.</p>
<p>Windows Phone 8 also doesn&#39;t support w3c touch events, so things aren&#39;t improved. However, Windows Phone 8 does have a new touch API Microsoft invented that Titanium Mobile Web does not currently support, but hopefully will some day.</p>
<p>In short, it will be extremely difficult to create a decent mobile web experience for Windows Phone users regardless of what framework you use.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Chris for this valuable information. So what this implies if I develop my pages in html5&#x2F;css3.0&#x2F;js .. I will not be able to use features such as camera, geo-location, bluetooth and other native feature of windows-7 and windows-8 by any means. Is there by any chance any deployment option available for windows mobile in Titanium or its not just not compatible..</p>

										<p><p>Titanium Mobile Web runs in mobile web browsers. Most mobile web browsers do not expose things like camera and bluetooth. Titanium Mobile Web does support geo-location provided the browser supports it.</p>
<p>We are working on added native support to Titanium for the Windows Phone platform. It&#39;s not done yet and I don&#39;t know when it&#39;ll be available. Could be a while.</p>
<p>As far as Windows Phone is concerned, given the major limitations of the Internet Explorer web browser, you will be able to provide a much better user experience in a native app.</p>

							<p>It will work, but keep in mind that it will have a <strong>limited</strong> feature set since it will be a web application.</p>
