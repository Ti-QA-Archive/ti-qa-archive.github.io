			<h1>Failed to load NSMainNibFile MainWindow_ipad.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>First off, I love this development platform. </p>
<p>I downloaded the latest release of titanium for my new macbook pro. I then downloaded the latest version of iOS SDK (xcode 3.2.3 and iphone sdk 4), and tested out the kitchen sink project and a brand new project. Titanium failed to build either projects, and then I looked online and installed the patch:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2010&#x2F;05&#x2F;titanium-and-iphone-os-4.html</p>
<p>I tried again, and this time I got a little farther. It built the app, but opened up an ipad window. When I tried the kitchensink, it briefly flashed the title screen then went black in the ipad emulator. It also gave me this error, while compiling the javascript:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">
[WARN] JavaScript compiler reported <span class="hljs-string">"'interval' was used before it was defined."</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">at</span> examples/animation_points.js:<span class="hljs-number">44</span>

This was followed <span class="hljs-keyword">by</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">about</span> <span class="hljs-number">100</span> more similar Warnings
</code></pre><p>It then loaded in an ipad emulator and gave me this:</p>
<p>Failed to load NSMainNibFile MainWindow_ipad.</p>
<p>When I tried building my blank test application it opened up the ipad window, opened and briefly flashed the appcelerator default screen and gave me this error again:</p>
<p>Failed to load NSMainNibFile MainWindow_ipad.</p>
<p>If anyone can help, I&#39;d really appreciate it. Thanks</p>

							<p>It&#39;s a little odd but you can try editing the js file it mentioned and:</p>
<ul>
<li>At line 44: change &quot;var interval&quot; = to &quot;interval =&quot;</li>
<li>At line 2: insert &quot;var interval;&quot;</li>
</ul>

							<p>Yeah, but the problem with that is that might fix it in that spot, but there were a hundred other issues just like it that it displayed. So this leads me to believe that there is a deeper underlying issue.</p>

										<p><p>I agree - but if it fixes it - then you have a little more information than before.  If it doesn&#39;t then it indicates a different type of problem.</p>

							<p>Well I found a solution. I changed the SDK from 3.2 to 4.0 and it worked perfectly.</p>

							<p>I have to ask the question - WTF with all of the patching and backdooring? Why can&#39;t the Titanium team have everything you need on one page with detailed instructions ready to go?</p>
<p>I understand that if you&#39;ve been using the Titanium app for a while and it works for you. Yippee. Get over yourselves and show some love to those that are just now entering the Appcelerator world when Apple has done a major upgrade, which I guess forces Titanium to do one. If the iPhone SDk isn&#39;t jiving with the Appcelereator SDK, THEN FREAKING SAY THAT AT THE VERY BEGINNING!! Don&#39;t make it sound all rosy that you can download this SDK, download that SDK and produce your first app shortly there after. </p>
<p>It&#39;s frustrating as hell to down load an app that tells me one thing and then I have to go in an rename this, delete that, alter this and move something else just for the damn app to work. </p>
<p>FIX IT and make it work so those of us that are new don&#39;t have to find a thread buried in your forum that says, &quot;Oh yea, you need to do the following just so you can view the Kitchen Sink.&quot;</p>
<p>If I am off the path, flame away. But if I am even close to be right, then do the right thing to do is acknowledge that there is a problem and fix it. Hell, maybe even do one of the fancy Vimeo videos showing a walk through showing the setup of the Titanium (which version) and the iPhone SDK (the correct version) and anything else that is needed just to get up off the ground.</p>
<p>I&#39;m like the rest of you - got a great idea that I want to see come to fruition in the Apple App Store, but cannot even get off the ground due to the emulator not working.</p>
<p>Where did I go wrong?</p>
<p>Thanks for your time,<br>Tommy</p>
