			<h1>Threads! My UI events don&#39;t fire while background task is running. They work once it&#39;s finished.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Sorry I can&#39;t paste code yet - there&#39;s a lot of it and I&#39;d need to remove lots before I could post it.</p>
<p>At this stage I&#39;m looking for advice regarding events - UI events (eg, button click), Interval events and Timeout events, as well as synthetic app events.</p>
<p>My app.js has an &quot;Interval&quot; event that checks for data on a server via HTTPClient. If data is there it downloads the data and inserts into a database. This process can take maybe 10 seconds.</p>
<p>app.js also opens a window which is my main UI.</p>
<p>When the process is running buttons on the window work (ie, the button changes colour to show me it got pressed) but the eventlistener doesn&#39;t fire. It&#39;s queued up it seems. So if I press it a few times the event fires that many times once the background process finishes.</p>
<p>I had thought events run in their own threads, but it looks to me like there&#39;s still a queue of some sort.</p>
<p>Is there a way to stop the background task stopping the UI events? Or do fireevents and eventlistening all channel through a single queue of some sort?</p>
<p>I&#39;m on latest libs and SDKs.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.<br>:)</p>

							<div><p>There is definitely some limit on events or something about events blocking further events.</p>
<p>The rough flow WAS like this:</p>
<h1 id="app-js-">app.js:</h1>
<p>&quot;updateloop&quot; (setInterval)<br>runs &quot;app.update&quot; every minute.<br>fires 2 further events (upd1 and upd2) to update different areas of the DB.</p>
<p>&quot;upd1&quot; (synthetic event)<br>updates DB.<br>fires event in win.js:refresh.</p>
<p>&quot;upd2&quot; (synthetic event)<br>updates DB.<br>(doesn&#39;t fire events).</p>
<h1 id="win-js-">win.js:</h1>
<p>&quot;refresh&quot; (synthetic event)<br>updates UI label with a value.</p>
<p>&quot;btnClick&quot; (UI button addlistener event).</p>
<p>In this scenario, with &quot;win.js&quot; in focus, app:updateloop fires and the UI label would update to show me that an update is taking place. During this time the button eventlistener would not respond, but the button presses are being queued. Once &quot;app:updateloop&quot; completes the listener wakes up and the queued presses are acted on.</p>
<p>I tried putting the &quot;upd1&quot; and &quot;upd2&quot; calls into settimeouts to see if I could force a new thread. Didn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>NOW it&#39;s like this:</p>
<h1 id="app-js-">app.js:</h1>
<p>&quot;updateloop&quot; (setInterval)<br>runs &quot;app.update&quot; every minute.<br>calls 2 functions (upd1 and upd2) to update different areas of the DB.</p>
<p>&quot;upd1&quot; (function)<br>updates DB.<br>doesn&#39;t fire event.</p>
<p>&quot;upd2&quot; (function)<br>doesn&#39;t fire event.</p>
<h1 id="win-js-">win.js:</h1>
<p>&quot;refresh&quot; (synthetic event)<br>updates UI label with a value.</p>
<p>&quot;btnClick&quot; (UI button addlistener event).</p>
<p>In this case the &quot;btnClick&quot; event works once, maybe twice, but eventually stops working until the update finishes.</p>
<p>Very weird. But it does seem that fewer events is better and that they don&#39;t like over-lapping.</p>

							<p>My understanding is that threads are tied to contexts in titanium. So, if you need a separate thread, then you need a new execution context. The easiest way to do that is start the process you want in a new Window (using the <code>url</code> property). Just remember to clean up (ie close the window) when you&#39;re done.</p>

										<p><p>Hmmm… seems to work!</p>
<p>I&#39;m opening this window, but the window&#39;s underlying win.js doesn&#39;t do anything visual so it&#39;s not disrupting the display which was what I was hoping.</p>
<p>CreateWindow gives a completely seperate context then and will minimise the overlapping calls I guess.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll make it all &quot;eventy&quot; again so I can fire the update manually too and see if the label updates too.</p>
<p>Great tip - thanks.</p>

							<p>If I am understanding you correctly… you should be correct… but without seeing code I cant be sure… I have a buch of apps that download data in the background and dont lock the UI… the KitchenSink app has some download examples that dont lock the UI… so ether your code is a corner case for a bug, or there is an issue in your code.</p>
<p>If you truly can&#39;t post your code here for NDA reasons, I do freelance work on the side and could sign an NDA and then be able to give you a hand… if you choose to do that, my email is me@mattapperson.com</p>

										<p><p>I think it&#39;s the number of events I&#39;m firing as I fire quite a few.</p>
<p>The app-level event runs in a loop - through record set, running an INSERT for each record. Every 500 records it fires a synthetic event at the window which updates a label&#39;s text to show progress.</p>
<p>That window-synthetic event fires once, sometimes twice, updating the label each time, but after that stops working. It&#39;s why I was wondering if there&#39;s any sort of queue because I think what I&#39;m doing works initially but seems to be subject to limitations I&#39;m not aware of.</p>
<p>I&#39;m wondering if the synthetic event calling is blocking the UI events and that they&#39;re not terminating properly. I&#39;ll remove them now and see what happens.</p>
