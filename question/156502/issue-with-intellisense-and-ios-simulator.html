			<h1>Issue with intellisense and iOS simulator</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi peeps,</p>
<p>Technical specifications:</p>
<p>Titanium Studio version 2.1.2</p>
<p>Titanium Mobile SDK version 3.0.0 and above</p>
<p>Mac OSX version 10.7.5 (2.5GHz Intel Core i5 and 4GB RAM)</p>
<p>So I have these 2 issues.</p>
<p>First issue is the intellisense is not working properly.</p>
<p>I have to enable Titanium Mobile SDK 2.1.4 to make the intellisense working if I have a project using SDK version 3.0.0 and above. I don&#39;t know exactly why but if I don&#39;t enable the 2.1.4 SDK in Project Path, the intellisense won&#39;t work.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not a big deal for me but I&#39;m just wondering if there is any bug related to this?</p>
<p>Second issue is the iOS simulator is very slow unlike the earlier time I used it.</p>
<p>Back then it only took 30 seconds at most to run the app in the simulator after cleaning the project. Then it only take a mere 6 seconds at most on subsequent runs without cleaning the project. Now, it averagely takes 50 - 60 seconds to run the app in simulator after cleaning the project. Then it takes 20 - 40 seconds for subsequent runs. Not only that, the Console also responding very slow at times. The &quot;Ti.API.warn&quot; could appear in the console like 10 seconds after it&#39;s executed in the app.</p>
<p>I admit my computer now runs a bit slower but I don&#39;t really think it will affect Titanium that much since it is just slightly slower.</p>
<p>This is my biggest concern, is there anything I can do to resolve this issue?</p>
<p>Feel free to ask me if I missed any important information.<br>Thanks in advance.</p>

							<div><p>Oh, forgot to put another issue with iOS simulator. Sometimes the iOS simulator shuts down without any error message other than &quot;Application has exited the Simulator&quot; message and it usually happens in first run after cleaning the project.</p>
