			<h1>Ability to detect disabled or restricted conditions</h1>

			<p>I have and app which is in test right now and I have a very specific need.  I have been forced to use the new Facebook module in the 1.6 SDK, due to a serious and fatal bug in 1.5 dealing with scrollviews now fixed in 1.6, and the implementation currently puts my app into the background while Safari is started and used for authentication.  </p>
<p>All is working as expected, but the demographics of this app is young pre-teen to teenage, and we have a requirement that the app run with the possibility of Safari being restricted.  If a parent wants to restrict the device from accessing Safari we still need to function.  </p>
<p>I think the Appcelerator developers have made an oversight here, or it is a bug…which ever you prefer.  First, webviews still continue to function even when Safari is restricted which is good, so why not allow for an optional param to be specified and enable a FBDialog interface to perform the authorization?  The chrome is what parents want restricted, thus disabling the possibility of opportunities to browse to inappropriate sites. Second, if the first option is not acceptable, then at least don&#39;t crash when the Facebook module is called and Safari has been restricted.  Currently, the app crashes…I am sure this is a bug in the Facebook module.  Third, is there a way for me to query via the SDK and determine if Safari is restricted so that I can disable the Facebook feature entirely?</p>
<p>I am hoping for the third option as I have asked about the first option before and have heard nothing back.  </p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>-Hamii</p>
