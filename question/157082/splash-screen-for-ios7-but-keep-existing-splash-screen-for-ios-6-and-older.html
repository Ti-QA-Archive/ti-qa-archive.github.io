			<h1>Splash Screen for iOS7 but Keep Existing Splash Screen for iOS 6 and Older?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>As we all know, iOS7 uses a flat design so most of us are updating the UI and design of our apps. Because of this, I&#39;ll need to use a new version of the splash screen only for iOS7, but retain the existing version of the splash screen for iOS6 and below. Is this possible? How do we support different splash screens for iOS7 and iOS6 and below?</p>

							<div><p>Hello,</p>
<p>In short: you can&#39;t. It&#39;s like when changed from iOS 4 to 5 or 5 to 6, you used the same splash screen.</p>
<p>The idea is move everyone to iOS7 as soon as it&#39;s out. As happened with iOS6. </p>
<p> Best,</p>

							<div><p>Yup.  Also bear in mind that fact that only 2 days after iOS6 came out, there was apparently 90% adoption of it from iOS5. So, the user audience will be smaller on the lower versions.</p>

							<div><p>Mauro, you should be providing answers as answers, not comments. There&#39;s now no way for the original poster to mark your answer as correct and close this entry. Others like me will come along thinking the question is unanswered.</p>
