			<p>I am working with twitter in my Titanium project in which I am using Dawson Toth&#39;s <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;appc.me&#x2F;social.js">social.js twitter library</a> for user authentication and posting tweets. I want that when a user logs in(authenticated), his&#x2F;her profile summary is shown in a web view from the url <code>www.twitter.com&amp;#x2F;user_name</code>. The user name user inputs in the authorization UI but I don&#39;t know how to grab it from the webview. Anyone please tell a way to do this or any other better solution to meet the goal. Thanks</p>

							<p>Once you have the OAuth tokens required after authentication, it&#39;s far easier to use the Twitter API to get the actual data about the user (including avatar and cover image) and construct some real views and labels to display it how you like.</p>
<p>If you really must do it the way you are suggesting, please look at the evalJS function for webViews to manipulate the HTML of the returned webView html. (This must be called after the &#39;load&#39; event of the webView).</p>
<p>I do not recommend your approach, as your app will break as soon as Twitter decides to chnage any of their HTML. (As they often do.)</p>

										<p><p>This url requires either user id or screen_name parameter to get the user&#39;s info. Where I can get any of the required parameter. I think twitter returns both of these in the authorization response but how to get them in social.js?. Please give me some example. I&#39;ve all oauth tokens but I am understanding nothing. Thanks for your help.</p>

										<p><p>Sorry. This is not the place to get support for the Twitter API. </p>
<p>If you have been able to get Dawson&#39;s Twitter library to work, then I suggest you take a closer look at what is going on and how it works. All the information you need, like the user_id and screen_name will all be available with it.</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s the actual problem. I looked at the library code for consecutively 3 days but didn&#39;t understand where to hit for my required info. Its too complex for me. Anyway thank you very much for your help.</p>
