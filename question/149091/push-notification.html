							<p>Hi</p>
<p>With the Urban Airship model you can register both a unique reference per user and a series of <em>tags</em> that they are subscribed to.  Guessing the ACS version is the same or similar.</p>
<p>The logic would follow like this, image there are five users, each registered for push notification;</p>
<ul>
<li>One = 1 &amp; [red, green]</li>
<li>Two = 2 &amp; [red]</li>
<li>Three = 3 &amp; [green]</li>
<li>Four = 4 &amp; [green, blue]</li>
<li>Five = 5 &amp; [red, blue]</li>
</ul>
<p>So you could send a push directly to the <strong>Three</strong> by sending the unique id <strong>3</strong>, which works for a one to one, but not ideal for your needs.</p>
<p>Which is where the tags come in.  Imagine you want to send a push notification to anyone who likes <strong>red</strong>, now; <strong>One</strong>, <strong>Two</strong> &amp; <strong>Five</strong> will receive the push notification as they all had <strong>Red</strong> as a tag.</p>
<p>So if you build your searches on a similar basis and gave each a reference code, then users could <strong>tag</strong> the search.  If they tagged more than one search then you could send out push notifications they would receive whichever ones were applicable to them, they would not receive other push notifications as they would not have tagged them.</p>
<p>I hope this makes sense,</p>

										<p><p>I am assuming the searches <em>&quot;essentially filters on your data&quot;</em> are being stored on your own server.</p>
<p>If this is the case then each time you save the search filter your should create a unique ID that the user on their own device use to re-run the search again.</p>
<p>As I am not sure what mechanism you are using to re-run the search, this part I will have to guess.</p>
<p>I &quot;assume&quot; that as you get more jobs onto your database, you will re-run your saved searches and IF they return more results now than they did last time you will send a push notification to anyone who saved this search filter.</p>
<p>If this is the case then you would have needed to &quot;re-register for push notification&quot; each time a new search filter was added to the users device, you would have stored the unique reference in as a tag.</p>
<p>So imagine the search filter unique id is <strong>45</strong> you send a push notification out to all those people who favourited search filter 45.  As each user would have been re-register to listen for that tag they will receive the push notification.</p>
<p>So in this case you send one push notification but 20 users could be &quot;listening&quot; out for it, each one of them will display the push notification on their device.</p>
<p>This is complicated and a little more so because of what you are trying to achieve.  But all you need to do is remember that each search filter has a unique ID.  You assign that to the push tags array per device when they favourite the search filter.  Then later on when YOU initiate push notifications to THAT search filter unique ID, it will be received be each device that favourited it.</p>
