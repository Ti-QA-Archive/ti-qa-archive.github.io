			<h1>iPhone - Vibrate phone in silent mode</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I tried searching the forums and couldn&#39;t find a solution.</p>
<p>Wondering if it&#39;s possible to vibrate the iPhone when it&#39;s in silent mode and&#x2F;or the vibrate option (settings &#x2F; sound &#x2F; vibrate &#x2F; off) is disabled?</p>
<p>I&#39;m currently using Titanium.Media.vibrate() and it&#39;s working well except in the case above.</p>
<p>Any help or advice is much appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

							<p>Isn&#39;t this a bit counter-intuitive? You can vibrate the phone when its in silent mode. But if they user has turned off the global vibrate option, then there is a pretty good chance that they don&#39;t want their phone to vibrate.</p>

							<p>Apologies, I could have articulated the question better. I agree as pointed out, it&#39;s counter intuitive to activate vibrate when the user has turned off the global vibrate setting. Instead, I&#39;d like to:</p>
<p>a) check if the vibrate setting is disabled, and if so, display a message</p>
<p>b) show the user a UI to activate it within my app (that is, if we can programatically set this within Appcelerator) </p>
<p>c) revert it back to the original setting on program close or pause</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

										<p><p>Quick tip, this should have been a comment on an answer or on your own question as it makes conversation threads harder to understand in the future.</p>

										<p><p>No, there is to programmatic way to determine or change this setting within appcelerator and certainly no way to do it in iOS.  It might be possible to do it in android but you would have create a custom module if it is.  Unlikely though.</p>

										<p><p>As Malcolm said, there is no way to do this programmatically on iOS, but if its a necessary feature, you could try and walk the user through it.<br>Create a button that would vibrate the phone. Ask the user if they felt the phone vibrate. If yes, you&#39;re good to go, if not, then give them directions on how to change the settings on their phone. If they change it, great, if not, then you&#39;re kind of out of luck on that front.<br>In the end, if you are filling a need with your app, and they need it to function in a particular way, then they&#39;ll change the setting.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Anthony. Is it possible to programmatically check if the vibrate setting is active? I&#39;ve been trying to check &quot;Ti.Media.audioLineType&quot;, but it only seems to return the receiver or headset constant back. OR is a user initiated check (as you described) the only way?</p>

										<p><p>Unfortunately no, there are no checks for OS settings.</p>
