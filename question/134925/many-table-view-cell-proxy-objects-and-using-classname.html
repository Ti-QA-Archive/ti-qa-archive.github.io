			<h1>Many Table View Cell proxy objects and using className</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a SQLite database table with 60,000+ rows in it that I need to display in a table. When I profiled the app with fewer rows, I noticed that className effectively manages memory in that very few UITableViewCell objects are created. The issue though is that if I am using a for loop to go through the data and using Ti.UI.createTableViewRow, a proxy object does get initiated for all rows and all of those proxies are actively in memory. Is there a better way to do this so that I only have active proxy objects for the active displayed cells or something along those lines? </p>
<p>I suppose this is somewhat of a general best practices question for creating many rows. :)</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>You could try creating the rows dynamically. Every time you get to the bottom of the table or to the last row you ll query 10 more rows from the db. Also add the same className to all your rows. there is an example in the kitchensink app under BaseUI&gt;View&gt;Table Views&gt;Dynamic Scrolling. hope this helps.</p>

										<p><p>What are your thoughts on this implementation but also with a search bar? Do the dynamic loading by default and then query the database when the change event on the search box is triggered? I suppose you could still do the 10-20 at a time method with a given search, I would just lose the built in search bar functionality and have to implement it with the SQLite query.</p>

										<p><p>Your are right, by doing a limit on the query you&#39;ll lose the ability to attach a search bar to the table and do a quick search with hardly any code, but you are going to be using a lot of memory in creating 60000 proxy objects at a time + every time you scroll it has to display and animate the rows + any event that you add to a row. You are better of querying the DB and do a limit base on the query and you can still use your Titanium.UI.SearchBar object just dont attached to the table.</p>

										<p><p>Another interesting facet is discussed <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;117209&#x2F;append-section-to-table">here</a>.</p>
<p>You seem to still have to use setData when the table has sections, which is fine at first but ultimately will probably suffer from the same performance issues as the user scrolls.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you use an index you would have to reset that each time you lazy load as well.</p>
