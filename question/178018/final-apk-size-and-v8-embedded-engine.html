			<h1>Final APK size and V8 embedded engine</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi everybody, I&#39;m writing a comparison between the actual mobile frameworks to build cross-platform app for my BSc thesis.</p>
<p>I the last few days I&#39;ve made some moves with your Titanium product and I&#39;d like to ask you some questions about the building process about the final size of the installation file and the V8 engine.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve done some Android build and I&#39;ve seen that even for a simple HelloWorld app, the final apk size is around 10MiB. I&#39;ve searched in this Q&amp;A section and I&#39;ve found that this size is due to the embedded V8 engine that have to be included in every apk, am I right?<br>I&#39;ve also read this thread reagarding how and what V8 engine are embedded in every APK.<br>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;132976&#x2F;reducing-the-size-of-titanium-based-android-app</p>
<p>About this thread, in particular, I&#39;ve read that:</p>
<p>&quot;The reason there are two libraries is (from what I can tell) is that there is one library for older device architecture and one for newer device architecture. So if you want to use SDK 1.8.x and the V8 javascript engine you&#39;re stuck with these files sizes.&quot;</p>
<p>Could you be more specific about &quot;older device architecture&quot;? What do you mean?<br>I&#39;ve opened an apk as an archive and I&#39;ve found that there are 3 libraries embedded:</p>
<ul>
<li>arneabi</li>
<li>arneabu-v7a</li>
<li>x86</li>
</ul>
<p>What are the differences between arneabi and arneabu-v7a?<br>In the latest version of Titanium Studio, is it possible to choose which kind of V8 engine to embed in the apk that I&#39;m going to make without removing the unnecessary libs after the build?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help and have a nice day!</p>
<p>Roberto</p>
