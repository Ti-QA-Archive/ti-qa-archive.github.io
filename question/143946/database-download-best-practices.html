			<h1>Database Download Best Practices</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I&#39;m developing an application that will be quite data intensive, so in order to try to limit data usage, I am looking at downloading the database (~30 tables) to the device upon application startup. I&#39;d use database versions to keep the mobile database up to date. Problem is, although it will start small, there will end up being quite a bit of data updated quite frequently.</p>
<p>So my question is when is downloading a database to device a good option, and when is it going to impede the user&#39;s experience?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>I was in the same boat.. 30+ tables, shed loads of data.. Up to 250mb+ for some projects..</p>
<p>If you download a pre-packaged database to the device it&#39;s simpler on the client, you just stream it to the client and then it installs and you are away. It can successfully do this to a very large size.</p>
<p>It only impede&#39;s the users experience on the initial download surely? But it was either then or during the initial app download if you packaged it up there. By having it as a separate download you can offer separate databases, and update the database whenever you like, and not have to wait for an Appstore update to hit.</p>
<p>I tried to go down the route of web-services to build the database from scratch on the device, but with that much data it was a lot simpler to have the server keep the database up to date and just stream an up-to-date one to the client on request. I then use web-services to keep it up to date..</p>
<p>I&#39;d need more information on what you are trying to achieve in order to offer more advice..</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for a great response! Streaming does seems like a good way to go. Here are my concerns</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The database will be updated quite a bit depending on user activity(there is a social aspect to the application), and our client adding new content. I&#39;d like to avoid a situation where the user has to download 5MB of data every time they open their app.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Because the database can be updated so frequently, there is a high possibility that the user will have out of date content(especially on the social side of things).  I know I can pull that sort of data from the remote server, but is that the right way of handling things?</p>
</li>
<li><p>There will be quite a bit of potentially irrelevant data, as the application is location based and the database covers our whole country. The user does have the option to search outside their current location though. Does it still make sense to download the entire country&#39;s worth of data?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for the input!</p>

										<p><p>Humn, the only reason why I use a database at all, is because my construction app has to work offline for perhaps a couple of days where there is no connectivity available (tunnels etc..), so all the project data needs to be there and working and then the user sync&#39;s later..</p>
<p>This is honestly the biggest ball ache of all time to achieve though.. Keeping that much data sync&#39;d with complicated sets of data across multiple tables that need to be sync&#39;d together in a set so that the server can take action on the results of the set (if that makes sense). It&#39;s taken 60% of the total development time to achieve - the functionality of just one button - &#39;synchronise&#39;</p>
<p>So why can&#39;t you poll the server for the data like you do on Google maps? You could then cache it (like you can do in Android Google Maps), and set a DateSync date to prompt your web-service to receive and update if new data exists.</p>
<p>The advantage is three fold. The user starts with a blank canvas so isn&#39;t impeded by a large download. They cache what they regularly search for so your server isn&#39;t spanked and because you&#39;re passing just a date to the server so it can work out whether or not to update for your location based search criteria or not, when there isn&#39;t new data everything works nice and snappy..</p>

										<p><p>Good idea! The main thing the client doesn&#39;t want is to for the application to use data every time the user does something. Your method would then use data for the first couple of searches and uses, but after that would use less and less if I understand it correctly. </p>
<p>Potentially another way to do it is to download data within a radius, say, the user&#39;s city. It might have some implications on the way things are stored and updated in the database, but will reduce download sizes and update frequency. What do you think of that approach?</p>

										<p><p>Yeah it was what I was hinting at.. </p>
<p>With Google Maps on Android you can draw a square and cache a local database for that area, which is neat.. </p>
<p>If you poll the server with your last sync date for that radius &#x2F; lat&#x2F;long then it can send new data down and prompt to delete old data.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

							<p>I have a few suggestions for your original question.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that you run the VACUUM command on the sqlite database on the server with some frequency to cut down on unused space.</li>
<li>Zip the database server-side, and un-zip the database on the device, using <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;774?126273822">Compression Module</a>. Nice and fast, and the customer will love the saved bandwidth.</li>
</ul>
<p>I still feel that updating sections of the data on-demand (if connected) is the better route, though.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the considerations! The project plan at the moment is to use a MySQL database on the server as we&#39;re hosting it in the cloud. So I&#39;m probably going to have to manually transfer the data. That&#39;s part of the reason I&#39;d like this process to be as simple as possible.</p>

										<p><p>Alternate suggestion then… Look into Alloy. There&#39;s a whole model sync level available, but I haven&#39;t had a chance to play yet.</p>

										<p><p>Are there any updates on this thread? Did keeping version server side and updating on user command help? Did You check out Alloy&#39;s model sync adapters? What has been the experience up to now? I think that mobile database best practices should be updated frequently. Like using transactions, storing db versions and remembering to close your db after execution of your transactions. Any comments on this?</p>
