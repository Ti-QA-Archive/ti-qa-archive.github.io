			<p>Hi, I have a question, im trying to develop and app, and i have been reading the docs and forums, but i cant find the answer. Im sure this is stupid… but wel.. i dont know how to do it so.. im asking.<br>In what size do i have to design my buttons, images, etc? The docs said that resolution doesnt matter, what matters is DPI, but when i design a button, with 320dpi (xhdpi) and try it, it looks very tiny, so.. what size should i use for design? and how can i support xhdpi sizes? the docs are not clear about this… Thx in advance guys. Greetings.</p>

										<p><p>Thx Nick and Malcolm! I have a question tho.. Im reading about the sizes of images, but there is something that doesnt fit, in my android project, i have res-long-ldpi, res-long-mdpi and res-long-hdpi. In my res-long-mdpi i have this image 480x320. And when i multiply it for 1.5 (150% to convert to hdpi) the result should be 720x480, but in the hdpi folder the image is 800x480, do you guys know why?</p>

										<p><p>This is due to Android having many variation and aspect ratios that often the best you can achieve is close when attempting to resolve splash screens or background images.</p>
<p>This is where image scaling and device screen popularity within each density comes into play.</p>
<p>Often people resort to using dot 9 images for splash screens - these allow you to define the content area of an image and then specify which portions of the image can be stretched and which cannot - this often leaves patches of solid colours - which whilst not ideal - at least does not stretch or compress the content area of the image.</p>
<p>You are experiencing what we have all gone through when developing for Android - fragmentation, Android lovers hate the word, iOS lovers use it to berate Android lovers.  A smart group of realists simply understand it to be fact and it is both the reason Android is successful and a pain to develop for in equal measures.</p>
<p>Take a look at this report into the Android platform and the fragmentation, specifically the screen sizes to see what you are up against.</p>
<p>The best thing to do is pick the most common resolutions, throw in a bit of dot 9 layout to the designs and test as many brand leading devices as you can get your hands on.</p>
<p>The other thing that sometimes comes into play is density misreporting, sometimes the device will tell you it is a density but in reality the density should be something else.  This is one of the many fun things about software development.</p>
<p>Keep in mind if it was; easy, made sense and always worked - then we would not be the specialists we are - or in other words; we mad people trying to make mad things less maddening.</p>

										<p><p>Ok i saw the report, very useful. im sorry if im annoying, but i have what i think is my last question about this topic, looking at all those screen sizes, assuming im going to try two different screen resolutions with the same density, what should i do with the &#x2F;resources&#x2F;android&#x2F;images? should i create another folder? or put all images inside xhdpi (for example)?  To make my self more clear, i have all these folders, but they dont reference the resolutions, only density, so this is why should i use .9 files or do i have to create new folders to put my images in? Thx again and sory for bother!</p>

										<p><p>I would not try and create two different images for each density, if you do this - when will it ever end beyond creating over a hundred variations.</p>
<p>Many of my Android apps have used the following sizes;</p>
<ul>
<li>ldpi; 240x320</li>
<li>mdpi; 320x480</li>
<li>hdpi; 480x720</li>
<li>xghpi; 640x960</li>
</ul>
<p>If .9 files were used then each of those measurements are increased by two to allow for the single pixel edge that denotes the stretchable portion.</p>
<ul>
<li>ldpi; 242x322</li>
<li>mdpi; 322x482</li>
<li>hdpi; 482x722</li>
<li>xghpi; 642x962</li>
</ul>
<p>Folder names are important here, for standard images in a classic app;</p>
<ul>
<li>{appname}&#x2F;resources&#x2F;android&#x2F;images&#x2F;res-ldpi</li>
<li>{appname}&#x2F;resources&#x2F;android&#x2F;images&#x2F;res-mdpi</li>
<li>{appname}&#x2F;resources&#x2F;android&#x2F;images&#x2F;res-lhpi</li>
<li>{appname}&#x2F;resources&#x2F;android&#x2F;images&#x2F;res-xhdpi</li>
</ul>
<p>For standard images in an alloy app;</p>
<ul>
<li>{appname}&#x2F;app&#x2F;assets&#x2F;android&#x2F;images&#x2F;res-ldpi</li>
<li>{appname}&#x2F;app&#x2F;assets&#x2F;android&#x2F;images&#x2F;res-mdpi</li>
<li>{appname}&#x2F;app&#x2F;assets&#x2F;android&#x2F;images&#x2F;res-lhpi</li>
<li>{appname}&#x2F;app&#x2F;assets&#x2F;android&#x2F;images&#x2F;res-xhdpi</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Tip: Alloy assets compile down to the same location that classic apps start off as</em></p>
<p>For .9 images (classic or Alloy)</p>
<ul>
<li>{appname}&#x2F;platform&#x2F;android&#x2F;res&#x2F;drawable-ldpi</li>
<li>{appname}&#x2F;platform&#x2F;android&#x2F;res&#x2F;drawable-mdpi</li>
<li>{appname}&#x2F;platform&#x2F;android&#x2F;res&#x2F;drawable-hdpi</li>
<li>{appname}&#x2F;platform&#x2F;android&#x2F;res&#x2F;drawable-xhdpi</li>
</ul>
<p>Whilst you can have .9 splash screens - I do in many apps, the support is not complete in current versions.  However Ti SDK v3.2 looks to have full support for them without having to use to &quot;hack&quot; of platform folders.  You can read more about it here;</p>

										<p><p>I will let you know, plus I will be making sure that Appcelerator promotes it.  I am strongly leaning towards publishing either solely or side by side as an interactive book, so everything can be seen as it works - means it takes longer but I hope it makes for a better understanding by people.</p>
<p>I have been speaking with them about promoting all Appcelerator related books on the web site so people can easily find other resources.  Turns out they are happy too - or should I say they are happy for me to and then give them the stuff.  Made a rod for my own back there, but it helps everyone.</p>
