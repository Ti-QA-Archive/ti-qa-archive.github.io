			<h1>ApplicationDataDirectory&#39;s path on PC</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hello</p>
<p>Where can I find the ApplicationDataDirectory on my PC? Which folder is this? I would like to insert a picture there that I can use in my application.</p>
<p>The application checks for updates and is able to overwrite the image with a new image, so I can&#39;t store it in my resources directory since I can&#39;t download and save an image to that folder.</p>
<p>I&#39;m working with iPhone SDK 4.2 and Titanium SDK 1.6.2</p>
<p>Tjeu</p>

<li>Library is now set as hidden on Lion, so you may have to adjust that to see it</li>
<li>4.x.x represents the iOS sdk you built against</li>
<li>random-guid, just browse through until you see your app.app and that is the directory you will find the corresponding Documents folder for.</li>

							<p>With the iphone simulator, the path will be something like</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">/Users/<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">username</span>)</span>/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">version</span>)</span>/Applications/<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">app</span> id)</span>/Library/Application Support/
</code></pre><p>However, this statement concerns me:</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to insert a picture there that I can use in my application.&quot;</p>
<p>You normally don&#39;t want to add a file there using methods on your PC, because the same thing can&#39;t be used in production mode on the device.  The main benefit to knowing where the simulator puts the files for an application are to let you independently examine things your application creates.  For example, I use this to examine SQLite databases using the Firefox SQLite Manager plugin.</p>
<p>In your application, you always want to use the normal syntax to the folder:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Ti<span class="hljs-class">.Filesystem</span><span class="hljs-class">.applicationDataDirectory</span>
</code></pre>

										<p><p>What would you suggest I do then?</p>
<p>I have a map image, but there can be changes made on that map. So at the start, when I upload the app I want the normal image there, but if there are changes I will have to download it and overwrite the previous one.</p>

										<p><p>Oops, I was thinking where databases were stored.  As Stephen says, Documents may be correct for the applicationDataDirectory.</p>
<p>But I still question why you would want to put something there from OSX.  I can see wanting to examine things put there by your application, but not the other way around.</p>
<p>Just my .02</p>

										<p><p>In your application, if you want to download a file and store it in the applicationDataDirectory you can follow the kitchen sink <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;KitchenSink&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;examples&#x2F;xhr_filedownload.js">xhr_filedownload</a> example.</p>

										<p><p>With many of our projects, an app is being designed while the web monkeys on the other side are still throwing stuff up online (web, s3, etc).  Not all of the resources are available for download yet.  Knowing how to temporarily place resources in their final locations before actually writing the code, allows us to dev a bit faster.</p>
<p>A problem that is beginning to show itself even here in the Q&amp;A are &quot;developers&quot; who have no understanding of the backend (inner workings) of java or xcode and are looking for the ease of a coloring book to paint a mona lisa, if you would.  While  Titanium IS easy to get started with cross platform dev, the devs really do need to know more than jscript.  </p>
<p>I&#39;v enjoyed watching some devs, Tjeu being one of them, that are interested in more than just pumping out a cheap app, but to learn the system.</p>
