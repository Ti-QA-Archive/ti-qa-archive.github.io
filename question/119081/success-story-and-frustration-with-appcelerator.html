			<h1>Success story and frustration with Appcelerator</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have got my first app approved for the AppStore. The Android version is finished and is about to be published on the Android Market.</p>
<p>It has all been done in about 6 weeks (including review time in the AppStore). I knew when I started out that I was on a tight schedule. The choice fell on Titanium for being cross platform and what looked like easy to get up to speed for someone that never worked with iOS or Andriod development.</p>
<p>It worked out and the apps were done in time. Success!</p>
<p>What didn&#39;t work out was the cross platform part. We started out the iOS version as that was most important. Half way through we almost got the Android version up to par (only some messaging was not perfect). When the iOS version were finished we realized that we couldn&#39;t get the Android version to work reliably with events between threads. To save the project we ended up doing a fork and rewriting the whole structure. We were out of time to make big changes in the iOS version and we now have to maintain two projects…</p>
<p>The biggest disappointment is however with Appcelerator as a company. As we were pressed for time I sent an inquiry for premium support as soon as we got started. My initial message included a question about available plans and the pricing. After about two weeks I received this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Hi Peter,
My <span class="hljs-property">name</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> Jeaninne Moya <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> I am contacting you <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> two reasons;
<span class="hljs-keyword">first</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> introduce myself.  I am part <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> your account team.  
Secondly, <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> follow up <span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> you regarding <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> additional information you 
requested <span class="hljs-keyword">about</span> Titanium. 
How we can support you?

Best Regards,
Jeaninne Moya
Account Manager
Appcelerator, Inc.
<span class="hljs-number">650</span>-<span class="hljs-number">318</span>-<span class="hljs-number">5134</span>
</code></pre><p>I replied a few hours later with the same question as in my initial contact:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Thank you <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> your email.

I’m interested <span class="hljs-operator">in</span> <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> premium support plans.
How <span class="hljs-built_in">do</span> you sign up <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> these <span class="hljs-operator">and</span> what is <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> pricing?
</code></pre><p>This was on March 25th. After that I haven&#39;t heard anything at all. I can live with some bugs in the software, but having to see info about premium support every time I compile from a company that doesn&#39;t even respond (at least not within 4 weeks) with how much it costs. If it is too expensive for small companies why not post a price indication on the web site?</p>

							<p>I had the same issue, you cannot just buy the support anyways.. they sell you some 5 app package with a bunch of modules that you don&#39;t want for quite a sum of money… pretty frustrating when all you want is answers to some questions.</p>

<p>I can appreciate your frustration with the situation you have described. Although by no means an excuse for it, at the time of, and since, your post our support plans and their pricing were in a state of &quot;flux&quot; internally. This may explain why the response from our team did not reach the level of conscientiousness you rightly expected. Be assured that we will review the reasons why it happened, to ensure that it was an isolated incident and to improve our processes. In the meantime, I hope you will accept my apologies for it.</p>
<p>Since <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;05&#x2F;major-titanium-updates.html">this recent announcement</a>, there is a much better range of support plans, with associated pricing to suit a range of budgets. These are described in more detail on the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;plans-pricing&#x2F;">Plans &amp; Pricing</a> section of our main website.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about this, whether for clarification or to begin a subscription, please contact me directly at community [at] appcelerator.com, and I will ensure that it reaches someone who will give the inquiry the attention it deserves.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

							<p>I have built ipad, iphone and android apps with Ti. Here&#39;s my take, forget cross platform, It&#39;s half BS. You will waste more times debugging than actual coding down the road. As Peter mentioned, built separately. </p>
