			<h1>build simple (wrapper) app for ipad - for developers</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>hi guys,</p>
<p>i need to build a simple app (kind of wrapper) that would have top, bottom and center frame that brings content from a web URL.</p>
<p>Currently I an app build that runs perfectly fine from safari(on ipad), but i would like to have it as native application with ability to disable &quot;home&quot; button once the app is working.</p>
<p>i am expecting that the wrapper should be easy to make, but i need someone to help me make it. i am willing to pay professional charges.</p>
<p>looking forward for interested developers,</p>
<p>thanks,</p>

										<p><p>Yes, he explained further what he meant by that and I let him know that it was against Apple&#39;s policy and even if it wasn&#39;t - It wouldn&#39;t make users very happy at all.</p>
