			<p>Hi Gerd,</p>
<p>Your Appcelerator community Q&amp;A question received an answer to the question titled:</p>
<p>&gt; table view with page selection</p>
<p>Malcolm Hollingsworth answered:</p>
<p>&gt; Hi Gerd</p>
<p>When I first saw this question it looked like an interesting one and I almost created an answer for you.</p>
<p>However I held off, as the last time I spent a couple of hours assisting you ended it up with worse than no acknowledgement.</p>
<p>Having just gone through my most recent answers to people I notice you name appears more than once, each time I have spent a significant amount time assisting you. However no acknowledgement of that effort despite each time providing you with the answer.</p>
<p>I then looked further and noticed you have asked 20 questions, you have never marked ANY questions as solved despite people spending a significant amount of their free time assisting you, working through problems sometimes through several iterations.</p>
<p>I know you know how much time people spend as you are the recipient of it. Yet you fail to do the only thing that is really asked of you - to help both you and those who see your questions in the future - to mark the questions answered to the appropriate answer.</p>
<p>So I would ask that you spend some of your time reviewing those question you asked - all 20 of them and where an answer was provided that assisted or even solved you problem - mark it as the successful one.</p>
<p>By all means ignore my efforts as maybe you think the significant amount of time spent by me was not enough - but I assure you that the efforts of others should be acknowledged.</p>
<p>Read Using Questions and Answers thoroughly.</p>
<p>The down side of of just taking - people stop giving.</p>

							<p>So Antony, maybe is the time to restructure a little the Titans ?<br>I&#39;m kind of sick of this types of &quot;Titans&quot;, you know. Being a Titan should mean something but in any case not somebody that doesn&#39;t understand what a community is and not somebody that still thinks javscript is an uglier word for jQuery…</p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t see any threats or demands in that message.</p>
<p>&quot;So I would ask that you spend some of your time reviewing those question you asked&quot; - This sounds pretty friendly and straight forward to me.</p>

							<p>You say <strong>&quot;Since when can people demand stuff?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Well it appears to to me that you are the one <strong>demanding</strong> more than you are <strong>giving back</strong>. Don&#39;t get wrong though, there is nothing wrong with seeking help, but where Michael has a point is that marking the best answer. Which is not a huge thing compared to the time it takes for someone to give you an proper answer. And complaining about the rules already in place (I assume you are very familiar with them since you are a Titan after all) won&#39;t get you much karma with the community. </p>
<p>I also agree with Dan, Aaron and Sharry when they suggest we all have a hard look of what the Titans program stands for. Being a Titan is about helping the developer community (whether it&#39;s Q&amp;A, blog posts, meetups, etc.). But thinking back, I don&#39;t recall ever seeing your name popup anywhere Gerd… (Feel free to prove me wrong and I&#39;ll take it all back. But in the mean time, I&#39;ll just go with my gut on this one)</p>

										<p><p>No, you did not hurt his feelings. You have not fulfilled one of the main things that we ask of people who receive help on the QA to do, which is mark a best answer if you receive one. Its the best way to acknowledge that you got the help you needed and that people have taken the time out of their day to offer that help to you. </p>
<p>On a related note, this is something that we expect from our Titans. The Titans exist to raise the community, and I would agree with the author of the post that you take the time to acknowledge those who have helped you with your questions. Otherwise you may see a serious drop in the number of people willing to help you out when you have questions.</p>
