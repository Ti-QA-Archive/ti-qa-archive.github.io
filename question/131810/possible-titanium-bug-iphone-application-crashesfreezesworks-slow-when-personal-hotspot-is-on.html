			<h1>Possible Titanium BUG: iPhone application crashes/freezes/works slow when Personal Hotspot is ON.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am developing an application that uses GPS, accelerometer and heading data.<br>I don&#39;t have SIM card in it so I am not on internet with my iPhone.<br>Nowhere in my app I don&#39;t use network data.</p>
<p>Now I&#39;ve put SIM card in my iPhone and application started to act slow and also it freezes and crashes.</p>
<p>I know that I didn&#39;t change anything in my code so I started thinking what was different from the last usage (when application was working normally).<br>I remembered that I&#39;ve put a SIM card in it so my iPhone is on internet now.<br>I went to settings and turned off 3G and EDGE and application was again working normally.</p>
<p>Eventually I would need network communication in my app so this was not the solution. </p>
<p>So I remembered that I had internet tethering (Personal Hotspot) turned ON. I turned it OFF but 3G and EDGE was still ON and my app is working normally.</p>
<p>This looks like a Titanium SDK bug because I don&#39;t see how Personal Hotspot could possibly influence my application.</p>
<p>iPhone 4</p>
<p>iOS 5.0</p>
<p>Titanium SDK 1.8.1</p>

							<div><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>please let me know if you could reproduce that.<br>I tried several more times (Personal Hotspot ON&#x2F;OFF) and after a few times application continued to work normally with Personal Hotspot ON.</p>
<p>At that time when my app was working like that (crash&#x2F;freeze&#x2F;slow) I tried to open KitchenSink and it crashed. But after reopening it, it started to work normally. A few Hotspot ON&#x2F;OFF later my app also started to work normally.</p>
<p>So Hotspot was definitely being a source of problem but the question is WHY or HOW?</p>
