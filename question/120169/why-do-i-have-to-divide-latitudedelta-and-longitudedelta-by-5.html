			<h1>Why do I have to divide latitudeDelta and longitudeDelta by 5?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have my app capture the data returned from a region change in the mapView so that when the user reopens the app they will return to the same location.</p>
<p>I noticed that whenever I reopened the app using the exact data that was returned from the region change that I was in the correct location but it was zoomed out. After a day of working on this issue I had the luckily brilliant idea to use the Kitchen Sink app&#39;s Atlanta location and see what was returned to me. The latitudeDelta and longitudeDelta were set to 0.5, the returned values were approximately 3.5.</p>
<p>The part that completely mystifies the … well … code out of me is that if I store the returned latitudeDelta and longitudeDelta and then when they return I divide them by 5, the user returns to the EXACT location they left from. This is what I wanted … I just don&#39;t understand why it works.</p>
<p>Any insight would be greatly appreciated.</p>

							<p>Hi Kenneth</p>
<p>Did you ever get anywhere with this problem?</p>
<p>If not - take a look at this answer that I gave to another question.  I used your <strong>5</strong> factor as the basis of the answer.</p>
