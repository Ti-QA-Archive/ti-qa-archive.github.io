			<h1>Forging Titanium Episode 6 Cross-Platform Tabs and V8 runtime</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am working with the episode 6 cross-platform tab group to model an app I am working on (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator-developer-relations&#x2F;Forging-Titanium&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;ep-006).  It runs fine with SDK 1.8.0.1 and iOS.  With android Rhino runtime it works but with V8 runtime I get this error:<br>ui&#x2F;AppWindow.js uncaught reference error: globals is not defined; globals.tabs.currentTab.open(Ti.UI.CreateWindow({</p>
<p>Looking more closely, it seems the AppWindows.js module references a global variable set in the main app.js.  I am a newbie to CommonJS but it seems the global variable defined in app.js should not be visible in the AppWindow.js module but it seems to work until the V8 runtime.  </p>
<p>I refactored my code to set the AppWindow button event listener in app.js and it works OK but since I am using this code to help me model a rewrite of an app for cross-platform using CommonJS I was wondering if someone could clarify what is really happening and the best approach to resolve the issue.<br>Thanks.</p>

							<p>In Titanium&#39;s CommonJS implementation, variables defined in global scope cannot be referenced from module&#39;s scope.</p>
<p>That is, CommonJS module creates new JS context (like iframe in browser environment), so even if you do something like change of native prototypes like &quot;String.prototype&quot; (String.prototype.doSomething = function() {}), that won&#39;t be reflected in module scope (typeof &quot;&quot;.doSomething === &quot;undefined&quot;).</p>
<p>Now, is that a good thing or a bad thing can be discussed. :)</p>
<p>Anyway, at the time of writing that Forging Titanium episode, there was a bug in Titanium on Android side that allowed usage of global variables in CommonJS when heavyweight windows wasn&#39;t used. iOS side also suffered from same bug and authors of that episode probably didn&#39;t know about it. Unfortunately, they did&#39;t fixed that yet.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know is that fixed in Titanium SDK or not, but Android side when using heavyweight windows got that right and you can&#39;t use globals. It would be the best if you use some other pattern.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the info Ed.  This may be a workaround for the issue.  I want to emphasize two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>I may not have made it clear but I am running the Forging Titanium Episode 6 code as downloaded and encountering these problems.</li>
<li>From my testing it didn&#39;t seem to be a problem with SDK 1.8 but with the V8 runtime as the code worked fine on iOS and Android with Rhino and 1.8.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope the guys from Appcelerator will give some feedback since this is one of their demos and meant to provide a model for creating a cross-platform tabbed app.</p>
