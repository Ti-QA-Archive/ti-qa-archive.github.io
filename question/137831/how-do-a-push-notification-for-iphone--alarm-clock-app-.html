			<h1>How do a Push Notification for iPhone? ( alarm clock app )</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I am learning how to create apps with Titanium, and I love the JS API stuff. I am a designer&#x2F;programmer, first time creating an app. :)</p>
<p>Now I got a question:</p>
<p>How do I make my app allow for Push Notifications? Without using a service like UrbanAirship, or anything like that.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t need a push notification that can be triggered remotely, I need one that can be triggered by the device it self. So it can work offline. I know some push notifications ( maybe only with a server ?) can be triggered even if the app is closed.</p>
<p>I am building an alarm clock as my first app, I know, I know, been done to death, but I am adding fun features and just learning.</p>
<p>Is this possible?</p>
<p>I want to be able to send a push (alarm with sound and a message) on the screen when the time has been reached, ie. 8:00am.</p>
<p>What in the API allows this to happen? </p>
<p>Do I just do a setTimeOut and have the app check every 5 minutes if the times match then send out an alert, etc? This wont work if the app is closed, and this seems it might be taxing on the device memory?</p>
<p>Any help will be appreciated. :)</p>

							<div><p>I did a test, and the setInterval does what I want, well to display an alert when a time has been reached.</p>
<p>This would only work if the device is not closed, any way to call the function when its closed?</p>
<p>Also - doing a setInterval every 5 seconds - will be too much? Or is it nothing to worry about?</p>

							<p>Okay, so I learned that push notifications can only be called server side, so something like urban airship would be the ideal solution.</p>
<p>However, doing a push notification for alarm app would be overkill.</p>
<p>So new question:</p>
<p>Is doing a setInterval every few seconds - would this be bad or be bad for memory, or battery life?</p>

							<p>Could you not utilize local notifications?</p>
