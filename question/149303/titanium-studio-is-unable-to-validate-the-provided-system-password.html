			<h1>Titanium Studio is unable to validate the provided system password</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Titanium SDK: 3.0.2.GA?<br>Host Operating System: OSX 10.8.2<br>Titanium Studio: Titanium Studio, build: 3.0.2.201302191606<br>Build: jenkins-titanium-rcp-master-372 (origin&#x2F;master)<br>Date: 19 February 2013, 16:09:49</p>
<p>For 2 months now I keep getting this error when I launch Titanium and it wants to install two updates being &quot;Titanium CLI 3.0.24&quot; and &quot;Alloy 1.0.0&quot;.  </p>
<p>I click &quot;Install&quot; button and it says &quot;Titanium Studio wants to make changes. Provide your system password to allow installation.&quot;  Under &quot;User:&quot; it says Lou and is greyed out and I can not change it.  It is &quot;Lou&quot; as a Standard user user and it is &quot;Lou Cipher (Admin)&quot; as the Admin.  However, I work under a Standard user account not an administrator account for security. So I try and enter my Standard user passord and it does not work at all. </p>
<p>Then this screen pops up:</p>
<p>&quot;Titanium Update&quot;<br>&quot;Titanium Studio is unable to validate the provided system password.<br>Please provide the system password in the terminal view to proceed with installation.&quot;</p>
<p>So, under the terminal view it shows the following:</p>
<p>lou-ciphers-mac-pro-2:Titanium_Studio_Workspace Lou$ sudo npm install -g titanium alloy</p>
<p>WARNING: Improper use of the sudo command could lead to data loss<br>or the deletion of important system files. Please double-check your<br>typing when using sudo. Type &quot;man sudo&quot; for more information.</p>
<p>To proceed, enter your password, or type Ctrl-C to abort.</p>
<p>Password:</p>
<p>I try and enter my Standard user password giving me the following error message:</p>
<p>Lou is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.<br>lou-ciphers-mac-pro-2:Titanium_Studio_Workspace Lou$ </p>
<p>When I try and enter my Admin user password I get three tries then this message:</p>
<p>Password:<br>Sorry, try again.<br>Password:<br>Sorry, try again.<br>Password:<br>Sorry, try again.<br>sudo: 3 incorrect password attempts<br>lou-ciphers-mac-pro-2:Titanium_Studio_Workspace Lou$ </p>
<p>So, it seems it does in fact want the Standard user password but says my account is not in the sudoers file.</p>
<p>Any advice…??</p>
<p>If I have to run a certain instruction, what is the exact directory that I am supposed to run the instruction from…?  Do I go to Terminal and cd to a specific directory and run a specific command…?</p>
<p>Please advise as I would love to get started programming - have not programmed in 17 years and I am so out of date and awkward at this point.  Please help stabilize and get me going :)</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Joe</p>

							<p>I was also stuck on this issue on a new Mac with OS X 10.9.3 (Mavericks).  The chown suggestion on this thread did not work for me, possibly because the &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local folder was moved between versions of the OS.  There was no &#x2F;local&#x2F; folder under &#x2F;usr&#x2F; on my machine.</p>
<p>However, I came up with a workaround that solved it for me.  Apparently I never set a Master Password for my Mac.  Here&#39;s how I solved the problem.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Apple menu &gt; System Preferences &gt; Users &amp; Groups.</li>
<li>Click on &quot;Click the lock to make changes&quot; and provide your current user password.</li>
<li>Click the tiny gear icon (below Login Options on the left) and select Set Master Password.</li>
<li>Enter the password you want to use.  Click OK on all prompts.</li>
<li>Next time you try to run Titanium and try to install everything (node.js, Alloy, etc.) the installers should work.</li>
</ol>

							<p>I had the same problem with the password prompt by Ti Studio, but it worked in the terminal window it opened (since I have Admin privs on my Mac).  I wonder if the Ti Studio prompt is length-limited on the password field?  Anyone using long passwords? Mine is 28 characters, and I wonder if it is being truncated.</p>

<p>Logged in as the administrator user, in your case it must be Lou Cipher, started appcelarator and follow the instructions as befor. You will have now enough permissions to succeed.</p>

										<p><p>Hey Simon!</p>
<p>Thanks for answering my question and helping me out here!!!</p>
<p>113 views posted 6 days ago and FINALLY a VOICE!!! :)</p>
<p>So after you logged in as Admin, did the updates…could you switch back to a regular user and program from there and it works…?</p>
<p>If yes then I suppose I could live with that…</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

										<p><p>I have wasted enough time trying to get Titanium to work. I should not have to give the application root access to my machine and why should I have to change my machine set up to make an application work? I do not understand why this doesn&#39;t just work. It&#39;s easy, install software, use software… Unless this product can do this I can not recommend to anyone to bother using it.</p>
