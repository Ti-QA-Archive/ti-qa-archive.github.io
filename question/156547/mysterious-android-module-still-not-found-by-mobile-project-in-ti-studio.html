			<h1>Mysterious android module still not found by mobile project in Ti Studio</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Still can&#39;t find module file. I&#39;ve searched every piece of documentation there is, honestly. It&#39;s been months now. I searched again and found one piece of documentation that suggests a module.zip file is created when a module project is built. However, I&#39;ve built many module projects in Ti.Studio and have never seen a zip file of any sort. Some of the documentation on including a module project in a Titanium project refers to the zip file but is very vague on what to do with it. One post here suggested I create a modules folder within my project because &quot;it is not automatically created&quot;. Another doc talks about the contents of this module zip file but doesn&#39;t say a word about what to do with it. Some of the documentation is based on Ti 1.1. Most of the docs are based on Ti 2.1. Who can tell what&#39;s accurate and what&#39;s not. There is no way  this effort should take me more than a day to figure out, but the documentation is not any help, primarily because of conflicting statements. I&#39;ve received many response over the months and I appreciate them all, but none have elaborated on a solution. Rather, they sort of give a hint without details, which doesn&#39;t help. I respond and never hear from them again, increasing my frustration. I really would like to be able to use Appcelerator Titanium but dealing with this one problem, not to mention all the inconsistencies in Ti Studio is making it almost impossible. Is there anyone out there that can clearly explain why I continually get the error message &quot;module not found&quot;. What I&#39;m trying to do is include a module project with a .jar file in my mobile project. I will once again list the steps I took to create the module and according to the documentation, include it in my main project. </p>
<ol>
<li>Create a module project. Very simple.</li>
<li>Add my third party custom .jar file to the &#x2F;lib file of the module project.</li>
<li>Add an entry to the .classpath file that describes the location of the .jar file</li>
<li>Build the module project (no zip file is created contrary to some docs). </li>
<li>Modify the already created mobile project&#39;s tiapp.xml file to include a module node of the created module.</li>
<li>Build the mobile project.</li>
<li>Run the mobile project…&quot;File not found - com.example.mymodule.<br>Any suggestion or thought would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much.</li>
</ol>
