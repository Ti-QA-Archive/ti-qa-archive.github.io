			<h1>Black screen on boot in between splash screen and window load. Help please</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey Guys,</p>
<p>I have an app that is essentially finished however i have one or two bugs. The most frustrating is this black screen issue im having. Heres what happens:</p>
<p>• I run the app in the emulator or open it on my iPhone</p>
<p>• The splash screen appears then disappears quite quickly</p>
<p>• Then i get a full on black screen with only the status bar showing</p>
<p>• Then the ui and window pop up</p>
<p>I have built a few apps now and this is the first time i have seen this issue can anyone tell me what i have missed&#x2F;done wrong. Thank you very much for your time.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the link http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;9zYxfZcX</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Is this problem simply that you are loading all the UI and then eventually showing the window once everything is loaded, so your user has to wait until that completes before they see anything?</p>
<p>You would be better served by creating a simple initial window show it, add an activity indicator if things really do take a while, adding items behind the scenes.  Especially those elements that are not in the visual portion of the screen straight away.</p>
<p>Plus I notice all your images end &quot;…@2x.jpg&quot; or &quot;…@2x.png&quot;.  You realise you are meant to supply two images; one standard res and the other retina res (ending @2x), but you only reference the simple file name as iOS handles the actual selection for you;</p>
<p>You supply <strong>example1.png</strong> and <strong>example1@2x.png</strong> but you ONLY reference &quot;example1.png&quot; as iOS will automatically selection the @2x file and ignore the other when on a retina screen.</p>

										<p><p>Hey Malcolm, i am aware of the image selection for retina images just have it setup like this whilst I&#39;m coding. In regards to the black window i gave up and have begun restructuring the app using views instead of windows giving me more freedom. Fingers crossed it works out. Its good so far no black screen as of yet.</p>
