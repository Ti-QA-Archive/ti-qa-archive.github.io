			<h1>Optimizing app with hundreds of views, any tips?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have been working on an app which creates tables (tables + chairs) using views.</p>
<p>So, let&#39;s say I want to create a table with 4 chairs. </p>
<p>I have one view which acts as the table, 4 views for the 4 chairs, and a container to host the tables and chairs.<br>So my views for one table is as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Container
 -<span class="ruby"> <span class="hljs-constant">Table</span>
</span> -<span class="ruby"> <span class="hljs-constant">Chair1</span>
</span> -<span class="ruby"> <span class="hljs-constant">Chair2</span>
</span> -<span class="ruby"> <span class="hljs-constant">Chair3</span>
</span> -<span class="ruby"> <span class="hljs-constant">Chair4</span></span>
</code></pre><p>Total: 6 views per table.</p>
<p>All those views except the container view have touchEnabled=false (I thought this might make the views less expensive).</p>
<p>Now, the problem I have encountered is that when I create 50 tables (50x6=300 views), the app responds very slowly (after they have been rendered). </p>
<p>I thought maybe there is a memory leak, so I created an interval to update a label every second with availableMemory. It shows between 0.033 - 0.020 kb.<br>Since I don&#39;t have anything to compare it to, I created a new app with a window-&gt;view-&gt;label and the label is updated every second with available memory, it says 0.033.</p>
<p>Code used in both places: app with tables that lags and a clean app.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">win</span> = Titanium.UI.createWindow({ 
    backgroundColor:'#fff'
});

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">view</span> = Ti.UI.createView({});

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> availableMemory = Ti.UI.createLabel({
    text: (Ti.Platform.availableMemory/(1024)),
    width: 200
});
<span class="hljs-keyword">view</span>.add(availableMemory);

setInterval(function(){
    availableMemory.text = (Ti.Platform.availableMemory/1024).<span class="hljs-keyword">toString</span>();
}, 1500);

<span class="hljs-keyword">win</span>.add(<span class="hljs-keyword">view</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">win</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>();
</code></pre><p>How is it possible that a clean app is using the 24mb of available memory when its blank?!</p>
<p>Also, any tips on how I can show a lot of views without it becoming unusable? What are some things I should avoid? PS: Removing the views is not an option.</p>

							<div><p>Just a comment the simple answer is that is a lot of data andi would expect it to slow down. If you have to have that many views at once then maybe you need to look at the architecture of your app. I am not sure a ui would handle that well, consider only loading the views as you need them and paging if possible.</p>
<p>Other than that I don&#39;t see without your trying to optimise your code which in this case may not really be possible what you can do.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

							<p>How about instead of creating all those views, you create a class that manages your object model (tables and chairs) and then just use a discrete number of windows to display the view you just need. </p>
<p>I am not sure whey you need to have that number of view active at the same time when the user will only see a few of time at a time (i&#39;m assuming your hiding some and others are visible).  Try an on-demand approach to rendering and try to reuse the same window but with different data.  That should lower your footprint and increase your performance.</p>
