			<h1>Apps not installing on other iPhones</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey guys, I&#39;ve been away from app development for like a month and a half, after I came back, I made a few simples apps, and even a simple Hello World, it install on my iPhone which is connected to the my dev macbook, but not in other iPhones, even tho they are registered in the developer center from apple and with the .provision file updated, I&#39;ve been developing apps using Titanium for over a year now, and never had this kind of problem.</p>
<p>It doesn&#39;t give me any error message, it just doesn&#39;t install, in the client&#39;s iTunes, it shows the app, it says it will install, but it doesn&#39;t.</p>
<p>iPhone Apps with the SDK 3.0 and 2.3.4(?), I&#39;m running OSX 10.7.4, and trying to install on iPhone 4s with iOS 6.1.3.</p>

							<div><p>Hello,</p>
<p>looks like you are using an older version of the Xcode. Does your ipa&#x2F;app supports 6.1.3?</p>
<p>Best,</p>

							<div><p>yes, both mine and the other iPhones are included in the list of allowed devices and associated with the provision profiles, I&#39;m also using the main provision profile which is managed by Xcode  and it&#39;s updated &#x2F; refreshed.</p>
<p>The apps do install on my iPhone, just not in other iPhones when I send them the .provision and .ipa files, I personally tried in the MacBook &#x2F; iPhone of a friend, which was also an iPhone 4s with iOS 6.1.3 and it didn&#39;t install.</p>

							<div><p>Hello,</p>
<p>iOS 6.1 is not compatible with Xcode 4.3.2. Please try to install the app within your xcode into other devices, to see if it works at all with your old xcode version.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
