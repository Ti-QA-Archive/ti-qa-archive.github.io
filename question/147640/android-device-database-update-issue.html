			<h1>Android Device database update issue</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have just updated by Android app, however, before I release to the app store, I am trying to figure out a performance problem on a specific device. </p>
<p>At the start of the app, I update a local SQL database with data from ACS. On newer phones (like my HTC evo 3d) it takes about 3 seconds to startup and put the data in the database. On an original Samsung Galaxy S, it takes almost 3 minutes to do the same thing. Looking at DDMS, it takes about 3 seconds to run the insert query on the Galaxy S and fractions of a second on the EVO. </p>
<p>So, is there anything I can do in this case or just chalk it up to &#39;old phone = poor performance&#39;…</p>
<p>Ray</p>

							<div><p>Have you tried bundling up all your queries into a transaction? We work a lot with Samsung Galaxy S &amp; have some fairly large inserts at times (about 3Mb)</p>

							<div><p>David,</p>
<p>Thanks for the nudge in the right direction. Bundling into the transaction sped it up to about 9 seconds… which I can live with!</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>
