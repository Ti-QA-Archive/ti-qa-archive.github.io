			<h1>Scrollable View - insert a view into a specific spot?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Is there anyway to add a view into a specific spot in the scrollable view?  I see the addView method but that always adds a view to the end.  It would be great if there was a way to insert a view into at the beginning.</p>

							<p>Ok well you should be able to make use of underscore.js</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var<span class="hljs-instruction"> array </span>= <span class="hljs-keyword">[</span>];
var view =<span class="hljs-function"> Ti.UI.createView(</span><span class="hljs-function">)</span>;
newArray.push(view<span class="hljs-function">)</span>;

var newArray =<span class="hljs-function"> _.union(</span>array, oldArray<span class="hljs-function">)</span>

scollableview.setViews(newArray<span class="hljs-function">)</span>;
</code></pre><p>So assuming you create an array of views which you pass to the ScrollableView, when you create a new view you add it to its own array and then use the <strong>union</strong> function from underscore to join the two arrays together.</p>
<p>You can then use the <strong>setViews</strong> method to set the views for the ScrollableView.</p>
<p><em>The code above is just an example as I don&#39;t know any of your actual variables</em></p>

										<p><p>Also, by creating a new array it means you could actually add more than one view at a time when joining the two arrays, and note the order of the arrays when placed into the <strong>union</strong> function. The first array will place it at the front of the join.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ll try that, but I believe I&#39;ve gone that route before.  The issue is with the following:<br>Lets say I have 400 things to page through, for memory&#x2F;performance reasons I have 3 at any given time.  The user is on #20 so we have views #19-21 loaded.  The user swipes to go to #19, and so I want to remove #21 and add #18.</p>
<p>If I then do what you suggest above, when I do scrollableview.setViews(newArray) everything gets messed up because the scrollable view no still thinks i should be on view with index 0 when in reality i should be on index 1.  If I try to manually set it back to index 1 then the user gets a flickering effect when the content reloads.</p>
<p>I hope this makes sense?</p>

										<p><p>In the simplest terms you create a simple array with each entry containing as much unique information as is required to display each individual page.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[
    '<span class="hljs-number">1.</span>jpg',
    '<span class="hljs-number">2.</span>jpg',
    '<span class="hljs-number">3.</span>jpg',
    ...
    '<span class="hljs-number">400.</span>jpg'
]
</code></pre><p>Or something a bit more complicated</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[
    { <span class="hljs-string">title:</span> <span class="hljs-string">'one'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">image:</span> <span class="hljs-string">'1.jpg'</span> },
    { <span class="hljs-string">title:</span> <span class="hljs-string">'two'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">image:</span> <span class="hljs-string">'2.jpg'</span> },
    { <span class="hljs-string">title:</span> <span class="hljs-string">'three'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">image:</span> <span class="hljs-string">'3.jpg'</span> },
    ...
    { <span class="hljs-string">title:</span> <span class="hljs-string">'four hundred'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">image:</span> <span class="hljs-string">'400.jpg'</span> }
]
</code></pre><p>You create a simple function that takes three array nodes and then return an array containing each of your &quot;pages&quot; (simple image or complex view).  This is then used to set the views on the scrollable view - replacing the previous views.</p>
<p>The idea is that you show (if swiping left);</p>
<ul>
<li>1, 2 &#x2F;&#x2F; start</li>
<li>2, 3, 4</li>
<li>3, 4, 5</li>
<li>…</li>
<li>399, 400 &#x2F;&#x2F; end</li>
</ul>
<p>Until you get to the end.  </p>
<p>This assumes that this will act as a book where you go from the first page to the last and it does not loop at the end. Then the first and last &quot;pages&quot; are shown as simply two rather than three, this is because at the start you cannot swipe right because there is no page 0 and on the last page you cannot swipe left as there are no more pages.</p>
<p>Keep a variable to say which page is currently being displayed - this is the current page, this will tell you which part of the cached array to take and if you need 2 or 3 nodes.</p>
<p>This way the only information in memory is three pages at most plus an array of data you read from each time.</p>
<p>The OS will re-use any images previously downloaded or shown automatically and will release them from memory if you are running short for you.</p>

										<p><p>The function to use in this case is <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3schools.com&#x2F;jsref&#x2F;jsref_slice_array.asp">slice</a> where the first parameter is the index and the second is the number of nodes.</p>
<p>So, first page:</p>
<ul>
<li>array.slice(0, 2);</li>
<li>array.slice(1, 3);</li>
<li>…</li>
<li>array.slice(398, 2);</li>
</ul>
<p>until the end.</p>
<p>The index will come from the variable which you use as your page count&#x2F;current page.</p>
<p>You then set currentPage to be the respective view of where you are in your index. So if you have 3 views your currentPage will be the middle view.</p>

										<p><p>Your answer + comments helped me wrap my head around what I needed to do.  The only issue I still run into is when I call:<br> scrollableView.views = newViews;<br> scrollableView.currentPage = correctPage;</p>
<p>There is a noticeable flash from the view reloading.  I wish that could go away completely but overall this is working much better than it used to.  Thanks!</p>

										<p><p>Hi guys, I&#39;m also in need of prepending and inserting views on a ScrollableView. The .setViews() method suggested above, works but causes a bad flicker with complex views. I&#39;ve submitted a JIRA ticket to request a proper .insertViewsAt() method. Anyone reading this interested in this feature, please hit &quot;watch&quot; on the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC-4013">ticket</a> to keep interest on it.

							<p>I&#39;m curious, to fix the flicker issue why not insert, for example, 1000 blank views and then add contents to the current 3-5 views in the swipe range? (And remove any content that moves outside of that swipe range)</p>
