			<h1>Placing ads on Titanium</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Do I have the right to place ads (currently admob) on my application developed in Titanium Studio and uploaded to appstore without sharing the commision with Titanium and without Titanium placing ads on my app.</p>
<p>Sorry, but it was not clear for me from reading the latest license agreement </p>
<p>2.4 Advertisements. – Appcelerator expressly reserves the right to serve ads in Studio itself but not the right to serve ads in any Customer Applications unless Customer has given express consent. If and only if Customer has expressly signed up for ad delivery in its Application via separate third party ad vendors (see ad-modules available in Appcelerator&#39;s Open Mobile Marketplace), then Customer grants Appcelerator the right to include ads on Customer’s behalf in the Applications developed with Studio.</p>
<p>Does it mean that appcelerator can put ads on my app ?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>You have a couple of questions so I will answer in order you asked them.</p>
<p>Yes YOU can place ads in your own app produced with Appcelerator and you are NOT required to share any revenue.</p>
<p>No Appcelerator will not add any ads into your app..  Appcelerator does not reserve or assert the right to include ads.  This was a topic that came up a short while back and was answered back then - so this knowledge is based on that</p>
<p>They are only pointing out you would have to have signed up to something to have ads - basically it would have been your explicit choice before it happened, plus you would have written some code to make it happen.</p>
<p>Appcelerator earn their money in other ways including but not limited to;</p>
<ul>
<li>paid dev accounts in several levels</li>
<li>support levels</li>
<li>marketplace</li>
<li>cloud services</li>
<li>value ads</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to create your app, include your own ads, keep any revenue and when you start earning reasonable money consider a paid account and&#x2F;or the other services that Appcelerator offer - or don&#39;t there is no obligation.</p>

										<p><p>You just referred to this fragment as something you still have concerns over;</p>
<p><em>&quot;…then Customer grants Appcelerator the right to include ads on Customer’s behalf in the Applications developed with Studio&quot;</em></p>
<p>You are ready this as a separate sentence unrelated to the first half of the sentence.</p>
<p>The full sentence is;</p>
<p><em>&quot;If and only if Customer has expressly signed up for ad delivery in its Application via separate third party ad vendors (see ad-modules available in Appcelerator&#39;s Open Mobile Marketplace), then Customer grants Appcelerator the right to include ads on Customer’s behalf in the Applications developed with Studio&quot;</em></p>
<p>The first half says ONLY if you expressly agree to take third-party adverts the second half says that if you do then Appcelerator via one of those ad networks you choice will be involved in the process - not the provision.</p>
<p>Read this blog post from the main man Jeff Haynie <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2012&#x2F;10&#x2F;please-review-proposed-license-agreement-changes.html">Please Review: Proposed License Agreement Changes</a> where he goes into it in detail.</p>
<p>But as Stephen says - always seek your own legal advice.</p>

<p>Impractical? Sure. But if you can&#39;t understand the words in the agreement, might want to consider it.</p>
<p><code>Does it mean that appcelerator can put ads on my app ?</code></p>
<p>Which part of this is confusing:</p>

										<p><p>Its nice that you were referring to the part that is very clear.<br>However, the unclear fragment is &quot;then Customer grants Appcelerator the right to include ads on Customer’s behalf in the Applications developed with Studio&quot;. </p>
<p>Can someone elaborate on that?</p>

										<p><p>so you cannot place ads like admob in your app without Appcelerator pushing their ads , that&#39;s too bad.<br>In addition they didn&#39;t specify how many ads they can push and what if it is for competitors<br>I would expect some filtering tool.</p>

										<p><p>You can place ads in your Titanium app using any ad network that you would like. We will NOT push ads to your app. We do not have a system in place that pushes ads to your application and would not do so without your permission even if we did. Since there is no system in place to serve ads, there is no need for a filtering tool. Your app is yours to advertise with as you please.</p>
