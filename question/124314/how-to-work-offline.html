			<p>Hello, I cant open Titanium Studio when my internet connection is weak (very weak) or I am offline (e.g. on a plane). I read that I should never logout. Then I could work offline but how can I shut down my computer without logging out?</p>

							<p>Thanks for your quick reply. That is really sad. That makes Studio utterly useless for me.</p>

							<p>Don&#39;t do a complete shutdown of the computer.  Hibernate or go into sleep &#x2F; standby mode, and Studio should remain logged in and allow you to continue to work.</p>
<p>This of course is not a real solution either – there are times you must reboot for a variety of different reasons.  But a full shutdown is really not needed on a routine basis, even when traveling.</p>

							<p>Thanks for your thoughts. But there are airports where the security forces you to shut down.<br>Now I am really worried about the company appcelerator! Why do they so aggressively observe what I do on my own computer. To me Studio now looks like a piece of spyware.</p>

										<p><p>I am just a user, so I don&#39;t know all the reasons why.  But I suspect a major reason for the login was until recently the debugger was not available unless you were a paid subscriber.  The forced login was probably at least partially to know if they should enable debugging.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t throw the baby out with the bath water.  If you are unhappy with Ti Studio, consider looking at the open source version of <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;121270&#x2F;titanium-developer-130">Ti Developer</a>.  There was talk in that thread about allowing it to run while completely offline.</p>

										<p><p>You don&#39;t need to use Studio to develop Titanium applications. You can use your editor and build on the command line if you please. There are some limitations with doing so, like you can&#39;t build for more than one platform using the cloud, but you can build for your platform your working on.</p>
<p>It is entirely possible to work offline and then package it online after you are connected.</p>
