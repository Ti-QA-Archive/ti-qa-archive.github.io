							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Ti SDK 3.2 has loads of things coming, but most of these can be considered tweaks and fixes - but they amount to big changes&#x2F;benefits.</p>
<p>A few - no particular order</p>
<ul>
<li>Managing Alloy themes beyond tss</li>
<li>iOS7 64 bit</li>
<li>Studio visual updates and refined interface</li>
<li>Direct to device compling for iOS - no need for iTunes in the middle</li>
<li>GenyMotion Android Emulator support - this is big</li>
<li>Lots of command line tweaks</li>
<li>New properties on common elements</li>
</ul>
<p>Ti SDK 4.0, this will be big.  Often referred to as Ti.Next (just show it is beyond now), it includes <strong>hyperloop</strong>, this is a completely different SDK design - basically a whole new re-write of the original.</p>
<p>Some of the benefits;</p>
<ul>
<li>Much faster; compiling and app run times</li>
<li>Much smaller; the size of the supporting files used in the app files</li>
<li>Do everything exactly as you do today - unless you want to go further</li>
<li>Down down and dirty with native elements.  This means you can right native code in JS - in the same code as your existing app.  This means if you need something native - just add it, no need to create a module.  You will need to learn the native syntax - but as it uses JS this will be fairly easy if you are comfortable in Titanium and JS and have a want to go further.</li>
<li>Native elements mean you can add that Android switch we do not have or use iOS iBeacons right inside your app.</li>
<li>Much easier to code for multiple platforms that you do not already code for</li>
<li>Windows mobile is expected</li>
<li>MUCH MUCH easier for Appcelerator to build out new functionality as they will be dealing with one core code rather than a duplicate for each additional platform supported.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read more about <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2013&#x2F;10&#x2F;introducing-hyperloop&#x2F;">Hyperloop</a></p>
<p>There is more, there is lots more.  These are some big changes that we can expect for 4.0, but this is new ground and needs time to work correctly.  This is going to be next year and likely somewhere around the middle - no dates I am aware of have been set in stone.</p>
<p>This is a simple overview, I do not want to go further than anything you can access publicly.</p>
<p>Just know that great gets better.</p>
