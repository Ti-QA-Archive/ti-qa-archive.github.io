			<p>Ok.</p>
<p>I have read alot of post in here and forums and on tha android dev sites.</p>
<p>But i cant get anything to work with my backgrounds.</p>
<p>I have understand that you have to have the folders res-long-port-hdpi etc and make several images of each one and put them in those folders.</p>
<p>But where do i put the folders?</p>
<p>Do i put them in Resources - images - res-long-port-hdpi  or do i keep them where they are in resources - android - images - res-long-port-hdpi or what?</p>
<p>After that how will i make the path for my image files? </p>
<p>Will i just leave it like.  image: &#39;images&#x2F;h3.jpg&#39;    or should do something else?</p>
<p>And finally.</p>
<p>How about that &lt;supports-screens android:anyDensity=&quot;true&quot;&#x2F;&gt;   or &lt;supports-screens android:anyDensity=&quot;false&quot;&#x2F;&gt;? </p>
<p>And what if i dont want to support small screens? (lets face it, everything looks like Sh*`^t on those) How will i make the code for that and where?</p>
<p>When i started building apps i really thought that Apple were idiots for just having one size screen. Well you could say that i´m not Androids biggest fan at this moment…..  ;)</p>

							<p>Try using the leading &quot;&#x2F;&quot; on your file paths.</p>

										<p><p>My bad – I was going from memory, and I mislead you on the folder names.  Try</p>
<ul>
<li>res-ldpi</li>
<li>res-mdpi</li>
<li>res-hdpi</li>
<li>res-xhdpi</li>
</ul>
<p>Still use the leading &quot;&#x2F;&quot; (my advice is to use leading &quot;&#x2F;&quot; <em>everywhere</em> in Titanium – whether you&#39;re referring to image files or javascript files)</p>

										<p><p>Yepp! That did the trick! But now all my other images look like sh€€%&amp;%t….   Ha ha ha…</p>
<p>I am putting a BG image with faded edges instead so it doesn&#39;t matter what screensize it is.</p>
<p>#iamalazybastardandiknowit</p>
<p>But now when i know how to do it i will do it properly in my next app from the start.</p>
<p>Thanx man!</p>

							<p>The directories live in Resources&#x2F;android&#x2F;images, e.g. Resources&#x2F;android&#x2F;images&#x2F;res-long-port-hdpi.</p>
<p>You can probably save yourself some trouble if you simplify your resolution-dependent directories and just make them &quot;ldpi&quot;, &quot;mdpi&quot;, &quot;hdpi&quot; and &quot;xdpi&quot;.  Otherwise, you have a combinatorial problem, and you&#39;re going to have a ton of files to manage.  I suppose some things like splash screens may be more important to have landscape and portrait versions, so you could probably selectively use the more specific directories for images like that.  But for general buttons and logos, I stick to the simpler directory names.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll reference the images as if they live directly in Resources&#x2F;images.  For example, if you have Resources&#x2F;android&#x2F;images&#x2F;hdpi&#x2F;foo.jpg, it would be referenced in your code as &quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;foo.jpg&quot;.</p>
<p>I do not use the anyDensity directive.  I believe that&#39;s for backward compatibility with legacy code (pre 1.7, which in Titanium terms is an eternity ago).  If I understand it correctly, it makes display pixels the default unit on Android, which admittedly might make things simpler for cross platform UI design.  But the Ti devs decided to make android units default to pixels, so I wouldn&#39;t try to fight that – you&#39;ll probably make your life more difficult.</p>
<p>As for requiring a minimum screen size, try <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;doc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;android-custom-androidmanifest">this technique</a>.  I haven&#39;t used it firsthand, but it looks reasonable.</p>

										<p><p>Ok so now i have no &lt;supports-screens android:anyDensity=&quot;true&quot;&#x2F;&gt; or &lt;supports-screens android:anyDensity=&quot;false&quot;&#x2F;&gt; in my manifest and i have made ldpi, mdpi, hdpi and xdpi folders and put them in Resources&#x2F;android&#x2F;images&#x2F; and fixed every background and put them in their right folder.</p>
<p>I have named it the same everywhere and i have the path:    image:  &#39;images&#x2F;bg.jpg&#39;   and nothing shows. Not in the emulators and not on devices.  I have tried every emulator and i have 4 different devices.</p>
<p>So what i have i missed?</p>
