		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m sure this has come up before, but with all the new releases (thanks for that BTW), are there any tips for Developers to speed up Development. When I need to make any change, it takes about 1 minute for everything to compile and get loaded on the simulator. When the app loads, I need to navigate to the right place to test my code. </p>
<p>iOS simulator loads faster than Android&#39;s. I actually connect a physical device to test on Android. Do folks do the same?</p>
<p>Any tips?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>You are not going to like my answer.  I have the advantage of being old and therefore having been writing software long before the modern computer.</p>
<p>The average modern developer writes a few lines of code, compiles - test to see if it works and if it fails, tweaks one value, compile again and continues this process until something actually works.</p>
<p>Back in my day (yes I am old enough to use that phase), we wrote code on paper, debugged on paper, ran test data sets against the written code.  Once this all appears to work and only then did we enter the code into the computer.  Now I am very well aware that things have moved on, the amount of code and the things that need to interconnect have all increased - so the older way of writing code on a sheet of paper first has come and gone.  However the logic that it created can and should be taken into account.  </p>
<p>What I am suggesting is that modern developers should take much more care in creating the code they are writing.  By not relying on a compile to confirm if code will work and instead test the process in your mind first will give you significant increases productivity not only by confirming your own code long before you actually run but also increasing your ability to remember all the keywords and parameters.</p>
<p>So on to tips;</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the documentation</li>
<li>Review to the documentation</li>
<li>Review the release notes for each update</li>
<li>Plan your app, plan everything, revisit the plan and then write code - not before</li>
<li>Wireframe your app before you write any code, it helps you work out which things are common - these you write once and re-use</li>
<li>Break up your code into lots of smaller manageable modules</li>
<li>Define what parameters each module should accept and what outputs the module can provide</li>
<li>Learn when to use CommonJS and when to use in-line functions</li>
<li>Use GenyMotion rather than the Android Emulator - it is much better and much faster</li>
<li>Use physical devices as much as possible as they better reflect the speed and memory of an actual device</li>
<li>Look into <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tishadow.yydigital.com&#x2F;">TiShadow</a></li>
<li>Always consider the code you are writing can and should be designed for re-use</li>
<li>Always consider the code you are writing can and should be used for more than one app</li>
<li>Learn about &#39;underscore&#39; and benefit from it (included in Alloy apps)</li>
<li>Learn about &#39;backbone&#39; and benefit from it (included in Alloy apps)</li>
<li>Learn about &#39;i18n&#39; and make extensive use of it (only ever store string here)</li>
</ul>
<p>Alloy;</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Alloy if you are not already doing so.  If you are mid-way through a project wait until the next project</li>
<li>Use Widgets, if for nothing else, break up your app into sections and use a Widget for each section.</li>
<li>Always use TSS, never add properties to the XML views</li>
<li>Make good use of the &#39;app TSS&#39;</li>
<li>Learn about &#39;momentjs&#39; and benefit from it (included in Alloy apps)</li>
</ul>
<p>The obvious things;</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy a faster computer</li>
<li>Buy as much RAM as possible</li>
<li>Buy an SSD as the primary drive</li>
<li>If you are using a SSD then try and get one that connects via PCI</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything else is app specific.</p>

							<p>You can for sure speed up development. Especialy for android, as the default emulator is way too slow to be usefull. This makes a night and day difference and it&#39;s twice as fast as installing it to my physical nexus 7 : http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2013&#x2F;12&#x2F;using-genymotion-with-titanium-3-2&#x2F;</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for sharing the blog link. I had no idea about genymotion. I believe the getting started guide should mention this to help the newbies :)</p>
