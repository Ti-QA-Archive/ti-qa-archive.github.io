			<h1>ACS Push Notifications do not arrive consistently</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m still seeing intermittent problems with ACS push notifications, as reported here previously: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;150599&#x2F;acs-push-notifications.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve noticed that very short alert messages seem to arrive much more consistently than slightly longer ones (albeit less than 120 chars). Longer alerts are hit and miss and some never arrive at all even after several hours. </p>
<p>I tested push notifications to a specific channel a few times from the acs console for comparison. I often receive the push notification on one device, but not on the other.</p>
<p>Is this a known problem that&#39;s being looked at?<br>I&#39;m wondering whether anyone has seen push notifications getting dropped on the floor with one of the showcase apps if any of them use acs push notifications.<br>If none of the showcase apps use acs push notifications, what do they use, Urban Airship?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>Are you using ios Push? APN has a size limit of 256. http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;mac&#x2F;#documentation&#x2F;NetworkingInternet&#x2F;Conceptual&#x2F;RemoteNotificationsPG&#x2F;Chapters&#x2F;CommunicatingWIthAPS.html#&#x2F;&#x2F;apple_ref&#x2F;doc&#x2F;uid&#x2F;TP40008194-CH101-SW4</p>
<p>The smaller alert arrives faster than longer ones might be related to how APN handles your push. You can check your push log to see when your push was delivered to APN.</p>
<p>Is your other device properly regiserted to the channel?</p>

										<p><p>Wei,  thanks for the quick response. I checked the push log and the issue is indeed that the payload is over 256 bytes. </p>
<p>I am getting a success code back from my calls to Cloud.PushNotifications.notify though. How can I detect programmatically that the send status is fail?</p>

										<p><p>i think you will have to check before calling notify. The reason we don&#39;t return error is because android has a much higher limit than 256 so it is hard to set a limit incase some apps only use android push.</p>
