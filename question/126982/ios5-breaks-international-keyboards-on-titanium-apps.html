			<h1>IOS5 breaks International keyboards on Titanium apps</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>ALL my present and previous Titanium apps no longer recognise International keyboards after devices update to IOS5.  Is anybody else having this problem?  It is easy enough to test, just add a keyboard e.g. Thai and then see if your app recognises it.</p>

							<p>This is nothing to do with an SDK.  Existing released apps up to a year old no longer work with International keyboards when their owners update their devices to IOS5.</p>

										<p><p>Not every time, but when a major update like 3.x to 4.x, or in this case 4.x to 5.x 90% of apps will have some sort of issue that will require a recompile and resubmission because apple changes so many APIs</p>

							<p>Recompiling with the latest available build of 1.7.3v20 has not fixed the problem.  Apps recognise e.g. French keyboards but not Thai or Russian.  Interestingly the Thai keyboard appeared briefly after the app update but then refused to appear on subsequent uses.  This looks like a severe sort of bug to me.</p>

										<p><p>Could you provide a code sample that can easily be pasted into an app.js that can demonstrate this issue?</p>

										<p><p>Hi, it looks like the first 4 versions of iOS - or the first million versions of Titanium - ignored the keyboardType parameter when users changed to an International keyboard.  So anyone like me who simply copy-pasted the US-Centric Kitchen Sink or API Docs examples that specify an ASCII keyboard now has to go through the code of all their previous apps and remove any text field or text area references to a specific keyboardType and recompile with 1.7.3+.  That seems to allow the International keyboards to be recognised again. I hope this is right anyway, one corrected and recompiled app has been approved this morning.</p>
