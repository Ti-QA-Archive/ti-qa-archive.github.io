			<p>Dear Titans,</p>
<p>I am writing this letter to you here as I think there are many developers like me who have the same feeling. So, here goes. </p>
<p>I am writing as a desktop app developer who thought that Ti for desktop was God send for me because of 2 main reasons - no stupid security problems like Adobe AIR and ability to extend Ti unlike Adobe AIR. But alas! You guys have completely abandoned Ti for Desktop and are focusing only on Ti for Mobile which is a fantastic product and you come out with numerous updates.</p>
<p>But why have you abandoned desktop? Why why why? I was going through launching a commercial app using Ti desktop but had to hold on as you guys stopped updating it. You guys came out with premium support and tutorials for mobile but not desktop. You guys have good documentation for mobile but not desktop.</p>
<p>Please bring Ti for desktop from the dead and improve the docs. This product has lot of potential to outsmart Adobe AIR.</p>
<p>Please please please resurrect Ti for Desktop.</p>
<p>A pleading developer.</p>

							<p>I couldn&#39;t agree more. </p>
<p>The saddest part is though that they &quot;only&quot; need to update the javascript and webkit engines for it to be perfect for what I personally need it to do; a branded cross platform browser window to deploy a desktop application environment for accessing a web-application. </p>
<p>However the current webkit version they are using is so slow regarding javascript, that customers notice to big a difference between using a &quot;real&quot; browser and the application, and think it is the applikation version that is slow.</p>
<p>I can see they are working on a new version in the code repository, but then you have to manually build it on all the different platforms, and it seems that you can&#39;t rely on the titanium deployment&#x2F;update cloud functions to handle updates when you manually build your apps?</p>
<p>So if possible at all, please finish up the work you&#39;ve already so far ahead with, and make a public release of the much faster and updated webkit version. It would solve a lot of the troubles with the desktop version, just being able to build with the new webkit engine (as a beta version or something) in your cloud. :-)</p>

<p>That&#39;s simply not true, Josh. Compare the number of points in your Q&amp;A profile with Don Thorpe&#39;s or Kevin Whinnery&#39;s to name just two.</p>
<p>Don&#39;s last post was actually only 14 hours ago.</p>
<p>I imagine they select only the topics that they feel the community is unable to asnwer, or that they haven&#39;t answered at least once before, which seems very reasonable to me.</p>

							<p>All - </p>
<p>Quick touch base as Ralf Pfeiffer (Director of Engineering and responsible for release schedule) will be responding asap on our 1.1 plan.</p>
<p>So you know, this thread has been read by every single member of our exec. team.  Desktop is and will be in our product lineup.  There are several dozen apps built every day using the product and it&#39;s part of our company&#39;s DNA.  To this end, we are actively adding additional investment into the product and will be more forthcoming with roadmap plans than we have been.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your patience - we&#39;ll continue working as hard as we can to make both desktop and mobile products the best they can possibly be.</p>
<p>P.S. - excellent observations, Oscar and Ralf will specifically speak to those points. </p>

							<p>&gt; Personally, I think it&#39;s because they&#39;ve realized that desktop development is dead.</p>
<p>Personally, I think it&#39;s because we have a mobile-app-hype,  a kind of goldrush, and everyone is busy to stake the claims, but:</p>
<p>Desktop development is definitely not dead, and probably will never be. The majority of the people on this planet is still NOT online 24&#x2F;7. And the majority of the people who are, is not willing to hand over their data to servers in Taka-Tuka-Land.</p>
<p>I&#39;m developing an information system right now, and there will be mobile apps for it too, but it really made my hands clammy watching  how Appcelerator has neglected the desktop. I dropped AIR-development and a lot of time has went into doing things the HTML-CSS-JS-way.</p>
<p>At least they assure now (latest webcast) that things will go on with Titanium Desktop and it&#39;s probably their substantial progress with Titanium Mobile that has brought the money to do so.</p>
<p>By the way: window.showInTaskbar = false Pleeeeeeeease!!</p>

							<p>HI all,</p>
<p>As per Scott&#39;s post above, I have some news today about our Titanium Desktop 1.1 release plans.</p>
<p>The good news is that we will have a new release out in about 3 weeks! It will address Webkit and a number of things mentioned above.</p>
<p>Please see my Blog at:<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2010&#x2F;11&#x2F;new-titanium-desktop-release-is-coming-soon.html</p>
<p>Sorry for the &quot;dead-air&quot;, and don&#39;t take a lack of immediate response as lack of interest. I am in my second month running platform engineering and I&#39;ve just been very busy. I will make it a point to be more active on our blog, and in Q&amp;A. </p>
<p>Talk to you all again soon, as I expect to be blogging about the Desktop release quite soon.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Ralf Pfeiffer</p>
<p>Director of Platform Engineering</p>

							<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Great news, we&#39;re deciding whether to invest in Appcelerator as well need a cross platform (Desktop &lt;-&gt; Phone &lt;-&gt; Tablet) and the Desktop is actually the key application area.</p>
<p>I&#39;m hoping to see more information and examples about connecting to native libraries on the desktop (much like is possibly with the mobile versions).</p>
<p>So far there&#39;s just no information on it even tho 6 months ago posting said &quot;Yes it&#39;s possible&quot;..</p>
<p>So good news to hear there&#39;s some focus as we&#39;re split on going the safe Adobe Air way or trying something bit newer with Appcelerator.</p>
