			<h1>Titanium Studio Crashes on Startup</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am running the latest Titanium Studio with SDK 1.7.2. Every few days or so me, and everyone at my organization have to reinstall Ti Studio in order to be able to continue working with Ti.</p>
<p>We have read about removing the .lock files in the studio folder and even in our project, but after a time or two that even fails us and we have to reinstall. </p>
<p>Has anyone come across a solution? I haven&#39;t seen one that works past deleting the .lock files.</p>

							<p>This is a shot in the dark, but is it possible that your organization&#39;s firewall is interfering with the automatic updates of Titanium Studio? Depending on how your firewall is configured, it is technically possible it could be corrupting the updates.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the reply!</p>
<p>That is an interesting idea, though I don&#39;t believe it is the firewall. It happens seemingly at random times. I tend to have more issues, as I am running the build more often than the others in the organization. Though someone who had no problems for a week just had to reinstall twice today.</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve had that problem ever since I installed the svn plugin (subversive) with titanium studio. The temporary workaround that I use it to delete or rename the .metadata folder under your titanium studio workspace directory. Ofcourse, this will cause loss of preferences and settings and project explorer clears up as well.</p>
