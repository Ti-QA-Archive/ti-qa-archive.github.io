			<h1>Disable Delete icon in TableView edit mode?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m constructing a TableView with custom rows.  I want the users to be able to switch to the Edit mode, which they can select multiple items, then hit &quot;Complete&quot; to mark these items as completed.</p>
<p>The problem is as soon as I set</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">tableView<span class="hljs-class">.editing</span> = true
</code></pre><p>the red (-) would appear, but I don&#39;t want the user to remove the rows.  But there seems to be nowhere in the API to disable this default behavior.</p>
<p>My alternative approach is to re-render the row when user clicks on the &quot;Edit&quot; button and customize the row accordingly.</p>
<p>So my question is whether it&#39;s possible to turn off the Delete icon in the edit mode. </p>

							<p>Glad to see others are having my same issue (I&#39;m the one that asked &amp; answered the question Ben referred to)……this really should be documented.</p>
<p>To prevent deleting a row: set editable = false for the row.</p>

							<p>Thanks for answering my question.  I should have been a bit clearer in the original question.  I actually want to have the editing animation to occur when you set the editing=true property of the tableView (the right-shifting animation for the rows which the hasChild icons disappearing and the red icons appearing). But in my case, I don&#39;t want to have the red icon to appear.  However,  Setting editable=false for the row means that it won&#39;t go into the edit mode at all, so no animation would occur.</p>
<p>If you have RememberTheMilk app, click the &quot;Edit&quot; button in the tasks list will switch to the selection mode which you can select the tasks then hit the &quot;Complete&quot; button to complete them.  This is what I wanted to mimic.  If the red delete button can somehow be removed, then it&#39;s pretty simple to do something like that in Titanium.</p>
<p>I tried to hack it around by looping thru my custom rows, and for each row, applied a translation transition to every child elements to mimic the shifting.  The result wasn&#39;t too good because the animation was chugging and stopped at various random unfinished states.  I also tried to apply the shifting transform to the row but the row itself doesn&#39;t seem to animate at all.  Then I applied the transition transform to  the tableView, but now the entire screen got shifted.  So basically I just gave up on the animation, and just used a quick image toggle instead.</p>

							<p>Just wondering if anyone ever figured this out? I also would like to use the edit mode to select multiple rows and then run a function based on those selected rows. But I can&#39;t seem to figure out if its possible. </p>
