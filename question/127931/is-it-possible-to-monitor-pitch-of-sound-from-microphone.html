							<p>I&#39;m not sure exactly what a pitch is or how it is measured (if you explain maybe I can think of a better answer), but have you taken a look at Ti.Media? there you would find averageMicrophonePower and peakMicrophonePower - maybe these can help you.</p>

										<p><p>The pitch can be considered as the frequency of a sound.<br>I think Griffin is trying to get the sound of the guitar and if the pitch of this sound is in a certain ange the guitar is correctly tuned.</p>

										<p><p>As far as I know the mic gives back the 2 params I mentioned. So, given those param the the length of the sound (which I read is needed in the formula) - how do you calc the mhz ?</p>

										<p><p>I believe not enough, I think you have to read the input sound and analyse it to get the pitch.<br>As an aside you cannot have MHz :) the sounds are from 20Hz to 20KHz only :)</p>

										<p><p>And that range is pretty much only for those below 30 years old or so, particularly female, which tend to have a wider audible spectrum than males.  The flip side is those of us who are older aren&#39;t bothered by the places which broadcast high-pitched signals to discourage loitering…</p>
