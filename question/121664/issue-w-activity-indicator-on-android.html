			<h1>Issue w/ Activity Indicator on Android</h1>

		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve noticed some crash reports from my android App that seem to be coming from showing that activity indicator:</p>
<p>Unable to add window – token android.os.BinderProxy@47869740 is not valid; is your activity running?</p>
<p>The code I&#39;m using to show the indicator is (this is included in all my heavyweight windows):</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> showingInd=<span class="hljs-literal">false</span>;

    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> actInd = Titanium.UI.createActivityIndicator({

        font : {fontFamily:<span class="hljs-string">'Helvetica Neue'</span>, fontSize:<span class="hljs-number">15</span>,fontWeight:<span class="hljs-string">'bold'</span>},
        color : <span class="hljs-string">'white'</span>,
        style:Titanium.UI.iPhone.ActivityIndicatorStyle.BIG
    });

    utils.showInd = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(message)</span></span>{
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (showingInd == <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>) {

        }
        Titanium.API.debug(<span class="hljs-string">"Calling Show Indicator "</span> + message);
        actInd.message = message;
        actInd.show();
        showingInd = <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>;

							<div><p>Lol, this issue has been killing our ratings since 1.6.1. I really, really hope some fix is coming soon.</p>
<p>I really wish there was something more we could do. Anyways, the steps I have taken to reduce the occurrence is:<br>1) When possible, do not use&#x2F;show an activity indicator<br>2) Try to close activity indicators when your current window closes (even if the task is still in progress).<br>3) Try to create&#x2F;show&#x2F;hide the activity indicator all from within the same context (window).</p>
<p>While I wish there was something more I could say, these steps have reduced the problem but we still get plenty of emails about it force crashing user&#39;s devices.</p>
<p>You might look at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dimitar.me&#x2F;android-displaying-dialogs-from-background-threads&#x2F;">this link</a> for some additional details as to what exactly is causing it.</p>

							<p>Frank - Thanks for your comments I have another idea you could try. Personally, I can&#39;t really test it as I have had a hard time duplicating it, though there are plenty of errors to let me know it is occurring.</p>
<p>Anyways, I got to thinking what do I actually know about this error</p>
<ul>
<li>It started with the 1.6.0 SDK</li>
<li>It has something to do with the Android activity lifecycle</li>
<li>It is mainly happening on the activityIndicator.show, though I believe it has happened on .hide as well</li>
<li>The Android activity indicator (natively called progress dialog) is an Android activity as well as the window we open it from</li>
<li>Creating &amp; destroying my activity indicators in a single context &amp; adding listeners to the win &amp; activity close have cut my # of errors about in half</li>
</ul>
<p>With all of that knowledge, it got me thinking what change in 1.6 was likely to have caused this. The conclusion is obvious, it is the first time we as developers have access to the Android activity. Titanium had to make changes to how&#x2F;when items were fired. They recommended only keeping lightweight code on the initial load of a window. You can find this comment within the lifecycle section of the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;1.6.0&#x2F;changelog.html">1.6 release notes</a>. I really recommend you read that.</p>
<p>Consequently, what I believe is happening is that we start loading our window (Android Activity) and then we try to create an activity indicator on that window before it is fully opened. As Android treats the activity indicator (progress dialog) as it&#39;s own activity we are trying to add an activity on top of our window activity, which has not been finalized yet. Typically, I have showed an activity indicator, started some long process such as an httpClient request, with the callback hiding the activity indicator. Since the httpClient uses a callback, it hasn&#39;t blocked execution, but I am displaying the activity indicator before the window has been finalized.</p>
<p>What I recommend doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the existing activity indicator code that listens for win close that hides the activity indicator (as hiding can be a cause as well)</li>
<li>Never create&#x2F;show the activity indicator in the normal window code.</li>
<li>When you need to display an activity indicator do it after&#x2F;within the Win.Open event fired. (You might also try Android Activity &#39;Resume&#39; event).</li>
</ul>
<p>Please let me know how it goes. If it all works out okay, I will make the massive changes to my application.</p>

										<p><p>Another thing you could try, I have seen some related crashes on other objects. Though these are usually happening after the app has been run once and backgrounded. You could look at enabling <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Maintaining+a+Custom+AndroidManifest.xml#MaintainingaCustomAndroidManifest.xml-EnsuringAndroidshutsdownappscleanly">alwaysRetainTask state</a>. This does have drawbacks, but it is another thing you could try. Personally, I believe the text above is probably the issue.</p>

							<p>Let me know if that works for you. But I was saying to add some listeners to the current Android activity &amp; current window that hide the activity indicator on pause&#x2F;close.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, I would be very interested in testing it out. Though I am a little ways away from a release (thanks to some refactoring the 1.7 SDK is going to require from me), which is when I will know if it actually works.</p>
<p>I saw your other <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;122441&#x2F;contributing-fixes">question mentioning it</a>, and it seemed the fix is just what I thought it would be. Sadly, it might be awhile before it actually gets included.</p>
<p>Why don&#39;t you send me a link through DevMail (click on my name below right, then select the DevMail tab). Also, if you can include any information on how you do local Android changes I would love to see how as I always seem to be running a custom iOS build of my creation, knowing how to do Android would be a plus.</p>

							<p>I took a recent Cont Build of 1.7.3 after the JIRA ticket was closed.  2 days now with 0 crashes on that build (usually had 10 or so a day).  I think the issue is fixed.  Hooray!</p>
