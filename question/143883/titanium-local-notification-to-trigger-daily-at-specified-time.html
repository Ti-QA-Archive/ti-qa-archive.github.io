							<p>Simply sen the <code>when</code> property when you create your <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Android.Notification">Notification</a>. Simply set the time to the specified time you want it to appear.</p>
<p>As for the each day, this might prove a little tricky.</p>

										<p><p>I think this answer is not quite accurate.  I&#39;ve been struggling with this issue for days, so I feel your pain, Aadil.</p>
<p>From the docs for Notification:</p>
<p><em>&quot;when&quot; has nothing to do with when the actual notification will happen. It is only a timestamp that will show on the notification and can be set to any date you wish.</em></p>
<p>The notification will fire as soon as you call NotificationManager.notify().</p>
<p>So you have to use a background service, which at the appropriate time will create and fire the notification.</p>
<p>However, once the device goes to sleep, I don&#39;t think your service will get any cycles.  It might run for a little while, but I don&#39;t know if it will run until 9:00 a.m. the next day.</p>
<p>Android has the concept of wake locks that prevent the device from going to sleep, but I think it would be a bad idea to hold such a lock for hours at a time, as you will probably kill the battery.</p>
<p>Ben Bahrenburg generously built and shared a module for interfacing with Titanium&#39;s AlarmManager.  Get it <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bencoding.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;06&#x2F;06&#x2F;android-alarmmanager-for-titanium&#x2F;">here</a>.  I&#39;ve had some success with this.  Unfortunately for my purposes, his module does not support setting multiple alarms.  I may end up reworking it a bit.</p>
<p>One last problem I&#39;ve encountered is that I can&#39;t figure out how to get the screen to come on when the Notification (or the Alarm) fires.  I want my app to behave like the alarm clock that&#39;s built into my android device.</p>
<p>This problem <em>should</em> be simple.  It&#39;s very difficult with the current Titanium API.  If I can come up with a working solution, I will definitely be sharing it here in the Q&amp;A.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Jason for replying and thanks for understanding the problem.<br>I had a problem. Lets say if the user sets a notification of 9am and the current time is 8:30am. What should the interval be in  intent.putExtra(&#39;interval&#39;, ???);?? I think you cant change it once you set it.</p>
<p>What I have done till now is that I am using two services. One with &quot;x&quot; interval(i.e x=9am-Current Time) and other with interval of 24hrs.<br>So when the first service triggers I generate notification and stop the first service and make a new service with new interval of 24hrs….</p>
<p>I thought I had some success… But you just told me about the problem of missing cycles when android goes sleep.<br>I think some more experienced people should also shed a light on it.</p>

										<p><p>@Jason, I just plugged in the Ben Bahrenburg Titanium Alarm Manager Module you were talking about… It crashes on v8 for some odd reason, but working on Rhino..<br>Anyway, i just saw in &quot;bencoding.alarmmanager&gt;0.4&gt;timodule.xml&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;benbahrenburg&#x2F;benCoding.AlarmManager&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;ExampleProject&#x2F;AlarmTest&#x2F;modules&#x2F;android&#x2F;bencoding.alarmmanager&#x2F;0.4&#x2F;timodule.xml">here</a>)that he is using permission of WAKE_LOCK … will that not drain battery too???</p>
