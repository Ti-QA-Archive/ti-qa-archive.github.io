							<div><p>Maybe you shouldn&#39;t use unstable builds when you can&#39;t handle those issues. For me, Titanium works like a charm without any issue (I am using the latest official release which is version 3.3.0 of the SDK)</p>

							<div><p>A bit of moderation is required here I think.</p>
<p>This question falls below the level of quality required to offer any meaningful assistance.  Ray has pointed out what you need to do in order to gain the best chance of any answers.  He has provide a link that shows how to make the most out of asking your question.  However your follow-ups also lack the required detail.</p>
<p>This is not the correct way to gain assistance;</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;If you guys cannot keep your platform stable then get out of the games please&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>You are having problems yes, however whilst a tiny number of people end up with such an installation issue as you are reporting here this does not mean that every one does. So right now the problem appears installation related.  How this has occurred over Windows and OSX machines and more than one machine that you have is very very strange.</p>
<p>Do as Ray suggests, return with a simple question that will move you to the next stage of determining the problem, people here will assist you.  No one wants this sort of problem, but as you have essentially said &quot;I have problems - fix them&quot; rather than &quot;this is specific thing with specific error messages and ideally in this case screenshots is happening any thoughts?&quot;.</p>

							<p>Adel,</p>
<p>I can tell from the tone of your question, you are obviously frustrated. Your issues do not seem typical nor are they widespread. I know many developers that are using Titanium without issues (including myself and the 5 devs who work with me). Maybe if you can narrow down the issues to include exactly what is happening, when, what type of system, exact errors that you are encountering, then others here can help you. </p>
<p>Please refer to  <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tidev.io&#x2F;2014&#x2F;02&#x2F;05&#x2F;titanium-qa-how-to-ask-a-successful-question&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tidev.io&#x2F;2014&#x2F;02&#x2F;05&#x2F;titanium-qa-how-to-ask-a-successful-question&#x2F;</a> as a starting point to ask a successful question.</p>

										<p><p>sorry for my tone, but really what happens to us few days ago is very bad, Am sad for that great effort done by titanium team is gone by lot of bugs and lot of inconsistency! </p>
<p>We had need to to use the new sdk 3.5.0 as it has new feature not exist in previous version , and it worked well , but second day when me and my team started the working day, we was surprised with punch of errors &quot;Refreshing Devices…&quot;. java.lang.Long cannot be cast to java.lang.String&quot;<br>&quot;error computing sdk&quot;  and nothing fixed it even we couldnt use the previous sdk (which is still available for us)</p>
<p>If tried to uninstall the studio with sdk completely and install it again , but same errors exist,<br>then i found a Titanium studion 3.4 rc , i though it might have the solution when tried it , still above errors happens and others ( I dont know it seem like AWS services of their own have problems&quot;</p>
<p>No our work is suspended and we have a delivery date and dont know what to do!</p>

										<p><p>Adel,</p>
<p>Again, it&#39;s a little hard to tell what your problem is as you don&#39;t describe where, circumstances, configuration, etc. for your system. If &#39;the first day it worked well&#39; but &#39;second day, starting to get errors&#39;, well, did anything in your configuration change? When you mention your team, do you all have the same errors happening on each of your development machines? When you try and create a new project&#x2F;compile and run, does it work? Have you tried cleaning your project and restarting the project?</p>
<p>Again, without ANY DETAILS, can&#39;t really help…</p>

<li>Try creating a new default app on each of your machines on each of your platforms and make NO changes - run them and do they all fail?</li>
<li>If yes, then wow - very unlikely</li>
<li>If no, then the ones that worked, what OS, Studio and SDK versions do they use, and then the same for the ones that failed- any patterns?</li>

										<p><p>I&#39;m still assuming that you get this as soon as you start studio? The issues you are seeing can sometimes be related to not having all of the components installed and up to date. From a command line, can you try running <code>ti setup</code>, then select option 2, <code>check environment</code>. Copy and paste the result of that here and let&#39;s see what might be going on.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks a lot guys , thanks Ray We have manage to solve the problem by , </p>
<p>For Windows:<br>1- we did uninstall<br>2- We removed folders .titanium at documents roots<br>3- we removed folder C:\Users[username]\AppData\Roaming\Titanium<br>4-we used some program to clean Registery ( this was very important unfortunately).</p>
<p>Then we have installed the studio 3.3 and its working now</p>
<p>For Mac<br>1- we have first uninstalled node using command line<br>2-we have removed Titanium from folder application<br>3- we have cleaned folder titanium at application Support folder in Liberary folder<br>4- we installed the Studio 3.3</p>
<p>[Note]</p>
<p>yes titanium did a great job in doing this platform ( we totaly depend on it in our projects) , but strange issues that we keep finding and issues appear from release to release( even stable releases) need to be revised, they do a great job but have a very big problem in Packaging the product.</p>
<p>I shouldn&#39;t face problem when even trying to use unstable sdk release as I supposed to know that i can revert it an anytime by just selecting previous SDK. I shouldnt even be acknowledged that action bar cannot be hidden properly and that a previous important property is no more working in stable release like 3.3 that not how professional platform maker act.</p>
<p>anyway thanks a lot for your help and support!</p>

										<p><p>Good new you have it back up and running.</p>
<p>I would like to point out that ideally you should only use pre-release unstable versions on test machines or dual boot setups.  As the names imply &quot;pre-release&quot; - not ready to be released &amp; &quot;unstable&quot; - not stable, these should not be used on production machines ever.</p>
<p>During testing of; Yosemite, Ti 3.4, xcode 6 and iPhone 6 I have an external HD connected to my dev machine that acts as a dual boot device - this way I simply swap boot drives from preferences (Apple OS X solution) without a second thought - the only cost is a reboot and a cheap external HD.</p>
<p>Using this method means I get everything I want to test on - without any of the risks.  I learnt the hard way - not with Titanium with software long ago, you then work out how not to ever get into that situation again.</p>
<p>So this question can be marked as answered now I hope.</p>
