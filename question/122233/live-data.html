							<p>The questions seems rather abstract and a bit vague, so I&#39;m just going to throw this out there for you. Since multiple people will be working on the database, that means the database must be remote. With constantly changing information you can either push those changes to the device or have the device query for the data while it is open. The best way to execute as well as the best way to display the data really depends on the data and your service.</p>

										<p><p>Try to keep responses to answers as comments rather than new answers, that way others who view this thread see a concise conversation.</p>
<p>Now, as for timeout and update checks, I would simply say that in the event of a timeout, query the server to check for the latest data. If those timestamps don&#39;t match, then update. Howerver, you must remember that when updating the device database that you must use the timestamp from the server and not the insert time from device as they will never be the same.</p>

							<p>ow sorry guys, i should be more detailed on this.<br>I&#39;m using a sql database with lots of messages in it, people that work for me edit these messages remotely from the web or (desktop app soon)<br>Pulling data with a timeout takes alot of power from my servers. is there a beter and more efficiënt way to do this in a desktop application.<br>maybe a other type of database that is able to callback on changes.</p>
