			<h1>sending sms from iphone app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>i tried sending sms programmatically from an iPhone app using the following two modules but I am running into one issue in both cases.</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;omorandi&#x2F;TiSMSDialog<br>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;benbahrenburg&#x2F;benCoding.SMS</p>
<p>After sending the sms (after sms dialog disappears), my app window becomes unresponsive (text fields are not editable, etc.). I am wondering if anybody else who has used these modules have experienced something similar? I tried the sample apps that module provides and even the examples have this same issue.</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

							<p>Hi Saqib</p>
<p>I have used the TiSMSDialog module and it works correctly, I am not seeing the same issue as you.</p>
<p>I used the exact same code as the example supplied with the module, only changing the phone number when the dialog is shown, before sending.  Obviously this needs to be done on the physical phone as the simulator does not support this function.</p>
<p>I added the module into the Modules folder of the project rather than globally, in case that might be different from your use.</p>
<p>Exact code used shown below.  This was triggered by a left nav button and sat above a table.  Once the sms was successfully sent I continued to have normal use of the app.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> SMS = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'ti.sms'</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> sms = SMS.createSMSDialog({
    animated: <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
});
sms.barColor = <span class="hljs-string">'black'</span>;
sms.toRecipients = [
    <span class="hljs-string">'5678309'</span> <span class="hljs-comment">// who should receive the text? put their numbers here!</span>
];
sms.messageBody = <span class="hljs-string">'This is a text message.'</span>;
sms.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'complete'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">evt</span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (evt.success) {
        alert(<span class="hljs-string">'SMS sent!'</span>);
    }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">switch</span> (evt.result) {
            <span class="hljs-keyword">case</span> SMS.CANCELLED:
                alert(<span class="hljs-string">'User cancelled SMS!'</span>);
                <span class="hljs-keyword">break</span>;
            <span class="hljs-keyword">case</span> SMS.FAILED:
            <span class="hljs-keyword">default</span>:
                alert(evt.error);
                <span class="hljs-keyword">break</span>;
        }
    }
});
sms.open();

										<p><p>I have tried the benCoding version as you requested and have had successes and failures.</p>
<p>Test 1.<br>Using the (almost) exact code as provided with the example only changing to allow it to sit on my test app window.  I could not view the button at this point so I added an underlying scrollview.  I was then able to press the button.  This allowed me to send the sms then I <strong>DID</strong> experience the same inability to select the text fields form the example.</p>
<p>Test 2.<br>Stripped the whole code back down to just a button on the navbar and the following lines of code;<br>Obviously changing the number prior to send.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> sms = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'bencoding.sms'</span>).createSMSDialog({ barColor:<span class="hljs-string">'#336699'</span> });
sms.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'cancelled'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">e</span>) </span>{ alert(e.message); });
sms.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'completed'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">e</span>) </span>{ alert(e.message); });
sms.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'errored'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">e</span>) </span>{ alert(e.message); });

sms.setMessageBody(<span class="hljs-string">'This is a text message.'</span>);

sms.open({
    animated: <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
});
</code></pre><p>This <strong>DID NOT</strong> suffer the same problem and correctly sent the sms and then allowed full access to the rest of the app.  Note that there were NO other controls on the same window.</p>

<p>There does appear to be an issue - it is not just you.  I am using 2.1 on a mac and iOS 5.1, for comparison.</p>

										<p><p>Suresh, Will be doing some more tests as you can see from above, I will repeat these tests using 2.0 to see if there is any difference.</p>
<p>Please be aware I do not work for Appcelerator and did not create either of the SMS modules, I am just here hopefully lending a hand to Saqib and possibly you depending on my results.</p>
<p>I will not be able to run the tests for a few hours, but I will update this answer later with the results.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Saqib</p>
<p>I have just tried using the <strong>TiSMSDialog</strong> with the exact same text fields on the window as previously used with the <strong>benCoding</strong>.  I have also used  <strong>TiSMSDialog</strong> with my own typed text fields (just in case).</p>
<p>Both tests worked perfectly, no lock ups as seen with the <strong>benCoding</strong> version.  I had full editing ability of the texts fields in the same way as I had with the table view from the first tests.</p>
<p>The code used was the same as the first block from my earliest answer.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Suresh</p>
<p>As you can see from above my tests worked.  Please note ALL tests were performed using Ti 2.1.0 so it would show that the lack of support you had been told of - no longer appears to be true.</p>
