			<h1>Log SOAP response? I just want to see what it is</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m using the SOAP example in Kitchen Sink and seem to be getting a response from a SOAP web service, however, since I don&#39;t know much about what to expect in the response, I don&#39;t know yet what parts I&#39;ll need from it.</p>
<p>So, is there some way to just dump the response to the Appcelerator console?</p>
<p>I&#39;m currently getting a successful .evaluate() like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (xmlDoc.evaluate) {
            alert(<span class="hljs-string">'YES'</span>);
        } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
            alert(<span class="hljs-string">'NO'</span>);
        }
</code></pre>

							<p>Not in a human readable format.  IMHO you&#39;re better off trying to use a client application of some kind to test your web service and inspect the contents.  I use SOAPClient on Mac with decent results.  You could also manually POST a SOAP envelope using HTTPClient, available in the Mac App Store.</p>
<p>You might also be able to use apigee.com&#39;s console tool, though I&#39;ve never tried it for SOAP web services.</p>

							<p>Thanks so much for your reply, Kevin. You helped me in a couple of different ways.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Since this is my first project using SOAP, I didn&#39;t know that SOAP results weren&#39;t just a fancy string. I&#39;d have probably beaten my head on it for days without your heads-up.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Trying HTTP Client on the app store was hugely helpful. It has better error reporting so it was able to better show me the error in my request than the other client I was using. Well worth the $2.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks again!</p>
