			<h1>Retain Sub Window State in Tab Group</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I would like my iOS app&#39;s tab&#39;s sub windows to retain their state when they are closed via the &quot;back&quot; button and then reopened. The best example of what I am trying to emulate is the iOS Messages application. </p>
<p>The main window shows a list of items linked to dynamically populated sub windows. When a sub window is opened, the user may change the scroll position of the chat thread, open the keyboard, begin typing a message, then click the back button, and reopen the sub window at a later time. When the sub window is reopened, the user expects the state to be identical to where they left it.</p>
<p>The obvious solution to this is to not close the window and instead leave it open in memory, however, I am unable to find out how to prevent the default &quot;back&quot; button functionality from closing the sub window, and simply hiding it instead.</p>
<p>Being that sub windows are dynamically generated and many could exist simultaneously, saving the window state in the prefs isn&#39;t very practical, nor would the UI feel smooth; some state-refreshing (like the keyboard being brought back into the view) firing after the window has come into the view.</p>
<p>Any solutions?</p>

										<p><p>I have no grand solution yet Maikel. I have an idea of not using the tab window stacks and creating my own window stack with custom back button functionality, but have not yet invested the time to explore the concept.</p>
