			<h1>Projects Won&#39;t Build for Android</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<ul>
<li>Application type: android mobile </li>
<li>Titanium Studio: 3.2.3.201404181442 - 4&#x2F;18&#x2F;14 </li>
<li>Host Operating System: OSX 10.9.2 (Mavericks)</li>
</ul>
<p>I recently upgraded to Mavericks. Here&#39;s the current situation:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>iOS always builds fine when &quot;Run&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Previously programed projects won&#39;t build for Android when &quot;Run&quot; from Titanium GUI</p>
</li>
<li><p>All projects build for Android when &quot;Run&quot; from command line</p>
</li>
<li><p>Opened a brand new project with no edits called &quot;Testing&quot; and it built for Android from Titanium GUI</p>
</li>
<li><p>I replaced the entire resources folder of the &quot;testing&quot; app with a previously built app and it built fine for Android from Titanium GUI. (Yay!)</p>
</li>
<li><p>I replaced the entire resources folder of the &quot;testing&quot; app with a the resources folder from the KitchenSink and the build failed within the Titanium GUI. (Ugh!)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Made another fresh new project with no edits called &quot;Test&quot; and it no longer built for Android from Titanium GUI (Super Ugh!)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>There are no errors and no console activity at all when the build &quot;fails&quot;. It just doesn&#39;t attempt a build.</em></p>
<p>Instead it shows me the &quot;Run Configuration&quot; screen every time. I click run, the screen pops away and then pops back. I can build form the command line, but it&#39;s much slower for me and it&#39;s a lot of typing instead of just clicking &quot;Run&quot; like I&#39;m used to.</p>
<p>Any idea about what could be happening here would be appreciated it. Hopefully I&#39;m not the only one with this issue. Thanks guys.</p>

							<div><p>New wrinkle. I backed up and deleted all the old projects, and then rebooted. After reboot I created another fresh project without any edits. It built from &quot;Run&quot; and launched the emulator as hoped. I renamed the project to the name of an old deleted project and tried to build it again without making any other edits, only to get stuck with my previous problem of the never-ending &quot;Run Configuration&quot; screen. It&#39;s as if TI remembers the old project names and decides not to work.</p>

							<p>When you mentioned that Studio just doesn&#39;t attempt a build - I assume that the app is not launched at all. One of the potential reasons that can happen is when the RUN button can get retrieve the active selected project in the project explorer. Can you make sure by manually selecting any file&#x2F;folder in the project and then, click the RUN button?</p>
<p>Also, as you have pointed out, there seems to be a potential bug in Studio that if a project is renamed to an existing older project, then Studio still remembers the devices&#x2F;emulators of the older projects. The only workaround for now is to restart the Studio to reload the new devices&#x2F;emulators for the project. I have created a ticket for issue at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TISTUD-6414 - please do add any additional info if required.</p>

										<p><p>This comment led me to the solution. For the record, yes I tried everything including manually selecting the folder first. It was remembering all the old run configurations, which I had no idea it did. I also had no idea that there was a delete option for run configurations! So for all who come after me here&#39;s how it gets fixed.</p>
<p><strong>Delete your old run configurations one by one.</strong></p>
<p>After that, everything starts working again like magic. Everything except KitchenSink which apparently no longer works on any Droid emulator. :)</p>
<p>Thanks Praveen!</p>

<p>I had a project like this, was the straw on the camel that sent me to cli almost 100%. </p>
<p>However, I&#39;ll wave someone down who knows Studio a bit better.</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve also run into issues if I &quot;sleep&quot; my computer with the app running via USB overnight, wake my machine and try to build to device. I have to stop all operations, unplug my phone, reconnect, and rebuild. Seems the connection times out or something… Just a heads up if the above solution does not work.</p>
