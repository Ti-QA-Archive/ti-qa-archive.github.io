							<div><p>I think it is official as Appcelerator Marketing material does come from x.mktomail.com (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marketo.com).  As Gergely states below the &#39;?mkt_tok&#39; parameter is messing up the styling on the page (look as the css paths in view-source).</p>
<p>However, I still cannot find any link on that page relating to &#39;Exam(s)&#39; - this is confusing &amp; bad testing!  As the USA is now in sleep mode we need someone from the UK office to ideally give us some feedback.</p>

							<p>Guys</p>
<p>Our sincerest apologies for this. The emails are authentic and the link is correct. However, the forward slashes are not being escaped correctly when the link redirects from Marketo, which we use to run our promotions, causing CSS not to be applied.</p>
<p>If you can see a link to the exam in the resulting page, it is perfectly safe for you to proceed. If not, then please be assured that we are working with Marketo to resolve the problem. We will let you know when we have any further useful information from them, or when the issue has been fixed.</p>
<p>In the meantime, thank you for your patience.</p>

<p>To everyone that get&#39;s the &quot;URI too large error&quot; - seems to be an &quot;over-engineered login procedure&quot;<br>that is not related to the promotion but related to the account management in general.</p>

							<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s only a CSS problem. It&#39;s obvious from other members that some can see the <code>Get Certified</code> button some others cannot. I have even checked the view source and there is nothing there.</p>
<p>Can you guys give us the official URL of the test? There is no point to wait for an updated email … ! We deserve to be the first ones! :-)</p>

<p>I am not a certified developer yet. Perhaps that&#39;s why I (and the rest) cannot see the button that Stephen posted on his screenshot.</p>

							<p>Click the <code>To view this email as a web page, click here</code> - it opens up on <code>http:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;pages.appcelerator.com&amp;#x2F;index.php&amp;#x2F;email&amp;#x2F;*********</code> which basically looks like a web version of the mail, since it&#39;s on Apcelerator subdombain, my guess is that it&#39;s legit :)</p>

							<p>Do you have to be at a certain account level for the link to show up? I have 3 appcelerator accounts that I log into at the moment, a &quot;community&quot; level that I created before I knew what I was doing, an &quot;indie&quot; level that I setup more recently and is my personal account, and a &quot;professional&quot; level for a client of mine where I am the only mobile dev.</p>
<p>The link shows up in my client&#39;s &quot;professional&quot; account but not in the &quot;community&quot; or &quot;indie&quot;. I would use the &quot;professional&quot; one but will the certificate still be linked to me even though it&#39;s not my account (but I am the only developer that uses it)? The email was originally sent to the &quot;community&quot; account I setup a while ago so I would expect that one to have the link, but it doesn&#39;t.</p>

							<p>I don&#39;t understand. if it was a CSS issue (as the official response was) why does it take so long to fix it? it&#39;s a CSS for God&#39;s sake! I can fix it for you for free if you provide me with the code! :-)</p>

							<p>Dear all</p>
<p>To explain this TCAD promotion, a random sample of developers were selected to gauge the interest these initiatives could generate. An updated email containing the correct link has at last been sent to those people who received it but did not take the exam.</p>
<p>Once again, I apologize for the confusion. If anybody has problems with the new link, then please reply to this thread and one of us will investigate it for you.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

										<p><p>It might be the correct answer.. However a correct answer might not be a good answer.. </p>
<p>It&#39;s easy to make mistakes, but it is also really easy to make people feel let down especially if you think you are getting something and later it&#39;s pulled away. The size of this thread should be a good indication of that..</p>
<p>Next time, early information.. Correct information.. </p>
<p>thanks</p>

							<p>It&#39;s been over 3 weeks and I still haven&#39;t gotten that &quot;update email&quot;.<br>I&#39;ve sent an email to Karin 11 days ago and still haven&#39;t gotten any response.</p>
<p>I already had a coupon for the TCAD test but it is now gone as well.</p>
<p>We have been patient but I think this is way too long to fix a link.</p>
