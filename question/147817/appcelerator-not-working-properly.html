							<div><p>Whilst you are allowed to frustrated you must remember that your problems are not caused by the Appcelerator community and we should not have to be subjected to what many consider rude, insulting and blasphemous language.</p>
<p>Your question appears to be a rant rather than an actual question designed to provide yourself with a solution.</p>
<p>I suggest;</p>
<ul>
<li>you take a breath</li>
<li>take a moment to remember people here want to help but are unlikely if someone is being rude</li>
<li>apologise on this question for being rude</li>
<li>close this question</li>
<li>work out a question that asks things that can be delivered and provide that and any related information in a NEW question</li>
<li>let people help you</li>
</ul>
