			<h1>Is it possible to scroll two tableview at the same time ? (Grid TableView Layout)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Good day everyone. I am trying to create a brick grid style Tableview (like <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pinterest.com">Pinterest</a>) with appcelerator. </p>
<p>At the early stage, I was tried to create a Grid-style tableview with 2 data container contained within 1 tableViewRow. But It is not able to create the brick-style layout even both container are with different height. Like <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i1374.photobucket.com&#x2F;albums&#x2F;ag440&#x2F;laionchun&#x2F;current_zps95a02396.png">This</a></p>
<p>And Then I tried to implement this layout with two ways:<br>i. Create Two TableView containing in one view and then draw it into a ScrollView. Like <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i1374.photobucket.com&#x2F;albums&#x2F;ag440&#x2F;laionchun&#x2F;experiment2_zpse155bf79.png">This.</a> This case seems worked with iOS platform (seems buggy at android), but since this case seems not able to make use of tableview functionality, so it would cause lag and memory issue.</p>
<p>ii. This time I would like to just create Two TableView within a window Like <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i1374.photobucket.com&#x2F;albums&#x2F;ag440&#x2F;laionchun&#x2F;experiment_zps6d6fdd90.png">This.</a> But these two tableview would scroll and works individually. So my question is: Is it possible to handle two tableview scroll event so i could make them able to scroll together at the same time? or is there any other ways to create this grid style tableview ?</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated :) Thx a lot !</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>They use a ScrollView with two&#x2F;three columns side by side and manage the flow (to average heights) as they add the pictures.  They also will be managing the memory actively, especially for Android as it is not as capable as iOS automatically.</p>
<p>Your TableView solution is probably safest for now.  You do NOT need two tables, simple create a single table and add custom rows.  Each row had two images, that simple.  No need to go side by side with two tables or try and match their positions which will not be ideal on iOS and level harder on Android.</p>
<p>You will need to keep memory issues in mind as lots of images are always going to be an issues, especially on Android.</p>
<p>BTW it may look like I am putting Android done, but the simple fact is when it comes to image memory management - iOS is significantly better (although more recent Android SDKs have improved), it just means you may have to do so e work yourself if you have many rows.  </p>
<p>A common memory management technique is to unload the imageView for any rows out of view (with a safety margin) and when they are getting close add them back in.  Only do this if it becomes a problem though.</p>
