			<h1>Issue finding Android SDK on Window 8. Support HELP !</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have been trying to install Titanium in my Computer for a week and it is still no working.</p>
<p>I have window 8 and I have changed the path on the system environment variables to point to the place with the android SDK.</p>
<p>I have change multiples time the location, added the 32 and 64 bit jdk, added the android-7 folder, modified the .py file reinstalled several time the application and I am still having problems.</p>
<p>Please I need some support help I have been answering similar posts and looking for a solution for this for a week and there is not standard solution and everything is different and old almost 2 years ago. </p>
<p>Looks like Titanium is dying or that the Titanium team is not concern anymore about the IDE and the developers. </p>
<p>Application type: mobile<br>Titanium SDK: 3.1.3.GA<br>Platform &amp; version: Window 8<br>Device: NA<br>Host Operating System:Windows 8<br>Titanium Studio, build: 3.1.3.201309132423version, copied and pasted from Help &#x2F; About</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve just installed Studio onto a freshly installed Win 7 without any installations from other SDKs (eg. JDK). Don&#39;t worry. You only need to take a few more steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>When installed Studio is only able to develop on a web app mode. Nothing to panic about here.</li>
<li>From the Dashboard tab select Get Started sub-tab. </li>
<li>Scroll down to Configure Native SDKs.</li>
<li>Select Android SDK. Studio will install a whole bunch of stuff it needs, including all the Java, Node.js, and everything you need to dev on Android.</li>
<li>Once done it will open the Android SDK Manager. On a fresh install the SDK Manager does not come with all the libraries Studio needs. The important ones are already selected, so you know what to install. Remember that you need to install API 10 as well. What you need to install are stated in the Studio page.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#39;s it! I simplified step 5 a little but that&#39;s really the kookiness of the SDK Manager, not within Studio&#39;s control. Ask me again if you&#39;re tripping over that step. Will suggest you try a little more so you understand how things work.</p>

										<p><p>Btw, there&#39;s a bug on Studio SDK 3.1.3 with Win 8. Basically you will get an odd error while compiling code. This error has been reported and it&#39;s just a matter of time before a patch is released. </p>
<p>SDK 3.1.2 works ok though (that&#39;s what I&#39;m using now). I&#39;m not sure how you can get 3.1.2 but dig around and see if there&#39;s possible.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you for this this solved part of the problem but not the whole problem. I am giving up to use this awful platform. I will keep native which is more work but reliable. Appcelerator is too unstable and unreliable option</p>

							<p>I did the steps I can find the sdk now at least it looks green on the Dasboard but I cannot create mobile projects. I have this error everytime that I create a new one.<br>&quot;Resource&#39;test2&#x2F;Resource&#x2F;app.js&quot; does not exist.</p>
<p>I also installed the version 3.1.2 and it did not work too, and as you can see in the hyperlink on my comments above I cannot update yet. </p>
<p>I have been trying to adopt this technology and introduce in my company but Titanium is to unstable software and the lack of real support make this option very difficult. I have spend a week trying to get support and several post here in Q&#x2F;A and I haven&#39;t had an solution</p>

										<p><p>When does your error pop up? Right after you created the mobile project, or when you try to compile? Have you checked the log files as suggested by the error message to have a feel of what might be tripping you up?</p>
<p>Try to get your updates installed first. Then you can play with Alloy - it&#39;s faster to code than the classic mode. Hopefully after the updates your error will disappear.</p>
<p>Remember that when you create your project you should select the right SDK version: 3.1.2. This can be set in tiapp.xml</p>

										<p><p>Regarding support: if you&#39;re coding professionally try to get your boss to pay for commercial support. Q&amp;A is a hit and miss thing. Not good when you have a project dateline.</p>

										<p><p>I think they have all these bugs and lack of support to obligate to customer buy the commercial support if they are going to be free they need to be really free and don&#39;t be selling and idea that is free but for real project become a problem. I was trying to introduce this platform other company that i work as lead developer and my old boss always was clear with these application almost 2 years ago telling me that appcelerator is not a good option now i need to totally agree, and I wont be use this there are a lot of other options with better and serious support than this.</p>

										<p><p>Your boss was right in that 2 years back this framework is more beta-ware than anything. I&#39;ve not used it that long myself, but I have started with native coding on Android (Java), to PhoneGap, and then something more familiar (Xamarin). Maybe you know another framework that helps a developer manage multiple platforms in a single project? To me Xamarin was the closest.</p>
<p>Having said that, Xamarin is also a commercial product. Titanium is in a way <em>optionally</em> commercial, depending what modules and support you need. There&#39;s probably a good reason for this: it has kinks that can put people off. </p>
<p>You&#39;ve only just started and you&#39;re turning away because of your less than perfect experience with the Studio installation? Why not stay on a little longer: get past this little hurdle and play with the framework. When you have understood the design principles, then I&#39;d think you&#39;ve made an informed decision.</p>
<p>Trust me, getting PhoneGap&#x2F; native ready for development wasn&#39;t smooth either. Cross-platform mobile development today is very much in its infancy.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer: I don&#39;t work for this company. I&#39;ve only just used this framework a month back, and I see its potential. And yes I do hit a few road blocks from time to time myself.</strong></p>
