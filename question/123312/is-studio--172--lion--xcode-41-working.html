			<h1>Is Studio + 1.7.2 + Lion + XCode 4.1 working?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I had a lot of problems getting XCode working again after my Lion upgrade. I am now on XCode 4.1 and have the latest Studio + Java updates including mobile SDK 1.7.2 - I get an error with no description trying to run in the iOS simulator. The traceback ends in run.py line 39 - SystemExit: 65 - there are no other issues being reported.</p>
<p>FYI - Android emulator runs just fine with FastDev too. Is there something I missed for iOS? before I start digging I wanted to make sure it is currently a supported configuration. thanks</p>
<p>-c</p>

							<p>Just want to check as this has been a very common issue… are you sure that you have Xcode 4.1 installed and its from the AppStore? The app store will say its installed when in reality it has only &quot;installed&quot; the installer… you must still install it.</p>

										<p><p>Yup - I have half a dozen native iOS projects and went through a lot of pain to remove the old XCode, the old Beta and then get this via the AppStore. About shows 4.1 - build 4B110.</p>

										<p><p>I had a lot of problems at first, since I was unaware I had an old Xcode 4 preview on my hard drive – which was not in &#x2F;Developer.  I think the 4.1 updater got confused.  I deleted this preview in Finder and reinstalled Xcode 4.1 with the installer that was downloaded from the app store.  It seems to work now.  I&#39;m thinking of doing a second machine and hope it works smoother.</p>

										<p><p>It sounds like it should be working, that was all I needed - I have started to dig into the build and see what might be broke. It appears to be an issue calling the simulator.</p>

										<p><p>Steve: yeah - when I get time I&#39;m going to rebuild this machine for the same reason - had A LOT of junk left behind and did a complete -dev-tools removal to clean it up but I think it&#39;s left my system unstable.</p>

							<p>I was able to track this back again to … xcode custom build paths - sigh. Why won&#39;t you guys fix this? I have to have custom build paths for other projects. Somehow the change to the project to set the actual path failed, it didn&#39;t throw the usual TARGET error but that was the root cause.</p>
