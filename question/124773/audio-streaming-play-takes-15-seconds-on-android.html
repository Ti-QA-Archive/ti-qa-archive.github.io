			<h1>Audio Streaming Play takes 15+ seconds on Android</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey guys</p>
<p>Looking at things in the Kitchen Sink with the sound_remote.js example. When using our MP3 stream (64k bit rate) it takes almost 20 seconds for the audio to start playing once you press the start button. Likewise… it is taking 20 seconds or so for the status message to change to stopped after hitting the stop button. This is mostly on my device tests (both HTC Inspire 4G and EVO 4G) both on WiFi</p>
<p>Am I missing a way to speed this process up? preloading isn&#39;t available inside the CreateAudioPlayer function is it?</p>
<p>I&#39;m using Ti Studio with the latest released Mobile SDK.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>The Inspire 4G is on the same Wifi connection I am on when I do test in the simulator. A speed test shows 9.75Mbps down on the device. I wouldn&#39;t think it would be a bandwidth issue on that one. The Wifi with the EVO is 10MB up and down… so they have enough there too.</p>
<p>The thing I don&#39;t understand is why the state takes so long to change once the stream is stopped?</p>

<p>Seems is not a bandwidth case, i&#39;ve tested over wifi and the same happens.</p>

										<p><p>It also seem to depend on the device. On my Arnova 7G3 using wi-fi the delay in some 7 seconds, as I said above. However on a borrowed Galaxy S2 it was considerably longer. This leads a user to think the app is not working causing them to push the start&#x2F;stop button again - which stops the stream! So not good for a &#39;real world&#39; commercial app.</p>
