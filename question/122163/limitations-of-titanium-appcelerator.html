			<h1>Limitations of Titanium Appcelerator</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi. I&#39;m newbie in the programming business. I know only html, css, some javascript and some python. I wanted to start developing ios apps, but first of jumping into learning something I wanted to know &#39;where&#39; to jump. I don&#39;t know what to do, If start learning Objetive-C and build native apps or use titanium. I know that the path of learning Objective-C is a longer one, but I have the sensation that using a 3rd party in the developing process will limit me. So I wanted to know, how true is this. What do you recommend?<br>Specially: what are the limitations nowdays of using appcelerator if I don&#39;t know writing a native module??<br>Thanks for the help!!</p>

							<p>Mateo,</p>
<p>I can only tell you about my own experience.</p>
<p>It took me 3 months to build my 1st app in Objective-C (including 1 month full-time to start understanding how Apple Dev Tools work), and my app was rather simple (no communication for instance - search &#39;clostermann&#39; in the App Store). I had done some C in the past and I had OOP experience.</p>
<p>It took me 1.5 month to build my 1st Titanium app, and it was much more complex (some Ajax, RSS feed) with a nicer interface (search &#39;corinnelepage&#39; in the App Store).</p>
<p>My feeling is that Titanium offers (almost) every features native languages (Obj-C, Java…) offers, but is easier to use and much more productive (thanks JavaScript!). Also, you don&#39;t have to care about low-level technical aspects (think of the impact of the modified memory management in iOS 5 for programers :-( ).</p>
<p>Since TitaniumStudio has been released a few weeks ago, we have a nice IDE, based on Eclipse, with more to come (including a GUI designer tool). And there is always the possibility to add native modules if one function you need is not available in Titanium.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Laurent</p>

										<p><p>I think that the titanium studio is a horrible IDE and increases confusion to newcomers, it&#39;s much more complex and harder to understand than Xcode. I feel that appcelerator should still support the original titanium developer.</p>
