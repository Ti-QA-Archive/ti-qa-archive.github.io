			<h1>Really need pro help with my Android problem</h1>

		<section>
			<p>This is more or less a programming problem i just cant solve.<br>Ill describe what my app does and where the problem occures is and how im busting my brains on this problem for the week.</p>
<p>Ill desribe it in steps:</p>
<p>step 1) My main window consist of 3 tabs, in the second tab i can search for contacts and companies. When i press a contact or company it opens up a new reuseable tabgroup with a few tabs.</p>
<p>step 2) each tab needs to have an Android MENU, which can only be activated by giving each window an URL towards and file containing the code for an android menu. </p>
<p>step 3) Heres where the problem starts, since my reuseable tabgroup is a .js file containing an class so i can use it over and over again without a problem. Now the Android Menu needs to use functions and properties inside that class. This causes the problem that i cant acces the functions.</p>
<p>What have i tried?</p>
<ul>
<li>making an api inside the class, this way i can acces its functions when i create the class like so:<br>~~~<br>var ABC = function(value){<br>var api = {};<br>api.Method1 = function Randomfunction(){}</li>
</ul>
<p>return api;<br>}</p>
<p>var classAPI = ABC(&#39;test&#39;);<br>classAPI.Method1();<br>~~~</p>
<p>Now the problem with this is that the AndroidMenu.js file cannot acces classAPI, it keeps giving me an empty property.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>i tried adding the api in the titanium properties, but it returns an empty object</p>
</li>
<li><p>tried including an global property with the classAPI, but when i include this file in the AndroidMenu.js file the property is again empty</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So im really stuck on this problem and could use some real help to solve this problem. This is the only part of my app that needs to be finished. Only after i can start adding more functionality</p>
<p>Hope someone can help me</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Im not having any run error on my code, i just cant acces the methods i need</p>
</li>
<li><p>I am using the same code for AndroidMenu as in the kitchensink example</p>
</li>
<li><p>I am using Titaniumd 1.6.1 and 1.2.2</p>
</li>
</ul>

							<div><p>well more code would not clear things up.</p>
<p>The problem is that my AndroidMenu.js file has no information of the class&#x2F;file that it was used in</p>
<p>So if file X has a window with an url: AndroidMenu.js , AndroidMenu.js needs to have information of file X. Now i cant get the right information for some reason</p>

							<div><p>basicly if i can give the Android Menu the ability to acces those functions&#x2F; method the problem is solved.</p>
<p>Including an Android Menu does not work anymore so thats one hope lost.</p>
<p>Creating an Android menu inside the class could solve the problem, only i have no clue how to get an Android menu working without and window with url:AndroidMenu.js .</p>
<p>Hope this clears things up</p>

<p>You have admitted yourself that this is a difficult problem, so you should not expect others to understand or be able to resolve it without a good, concise usecase. For an explanation of what qualifies as a good usecase, see <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Contributing+to+Titanium#ContributingtoTitanium-CreatingGoodUsecases">Creating Good Use-cases</a>.</p>
<p>One thing, though; you do realize that only one tabGroup can exist in an Android app, don&#39;t you?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>This is a difficult problem, but as im still new to both javascript and titanium, perhaps its just a problem i cant solve due to me lacking experience.</p>
<p>I know that only 1 tabgroup can exist, but i have 2, no even 3 tabgroups. Without any problem i can use this.</p>
<p>From tabgroup 1 i open the reuseable tabgroup, on close i return to tabgroup 1, and from the reuseable tabgroup i need to open the reuseable tabgroup again ( for seeing contact details that are associated with an company ).</p>
<p>This works fine and always has ;)</p>

							<p>So i had someone look at my code&#x2F;app, and after i realized that by creating a new window ( new .js file ) i can do an ugly workaround.</p>
<p>By putting the data object in the Ti.properties thing, i can acces that data which i allready tried but it failed cus i still needed the functions inside that class. </p>
<p>With this workaround i will put the functionality in a new window, meaning i dont need the functions inside the class i needed. This will show a new window outside of the tabgroup, ugly but it SHOULD work.</p>
<p>gonna do this next week and see if this workaround fixes my problem.</p>
