			<h1>Ti Developer / emulator very slow since update</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Since updating to Developer 1.2.2 and SDK 1.5.1 I&#39;ve been having a bunch of troubles. (Windows&#x2F;Android development)</p>
<p>My apps are extremely slow, like almost a minute to launch and 30 seconds to download a 170 byte text file from a test web server on my local network.</p>
<p>They&#39;ve mushroomed in size. A published app of mine is 2.7 MB. I compiled it with 1.2.2 and SDK 1.5.1 and it comes out at 5.5 MB. Another app is topping out over 6 MB.</p>
<p>When I try to compile any of my apps using the 1.4.1 or other SDKs, I get a FAILED_OLDER_SDK error at the point when Developer tries to install the app on my emulator.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve updated the Android SDK tools. I&#39;ve restarted. I&#39;ve killed various processes. I removed all my AVDs. </p>
<p>I&#39;d reinstall 1.2.1 to see if that would fix the problem. But I don&#39;t have the installer…I must have deleted that file. I&#39;m running on the same Windows XP computer I&#39;ve been using for months. Since installing 1.2.2, Windows updated with a few patch tuesday updates. Maybe that&#39;s it?</p>
<p>Anyone else having these issues? Suggestions?</p>

							<p>Titanium Developer 1.2.2 was a very minor update to the JavaScript logic for the Titanium Desktop app, and wouldn&#39;t affect your compile or deploy times.  </p>
<p>The binary size is much larger in 1.5 right now, as many more classes are being shipped with the SDK to support all the new Android features we&#39;ve added.  We&#39;re aware of this and are looking at ways to shrink our binary sizes.</p>
<p>As for your issues downgrading to Mobile 1.4.x, it could be that Developer is not successfully clobbering your old project files.  Removing the contents of the build&#x2F;android directory (but not the directory its self) should force Titanium Mobile&#39;s build scripts to regenerate everything.</p>
<p>In terms of the general slowness of the emulator, the Android tooling is generally really slow, so it&#39;s tough to say where the fault lies - and if you&#39;ve updated your Android tools lately, that might be another change factor to consider.  Our build process is probably also slower, since we are now looking for JSS and i18n files during the build process, and doing some additional work we didn&#39;t do before.</p>
<p>If your app is significantly slower on the device (our real runtime target) then it would be prudent to start stripping out components of your app to see where the issue lies so we can attack it separately.</p>

							<p>Thanks for the reply Kevin. I&#39;ve cleared out the build directory as you say. The emulator &amp; android tooling has always been a bit slow as you say. But this is painfully slow.</p>
<p>All my app does is download &amp; parse a small delimited text file and then update eight or ten labels on a window. There aren&#39;t many features to remove! Prior to the update, the process was quick…in the emulator less than two seconds. Now, it&#39;s easily two minutes.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t put the app on my droid. I give it a whirl to see if it&#39;s slow there too. But I&#39;m trying to lay out the UI and I&#39;m doing a lot of back and forth compiling to tweak positions, etc. Putting it on a device each time is not the easiest &amp; fastest way to go. </p>
<p>Tim</p>

										<p><p>sadly, this is currently the easiest and fastest way to go.  The round trip to the device is slightly faster than to the emulator.  we&#39;re actively looking for ideas to speed this up.</p>

							<p>It&#39;s much faster on my Droid. So, other than being painful to tweak the UI in the emulator, I guess I can move forward with the project. Thanks.</p>
