			<h1>How to open new page on submit button which is on layout page after entering textbox value ?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We have a requirement to implement search page on each page on the site. We are using MVC 5.0, AngularJs, EntityFramework for our application.</p>
<p>I have 2 textboxes  named as ID and Name and 2 dropdowns named as Status and Description on _Layout page in MVC 5.0.</p>
<p>I have filled dropdowns from database using List &lt;selecteditem&gt; .cs file.</p>
<p>When I put any ID and Name and select any status and description then it should show the results on another page with the grid. I am using here AngularJS ng-grid.</p>
<p>Please let me know how to write function on submit  button which should take parameters and based on that it should  show the results in grid on another page.</p>
<p>Please advice me asap. I am new to MVC.</p>
<p>Thanks &amp; Regards,</p>
<p>CareerCare</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I am confused as this question does not appear to have anything to do with Appcelerator Titanium.</p>
<p>You have not provided any additional information in order for me to determine exactly what set up you have or which target platforms you are aiming for.  However you are referencing many HTML libraries and one of the file extensions leads me to believe we are referring to c# code.  None of these things are related to Titanium.</p>
<p>So it would be very helpful at this stage if you could provide the following information;</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you actually using Appcelerator Titanium?</li>
<li>Are you instead using a Microsoft development platform or similar? </li>
<li>If you are using Titanium;<ul>
<li>What platforms are you targeting; Android, iOS, other?</li>
<li>What Ti SDK version are you using?</li>
<li>Please supply useful snippets related only to this issue - NOT the entire code</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If as I suspect you are not using Appcelerator Titanium then this is not the forum for you, our expertise and focus is solely Titanium and related code (for example server side scripts for APIs).  So we will not be able to provide assistance.  However if yu are focusing on Titanium then provide the details above and we can see what help we can provide you.</p>
