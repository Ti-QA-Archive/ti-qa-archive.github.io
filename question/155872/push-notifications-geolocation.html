			<h1>Push notifications geolocation</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Is it possible to make a push notification to a limited geolocation area of the users?</p>
<p>Lets say that i want to make a push to every user that is in 1500m radius from a gps coordinate that i send from my server.</p>
<p>Scenario:<br>I put the lat &amp; lon or street adress and send it to the app but only the users 1500m or less from it will recieve it. </p>
<p>If possible where can i read up on the subject? </p>
<p>Thanx.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I am building this very thing into an app right now.  In order to get this to work this is where most people start off;</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to know the current location of the device</li>
<li>You need to tell the server when the device enters that location</li>
<li>You need to tell the server when the device leaves that location</li>
<li>The server needs to send individual push notification to each device that is still in the location</li>
</ul>
<p>However that is a LOT of work, a lot of battery power and more importantly lots and lots of individual push notifications (or groups of individual push notifications).</p>
<p>Having spent a while on this and trying to make it much easier I found a better and in hindsight a more logical way of thinking about this;</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor the device an get alerted when the device enters or exists the location(s)</li>
<li>Re-register for push notifications and including or excluding a <strong>tag</strong> defining that location</li>
<li>The server sends a single push notification for that area that all those &quot;listening** for the tag will pick up</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I patted myself on the back for solving the logic<strong>.  However I still needed to monitor the current location and receive events that could tell me if I entered or exited a location.  A smart guy call Aaron Saunders can help with this.  He has created a custom module that exposes the underlying iOS ability to </strong>Geo-Fence*</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aaronksaunders&#x2F;ci.geofencing">ci.geofencing</a></li>
</ul>
<p>With this module you can very simply provide a lat&#x2F;lon pair, the distance from that point in metres and a location name and then listen for events such as;</p>
<ul>
<li>monitoring_region</li>
<li>entered_region</li>
<li>exited_region</li>
</ul>
<p>The example code he provides within the module, shows you just how simple it is to define the monitoring regions and how to detect the events.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aaronksaunders&#x2F;ci.geofencing&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;example&#x2F;app.js">example code</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you are monitoring the areas you can simply register for push notifications with a <strong>tag</strong> as it is referred to with <strong>Urban Airship</strong> for that region if you are in it and without that tag if you are outside it.  Then when the server sends a push to all those inside 1,500 metres of the Eiffel Tower (example only) those whose devices updated the registration within that area will receive them and those that had moved away or not yet entered will not get the push notification.</p>
<p>Surprisingly simpler than you may have first thought.</p>

										<p><p>Sort of… I dont want it to be like a &quot;Normal&quot; geoloc app that senses when you are in a certain position. I want to send out lat &amp; lon from server side and then check wich devices that are in that area. Those devices should get the push. So the location will be different every time. I will mark it answered because it did answer the basics of my initial q. Thanx</p>

										<p><p>Malcolm: I&#39;ve downloaded the ci.geofencing module zip and followed all the steps on https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;tis&#x2F;Using+Titanium+Modules but can&#39;t get it to work (module is not found). This, I should add, have worked when loading other modules.</p>
<p>Any suggestions on how to get the ci.geofencing module to work? Any help is much appreciated.</p>
<p>SDK: 3.2.1<br>Platform: iPhone</p>

										<p><p>Never mind, got it to work after I realized there were a few steps to take before the module was Titanium compatible.</p>

							<p>If your app send the own position to your server – yes. In other case I don&#39;t see a way.</p>
<p>Nebbich: good idea</p>
