			<h1>Titanium Studio can&#39;t launch Android Emulator after update</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>Alongside other developers on this forum I can&#39;t launch the Android Emulator from Titanium Studio after updating the Android SDK.  The error I get is as follows:</p>
<p>invalid command-line parameter: and.<br>Hint: use &#39;@foo&#39; to launch a virtual device named &#39;foo&#39;.<br>please use -help for more information<br>[DEBUG] signal caught: 3<br>[DEBUG] calling emulator kill on 5292<br>ERROR: The process &quot;5292&quot; not found.</p>
<p>I applied the &#39;no-spaces&#39; fix by removing all spaces from the directory pointing to the android sdk but that hasn&#39;t worked.  Created a new project as well as re-installed everything, still get the same issue.  This is blocking my development and would really appreciate it if anyone could shed some light on how to fix this and&#x2F;or if the Appcelerator team are working on a fix.</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>

							<p>I modified the builder.py as described <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;122318&#x2F;cannot-launch-android-emulator-from-titanium-after-updated-to-android-sdk-version-12">here</a> (look at all comments!). This solves the problem for me. :)</p>

										<p><p>Hi Peter.  Thanks for the response.  I can&#39;t locate builder.py anywhere, have done a system wide search for it with no results.  I also don&#39;t have the path mentioned in the post (C:\ProgramData..).  Have double checked in the root of my Titanium Studio installation.  Is this maybe a specific path generated by Titanium Developer instead of studio?</p>

										<p><p>The builder.py is located in a subdirectory (win32\1.7.1\android) of the mobilesdk directory. The following wiki article describes, where you can find the mobilesdk:</p>
