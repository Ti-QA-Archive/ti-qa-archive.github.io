										<p><p>You would have to know a server side language like PHP, write an email script, and an auth script to protect it, and a RESTful web service to access it, and on the iPhone side build your own email form, and use http calls to your newly created web service to send the email.</p>
<p>This is far more complicated then the simple iOS email form to do, but as apple provides to APIs to set a default sender for an email… this is the only way to do what your trying to do.</p>
