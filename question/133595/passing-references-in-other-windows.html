			<h1>Passing references in other windows</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am using multiple window apps being controlle via Tabgroup. I am using .js files for each window which are passed as URL with each window. I also have a function.js file where I am writing routines for reusable code;for instance Form generation or table View etc. Now I got stuck in a situation where I have to call a function which generates form element which are in WindowA. In WindowA I explicitly defined all required form elements. Now what do I pass in my function routine that it gets the reference of already created form element.</p>
<p>Please note that TableView created in separate Window, say WinB and I am generating rows by calling  a routine written in functions.js. Ia m getting undefined error despite of variables are global in WinA.</p>
<p>How can I get the reference of those variables in entire application?</p>

							<p>Hi Adnan, to pass reference you have to do such a simple work. object name of your window and your custom name as reference and your variable what you want to pass.<br>E.g. win.CustomName = YourReference;<br>win is an window object and CustomName is a object which you can access on other window which you want to open and YourReference is your reference Parameter. if you don&#39;t understan then ask me again.</p>

										<p><p>I have a function <strong>generateForm()</strong> this function calls in WinB. WinB&#39;s code in seperate file winB.js. WinB calls a function <strong>displayList()</strong> which has the code of <strong>TableView</strong> and it&#39;s event. On the click event of table, I want to call <strong>generateForm()</strong>. The function shows elements given in <strong>WinA</strong>. Now in WinB I pass the reference of WinA, it says, undefined.</p>

										<p><p>I need to access the Window element in <strong>generteForm()</strong> which is actually in a common function file named <em>*function.js</em> </p>
<p>The form element of <em>WinA</em> are instantiated in wina.js file which was passed in <em>url</em> parameter of <strong>createWindow</strong>.</p>
<p>The thing is that function.js file is unable to get the reference of elements created in <em>wina.js</em></p>
