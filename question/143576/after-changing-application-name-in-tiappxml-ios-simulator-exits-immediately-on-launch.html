			<h1>After changing application name in TiApp.xml iOS simulator exits immediately on launch</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Exactly as the title says. After testing, and retesting, I can make my application launch in the simulator <strong><em>just fine</em></strong> if I keep the apps original name, but as soon as I change the <code>&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;</code> field in tiapp.xml, the simulator opens to a black screen, then immediatly exits with no errors. Same thing happens (less the immedate exit) when I open the xcode project.</p>
<p>The original name was too long and had a space in it, when shortned to one word it works fine on Android (and building&#x2F;running on the Android emulator on the mac) but with the iOS simulator, this strange behavor is all I&#39;ve got. No other files contain the original name (at least those that I can find. Any ideas?</p>

							<p>Try setting the name using the i18n facilities. In the root of your project, create a &quot;i18n&quot; folder, then inside that create an &quot;en&quot; folder for English. Inside that folder, create a file called &quot;app.xml&quot; and set the app name there:</p>
<p><code>myproject&amp;#x2F;i18n&amp;#x2F;en&amp;#x2F;app.xml</code></p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-pi">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">resources</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">string</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">name</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"appname"</span>&gt;</span>&amp;amp;lt;name&amp;amp;gt;<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">string</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">resources</span>&gt;</span>

										<p><p>Ok so.. This does work (and was on my radar to try), but this begs the question: What the hell is going on that I must keep the OLD app name? Second, What will the app name be in another locale? The old app name? That seems somewhat unnacceptable and unpredictable.</p>

										<p><p>You can set the app name to anything you&#39;d like. The problem is when the name is blindly inserted into the main.m file (copied from the Titanium SDK folder). I&#39;m sure if the name was properly escaped, it wouldn&#39;t be an issue.</p>
<p>But because of that bug, you should only set your app name to something without special chars. Then using the i18n facility, you can set whatever name you want. The i18n app name is then compiled into build&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;build&#x2F;Debug-iphoneos&#x2F;your.app&#x2F;en.lproj&#x2F;InfoPlist.strings file where Xcode performs magic.</p>
<p>I have no clue what happens if you don&#39;t create an app.xml for Spanish and set the iOS device&#39;s locale to Spanish. Maybe it defaults to the English app.xml name or the app&#39;s name. I would be curious to find out.</p>
<p>FWIW, the new Titanium CLI that&#39;s coming out soon fixes the main.m insertion bug and should allow whatever name you&#39;d like.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks much for the clarification, quite cool. And yea, my guess is that it simply takes the &quot;Default&quot;, I seriously doubt it would take the english version, that&#39;s pretty arbitrary.</p>
<p>It&#39;s just strange considering the <em>new</em> name (that the app <strong><em>doesn&#39;t load</em></strong> with) has no spaces, all ascii, nothing special, and the old one is also nothing special, less the single space. Feh.</p>
<p>How long till that new Titanium  CLI comes out? ;)</p>

										<p><p>Aha.. all becomes clear.</p>
<p>Next problem: Apparently this app name translation only applies to iOS, Android (which was working fine) now uses the old name. Any way to get Android to show the translated name or to use the new App name without changing it by hand before I build? :P</p>

										<p><p>Yep. Clean build, all files updated and in the right place. App shows up as the old name (currently setup in the tiapp.xml). Android never had a problem running with this app name kerfuffle, the problem becomes that the original app name was far too long to ever fit under an icon, and as such, the higher ups don&#39;t want it.</p>

										<p><p>Ugh. I talked with the Android team and Allen is looking into it. Not sure I&#39;ll get an answer today. It&#39;s possible Android simply didn&#39;t implement it.</p>

										<p><p>@chris i tried i18n facility to change name of my application but it didnt worked for me.<br>My appname (&lt;name&gt;) was &quot;Sample Sample&quot; which was working fine till 2.1.3,<br>After i updated Ti SDK 3.0.0 and MVC alloy it is showing &quot;Sample Sample is not a valid value for NCName&quot; and generates a red-x pop-up error message in the TiApp Editor in Tiapp.xml.<br>This is very critical for me as previous version is on appstore and need to update the same quickly.<br>This is for both ios and android</p>

							<p>That was hard to track down, I could see it happening when changing the tiapp.xml, but had completely forgotten that I renamed the app. It happens even with plain english letters e.g. change MyApp to MyCoolApp. </p>
<p>It is actually the simulator that caches the name.</p>
<p>Easiest way to fix it is open the simulator and the do <code>Reset Contents and settings ...</code>.</p>
<p>If you cannot get the emulator opened, try deleting the file <code>com.apple.mobile.installation.plist</code> found in <code>~&amp;#x2F;Library&amp;#x2F;Application Support&amp;#x2F;iPhone Simulator&amp;#x2F;6.0&amp;#x2F;Library&amp;#x2F;Caches&amp;#x2F;com.apple.mobile.installation.plist</code>, it seems to be the offender.</p>
<p>You may also want to remove the existing Applications in <code>~&amp;#x2F;Library&amp;#x2F;Application Support&amp;#x2F;iPhone Simulator&amp;#x2F;6.0&amp;#x2F;Applications</code>.</p>

										<p><p>The project actually can not launch at all without cleaning the build after changing the name, So I&#39;ve got that covered. Also the manifest file <strong><em>already</em></strong> has the new name. No other files at all have the old name. My only thought might be that something to do with the Macbook I&#39;m using.</p>
