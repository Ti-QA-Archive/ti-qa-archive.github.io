			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>While working on our app, we&#39;ve found several issues &#x2F; bugs in the Titanium code on Android. Issues are mostly related to activity management, but also in the code generation (NULL pointer access in the templates).</p>
<p>After working the last couple of weeks on the various crashes that we experienced on Android, our app now looks stable, but we&#39;ve had to make a few changes in the SDK.<br>We&#39;d obviously like these fixes to be merged back onto the trunk as at the moment we&#39;ve had to fork the code and we&#39;re compiling the SDK ourselves.</p>
<p>A few of these fixes are for some issues that have been raised as tickets in the past on the TIMOB Jira project, but were closed because they could not be reproduced. For some of the other issues we fixed we couldn&#39;t find a JIRA ticket.</p>
<p>What&#39;s the preferred way to submit these issues? Shall we ask to reopen tickets, shall we create new ones…? Should we talk to a TIMOB developer directly?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Eric</p>

										<p><p>Nothing will be accepted without the CLA signed.</p>
<p>For existing tickets, reference the PR that applies JUST TO THAT TICKET.</p>
<p>For non-existent tickets, create a ticket, with reproducible use case, then reference the PR.</p>
<p>One PR, One Ticket.  Else QE becomes unmanageable.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks. The &quot;reproducible&quot; use case may be hard as we could not always find an easy-to-reproduce set of steps - most of the time it was a question of &quot;wait until the app crashes and look at the core&quot;…</p>
