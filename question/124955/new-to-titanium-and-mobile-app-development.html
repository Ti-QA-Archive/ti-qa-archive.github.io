			<h1>New to Titanium And Mobile App Development</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am new to mobile app development and trying to figure out the best way to write apps that can be deployed to iOS, Android, webOS, and Blackberry etc. The documentation for Titanium Developer sounds like I need to create development environments using native SDKs and IDEs for all of these platforms including MAC for iOS and develop code for them individualy. I am interested in writing a single code base and creating app packages for all environments. Is that possible to do and if so, how? Can I write code in Titanium Studio and create install packages for all platforms?</p>

							<p>Titanium does use the native SDK and compiler to generate the install packages.  Since Apple only releases that for OSX, the iOS install package can only be created under OSX.  Android has native tools for both OSX and Windows, so can be created on either platform.  Blackberry support from Appcelerator is still in beta and I have not used it, but my understanding is it works best from Windows – but you may be able to do it from OSX as well.</p>
<p>For sure Windows cannot create the iOS installer, due to Apple&#39;s SDK limitations.  OSX for sure can create both iOS and Android – and maybe Blackberry.</p>
<p>Titanium does not support any of the other mobile platforms at this time, like Windows Mobile, Symbian, or webOS.</p>

							<p>…i think you have come to the right place and you know a little<br>something about what is required. Yes, all you mentioned is possible. Start with<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;get_started  to setup your environment, then mayb head over to http:&#x2F;&#x2F;training.appcelerator.com&#x2F;zero-to-app and go through each video. Definitely download and get KitchenSink sample app running. Best of luck, this forum is very helpful too.</p>
