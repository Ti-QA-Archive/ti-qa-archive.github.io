			<h1>Switching back to previous view</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have requirement where I want user to back to previous view when he click on a button.<br>I have two views one Thumbnail and other list(two button). At any given time user can choose one. When user click on thumbnail I am opening a new window with new view. User can switch to list view from thumbnail, reverse is true too. Android OS maintain a view (window ) stack when I use back button of emulator it give me the previous window. But I want it to control through code. If the window view does not exists I will create one but if it is already opened(not in view) I want it to bring it to front and push back the current view.</p>
<p>Please help.</p>

							<div><p>let me explain the application flow.</p>
<ol>
<li>User will login to the application through login screen (window).</li>
</ol>
<p>I don&#39;t want user to navigate back to login screen. Login screen should not be in stack after successful login.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>After login a data screen with thumbnail (image in grid) will be displayed along with data.</p>
</li>
<li><p>User can change the view by selecting list view from the toolbar (toolbar is part of the application). This will result in showing a different window (in a list format)</p>
</li>
<li><p>during the view change I am creating window. so after 3rd step I have two window one hidden and one visible.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now user can switch back to thumbnail view by selecting the view button from toolbar. At this point I don&#39;t want to create a new window. I want to bring the previous (which is in stack) window to front.</p>

							<p>Hi Avaya</p>
<p>View and window are totally two different things, views cant work by default as window. The requirement you saying like if the view is currently open then bring in front is partly not possible to do. </p>
<p>We can only able to add and remove the view from the window at particular event requirement. In order to know which is the current view or the last opened view just maintain one stack or i say array of views. Push the newly open view and pop if the view been closed. so when the user close the current view you can get the entry of last view from the array and take necessary steps to add it again. </p>
<p>I have done this kind of work in one app where the whole app having only one window and all others are just the view.</p>
<p>I Hope that this atleast help you to get some clue.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Nikunj</p>
