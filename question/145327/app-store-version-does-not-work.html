			<h1>App store version does not work</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>We have a strange problem. During testing everything in our iOS version works perfect: in the simulator, on multiple devices and even if we make an ad hoc version and test that one it still works. However, for some reason when we build it for the app store (and Apple approves it every time) things go wrong. Then all of a sudden there are 2 bugs (as far as we know) in the market version.</p>
<p>The problem is that we can&#39;t replicate the bugs, because during testing everything works perfectly. We have tried to do some changes, but we have to wait 1-2 weeks to get reviewed and see if that changes worked. We have submitted it 4 times now with the same problems over and over again.</p>
<p>Does anyone know how a way to test the &#39;store version&#39; or another solution to our problem?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I had a similar issue some time ago and the answer was because of an errant comma in a third-party library, for example ONLY not the code that had the error;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var view = Ti.UI.createLabel({
    <span class="hljs-variable">height</span>: Ti.UI.SIZE,
    <span class="hljs-built_in">text</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'Label'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-variable">width</span>: Ti.UI.SIZE, <span class="hljs-comment">// this comma was OUR problem.</span>
});
</code></pre><p>We also thought there was no way to test under the basis of an app-store app rather than a local device app - there are subtle differences - as I found out.</p>
<p>However, compile for ad-hoc (set up certificates) and this is the same end compile as the app store app, you can put this version on your device and it works the same as if you had compiled for the app store (or as far as I can tell).</p>
<p>This way you should be able to replicate the bugs, build in some test code, retest and keep going until all is well.  Then put back in the store.</p>
<p>A programmers life is not an easy one :(</p>

										<p><p>Hi Malcolm, thanks for your quick reply. We do not use third-party libraries, but i will search our code for the problem above.</p>
<p>The ad hoc is working fine on all (three) tested devices. However, the final version has problems on all three devices.</p>

										<p><p>Worth passing your code through <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jslint.com">JSlint.com</a> during the development process as well as this will highlight things you would never easily spot yourself.</p>
<p>If you have not used it before go to the bottom of the page and choose some of the forgiveness options like messy white space and variables declaration, otherwise you will be there all day on the first pass.</p>
<p>Also add Ti to the big white box at the bottom - this will stop it moaning it has yet to be declared.</p>
<p>Some more - &quot;require Ti alert exports L setTimeout Titanium&quot;</p>
<p>The library I referred to was a JS code library for oAuth, used for twitter - rather than an external module&#x2F;library.</p>
<p>Any hint as to what you are seeing - in case anyone here has an &quot;ah ha&quot; moment and can provide a starting point?</p>

										<p><p>Thanks! We will use the website you suggested. I will keep you up-to-date.  I left the examples out, because that might raise some more questions, but I will describe the problems:</p>
<p>1: the first one is a simple event listener (click, which has to start a clock) which is not working in the market version.</p>
<p>2: the 2nd problem is the situation where we do a preload of 5 windows when you click a button and it hangs somewhere in the beginning of that process, because we don&#39;t see any requests to our webserver. To make things more complicated, as far as we know, we only have this problem on a iPod Touch (4th gen) and have not seen that problem on any other device yet. But I am almost sure there have to be more with that problem. Again, this device has no problems with the ad hoc version.</p>

							<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>Can I ask what the issue was in the end? I am having a similar experience with an issue only appearing on the App Store and not in the simulator, or in the ad-hoc distribution build. I would be interested in what you located as the issue in your case, just in case it gives me some clues…</p>
<p>Matt</p>

										<p><p>Hi Matt,</p>
<p>We had 2 problems. The first problem we solved by rewriting the code. We changed the place where we initialized an event listener. Instead of doing it when the app is running, we initialized it while building the screen.</p>
<p>How we solved the second problem, we don&#39;t know yet. This was our plan however, but we never needed it: we have a login to our app, so we know when I am logged in. Next, we did know in what part of the app our problem was. So with our latest app submission we added code that if I am logged in, we write some parameters to the analytics systems of Appcelerator, and by looking which parameters are set and which aren&#39;t, we hoped to locate the problem exactly. However, while testing we found that our problem was gone.</p>
<p>If you know in what part of the programm your problem is, feel free to send the code to me, maybe I have some suggestions. You can contact me directly by DevMail and if we found a solution, I want to propose we post it here for everyone to read.</p>
