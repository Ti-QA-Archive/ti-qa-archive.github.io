			<h1>Question about pricing, should I go elsewhere?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello I spent the last couple days investigating your service for a client. All in all your framework and cloud looks like a solid choice. However I can not find a solid price structure anywhere. And anytime anyone asks about it the admins showering them in flowery words that often mean nothing. This alone scares me. I can not in good faith use your service, without the complete knowledge that you will not go after my client for any licensing fees. I understand your business, but if your service requires fees at any level it should be plainly stated.</p>
<p>So please in plain english answer these questions.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>What are the limitation to writing my app within your framework? Can I only be so profitable with the app? Can I freely transfer ownership of the app to someone else and expect that no matter what you will not contact them or go after them for licensing fees. (Out side of your cloud services)</p>
</li>
<li><p>What is the pricing structure of your cloud service? If you can not not tell me this I will not use it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Can I freely use other cloud services in my app instead of yours? Thus not sure you cloud services at all.</p>
</li>
<li><p>How do you know when an app uses your services? Do you have built in hidden analytics?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you for reading my question. I have no issue paying for your services. That said if you can not answer these questions, there are numerous equivalent frameworks that can answer these questions and have already done so via a simple web page. I will happily use them instead.</p>

							<p>This is a recurring question, that has been discussed already too many times. I&#39;d be really short:</p>
<ol>
<li>Free to do whatever you want, sell it, work for clients, set your computer on fire, etc. So FREE.</li>
<li>There is a free tier that is suited to a lot of apps (if you have more than 5M api calls per month then you have already a hell of an app and you should go enterprise -  so contact sales). So FREE under 5M calls.</li>
<li>Yes, Parse,Amazon, own server, you name it.</li>
<li>No hidden analytics. There is a setting in the tiapp.xml that disables them. The only call &quot;home&quot; is done to verify the modules. If you want to know how they know you are using ACS this is pretty clear to me - you make a call to Appc servers…</li>
</ol>
<p>Now the last part of your post is a little grumpy, don&#39;t take it so hard :).</p>

										<p><p>Awesome thanks for getting back to me. Sorry if the last bit appears grumpy, but its true. I have several accounts of Appcelerate coming after clients of programmers. Also I would really like to use their cloud service however I can not sign up a client with out a clear pricing structure. Even if ultimately its a better deal. I am confused why this is not offered and it worries me.<br>Great so I can use their service entirely for free? Thats pretty awesome.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I am not sure what to say here.  You are asking real questions - but repeatedly saying if you do not get the answers you want you will go elsewhere.  As vast majority of people here are not Appcelerator employees and are in fact loyal community members who give up their own free time to help others solves problems - the answer will be somewhat biased.  </p>
<p>But in short if you feel that angry before even trying something - I am not sure you are suited here.  The rest of the people here are not as negative as you appear to be in life or Appcelerator.</p>
<p>If you are genuinely interest in answers then there are plenty;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;162147&#x2F;what-is-the-pricing-agreemeant-for-appcelerator.html#answer-274689">What is the pricing agreemeant for appcelerator?</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>That is just one of the many answers to your question that can be found with a quick google search - trust me I just searched for one - found one of the many times I answered this querstion.</p>
<p>The answers to your specific questions in case that doe snot answer your needs.  </p>
<ul>
<li>What are the limitation to writing my app within your framework?</li>
</ul>
<p>None, the community version is free the paid for version is paid for.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can I only be so profitable with the app?</li>
</ul>
<p>Earn nothing, earn a million or more - that is up to you.  Nothing anywhere to stop you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can I freely transfer ownership of the app to someone else</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes</p>
<ul>
<li>…and expect that no matter what you will not contact them or go after them for licensing fees. (Out side of your cloud services)</li>
</ul>
<p>No one is going after your clients for any sort of fees.  Unless you choose to exceed the free level of cloud services then YOU will be asked to arrange a licence fee if YOU decide the client should continue to use the services - but the licence is with the client.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the pricing structure of your cloud service?</li>
</ul>
<p>Loads of free stuff, when you have used that up then you move the paid version of the solution.  As the solution is tied to your actual needs the best thing to do is call sales now or in the future.  Kep in mind this only affects Cloud services - do not use them - no worries - stay on the community version.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you can not not tell me this I will not use it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Seriously - felt the need to repeat yet again?</p>
<ul>
<li>Can I freely use other cloud services in my app instead of yours?</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes whatever you like - you are not tied to anything you do not want to be.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thus not sure you cloud services at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>Correct your choice - any service, the ACS cloud service are very easy as they are built-in but again use what you like - I do.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you know when an app uses your services?</li>
</ul>
<p>Because you make API calls to the services, send a push it goes the server to make the server call, store something on the server - it is stored on the server.  Nothing hidden, nothing spying on you - if it is in the cloud it must have gone up to the - well, cloud.  This is not the NSA.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have built in hidden analytics?</li>
</ul>
<p>Nope, there are analytics - you can access, you can add your own choice if you wish - or turn them off - your choice.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the limitations </li>
</ul>
<p>Very open question.  I will assume you mean if you pay nothing what do you not get.  You will not paid paid support services - you come here for help and no SLA as the solution is free.  You can only use the free elements of the cloud services - 5 million pushes for example - sounds like a lot - because it is a lot.  Titanium does not do what you need, find a custom module to colve the problem.  Cannot find one - build one - that ability is built in.</p>
<p>So in short - calm down, you asked questions and got answers, you got them quickly and you got them concisely.  No one is out to get you or steal your money.</p>
<p>If you end up making millions you do not have to pay Appcelerator a single penny.  Then the question becomes - if you made millions from something you got for nothing - is that fair - you decide - but it is still free.</p>
<p>Need the benefits of the EXTRAS that a paid account gives - cool get a paid account.</p>
<p>But next come - come back without the attitude - we are here to help not get moaned at before we have even had chance to screw up anything.</p>

										<p><p>Please explain where I &quot;raged&quot; as you put it?  &quot;…not satisfactorily answered…&quot; - I am glad I spent the time trying to help you with answers.</p>
<p>Where did I fail to answer any of your question and without sufficient detail?  Did you also ignore the link I provided which went into more detail?</p>
<p>My entire summary was - you have this thing for free if you want it - or you can pay, call sales and ask them - weird this was not your first port of call.</p>
<p>In your follow ups that you have heard of clients being hounded for fees - I answered that already in the first questions I answered.  </p>
<p>Did you even read any of this answer?</p>
<p>I think you are referring to very old posts about a single incident that affected one country (the one I reside in) where overly enthusiastic sales people decided to go very off script and without anyone&#39;s approval.  This was dealt with immediately by the CEO of the company and in a follow up open letter to everyone.  The internet is full of information - it is up to you to put it into context.</p>
<p>You are very clearly someone who wants to take - then take some more - then when you have enough - take some more.  This is a pleasant community of liked minded people who enjoy giving their time to those who seek out genuine assistance for genuine needs.</p>
<p>I hope you are not - but this question appears to have the single goal of trolling.</p>
<p>Prove me wrong and respond with something intelligent and I will return with kind.</p>

										<p><p>Jason is that how you deal with your problems?</p>
<p>Malcolm your answer was a short essay, where it needed to be four lines. Whats your problem. You read someones questions and took personal offense. Its rather silly. Your reply was very flippant and of course I looked at the pricing model and of course I contacted their sales team. They have yet to reply and I need to start working now. Again I think you know the answers to those questions. The website is very unclear and avoids any discussion about price. If these were not real concerns of real people then why do people ask this question so often?</p>
<p>Ultimately I was hoping my question would attract a sales rep, because my numerous emails have not succeed at that.</p>
<p>So good bye and no your essay was not very helpful. Honestly it added more to my fear about their pricing structure.<br>Thanks, Dakota</p>

										<p><p>So a short essay (you asked for PLAIN English) - you asked lots of questions - I answered each one in turn - if you are not sure - read YOUR questions, and see that EACH one was answered.  You answered many more than four questions - you may have number them incorrectly but still I can spot a question when I see one.</p>
<p>You are suggesting I know the price model and want to keep it secret - why an earth would I do this and having ALREADY told you how the pricing is determined - you ignored that and believe the world is out to get you.  Maybe it is - maybe it isn&#39;t - I wasn&#39;t.</p>
<p>If you are less clear after reading the answers to your own questions come up with better questions - the answer in short were; it is free, you choose services you use, nobody is tracking you, of course your usage of premium features are documented - hard not to when they are actioned on the actual cloud they provide.  </p>
<p>You suggest my answer was flippant - maybe, hold my hand up to that one.  But did you read YOUR question, you suggested that everything was wrong, everything was tracking you and why should you pay for anything.</p>
<p>I am sorry you have not spoken to a sales rep. had you of mentioned that earlier on I would have made sure you got in touch with one.</p>
<p>Good luck in your future endeavours - wherever you go to from here - but seriously get a life or at least be pleasant.  BTW did you note that the only follow ups here have been to ask you &quot;seriously&quot; of similar.  It is our fault we have not been exposed to people who appear to be impolite from the start, during and at the end of their own question that often, so it is a massive surprise.</p>

										<p><p>Whoa the way you interpreted my questions is unsettling. Please reread my post and attempt to not attribute your own preconceived notion of my anger. I never mentioned anything about &quot;everything being wrong&quot;, &quot;everything was tracking&quot;, and that I shouldn&#39;t have to pay… TBH I want tracking and as I mentioned I don&#39;t mind paying for a service.<br>Also I never said you would be holding back a pricing model. I merely suggest that because you already know it, its apparent to you, but not new appcelerator customers this is backed up by the fact that there are numerous posts asking what exactly their pricing model is and that their website does not state it. Please learn to give people the benefit of the doubt before you go off the deep end.</p>
