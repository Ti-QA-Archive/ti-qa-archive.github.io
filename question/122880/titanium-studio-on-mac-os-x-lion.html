<p>In TiStudio, Android is greyed out as a deployment target even though it is checked and even though the SDK is seen in the configuration dialogs.</p>
<p>I&#39;m off to lunch, when I get back, will pull the new xCode, install it, and work through these minor issues.</p>

							<div><p>Lovely.  xCode 4.1 hung on install. &quot;Please close iTunes&quot;.  Hrm, no iTunes running.  Had to hit the terminal and kill the ituneshelper process.  Just an FYI.

							<p>Just gone through the process and it&#39;s all pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>Simply uninstall your old version of XCode by running:</p>
<p><code>sudo [xcode-path]&amp;#x2F;Library&amp;#x2F;uninstall-devtools --mode=all</code></p>
<p>Then go the Mac App store, download the latest version of Xcode which is free and version 4.1</p>
<p>Install that and voila, everything works perfectly with the latest version of Titanium Studio and Titanium Mobile 1.7.1+ (Lion support was added in 1.7.1)</p>

							<p>i have lion gm working here on both iOS4.3 SDK and android with xcode 4.1gm&#x2F;xcode4.2b3. i had also iOS5, itunes 10.5b3 and xcode 4.2 running without any problems when compiling things</p>
<p>please note, that even if you are able to run code on iOS5 simulator and on the device (you will also be able to compile for 4.3 using sdk 5.0) you can&#39;t use xcode 4.2 for validating and submitting an app (also doesn&#39;t work when choosing sdk 4.3 in titanium studio when creating a distribution package), apple doesn&#39;t seem to accept apps signed with xcode 4.2 at the moment. you will have to remove itunes 10.5 beta and xcode 4.2, and believe me, this isn&#39;t a procedure you want to run through</p>
<p>i also tried to use snow leopard and xcode 4.1 in an virtual box image, and couldn&#39;t compile an app there, however this could be related to having not enough memory inside the virtual machine, or not having waited long enough for the code to have finished compiling, xcode seemed to hang with 50% cpu-usage for half an hour when i finally stopped trying ;-)</p>

										<p><p>So I will be submitting an app to the app store next week, if I upgrade to Lion I should stick to Xcode 4.0.2 and not upgrade to Xcode 4.2?</p>

										<p><p>i don&#39;t think there is a xcode 4.0.x for lion, you will have to use xcode 4.1 for lion which is gm at the moment, and i guess will be updated in the mac store, and made available in the ios dev section very soon, as lot of ios devs will install the lion today and the gm wasn&#39;t available to ios devs but only to mac devs</p>
<p>i submitted an app by using xcode 4.1gm today, and it valitated&#x2F;submitted without any problems</p>

										<p><p>i&#39;d like to note i&#39;m pretty sure that xcode4.2 is meant to be used for iOS5 development only, which might be the cause for not being able to submit 4.3 apps using it. i&#39;m not sure, if the error results from ti studio not using the correct sdk (even when choosing sdk 4.3) when creating a distribution package, or it&#39;s apple having crippled the code signing process in xcode4.2</p>
