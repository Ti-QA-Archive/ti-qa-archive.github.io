		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve been using Ti Developer for a long time now i&#39;m looking into using Ti Studio, for obvious reasons, but my question is:<br>Do I need uninstall Ti Developer before i install Ti Studios? or can i run both at the same? or have both installed on the same windows machine and run one at a time? Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

							<p>Actually Titanium Studio is eclipse, so installing titanium studio will install everything. This does include eclipse.</p>
<p>Basically eclipse is the IDE and it has been customised and packaged as Titanium studio to work specifically the way it is required. But you still have the full functionality of eclipse so you can add all the tools like svn or ruby stuff if needed.</p>
<p>Also although the developer tool will still be there I don,t think any more work is being done on it, they are purely focusing on studio.</p>
<p>Hope this explains it.</p>
<p>T.</p>

							<p>You can have both installed at the same time. You can also run both at the same time however from my experience, Ti Studio sometime affect the output of Ti Developer…</p>

										<p><p>No, Ti Studio is a fork of Aptana which is a fork of Eclipse :) So with Ti Studio you are good to go.</p>
