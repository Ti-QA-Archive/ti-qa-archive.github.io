			<h1>Is there no ordinary dropdownmenu / combobox in Titanium???</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all.</p>
<p>Im looking for a way to create a standard dropdown menu, for my app.<br>And it seems like Titanium does not have such a thing.</p>
<p>Im talking the classic dropdownmenu, where you see 1 textfield (usually empty at first), and a small arrow at the right side. And when you click it, a list of options is made visible. You click one of the items in the list, and the list dissappears and your textfield holds that value.</p>
<p>I have looked into the Pickers of Titanium, and it seems like this is the replacement for this classic UI-element.</p>
<p>Is is really nessesary to use a picker for this? I mean, it seems like a lot of work:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Creating a container view for the picker</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add the picker to the containing view &quot;picker-view&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create a event on the textfield, to show the picker-view (and deal with all the hassle of controlling the z-index, since the picker-view will be on top of some other views in my app)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create a event to handle the transfer of the value from the picker to the textfield, and then hiding the picker-view once again.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>phew… what a load of work… Or am I missing something here???</p>

							<p>Titanium implements what is available on the native platforms. So you&#39;re not looking for such a thing in Titanium, you are looking for the equivalent in native controls. The picker seems to be what you are looking for. In the time that it took you to list out all those steps, you could have created and implemented the picker. Its just Ti.UI.createPicker()</p>

										<p><p>I gathered as much when you offered it to him as an answer. However, if he has a lot of options to choose from, then the option dialog would quickly become an issue. A picker is always the same size and holds as many options as you need.</p>

										<p><p>Haha, the point was that its not nearly as much work as you had made it out to be. You just create the picker, it doesn&#39;t need a container. Hiding and showing the picker on a single event is 3 lines of code, and you don&#39;t have to worry about z-index, because its handled natively by the app. Adding the chosen selection to the text field in an event is another 3 lines of code. So quite literally, in almost as many lines as it took to write out all the steps, the picker can be created.</p>

										<p><p>The TitanUp library that Stephen mentions above also has a component that does all this for you with a bit of overhead for the library if that is more your style.</p>

										<p><p>Or you could rip out the SimplePicker from the library if you want to avoid the overhead.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too terribly entwined with the rest of the library code.</p>
