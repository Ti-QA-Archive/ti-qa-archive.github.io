										<p><p>For the <em>very small empty rows between actual rows</em>, try making a TableViewRow with <code>height:15</code> (or whatever height you want) and <code>color:&amp;#39;transparent&amp;#39;</code>.  If the row turns out taller than you asked for, there is a minRowHeight property of the TableView that may need to be set.  I have not tested this exact case, but I have built TableViews with varying row heights mixed into one TableView.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Shawn</p>
<p>It appears you have suggested that creating empty short rows as the solution to including a <code>margin</code> equivalent to the row layout.  If I am miss-understanding what you have suggested - please accept my apologies.</p>
<p>If this is the case - then this does not need to be done and depending on the number of records will affect performance unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Please refer to the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;140576&#x2F;how-to-get-a-height-of-label-after-titanium-sdk-2-i-can-get-it-before-2#answer-244558">answer provided to Takumi</a> - that provides a very clear example of how there is NO need to fake any elements by adding rows. </p>
<p>That is bad practice.  Again if I have not got the point of the suggestion I am sorry.</p>

										<p><p>Malcolm, there&#39;s more than one way to skin a cat.  My answer was not &quot;bad practice&quot; (that&#39;s an opinionâ¦not a fact).  If he doesn&#39;t have a ton of rows, then my solution is easier than creating another view for the contents.  In fact, my first answer to him was &quot;<em>For a margin around the contents of a row, set the contents&#39; top, left, right, and bottom properties.</em>&quot;  He didn&#39;t go for that.  So I suggested the blank row idea.</p>
<p>Your solution will also work, but it also has touch implications (click event listeners on the row might need to be moved to the view, the color flash to visually indicate a touch might not show, etc.).</p>

										<p><p>Hi Shawn - as I said I never meant to insult.  Just trying to help improve things for everyone as the newer SDK versions have made many things we had to &#39;hack&#39; in the past now redundant.</p>
<p>The concerns you had with my suggestion do not actually occur, the touch events work correctly and there is no visual flash.</p>
<p>There is a fuller version of the sample code if you would like to see it, it includes performance tweaks, removes touch handlers from child views that do not need to receive them and uses the new property to set the selected text colour on child elements.</p>
<p>Let me know.</p>

							<p>Hi Mohamed </p>
<p>I answered a question about this a couple of days ago, check out the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;140576&#x2F;how-to-get-a-height-of-label-after-titanium-sdk-2-i-can-get-it-before-2#answer-244558">answer I gave Takumi</a>.</p>
<p>This shows you how to make a <code>tableviewrow</code> with optional caption and set table margins inside the row itself, it all automatically calculates positions and height and works in iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Should solve your problem.</p>
