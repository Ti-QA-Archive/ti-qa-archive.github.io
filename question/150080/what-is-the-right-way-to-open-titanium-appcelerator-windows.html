			<h1>What is the right way to open titanium appcelerator windows?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am working on a Titanium Appcelerator iOS app that contains an initial Dashboard screen and 2 separate screens that can be accessed from the Dashboard.</p>
<p>I have set up my app to use a navigation controller and everything is controlled from a main.js file using custom event listeners. I do this so that I can separate the code for each screen into separate files.</p>
<p>The problem is that with each screen that loads, I have to open the window on the nav stack and then add all the elements to it. This is fine for one of the screens because it just contains a few views and labels. However, the other screen has a MapView and it takes 3 seconds or so to load after the user sees the screen open.</p>
<p>What is the right way to handle this? Is there a way to preload the window before opening but to keep my current architecture?</p>
<p>This question is also on StackOverflow, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;15644557&#x2F;what-is-the-right-way-to-open-titanium-appcelerator-windows">here</a>.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>There are lots of ways to do lots of things and this one is certainly going to be code related - by this I mean how you ate currently architecting your app.  So you are going to have to show us some code to get a real answer here.  There are a few techniques that can be considered general, but nothing really provides a single solution to the myriad of variations of UI on UX that your app might delve into.</p>
<p>You have to consider the use case, the difference between perceived and real delays and how to mask them or speed them up.  You have to include where your information is coming from; a network call will be slower than a db call but a hard-coded UI is faster than all.</p>
<p>So you could (can) create windows in the background and only add them to whatever UI stack you are using WHEN they are needed - the visual work will have already been completed so should be just an attach time frame.  But this reduces the opportunity to build the window based on external factors and more I,port antsy could be a memory hog.  Remember you only get a certain amount to play with.</p>
<p>Progress indicators help the user understand something is coming, and WHEN you show these can help the user appreciate them more.  For example adding a progress indicator on a tableRow they just clicked gives immediate feedback that an action has occurred, build the window then show all at once.  However you must remember to ignore any new table clicks or you kill the experience - and possibly crash the app.</p>
<p>Remember you can cache things to give the appearance of speed, cache remote data in a DB and grab that first, then ping the network and determine if the data has changed, if so get the new data and then tell the user there is a new set to show.  This works best if the data stays the same most of he time and changes infrequently.</p>
<p>You can image cache as well, all UI elements have the ability to <strong>toImage</strong>, this creates an I age copy of that state. Remember last state for each main window and show that next time on a slow build window, then hide it to reveal the new data.  Apple themselves do this thought the OS to increase the perceived speed.</p>
<p>There is a lot to go through there - it is basically horses for courses.  If the app is small has little to no network calls and minimal db access then creating windows in the background might be the best bet.  If not, work out the real delay and offset it by caching or giving a perceived improvement with progress indicators and other feedback.</p>
<p>This will NOT solve all your potential issues, that is your job of course - just focus on each type of issue and solve that, then move to the next one.  Start with the biggest delays - perceived or real and I,prove those, the rest will follow.</p>
