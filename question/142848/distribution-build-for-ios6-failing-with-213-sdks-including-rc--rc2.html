			<p>These are the errors I get when I try to do a distribution build for iOS6 &#x2F; iPhone 5.  This was all working last week with an earlier version of 2.1.3, but now I can&#39;t get it to work at all.  I&#39;m using xCode 4.5 of course and Ti Studio 2.1.2.201208301612</p>

										<p><p>No disrespect, but recent versions of Titanium SDKs and Ti Studio don&#39;t have the &quot;dirty code&quot; problem that say 1.6 or 1.7 had - so I find that Project Cleans are not needed very often.</p>
<p>And it definitely had nothing to do with this problem.</p>

							<p>Turned out to be an obscure bug in the JavaScript compiler - the same app ran fine on the iPhone and Android emulators but failed when trying to package for iPhone because the JavaScript compiler couldn&#39;t handle this…</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    var divisor = (<span class="hljs-keyword">boothGroup.evenhigh </span>- <span class="hljs-keyword">boothGroup.evenlow </span>+ <span class="hljs-number">1</span>) 
            / <span class="hljs-keyword">boothGroup.rows;</span>
</code></pre><p>Apparently, the compiler parses the first line as a complete arithmetic statement and then the second line as a malformed comment and causes the resulting error messages that I posted.</p>
<p>Seriously, this is what caused it.  The formatter had split the statement on to two lines.<br>This was in the smallest code file of a huge app - how we found it was a miracle.</p>
<p>Had nothing to do with modules or anything.  I had added the file with this code in between when it packaged OK and when it didn&#39;t, and as I said it ran fine on both emulators so that&#39;s why it was a real head-scratcher.</p>

										<p><p>My error may be the same as yours but there is obviously something else wrong with mine as I don&#39;t have any code that resembles yours.</p>

<p>Do you have any recommendations as to how to find the errant code since the [ERROR] is too vague?</p>

										<p><p>Thank you Joe and Ingo. I have still been unsuccessful in finding the issue in my code. The exact code compiled fine before adding the splash screen for iPhone 5 support and the SDK update for iOS 6 (including xcode 4.5). There is no change to the code base from my previous version.</p>
<p>I look forward to having this fixed. I have already informed my client that we will need to wait a week or two until this is resolved. Not really the discussion I wanted to have, if you know what I mean.</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s a different situation than what we had - we had multiple variables and the bug we found exists in all the 2.x SDKs and probably the 1.x SDKs too.  Other than this weird bug, I haven&#39;t had any problems &quot;converting&quot; 2.x iOS  5 projects to 2.1.3 iOS 6 projects.  If you do have multiple code files, I would still spend the time withdrawing files and seeing what happens.  You still might have something in there that is confusing the compiler.</p>

							<p>We had a base app that built so we deleted files from the new work until it built. And then zeroed in on the bad file by adding files to the build until it broke the build.  Took about an hour or so.  Even when you find the offending file, figuring out what is wrong is fun</p>
