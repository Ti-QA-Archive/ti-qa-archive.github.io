			<h1>Step by Step/Video of Publishing Titanium Apps for the Apple App Store</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>While there seems to be quite a body of questions regarding publishing, all of them seem to be very confusing and end up back at the Vimeo video, whih gives some guidlines, but no details.</p>
<p>There is a mixture of how you actually publish now..through the Titanium Developer or through X-code?</p>
<p>The Vimeo process alludes to filing out &quot;paperwork&quot; for app publication and gives a site, but there&#39;s really NO integration there.</p>
<p>I have two apps, one is a &quot;paid&quot; app, and one is a free &quot;lite&quot; app of the first that is free. I&#39;ve gotten them compiled, running and working on my device with no problems. </p>
<p>What I don&#39;t find is this &quot;paperwork&quot; to get the app into the company for approval.</p>
<p>If you have a really nice step by step list or a video set. Please share!</p>

							<p>From the very beginning…</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>1: developer.apple.com &gt; Member Center &gt; iOs Provisioning Portal</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Create your provisioning profiles, BOTH for development and for distribution (menu &quot;provisioning&quot;, tabs &quot;development&quot; and &quot;distribution&quot;). The first one is for test on device and the second one to distribute on app store (or ad hoc). Download them and double click on both.</p>
<p>I suppose you already have your WWDR intermediate certificate, app id and so on. If not, read carefully the &quot;Hows to&quot; in provisioning portal.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>2: Titanium Developer</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<p>Select your project, go to Test &amp; package. In &quot;Run on device&quot; fill all the fields and select the provisioning profile for DEVELOPMENT. I think you have already do this, since you have tested on your device.</p>
<p>When you are ready to send the app to Apple Store, go to Test &amp; Package &gt; Distribute. Fill all the fields and select the provisioning profile for DISTRIBUTION. Click &quot;package&quot; and, if there&#39;s no errors, XCode will open automatically and your project should be there.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>3: XCode Organizer</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Check that your project is in organizer window (which version of XCode are you using?). Before continue, go to next step. </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>4: iTunes Connect</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Goto iTunes Connect. Select &quot;Manage your applications&quot;. Click on &quot;Add new app&quot; and fill all the forms with name, description, pictures and so on.</p>
<p>Very important: when you finish filling all that stuff, click on the button &quot;Ready to submit binary&quot; or something like that, a blue button at the top-right corner of the app page.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>5: XCode Organizer</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Last step! iTunes connect is already waiting your app, so, click on it in Organizer, click &quot;Validate&quot; and, finally, click on &quot;Submit&quot; button. Some dialogs will open, let the default options by now. The app should start uploading.</p>

							<p>Don&#39;t know any step-by-step. After deploy using Titanium Developer or Titanium Studio, go to XCode &gt; Window &gt; Organizer. There you will find your compiled file. Now you have to VALIDATE and SUBMIT to iTunes.</p>
<p>Prior to validate the file, you&#39;ll need to prepare the app in iTunes Connection (create a new app and set up &quot;Ready to upload binary&quot;). Look for &quot;itunes connection&quot; and create an account if you don&#39;t have one.</p>
<p>First time is a headache, but try yourself, is the best way to remembre forever :)</p>

										<p><p>Javier,  Thanks.<br>So here&#39;s where I am.  I have compiled. I got all the stuff necessary to run it on my device (iPhone 4). It&#39;s running fine on my phone.</p>
<p>So now you say I should open Xcode? Not sure what I&#39;m supposed to open in Xcode?</p>
<p>Also, I went to iTunes Connect and established all that stuff about the bank account and so forth. The Vimeo video says to fill out paperwork if my app is a paid app… This is where I get stuck.</p>
<p>Could you possibly provide a few more details since our folks at Apcelerator have made this process infinitely more complex and infinitely more expenseive?</p>

										<p><p>Sure. By now, the only way to upload to app store is from xCode Organizer, this is an Apple requirement. Do not suffer, you dont have to open the project, neither the code. You only need the Organizer window.</p>
<p>This complexity is not due to appcelerator, but Apple. As you will know, they like to do things at their own way…</p>
<p>So, go to iTunes Connect, manage your applications and set your app &quot;ready to upload binary&quot;. Now comeback to XCode, open Organizer Window and look for your app. Now first you have to VALIDATE, and then SUBMIT (look for that buttons). Be sure yor app is ready to submit binary in itunnes connect, or validation will fail.</p>
<p>Organize window is slightly different from xcode version 3 to 4. In version 3 your files are at the left menu. In version 4 they are at the top menu, under the Files button. Good luck!</p>

										<p><p>OK, so let&#39;s start at the very beginning. When I open Xcode-&gt;Window-&gt;Organizer, there is absolutely nothing there. Obviously it needs to know how to find my code I suppose…how is this done?</p>
<p>I find myself going in circles with the Apple certificates. At present I  have an active development certificate with two development provisioning pprofiles (one for my company name and one that simply says Team Provisioning Profile: *).</p>
<p>I have a Distribution Certificat, but no provisioning profiles for that.</p>
<p>I have set up two registered devices (iphone 3GS and iPhone 4)</p>
<p>I have two APP-IDs  one that is company based and one that is an Xcode Wildcard App ID.</p>
<p>When I go to Managing my Apps, there are no entries, as I&#39;ve not gotten   that far yet.</p>
<p>So, I&#39;m just basically looking for some sort of ORDER in what to do things! Everything Ive seen on the Appcelerator site is over a year old and nothing to tell us how to do things with Xcode Organizer or ANYTHING like that.</p>
<p>in a word…HELP!</p>
