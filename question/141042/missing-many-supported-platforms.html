			<p>I am evaluating Titanium SDK for myself and a company I work for. I just installed and updated studio. In configure, it only shows me android and mobile web as SDK choices. Am I being limited for some reason? This will be a short eval if I can&#39;t see it perform on multiple platforms.</p>

							<div><p>Missing from your question are a number of important pieces of information. I suggest you take a look at the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Using+Questions+and+Answers">Using Questions and Answers</a> article, specifically the Q&amp;A Question Checklist.  The missing information is critical to reproducing problems in a test environment and often indicates other factors that cause the undesirable outcome you are experiencing.</p>

<p>And btw, there are only 3 platforms currently supported - android, ios and mobile web</p>

										<p><p>The mac stuff is not Titanium&#39;s fault, is what Apple dictates.<br>&quot;You wanna play with us?, use our toys!&quot; Still there are ways to overcome this, use  a virtual machine, make a hackintosh or even rent a mac in the cloud.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#39;t recommend though, a mac mini is enough to do it, or if you don&#39;t bother using secondhand tools on ebay you can get really good devices on really good prices.</p>

							<p>iOS can only be developed on a OSX system with xCode installed. I am making some assumptions here regarding your development environment based upon the lack of information you have given.</p>

										<p><p>Ok, then the tutorial is misleading. I saw all the supported platforms there, but they must have been on a Mac. So the unwritten implication is to create cross-platform and include iOS you need a Mac.  This concludes my eval then as I do not have access to a Mac for development.</p>

<p>It says you need a recent version of Windows (Windows Vista may work, but is not officially supported), Mac OS X, or Ubuntu but nothing I read on the site indicated the Mac dependency. There are other cross-platform tools that do not have this requirement.  I will look into the VM option.</p>

The account is free, but to run on device you will need to sign up for the iOS Developer Program, costing $99&#x2F;year. Also be aware of Apple&#39;s license terms, which prohibit the building and execution of iOS applications on anything other than Apple hardware.</a></p>

										<p><p>I know its a pain, but like Dan said, these are Apple&#39;s rules, we just try to bend them. <em>grin</em> </p>
<p>Those of us on Macs have to deal with a lack of Blackberry tooling support, so it really does kind of go both ways.  See it as the cost of doing business.</p>
