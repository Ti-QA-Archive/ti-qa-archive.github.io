			<h1>Are In-App Purchases supported in the Professional edition?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>The new PayPal module is really nice, and does work well, but unfortunately it appears it cannot be used for &quot;in app&quot; virtual item purchases due to Apple&#39;s developer license:</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;appstore&#x2F;resources&#x2F;approval&#x2F;guidelines.html</p>
<p>(specifically section 11.2)</p>
<p>Does anyone know what additional features are available right now in the Titanium API for the Professional edition versus the Community Edition?  Does it include In App purchasing using Apple&#39;s API?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>Based on the level of responses from this Q&amp;A - I really doubt I&#39;d spend money on upgrading my account. If we can&#39;t get a simple yes&#x2F;no answer to a simple question even after 6 months! The documentation is quite poor as well.</p>

							<p>Does anyone at Appcelerator read any of these Q&amp;A questions?  I emailed sales 2 days ago,  and have also used the &quot;contact&quot; form here without any reply.  I&#39;m considering signing up for the professional edition, but I&#39;m beginning to have second thoughts if I can&#39;t even get a fairly basic question answered.</p>
<p>Is anyone home at Appcelerator?</p>

										<p><p>Um, can you please clarify that statement? What type of in-app purchasing is part of 1.5? I know that I (and many others) have been asking about in-app purchases for the last year or so. Where can I find in-app purchasing in the docs or Kitchen Sink? (I must be too slow to find this on my own)</p>
