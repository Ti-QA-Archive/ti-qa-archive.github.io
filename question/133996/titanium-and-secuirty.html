		<section>
			<p>Is there any chance of getting an update on the process that Titanium uses when &quot;compiling&quot; the javascript source for an app?</p>
<p>The reason I ask is that I would like to understand the implications of someone attempting to reverse engineer a Titanium app downloaded from the App Store or extracted from a phone. </p>
<p>The case used to be (from my understanding) that the dynamic javascript code was held as a string (base64&#39;d) within a data section of an objective C file. This was used to &#39;drive&#39; the compiled sections of the app library (via Kroll&#x2F;NSData).</p>
<p>Looking through some of the Titanium source it seems that this base64 code is now actually AES128 encypted&#x2F;decrypted?</p>
<p>It would be great to have a complete explanation of how this process actually works currently and from that an assessment of how secure a compiled Titanium app is compared with a native app.</p>
<p>It would go a long way in allowing people to judge if they could &#39;hardcode&#39; a username and password into one of there javascript modules.</p>
<p>And apologies if actually I am asking a dumb question as the answer is already elsewhere (and current), but if it is please could you point me in the right direction.</p>
<p>Many Thanks.</p>

							<p>Not a crazy question at all, Steve.  Actually, a valid one to start discussion.</p>
<p>I would never store username&#x2F;password under base64.  I would, however, consider doing so under AES128, provided I knew that the encrypt&#x2F;decrypt key was unique to my application&#x2F;build&#x2F;dev account and was equally as secure.</p>
<p>A lock is worthless if the world has the key.</p>

										<p><p>If one takes a look at the 2.1.x development branch, you will find that changes are coming to the encryption used to secure the JS files themselves.  That being said, on Android, we are building to bytecode, not completely securable.</p>

							<p>Hi, I&#39;ve been studying the internals of the SDK for quite a long time now, so I have some clues regarding what happens at your source code, at least on iOS.</p>
<p>Once (I&#39;d say pre-1.8.1) JS files were simply binary encoded as NSData structures in the dynamically generated file <code>ApplicationRouting.m.</code> The resolveAsset method there present was used to map each file name to the corresponding JS source.</p>
<p>Looking today at the same mechanism, it looks like before being put in the map, the code is first somewhat &quot;encrypted&quot; and then base64encoded. I haven&#39;t investigated more what happens during the generation of the file by the <code>compiler.py</code> script, however you can verify by yourselves the result by simply opening the Xcode project you find in the <code>build&amp;#x2F;iphone</code> directory and perform a build for device, and opening <code>ApplicationRouting.m.</code> </p>
<p>So, the JS code is not immediately &quot;visible&quot; in the application binary, BUT: your JS code is interpreted at runtime, so, even if it&#39;s stored in an obfuscated way, just before being executed it&#39;s re-converted to the original source code. Indeed at the end of <code>ApplicationRouting.m</code> you&#39;ll find:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-title">filterData</span><span class="hljs-params">([map objectForKey:path])</span></span>;
</code></pre><p>The string returned by the <code>filterData()</code> function is the original source code. The implementation of that function is unknown, since it&#39;s not part of the Ti SDK open source code, and it&#39;s contained inside the <code>libtiverify.a</code> library you find inside your SDK directory.</p>
<p>So are your JS files really secured? I think the answer is NO, because a &quot;cracker&quot; would simply need to tap into the right point in the running executable, just after the original source code is retrieved and just before that code is passed to the JSCore interpreter for retrieving your original code.</p>
<p>So I&#39;d say: don&#39;t store usernames &amp; passwords in your code.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Olivier, it sounds even more that it would be great if Appcelerator could generate a format statement about the process then we have the ability to generate our own assessment of what we should&#x2F;should not store in code and how secure our apps are (I realize that this is a function of what the app is going and the data it is accessing).</p>
<p>Personally most of the apps I have created with Titanium are corporate ones use in the enterprise and the security questions&#x2F;tests for these have been very rigid and becoming more so. Part of these are usually a Q&amp;A from hell, so any definitive data to help with this process would be greatly welcomed.</p>

										<p><p>For the sake of completeness, I&#39;ve just checked out how the base64 strings representing each source file are generated in <code>compiler.py</code>. </p>
<p>Actually they&#39;re created running the <code>titanium_prep</code> executable you find in your <code>$TI_SDK&amp;#x2F;iphone</code> directory on every JS file contained in the Resources directory of your app project.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

							<p>With the addition of &#39;cloud services&#39; in the coming SDK and the requirement that your app have an OAuth key that will&#x2F;could be stored in a .js file to access cloud data, this seems even more pertinent. </p>
<p>Anyone at Appcelerator have a comment on this one?</p>
