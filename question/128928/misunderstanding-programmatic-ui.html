			<h1>(Mis)Understanding Programmatic UI</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Yesterday I asked a question about using the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator-developer-relations&#x2F;Forging-Titanium&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;ep-010&#x2F;Forms">forms module</a> that was laid out in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;10&#x2F;forging-titanium-episode-10-forms.html&#x2F;comment-page-1#comment-79756">Forging Titanium Episode 10</a>. The short story is that the form wasn&#39;t being displayed. I could debug the contents of the form object and everything is in place, but it simply didn&#39;t show up on the screen.</p>
<p>Today, I found a &quot;fix&quot;. It shows up <em>only</em> if I explicitly set a height on the form object. The &#39;auto&#39; height seems to equate to 0 even though the form has content and that content has height. I&#39;ve bumped into this many times before and it just hasn&#39;t clicked that the container won&#39;t expand to fit its content.</p>
<p>When added to a window, as is done in the episode, it works just fine. I&#39;m adding it to a <code>ScrollView</code>. I don&#39;t know why there would be a difference or what that difference might be or even whether this is the difference that matters, but it&#39;s the only obvious deviation that I can see between what I&#39;m doing and what is happening in the standalone app.</p>
<p>Is there any resource or documentation or grand pearl of wisdom that will help me get past this aspect of the learning curve? I&#39;ve spent far too many hours on these kinds of problems and would like to come to a better understanding of when I have to set the height and when &#39;auto&#39; is good enough so that it&#39;s not <em>always</em> a matter of trial and error.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<div><p>Yeah, sometimes &#39;auto&#39; just don&#39;t works and you have to set height manually. I noticed that for table view component, but still didn&#39;t isolate the issue …</p>

							<div><p>A few more super fun nuggets of info:</p>
<ul>
<li>I didn&#39;t include a link to <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;128893&#x2F;forms-module-forging-episode-10-not-displaying-for-me">my original question</a>. That was an oversight.</li>
<li>If, in the forms module itself, I set the form height to &#39;auto&#39;, the form appears. This is acceptable, but I don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s necessary to be explicitly stated.</li>

							<p>Auto dimensions are often times not calculated until a view is rendered, or a window is opened. This can throw off any sub-components that are also using auto dimensions. That&#39;s why it works when you add it to a window, rather than a sub component of that window.</p>
