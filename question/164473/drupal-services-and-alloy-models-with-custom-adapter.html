			<h1>Drupal Services and Alloy Models with custom adapter</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi everybody, this is my first question! First of all, thank you to everybody here, i&#39;m learning a lot reading varius Q&amp;A in this section!<br>Now my problem..<br>I&#39;m using Titanium with SDK 3.2.2 and i&#39;m building an app based on web services created with Drupal Services, now i retrieve my JSON directly in the controller and with it i build my TableView, now i would like to do the things in the right way and create the model for my data:<br>Searching i&#39;ve found <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;viezel&#x2F;napp.alloy.adapter.restapi">this</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.andrewroot.com&#x2F;node&#x2F;9">this</a><br>now i&#39;m trying the second one, which is based exactly on what i need, but there&#39;s a thing i don&#39;t understand: is it possible to have a unique Model with &quot;arguments&quot;? For example, retrieve a Drupal View with some certain parameters (exposed filters) in a place, and the same View with other parameters in another place, or in case of nodes retrieve a specific node with given nid, and so on…<br>Thank you so much!</p>

							<p>Hello Francesco,<br>you should have one model for each resource needed by the app and defined on server, each one will use &quot;restapi&quot; adapter. On server side you will want a RESTful JSON API for each resource too. The adapters will take care of sending the proper request, and handle the responses, for your collections&#39; fetch() and models&#39; save() or destroy() actions.</p>
<p>hth,</p>

										<p><p>Well.. maybe I misunderstood your question.<br>Regarding URL, when having many models with restapi, my approach is to have in alloy.js a global with the common api endpoint. i.e:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Alloy<span class="hljs-class">.Globals</span><span class="hljs-class">.apiURL</span> = <span class="hljs-string">"http://server_domain_name_or_ip/api/v1/"</span>
</code></pre><p>then in each model, after requiring Alloy, i set the complete url, i.e. a &#39;users.js&#39; model would be like:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var Alloy = require(<span class="hljs-string">"alloy"</span>);

exports.definition = {
    config: {
        <span class="hljs-string">"URL"</span>:  Alloy.Globals.apiURL + <span class="hljs-string">"users"</span>,

        <span class="hljs-string">"columns"</span>: {
            <span class="hljs-string">"id"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"int"</span>,
            <span class="hljs-string">"name"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"text"</span>,
            [.. other columns ..]
        },

        <span class="hljs-string">"adapter"</span>: {
            <span class="hljs-string">"type"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"restapi"</span>,
            <span class="hljs-string">"collection_name"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"users"</span>,
            <span class="hljs-string">"idAttribute"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"id"</span>
        }

    },

    [.. extendModel ..]
    [.. extendCollection ..]
};
</code></pre><p>hth.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you so much to both :) i think i&#39;ve understand that i can&#39;t do what i need to do.. i explain better to be sure:<br>i have with <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drupal.org&#x2F;project&#x2F;services">Drupal Services</a> (and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drupal.org&#x2F;project&#x2F;services_views">Services Views</a> as complementary module) a list of content in json format: this list can be filtered as you can see in the link above:<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;example.com&#x2F;rest&#x2F;views&#x2F;articles?limit=5&amp;offset=2&amp;filters[tags]=5<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;example.com&#x2F;rest&#x2F;views&#x2F;articles?filters[tags]=5&amp;display_id=block_1&amp;format_output=1</p>
<p>so in this case the only thing i can do is to create a model for each URL i need? i will have dozens of model in this way.. Do you think it could be a problem? Or maybe in this case the Model approach can&#39;t be the right one and i&#39;d better use httprequest with a customizable function or something like that? I&#39;m new in MVC world so i don&#39;t know the best practice and how to hadle all situations..</p>
<p>Thankyou!</p>
<p>P.S. sorry for the &quot;fake answer&quot; ! :)</p>

										<p><p>I was thinking about two possible solution:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Use in config URL</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-string">"URL"</span>:  Alloy<span class="hljs-class">.Globals</span><span class="hljs-class">.endpoint</span> + Alloy<span class="hljs-class">.Globals</span><span class="hljs-class">.url</span>
</code></pre><p>and set <code>Alloy.Globals.url</code> in the controller every time i need the collection.</p>
</li>
<li><p>try to figure out a function to use instead of fetch() to put inside extendCollection.. but i can&#39;t figure if it&#39;s possible…</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I need to figure out how to resolve this problem because from my website i can retrieve the complete list of content, but what if i want the single content on my app? at the moment the only way is to make my httprequest inside the controller, but i think that this stuff have to be in the model, or maybe i&#39;m not understanding very well how MVC works :)</p>
<p>maybe with .get(id) retrieving every time the complete list of all the content with all associated data.. but it seems to me a heavy operation…</p>
<p>Or maybe for this specific needs the only way is not to use models but resign themselves to use only controllers making wanted requests…</p>

										<p><p>Ciao Franceso,<br>I&#39;m having hard time trying to understand you problem. Could you clarify &quot;what if i want the single content on my app&quot; please? Is it related to having collection persisted locally? Or retrieving single records?<br>Is it even possible that you are making confusion between &quot;model&quot; as resource definition in app&#x2F;models directory, and single models of a collection representing records of you db table?</p>
<p>I do not have any experience with Drupal, but if you can implement a REST API with it, you should have almost everything in place to work with Alloy and the restapi adapter (or sqlrest for automatic local db syncing).</p>

										<p><p>First of all… thank you to support me!<br>Yes, you&#39;re right, maybe i can&#39;t explain myself very well… also because it&#39;s difficult for me to understand what i need  :D (and because of my horrible english too… )</p>
<p>I&#39;ve in drupal a page who take optional parameters (example.com&#x2F;services&#x2F;list , example.com&#x2F;services&#x2F;list?category=1, example.com&#x2F;services&#x2F;list?offset=10&amp;category=2 […]) and all the single content pages (example.com&#x2F;node&#x2F;1, example.com&#x2F;node&#x2F;2, example.com&#x2F;node&#x2F;3 […] )</p>
<p>I&#39;ve installed in Drupal the Services module that provides json for all these things (example.com&#x2F;services&#x2F;list.json, example.com&#x2F;node&#x2F;1.json, example.com&#x2F;node&#x2F;2.json and so on)<br>In the list of content i export only the titles and ID of the content, but in other places of app using the ID i want to retrieve all data of that content from example.com&#x2F;node&#x2F;ID</p>
<p>in my app i need to retrieve the list: in certain places the entire list, in other places with parameters, i need also to retrieve individual nodes (content). So the oneurl - onemodel way is not possible for me because in this case i shoud export all the content with all its data attached and then search through the collection with get() only to show few fields of a single node.</p>

										<p><p>:) you are welcome Francesco. I&#39;m thinking we could go on for a long time here without making much progress. So my suggestion is you could create a repository with your app&#39;s source, in github (public only) or if you prefer keep it private go for bitbucket; than share it with me so I could have a look at it, we could even discuss code and issue there (enabling wiki or issue tracking i.e.) in italian. I cannot guarantee full time commitment on it but I&#39;ll be glad to support you in this learning phase. You can contact me privately using DevMail from my profile page (just click on my username down here to open it). Let me know. Ciao :)</p>

							<p>UPDATE: both of adapters work for me, i think i will use napp.alloy.adapter.restapi because it seems more complete and customizable, but i don&#39;t understand if i can change the URL in config section of the model at the time of fetching data, something like<br><code>eventsList.fetch({&amp;#39;URL&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;my_custom_url&amp;#39;});</code></p>
<p>i&#39;m trying to search in Alloy and Backbone documentation but can&#39;t see a solution…</p>
