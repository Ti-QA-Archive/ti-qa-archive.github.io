			<p>Please explain the new Titanium roadmap with the offering of Titanium+Plus.  Are developers going to have to pay for all new features?  It seems arbitrary that the free API includes email support and you need to purchase the SMS Text Message API.  What are the plans for blackberry support?  Will developers have to purchase the blackberry API?  With blackberry, will the email API be free but developers will need to purchase the blackberry SMS Text API? Please help developers plan their business goals by answering these questions.</p>

							<p>Thanks for the reply.  I did add modules for SMS but that really just leads to more questions about the Titanium roadmap.  If I submit my modules to the baseline then the community will have two SMS API - one paid and one free - or will Appcelerator clean up the code at that point to just support 1 free SMS API?  Really, I think the Roadmap needs clarified and a current customer of mine is expecting blackberry support soon. Do I need to budget for the blackberry API? or just the blackberry SMS API? or plan more hours to write my own blackberry SMS API but not blackberry email API?</p>

							<p>There is still no proper answer to the question of the loss of monthly support? I have posted this question in a number of different areas and directly and still not received an answer.</p>
<p>$2,000 for a year&#39;s worth of support? That&#39;s too much for most of us who develop Apps on an ad hoc basis and who may only require 2 to 3 months worth of support a year. With an initial outlay of $2,000 based on no income that&#39;s just way too much for me and I am sure most others. This really only works for larger companies and certainly NOT for smaller developers.</p>
<p>I have purchased a monthly support contract previously and so technically I am not a &#39;new customer&#39; so post the 1st will I have NO way of purchasing a monthly support contract and am I going to be FORCED to spend $2,000 for an annual support contract where I will only ever be using 3 months or so?</p>
<p>Sounds like we&#39;re all pretty much stuffed and forced into a rather nasty corner; please tell me I am mistaken?</p>

<p>Remember that you can add any functionality you need, including SMS, by creating a module. See <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;module_android.html">Android Module Developer Guide</a> and <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;module_ios.html">iOS Module Developer Guide</a>.</p>

							<p>I was previously under the impression that the modules would be like a store where 3rd party developers who created modules could sell them to the community (if they didn&#39;t want to give them away).  On the page Hal linked, it does make it sound as if Pro &#x2F; Enterprise developers get access to the modules.</p>
<p>My previous impression were the modules would be completely independent of what Appcelerator is adding to the SDK – not a way to introduce features which are extra cost.  Naturally, I expect that what some developers need to code up as a module because the current SDK cannot do it, will at times become obsolete if the feature(s) exposed get added to the base SDK.</p>
<p>So I too am confused by the page linked by Hal.</p>

<p>Presumably, if someone creates modules to provide the respective functionality of the TiPlus modules, and offers them to the community as open source projects, then everyone can add to them and benefit from them. Just as with any open source project, this does not necessarily mean that it will be integrated into the core product. Those projects can, and usually do, exist independently. There are plenty of examples with a multitude of open source projects where this is the case.</p>
<p>Inevitably, the functionality and aims of some of those projects will overlap. This is typical; the community will decide, by a process of <em>natural selection</em>, which project should succeed in the longterm.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">"because the current SDK cannot do it, will at times become obsolete if the feature(s) exposed get added to the base SDK"</span>
</code></pre><p>Yes, this is also quite typical of these types of projects - without commercial support by the vendor, the underlying API can change unexpectedly. That is an issue for the 3rd party open source project to overcome and manage.</p>

										<p><p>Hal,</p>
<p>I understand all that.  I guess what I was trying to say is that I am not convinced that any of the modules listed on that page are really officially part of Titanium per se.  As such, I expect there to be the potential for overlap as titanium evolves and gets more classes in the base code.  So I don&#39;t see something like the SMS module as a devious plan to leave something out of the base and bait people to Pro &#x2F; Enterprise.</p>
<p>I think it only amounts to the fact that someone, possibly even a titanium employee on their own time, has developed a module.  Modules which people create, no matter who they work for, may be offered back to the community free (as many have been), or like apps themselves, the developer may want to market it.</p>
<p>I have no problem with any of that.</p>

							<p>We will be officially launching Titanium+Plus in February, when we&#39;ll have all the details on our roadmap going forward.  That said, here are the basics:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Apcelerator Titanium SDK will continue to be available as it always has, freely available and licensed under the Apache 2 license.  In almost every case, you can think of the features in Titanium as equivalent to the features contained in the iOS or Android SDKs.  I say &#39;almost&#39; as there are a select few modules, like Facebook, that will remain in the core Titanium SDK.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Titanium+Plus is a subscription to premium modules that add value to your applications.  These modules are supported, updated, and maintained by the Appcelerator team as part of a Titanium Professional or Enterprise subscription.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We will continue to add modules to this subscription.  Think of it as something akin to Netflix.  You get access to a full library of modules as part of the subscription.  You do not need to purchase modules separately.  We have a roadmap of dozens, if not hundreds of these modules coming down the pike.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>More information will be coming over the next couple weeks, but hopefully this answers some the questions above.  I&#39;ll also publish an FAQ later this afternoon.</p>

										<p><p>Scott, thanks for the clarification.  I am not sure where I got the impression there would be a &quot;module store&quot; where developers could opt to market modules (or be a central repository for free ones).  But I stand corrected.  I think I&#39;ll sit down now…</p>

										<p><p>I think this answer doesn&#39;t clarify anything.  For the first bullet, the useful question is will any new features be added to the Apcelerator Titanium SDK - or will all new features go to Titanium+Plus.  I would guess that a frozen Apcelerator Titanium SDK will remain freely available.  For the second bullet, it seems arbitrary that SMS is a &quot;premium module&quot; and email is not.  Will all current unsupported native APIs be consider &quot;premium&quot;.</p>

										<p><p>Kevin - I think the point is, the details are being refined, and the official release in Feb will make the situation absolutely clear. In the meantime, from what I gather from Scott&#39;s post, there will be an FAQ answering some of the more general questions&#x2F;concerns.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m perhaps most concerned about the elimination of monthly subscriptions. I can&#39;t afford to lay out $2000 in one shot, hoping I&#39;ll get the clients to cover my costs. So far I&#39;ve had to go month to month, adding or removing the pro subscription as work permits. It&#39;s likely now that I&#39;ll be locked out of the program. </p>
<p>This change runs counter to comments that Appcelerator has made in other Q&amp;A posts, webinars, and survey follow ups. They&#39;ve talked about adding more affordable options for small developers.</p>
<p>On another note, all but a couple of those modules are iPhone only. If Ti is going to be cross platform, and they want me to pay $2K for modules, I really need them on both iOS and Android. </p>
<p>Sorry to take my worries public like this. I emailed sales@ this morning and never heard back. Maybe the forthcoming FAQ will clarify.</p>

							<p>I believe that the most important question is: how complete Titanium base SDK&#39;s support for the targeted platforms will be, without the need to develop a module to cover for the absence of a certain functionality in the base SDK, and without the need to pay for the premium privileges.<br>For example, in-app purchases, which are an integral part of the iOS SDK, is a very base and absolutely essential part of the app development, at least for the iP*&#x2F;iOS devices. If this functionality will be offered as a premium, or, alternatively, must be coded in Obj-C to become a module, than the question is: what else, of that magnitude, will be kept out of the base SDK?!<br>Which leads to a thought: are Titanium developers in danger of either falling behind developers using other platforms, or will be forced to pay premiums to stay competitive?<br>I love Titanium as a product, it opens up a world of possibilities for us, devs, but the kind of uncertainty we&#39;re dealing with here would make this product a very poor choice for a serious, long term commitment.<br>IMHO, of course…</p>
