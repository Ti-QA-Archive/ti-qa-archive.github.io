			<h1>iPad iOS 8, 8.1, 8.1.1, 8.1.2, 8.2 Camera Black Screen</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>My team has been experiencing a problem after the release of iOS8, where no problem existed before.  If you take a picture in a Titanium built app, the first picture works.  When you go to take a second picture, or video, within the same app session the camera is frozen with a black screen.  If you switch the camera orientation it will show you a blurred version of the first picture you took indicating somehow thats being held in memory.  You can take as many videos as you want by themselves, so it seems to be picture specific.</p>
<p>We have tried saving the pictures to a non native path ie. app:&#x2F;&#x2F; instead of file:&#x2F;&#x2F;, this did not work either.</p>
<p>Any assistance would help – this is not something we&#39;ve been able to work around through regular trouble shooting such as turning on and off iPad, reinstalling iOS, wiping iPad memory, or a camera API related work around.</p>
