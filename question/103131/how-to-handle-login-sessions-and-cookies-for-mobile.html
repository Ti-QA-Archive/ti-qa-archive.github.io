			<h1>How to handle login sessions and cookies for mobile</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Does anyone know a good tutorial for handling sessions and cookies for login on iphone using titanium appcelerator?<br>I want to do the following things for my login,<br>(1) open the app (login page as opening window and login for the first time.<br>(2) login valid and store user details in sessions and cookies for further use throughout other windows within the app<br>(3) if i terminate the app and re-open the app again, I&#39;m automatically logged in unless I logged out before I terminate the app previously.</p>
<p>I am currently communicating with my php server using HttpClient().</p>
<p>Any tutorial or sample code would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.</p>

							<div><p>Hi Jack! Did you achieve that? I&#39;m with the same problem.<br>I follow the tutorial, but the grantEntrance event is fired when user enter his credentials. But I need to make user&#x2F;app available without enter credentials every time that app is opened. Thanks!</p>

							<p>A typical web authentication mechanism will use a token stored in cookie to authenticate each subsequent request after a username and password have been provided.  This is more secure than repeatedly passing the username&#x2F;password as it can the token value can be refreshed on each request and can also be set to expire.</p>
<p>It looks like the mobile API does not support cookies, but the same mechanism can be easily replicated by returning a token with each XML&#x2F;JSON response and passing it on each request as a post or get parameter.  By storing the token on the device DB instead of as a property you can build local expiration of the token by including an expiry field with the token record.  I&#39;m in the process of modifying a PHP authentication module for Symfony to do exactly this and had been working out nicely.</p>

										<p><p>John - If you&#39;re still around, I wouldn&#39;t mind hearing how this effort went for you. I&#39;m in the process of trying to figure out how to handle authentication with sessions&#x2F;cookies also. Searching in the Q&amp;A forum begins to turn in to information overload with what works and what doesn&#39;t, and some of conflicting.</p>
<p>The tutorials linked in this thread appear to be for a &quot;roll-your-own&quot; method of authentication and don&#39;t use session variables in PHP&#x2F;the server.</p>
<p>What I&#39;m trying to get a handle on is…..</p>
<p>…..is the cookie handled automatically by the httpclient API for us? Or do we need to create our own logic to store what&#39;s passed to us, and re-send on subsequent requests, then destroy on the Mobile App end when we log the user out?</p>
<p>PS. You mention Symfony, I&#39;m getting things rolling in Codeigniter. How do you like Symfony?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any insight you or anyone else can provide.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, Jordy. I have gone through the 3 parts tutorials previously, but no where in the tutorial mentioned anything around sessions and cookie. I am abit confused, my current workaround is using Ti.App.Properties, and i am not too sure how secure it is by storing all the user information e.g. username, id, encrypted password in Ti.App.Properties, and not yet worked out how to set the expiry date on Ti.App.Properties like how we can set expiry date on cookie. If this is not the best solution, any suggestion and recommendation? Thanks again.</p>

										<p><p>Well, i&#39;ve done the authentication exactly how the tutorial describes, works perfect for me. You only need to authenticate a user once. A succesfull login means the user has entered the right information, so no need to sync it all the time with your server. However, when the user DOES something that requires a session (like commenting on a news post), then i&#39;ll let the App use the information he already entered (user&#x2F;pass) to re-check if that information is still correct. If that information is still correct, he can comment something. Still investigating the security risks, so don&#39;t use this way if you don&#39;t know what you are doing :)<br>As far as i know, you can&#39;t store cookie&#x2F;session information right into your App (except for webviews), you need to figure something out, like i did.</p>

										<p><p>@Jordy can you please explain how this achieves to authenticate the user just once? The process takes place only after entering the credentials and pressing login button. I am a bit confused :(</p>
