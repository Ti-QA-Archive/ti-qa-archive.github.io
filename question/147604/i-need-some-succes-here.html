			<p>Titanium 3.0.1, Android SDK 2.2, Win 7. I have tried four different sample apps, importing and creating new and run them on both the emulator(android) and the device (G s3). None, not one, has represented anything to do with the sample apps loaded. Some apps yield a red screen with appcelerator written on it. Most emulator apps are represented by a screen with date&#x2F;time a lock symbol and a volume symbol. But none with the screen images appropriate to the loaded app. It appears that Titanium is ignoring my app and loading the same thing each time, regardless of what project I have loaded.  I would imagine there is a simple explanation but I cannot find it in the documentation. Please help if anyone knows the answer to this. Thanks in advance.</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;m referring to the sample apps that are part of Titanium tutorial, e.g., kitchensink, helloworld, mileage&#x2F;bike meter, etc. So I don&#39;t know the version used. Thanks for responding. This has been a hair-pulling experience so far. I&#39;ve spent most of four weeks learning Ti and javascript and have yet to see a sample app run as advertised. It&#39;s important to me to have some working app as a baseline.</p>
