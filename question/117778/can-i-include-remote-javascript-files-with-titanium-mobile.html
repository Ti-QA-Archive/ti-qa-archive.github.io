			<h1>Can I include remote JavaScript files with Titanium Mobile?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Has anyone tried to include remote JavaScript files using <code>Titanium.include</code> or something similar?</p>
<p>For example, I have a server that has a file, let&#39;s say <code>test.js</code>, hosted on it. This file gets updated pretty often. Is there any way to include this JS file in my Titanium Mobile app?</p>
<p>I can think of a few different approaches to try, but I&#39;m just wondering if anybody has tried this and had any success.</p>

							<p>No, you cannot include remote JS files. They have to be stored locally in your app&#39;s resources.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, I agree with Colton. The reason is that this approach contravenes Apple and Google&#39;s terms and conditions.</p>

							<p>Turns out this is possible. I tested this on Android and it works. Be mindful of the security ramifications of using this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">remoteInclude = function (url) {
    var httpClient = Titanium.Network.createHTTPClient();

    httpClient.onload = function (e) {
        var tempFile = Titanium.Filesystem.createTempFile();
        tempFile.write(this.responseText);

        Titanium.include(tempFile.nativePath);

        tempFile.deleteFile();
    };

    httpClient.open(<span class="hljs-string">"<span class="hljs-keyword">GET</span>"</span>, url);
    httpClient.send();
}
</code></pre><p>The execution context is maintained just like with any other include, so the scope is shared between the local script that calls remoteInclude and the remote script.</p>
<p>The remote script is also able to use the Titanium API functions.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, but just note that it may be against Apple&#x2F;Google&#39;s ToS and&#x2F;or Privacy Policies to their customers if they let you remotely write to your application. I don&#39;t know their entire ToS, but from what I understand this is not generally allowed.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m not sure about Apple, but after looking through the Android Market terms, it looks like this sort of thing is allowed in Android apps. There are even entire scripting environments distributed via the Market and Google has no problem with it.</p>
<p>I only plan on deploying to Android so I think this will work.</p>

<p>Would you please post a link to the clause of the terms you have seen that allows it?  A quote of the text would also be helpful.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>Paul, nothing specifically allows it, but it is not prohibited anywhere either. The developer agreement is actually quite short and you can see it at:<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.android.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;developer-distribution-agreement.html</p>
<p>Furthermore, the content policy prohibits malware and spyware, but doesn&#39;t prohibit remote code:<br> http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.android.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;developer-content-policy.html</p>
<p>This makes sense when you consider that things like Adobe Flash are distributed via the Android Market, and that definitely executes remote code.</p>
