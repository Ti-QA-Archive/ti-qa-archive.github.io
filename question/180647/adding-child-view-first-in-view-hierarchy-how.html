The child view <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> added <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> the last child <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> this view<span class="hljs-comment">'s hierarchy.</span>

							<div><p>I have a ScrollView. Lets say we have a horizontal view layout. Now i want to keep adding child views into this scroll view and i want the newly added view to appear at the most left position.</p>
<p>Using scroll.add(newView).  The newView will end up being the last child in the view hierarchy and therefore end up a the most right position.</p>
<p>You get it? I would like something like<br>scroll.insert(newView, 0)<br>To put the newView first…</p>

							<p>That is not possible when you use layout property then child will be added as a last view.</p>
<p>Instead you can remove layout property and set child&#39;s left position to set as per your requirement.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, what I would need to do using your absolute layout solution is  modify the size of the &quot;container&quot; view, move every single child views left position, and add the new child at left:0. This is not the clean way, that i was asking for.</p>
<p>But I guess it is not possible. That is a really bad implementation of the ScrollView in my humble opinion…</p>

							<p>Those are added into a ScrollView by the way. I just need the new view to appear most left somehow, without doing a removeAllChildren() (and adding them again) for each new item that is being added…</p>
<p>Is there no way to do this? Sigh.</p>
