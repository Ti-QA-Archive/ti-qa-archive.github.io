			<h1>Newly added Ti.App.properties are not effecting after IOS App Update.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We have developed an IOS application in Titanium studio, Depending on requirement change we are providing different builds to client eventually. In our 1st build there are no Ti.App.Properties used and in our latest builds we have used multiple Ti.App.properties which are not reflecting to client.</p>
<p>Client has installed 1st build app into iPhone 6 then he used to update the same app by downloading from Enterprise server. Ti.App.properties are not reflecting to client where as we have downloaded in same way but we have deleted existing App and downloaded freshly from server we are able to have effect of Ti.App.Properties.</p>
<p>I cant ask my client every time delete and download the latest App. I am incrementing version every time in tiapp.xml in Project.</p>
<p>Can anybody help me in how to handle the issue.</p>
<p>Thanks in Advance,<br>Rakesh Kalwa.</p>

							<p>Ti.App.Properties is meant to persist the value of a variable even after the app exits and is restarted. But if the app is upgraded it will loose the value. You need to think about storing the value you want to persist after upgrades somewhere on a remote database or server and then retrieve it on update. Hope that made sense</p>
