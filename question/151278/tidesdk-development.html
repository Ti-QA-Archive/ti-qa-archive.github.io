							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The short answer is no, whilst Tide was originally part of Titanium, the differences are now too great to share one common pool of code.  Whilst you can of course create portal functions that you can use in both, there are no logical code branching techniques that would allow a seamless of even mildly painless transition and back again.</p>
<p>I am not sure that Tide support CommonJS yet, that would have been a huge benefit as you could have abstracted your non-UI code into CommonJS modules and shared them by copying files.</p>
<p>The other thing to take into account is that Titanium does not use CSS or HTML in any way to build an application, nor does it use; PHP, python or other typical server side script to run code - Tide does.  Tide is a HTML5 app with a platform specific app shell, Titanium is a native app that uses JS to bridge commands.</p>
<p>The two platforms are now fundamentally different.</p>
