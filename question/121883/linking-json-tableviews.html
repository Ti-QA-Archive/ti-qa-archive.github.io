		<section>
			<p>I have a tableview of companies which can be filtered. When you click a company it gives more information on that company;</p>
<p>My question is should I have all the company data in the one searchable feed (which will contain a huge amount of data), or if I create a separate feed for each company, how would I go about linking it to the filter results table, so when I click a row in the filter table it loads the info from that companies individual feed ?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

							<p>You really do confuse me terry, but hope this will awnser everything now.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> send an request to the webservice for only the names and unique id&#39;s from every company</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> create tableview with the data the webservice send you, make it as simple as possible, so create a row with only the title property set for the company name. Give the row an property for the Id.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> click an row, create an event that gets the unique Id you added to the row as a property. Now create a new request to the webservice to get the full data from the company. You send the unique Id to the webservice and it will return you full details verry quickly.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is the best way in my opinion, loading full data of 2000 rows will take minutes depending on the size of the full data. </p>
<p>Even if you have 2 different JSON results, 1 containing the names and 1 containing the full data. If you send the request at the same time, the moment you click a row you havent gotten the full data yet. With the above you will get full data of only the company you need, reducing the loading time drasticly</p>

							<p>Depending on the speed of the webservice you are using, you can get more info when you click on a row.</p>
<p>You&#39;re saying you have alot of companies, how much will it be? Sorting them on name and adding a searchbar on top of the tableview can help alot.</p>
<p>You should add basic info on the tableview, add a unique key of the compay to the row. Which you will need when you click a row. On click you send a request for more data from the company with the key. Getting such data is quick since the query is easy and fast.</p>
<p>Currently i have a list of alot of contacts in a row. Onclick it should show more detail. I also use hashTables, in which i store the basic row data and the full data. So when a user opens a new contact which he&#x2F;she allready opened the response will be instant for the user. And if you want the realtime data you can allways call that and show it when its loaded.</p>
<p>just my 2 cents</p>

										<p><p>There are about 2000 companies in the list so far, but that may increase. The feed currently lists all the company names, what I am wondering is whether it will affect the speed of loading if I add all the company details to the same feed, or is this the best way to do it so when I click a company I get a details page which loads the rest of the company info from the feed, or is it better to have separate feeds for each company and somehow link them to the master feed which just contains the company names for search purposes ?</p>
<p>It would seem to me that as the company details are only loaded when requested it should be Ok to have all the info coming from the one feed ?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

</code></pre><p>best way,you have a list of names and Id&#39;s those Id&#39;s are linked to a list where you can find full data. This will speed up the process alot.</p>
<p>2000 companies is a lot, i hope you are not going to insert them all in 1 tableview.</p>

										<p><p>what kind of search do you want?</p>
<p>enter a search string, then on search press it will search for the companies?</p>
<p>Or live search, so on each keypress there will be a search action?</p>

										<p><p>a searchbar in the tableview has this by default, so you need to add 2000 rows to the tableview.</p>
<p>you should try adding 2000 rows of only names, and see what the performance is. If it sux then youll need a different solution</p>

										<p><p>Yeah, thats pretty much where I am at the moment, thats why I am wondering, seeing as I am only loading the names to the first table anyway, will it make much of a difference if that feed contains all the other data which I load as its requested (by clicking on a row from the search table).</p>

										<p><p>Loading the full feed will take more time then loading only names,</p>
<p>load all names and when you click on a name, get the full data and open that data</p>

										<p><p>when you say get the full data and open that data, do you mean get the full data from the feed that contains everything, or get the full data from another JSON array that contains only the data realting to the name that was clicked ?</p>
