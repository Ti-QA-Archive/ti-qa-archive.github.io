		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve made a log in window, and i want that when that window is open navigation will be <strong>disabled</strong>, afterwards when the user gets in the application index I don&#39;t want him to be <strong>able to go back</strong> to the login window.</p>
<p>I guess it&#39;s super easy, but i just don&#39;t know what to look for? :)</p>
<p>THX alot in advance!<br>Tomer.</p>

<p>Target platforms - ios and android.</p>
<p>Yes, I have logout option in my application.</p>
<p>Building my app with Alloy.</p>
<p>The thing I do now is - in the index controller I check &quot;does the user already logged in?&quot; If so open the index window, else open login window.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve found a similar question but it&#39;s 3 years old, is it still relevant? </p>

							<div><p>Ok, for more clarity, could you explain in more detail the process of your login process as well as your logout process?</p>
<p>If you could provide screenshots to help your explanation that would be great!</p>

							<div><p>sure!</p>
<p>As all Alloy applications my starting point is index.js (alloy.js is irrelevant on this scenario)</p>
<p>When the user opens the app I check if the user is already logged in?</p>
<p>then - open the <strong>index.js</strong> window.</p>
<p>else - open the <strong>login.js</strong> window.</p>
<p>Index.js contains a <strong>logout</strong> button that delete the user records from the cache (that&#39;s the way that I check if user is logged-in) and opens the login.js.</p>
<p>Login is made by the user phonenumber and secert password, that&#39;s the way I can identify each user.</p>
<p>*user can not use the app with out login, therefore if user is not logged-in the only avaliable screen for him will be the log-in.</p>
<p>THX again!</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>So I would change your login.js to bring back a view rather than a window. This is to sit over the main container, and also so that there is no weird animations when removing a root window.</p>
<p>Unsure if you want to be able to <strong>only</strong> logout on the root window (index.js) or anywhere in the app. But I will assume the former.</p>
<p>I would create a couple functions to call when you open&#x2F;close your login view. These will be helpful later on to handle everything cross platform. Here are a couple examples:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">$.disableNav = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (OS_IOS) {
        $.win.setLeftNavButton(<span class="hljs-literal">undefined</span>);
    }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (OS_ANDROID) {
        $.nav.activity.actionBar.displayHomeAsUp = <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>;
    }
}

$.enableNav = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (OS_IOS) {
        $.win.setLeftNavButton($.leftNavBtn);
    }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (OS_ANDROID) {
        $.nav.activity.actionBar.displayHomeAsUp = <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>;
    }
}
</code></pre><p><em>This again assumes that there is only a left navigation button on both iOS and Android, and that you are using an Android version of 4.x or higher and finally that you have set up the ActionBar for Android also.</em></p>
<p>See here for <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Android.ActionBar">ActionBar</a></p>
<p>Hopefully this all makes sense and points you in the right direction, any questions just ask!</p>
