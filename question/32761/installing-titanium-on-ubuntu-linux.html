			<h1>Installing Titanium on Ubuntu Linux</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>As far as installing Titanium, the only instructions I found were on the &quot;Getting Started with Titanium Mobile&quot; page, where it says:</p>
<p>&quot;After installing Titanium Developer, you should start the Titanium Developer product and see the following welcome screen&quot;</p>
<p>However, I don&#39;t get any kind of welcome screen.</p>
<p>The first time I ran &quot;Titanium Developer&quot;, which was in the &quot;Titanium Developer-1.2.1&quot; directory, it gave me an install interface, and then installed some files in my home directory under &quot;.titanium&quot;.</p>
<p>After that, nothing. There are no shortcut links on my desktop or in my Applications menu to start anything. If I run &quot;Titanium Developer&quot; again, it does nothing.</p>
<p>So far as I can tell, I&#39;ve downloaded the Google Android SDK, but I can&#39;t seem to get it to link up in any way with Titanium.</p>
<p>Are there clear instructions for installing Titanium on Ubuntu Linux (or at least Linux in general?)</p>
<p>Thank you for any advice.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m having this problem as well. I have found more information though; when I run the program through the terminal I get the following error:</p>
<p>.&#x2F;Titanium Developer: symbol lookup error: &#x2F;usr&#x2F;lib&#x2F;libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0: undefined symbol: g_malloc_n</p>
<p>This happens after titanium developer goes and downloads the SDKs. After it does that, it tries to run and spits that error out.</p>
<p>Can anyone shed any further light on this issue?</p>

							<p>Do you see a ~&#x2F;Titanium\ Developer folder Dave?</p>
<p>If you do - inside that - you&#39;ll find the Ti Dev app - which is the the main app.</p>

<p>Why bring up such an old topic? The solution mentioned here, to remove libraries, is not necessary now.</p>

							<p>I tried everything. I&#39;m running 64bits ubuntu, 32 bits java, don&#39;t know about javac-version (it doesn&#39;t say the bits).<br>I downloaded the 64 bits titanium, no result,<br>the 32 bits, also no result,<br>(even the windows one doesn&#39;t work on windows).<br>I see a lot of how to install titanium&#39;s on the web, tried a log of them, all without success.<br>What we need, is an installation, that would check things to, with some good advice.<br>So when it needs a certain jdk, it would say: worng jdk installed, see: http:&#x2F;&#x2F; forumpage&#x2F;how_to_install_jdk</p>
<p>I&#39;m following this titanium thing for a couple of months now, but each time, I don&#39;t succeed. (And no way that it has anything to do with my computer, OS or whatever.) The installation instructions are far from mature. The forum is filled with problems.</p>
<p>If my car was like this, I had to let it go. However, I keep having faith in this product. Please, don&#39;t let me loose that.</p>
