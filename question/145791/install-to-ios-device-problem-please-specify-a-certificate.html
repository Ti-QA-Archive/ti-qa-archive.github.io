							<p>Hi Luis,</p>
<p>Is the project running with 2.1.4 SDK or the new 3.0.0 SDK? If it&#39;s using the latest SDK, could you try running &quot;titanium info -o ios&quot; and see if the list of certificates appear in the output?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>The only way that none of the certs are not found is if you have no certs. We&#39;re scanning the output of the command <code>security dump-keychain</code>. We search for &quot;iPhone Developer&quot;, &quot;iPhone Distribution&quot;, and &quot;Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certification Authority&quot;. Verify that you indeed have all of the required certs installed.</p>

										<p><p>I still have the same problem, and no idea how to fix it, if I want to install some app to iOS device I have to use Titanium Studio 2.1.2. WIth Titanium Studio 3.0.0 I can&#39;t install on my iOS devices. So, it&#39;s not a certificate problem, it´s just Titanium Studio 3.0.0 that doesn&#39;t find my iOS certificates</p>

										<p><p>Sorry, I meant &quot;titanium info -t ios&quot;.</p>
<p>@Luis, based on Chris&#39; comment, could you run &quot;security dump-keychain&quot; from command line and see if you see entries for &quot;iPhone Developer&quot;, &quot;iPhone Distribution&quot;, and &quot;Apple WorldWide Developer Relations Certification Authority&quot;?</p>

							<p>Same problem here!!! Even with the latest Studio and SDK ( CLI version 3.0.21, Titanium SDK version 3.0.1.v20121220123205 ) I get the same window as Luis Galhardo,</p>
<p>&quot;titanium info -t ios&quot; shows Xcode version, Development iOS Provisioning Profiles, Distribution iOS Provisioning Profiles and iOS Keychains, <strong>BUT NO iOS Certificates</strong>… Only &#39;not found&#39; on all three: Development, Distribution and Apple WWDR.</p>
<p>The only way I could make it work is by reverting to Titanium SDK build 2.1.4.GA.</p>
<p><strong>Any other suggestion so we can use the latest SDK please?</strong></p>
<p>Thanks!!</p>

							<p>I think is a problem of accents in certificates. When I run on IOS device 6 with SDK 2.1.3 my development certificate  shows &quot;Adolfo Pérez&quot;. But if I am trying to run with SDK 3.0, my developement certificate show &quot;Adolfo P\303\251rez&quot; and, logically it doesn&#39;t exits.</p>

										<p><p>Are your OSX in another language that english? Or any latin characters  in your certificates (ñ,ç,…)? I think is a problem with Titanium Studio&#x2F;SDK 3.0 and the languages. Are you tried with SDK 2.1.3?</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m using OSX in English, with Titanium Studio 2.1.2 works fine. I have no accents on my certificate name and I think that in your case it´s normal, seems like utf encoded because of accents. In my case, I don&#39;t even see any certificate available to choose from. My problem is with Titanium Studio 3.0.0, it has nothing to to with Titanium SDK versions</p>

							<p>This just started happening to me today. I&#39;m in the US and there&#39;s nothing special about my details. I went to install the app as usual and titanium thinks there are no iOS certificates. I checked with the security dump and I see them, I then checked with titanium info and it doesn&#39;t see them. I reinstalled them for good measure but still the same.<br>I&#39;ll try Studio 2.1.2 in the meantime.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ve been using 2.1.2 now for iOS installs. There&#39;s one other glitch that may be related… every time I start Studio 3 it tells me there is an update for Alloy and Titanium CLI even though I already have the versions installed. If I choose to install it says successful but then asks me again on next launch. Does that sound familiar?</p>
