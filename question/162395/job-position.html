							<p>You could try your hand at one of the many freelancer focused sites.</p>
<h2 id="let-me-tell-you-where-i-come-from-as-one-who-hires-developers-">Let me tell you where I come from, as one who hires developers.</h2>
<h4 id="your-account-on-the-q-amp-a-is-just-over-a-year-old-">Your account on the Q&amp;A is just over a year old.</h4>
<p>That doesn&#39;t scream 1 year of experience, that says one year of <strong>exposure</strong> to Titanium. Your other known languages (C#, asp, php) are server&#x2F;desktop centric and not mobile in nature.  So there is an experiential disconnect between your background&#x2F;education and the environment you are attempting to enter and you have to overcome this.</p>
<h4 id="you-hold-no-appcelerator-certifications">You hold no Appcelerator Certifications</h4>
<p>This is a bit disconcerting, in that while you have a background in computer engineering, and have studied such in Istanbul, it shows no effort on your part to demonstrate current marketable credentials.  Again, a degree from the 80s&#x2F;90s (heck, even the early 2000&#39;s) are so &#39;old&#39; in terms of comsci, that other than an &#39;atta boy&#39; for completion, the knowledge learned then often isn&#39;t applicable to today.</p>
<h4 id="you-are-an-unknown-in-the-titanium-community">You are an unknown in the Titanium community</h4>
<p>With the lack of experience, and the lack of documentation, the third of the three things an employer would look at is &#39;are you known&#39;.  This carries weight only in regards to a lack of formal education, in that you may have community peers who will vouch for your knowledge and understanding. In your case, the answer is, &#39;no not really&#39;.</p>
<h2 id="so-where-do-you-go-next-">So where do you go next?</h2>
<h4 id="you-need-to-show-a-body-of-work">You need to show a body of work</h4>
<p>You need to demonstrate your &#39;experience&#39;.</p>
<h4 id="you-need-to-document-your-credentials">You need to document your credentials</h4>
<p>This means take the Appcelerator exams.  Demonstrate that you understand the product and how it operates.</p>
<h4 id="you-need-to-market-yourself">You need to market yourself</h4>
<p>Generate <strong>QUALITY</strong> content that benefits the community.</p>

										<p><p>I think Michael has it right.  Build your LinkdIn profile.  If the apps you have made were for someone else or a company, get them to write up a recommendation on linkedin for you.</p>
<p>If the work was for yourself, thats a bit tougher, maybe some english pages on your personal blog site to get some google traffic.</p>
<p>Your geo&#x2F;political location puts you in an interesting predicament, as a US company could not use you for many government or enterprise projects (just being honest with you).  They could use you for non-secure projects.</p>

							<p>This is not a jobs board. So, you will probably have little success here. I would start your search on LinkedIn or some dedicated job resource like Dice.com or a local equivalent (if not in the US). Good luck.</p>

							<p>You could try to find Ti related jobs on Odesk.com or other freelancing sites.<br>Not the best pay in the world but it&#39;s a start. Assuming you&#39;ll get some projects there you can use them later in your portfolio and try to find clients that pay better.</p>
