			<h1>Splash Screen in Ti Studio 3.0</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>  i have a strange question, i have downloaded the latest Ti Studio and while i am building the app in simulator i can see my splash screen but when i test it on my device i see the default appcelerator splash screen. i have only appicon.png and Default.png in my iPhone folder.<br>   what can i do? is there anybody who have the same problem? i have tried with different images many times appicon.png is working but the splash screen ( Default.png ) doesn&#39;t working?<br>    i have built and made apps many times but this is the first time with this issue :(</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have the exact same problem. Mine is not a new app, it&#39;s an app I&#39;ve been working on for a while. I have all the splash screen variations in my resources&#x2F;iphone directory and it still doesn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>I have had this problem as well, both on  a new app and on one that has been in the App Store for over a year</p>
<p>One workaround I have found that works is to rename your Default.png (that is the only one that seems to have a problem) to anything else.  And then rename it back … seems to get picked up at that point.  But this does not last … and you have to do it again.</p>
