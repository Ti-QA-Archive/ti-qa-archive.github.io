			<h1>Editor windows closing by themselves.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a problem all of a sudden where my editor windows close automatically. Sometimes 1 or 2, sometimes all of them at once, so I have to keep reopening them. Sometimes the file I&#39;m editing suddenly jumps around a bit. It&#39;s not lack of sleep I&#39;m sure of it. I&#39;ve checked the preferences setting and it&#39;s not set to autoclose. But even then it would close the oldest one I assume, not all of them at once.</p>

							<div><p>Titanium Studio, build: 1.0.8.201201262211<br>(c) Copyright 2011 by Appcelerator, Inc.  All rights reserved.</p>
<p>Build: jenkins-titanium-rcp-master-136 (origin&#x2F;master)<br>Date: 26 January 2012, 22:14:21</p>
<p>It&#39;s quite recent(ish), installing  updates says it&#39;s the most recent version. Would something wrong witih Aptana cause this? I&#39;m assuming the code is all stored on my machine and a network connection issue or problem on the Titanium end wouldn&#39;t cause this issue?</p>

							<div><p>After some investigation, I believe this is something strange going on with Dropbox which I use. Although I copy the folder from drop box and edit it locally there still seems to be a link to the copied file to drop box and there might be a sync issue which is causing the file to appear changed on disk and thus titanium may be closing the window as it&#39;s different on disk.</p>

							<p>Not that anyone probably cares, but I managed to fix this. I copied my files to a new project and clicked promote to project. Somehow the issue seems to have sorted itself out by doing this.</p>
