			<h1>Proxy Server Crashing Studio - Unable to Remove</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>On a Mac (10.6 Snow Leopard), after having used Titanium outside of our proxy for a long time, I noticed Studio had some new settings so I adjusted it to run behind our proxy server. After some tweaks, I was able to check for updates without error. However, as soon as I closed studio and started it again…..it crashes immediately. I cannot undo my settings as it crashes.</p>
<p>I uninstalled studio (using AppZapper) and am no longer behind the proxy, but it is still crashing and I cannot undo my settings. I was perfectly fine not running behind the proxy before, but I cannot revert back.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the crash log:  <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;2449980">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;2449980</a></p>
<p>Any ideas? I can&#39;t even start studio to make the changes.</p>

							<p>Hi Mike, I recently had some issues with login on titanium studio. Following instructions from Paul Dowsett, this helped me:</p>
<p><em>&quot;Try closing TiStudio and confirming that its processes have stopped. Then rename its settings directory at <code>~&amp;#x2F;.eclipse</code> (the .eclipse folder in your home directory) and launching eclipse again.&quot;</em></p>
<p>If in this folder are preferences saved, maybe force to create a new one may help you.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks renaming the ~&#x2F;.eclipse folder seemed to do the trick. Hope they fix the bug soon as you cannot even start Studio.</p>

										<p><p>Sounds stupid but for anyone new to Mac OS like I was; the eclipse folder is hidden, so the you will need to either use the terminal (ls -a) to view the folder and it&#39;s content. Or you will need to Show Hidden files by using the following lines in the terminal and then rename the &#39;org.eclipse.equinox.security&#39; folder:</p>
<p>defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE</p>
<p>killall Finder</p>
<p>To hide the folders again use the lines below:</p>
<p>defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE</p>
<p>killall Finder</p>
<p>Hopefully this will save some pain if anyone comes across this rather annoying issue. thanks for the answer Javier.</p>

							<p>This happened to me today. Visited an office whose network was behind a secure proxy. My first action was to alter the network proxy settings in Titanium Studio &gt; Preferences because you <em>have</em> to login in order to use the Studio. :\</p>
<p>Naturally, the TI Studio crashed again and again until I removed that file. Very bad…</p>
