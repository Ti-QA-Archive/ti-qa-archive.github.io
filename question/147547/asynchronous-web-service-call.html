			<p>Hi everybody,<br>I want a solution like I am calling a web service and receiving data in response. now I want this data to use as it is received. I mean to say is that I don&#39;t want to wait until whole data is received. as data is available I would like to use it. I have tried with suds and soapclient libraries but could not get my desired result.<br>if question is not clear then please let me know………..</p>

							<div><p>Hi Sivakumar,</p>
<p>I want to load my app first then I want to call web service and then I receive data then I want this data to be displayed in table view as it is available. lets suppose I am getting 5 mb data in response then I would like to get this data in small pieces like any random amount called 500KB or anything. now I want to use this data…..without waiting for whole 5MB data to be downloaded.</p>

							<p>I have two suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you can control the back-end web service, modify it to send smaller chunks.  Do you really want to send 5MB directly to a mobile app anyway?  Have the app request 50KB or 100KB slices of the data.  It will introduce some more overhead, but I don&#39;t think you will get too much performance hit.</li>
<li>or instead of using Ti.Network.HTTPClient, try using Ti.Network.Socket.TCP and implement the basics of the HTTP protocol yourself.  Then you can read the response directly and react to it as it comes in.  In fact, the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Network.Socket.TCP">Ti.Network.Socket.TCP docs</a> have a perfect example of making an HTTP request and using a Ti.Stream to read 1024-byte chunks.</li>
</ul>
