			<h1>Source Not Found</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello-</p>
<p>I am developing an app for Android and I am using SDK version 1.7.5. I am trying to debug my application and I am receiving a page entitled [Eval script] and it says &quot;Source Not Found&quot; and has a button that say&#39;s edit Source Lookup Path. I tried adding my project under the &quot;Edit Source Lookup Path&quot; button, but after I click OK it just removes the project I just added.  Currently it just shows a folder called &quot;Default&quot; in the Source Lookup Path list.  For some reason I can run my application without the debugger but this only happens when I try to debug my application.  Also, it was debugging just fine, prior to running the application w&#x2F;o the debugger.  Does anybody have any insight as to what may be going on here? has anyone else experienced this issue?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<div><p>Could you post some of the code that is on the page with the issue?  This pop-up usually comes when there is a undefined method or it cannot find the file you are referencing in a Ti.include or require call.</p>

							<div><p>I was right about to say that I already placed a breakpoint on line one and the error still occurred, therefore there has to be some other issue. Than I realized that I never actually did that.  Now after having, actually, done that I realized that you are right, I was missing a couple file.  Debugging 101, geez.  Thanks so much for you help and sorry for wasting your time with such a trivial question.</p>

							<p>This error comes often when you have named file illegally or incorrectly, like your file name is &#39;createMainWindow.js&#39; and you require that file in another file like this &#39;CreateMainWindow.js&#39; or other spelling mistake, especially case is main problem. So when you compile it, it gives no error but when you debug, it tells you that source file is not found.<br>I thinks this would work for you…… :)</p>
