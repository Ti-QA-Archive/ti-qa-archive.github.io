							<p>You want to develop on your windows machine, then send it over and hope and pray it works on your iphone? Sure, you can use this truly sad and inefficient approach to product development.</p>

										<p><p>oh, as to your <code>how do you do this</code>…</p>
<p>Best to create the project on the mac, so that the project has both android and ios support in the project settings&#x2F;tiapp.xml.  Use github or similar to share the code back and forth.</p>

										<p><p>I am concerned you actually mean <strong>Can I develop on windows to create my app and then send the files to someone&#x2F;somewhere else so the iOS version will magically appear</strong>.  If this is the real question - then very much <strong>no</strong>.</p>
<p>There will be no way to debug for iOS, no way of making sure you haven&#39;t left any Android specific code in for the iOS version.  Most importantly you will not be able to test it yourself properly.</p>
<p>If you are exporting it so you can do the iOS stuff elsewhere - then as Stephen says - this is a <em>&quot;… truly sad and inefficient approach…&quot;</em>.  It may be a necessity but it is never going to be anywhere near usable, convenient or sensible.</p>

										<p><p>Your question was perfectly understood - it was my first paragraph and the point of Stephens original answer.</p>
<p>So to repeat</p>
<ul>
<li>There will be no way to debug for iOS, no way of making sure you haven&#39;t left any Android specific code in for the iOS version. Most importantly you will not be able to test it yourself properly.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is technically possible - but the likelihood of any meaningful success without significant debugging issues is very high.</p>

										<p><p>Quick tip; next time - please do not create a new answer when your contribution is actually a comment - it confuses things in the future when trying to work out relevance, simply add a comment to the answer it is related to, or if the additional information is a follow up to the question or general information then add it as a comment to your own question at the top.  You are NOT being told off.</p>
