							<p>You give us VERY little to go on.  Ti.Database works fine in every SDK level which I have tried in android, so the problem is most likely in your code or assumptions you are making.</p>
<p>Without more information, there isn&#39;t much we can do but make SWAG suggestions.  But here is one SWAG:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are trying to include a prepopulated database with your resources</li>
<li>You use the Ti.Database.install() method to pass the data to the app</li>
</ul>
<p>If I am right so far, then either:</p>
<ul>
<li>The install() method is not finding the source database</li>
<li>There was already a database by that name, but without the table, so the install() method did not replace the existing database</li>
</ul>
<p>The first could be the issue if the database to be installed is not in the same path as the *.js executing the install method.  Or if you are giving a path reference and do not have it right.</p>
<p>The second is quite likely if you had a previous run of the app where the database did not yet have the table in question.  The install() method will ONLY copy the database from the resources directory if it does not yet exist.  Otherwise it just acts like an open() method on the existing database.</p>
<p>So if you didn&#39;t try it in iOS until the database had the table, and you previously tried it under android before adding the table, that could explain your symptoms.</p>
<p>But really, your question does not provide enough information to give you a proper answer.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you Doug. The sql was not in the same directory path… it worked fine in ios which always seems to require more precision, but this time that was the key. Thank you so much.</p>

										<p><p>Assuming you are using SDK 1.7.0 or higher, you should review the discussion of paths in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;05&#x2F;changes-to-filesystem-on-ios.html">this</a> developer blog article.</p>

							<p>After many hours of forum searching and bald spots from pulling hair what I found was that if FastDev is true and the app is being installed after an uninstall then the db would not install properly and you get the missing tables. Simply make fastdev false.<br>Hope that helps someone down the road.</p>
