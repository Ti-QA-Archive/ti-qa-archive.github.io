			<h1>Reject after pushing app to AppStore (Apps are not permitted to access the UDID)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, we make new version of our application and today i have been updated titanium sdk to 3.1 and push to AppStore without changes in code, then i got the mail: </p>
<p>=============================================================<br>Dear developer,</p>
<p>We have discovered one or more issues with your recent delivery for &quot;Trivi Online&quot;. To process your delivery, the following issues must be corrected:</p>
<p>Non-public API usage:</p>
<p>Apps are not permitted to access the UDID and must not use the uniqueIdentifier method of UIDevice. Please update your apps and servers to associate users with the Vendor or Advertising identifiers introduced in iOS 6.<br>If method names in your source code match the private Apple APIs listed above, altering your method names will help prevent this app from being flagged in future submissions. In addition, note that one or more of the above APIs may be located in a static library that was included with your app. If so, they must be removed.</p>
<p>If you think this message was sent in error and that you have only used Apple-published APIs in accordance with the guidelines, send the app&#39;s nine-digit Apple ID, along with detailed information about why you believe the above APIs were incorrectly flagged, to appreview@apple.com. For further information, visit the Technical Support Information page.</p>
<p>Once these issues have been corrected, go to the Version Details page and click &quot;Ready to Upload Binary.&quot; Continue through the submission process until the app status is &quot;Waiting for Upload.&quot; You can then deliver the corrected binary.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<h1 id="the-app-store-team">The App Store team</h1>
<p>As i know Titanium have his own method to ganarate UDID, and then i use Ti.Platform.id, i take titanium generated id.<br>When i turn back ti sdk to 3.0  - but it didnt help.</p>
<p>Maybe Titanium use the real IOS UDID in his code, and this cause of reject?</p>
<p>Please Help!</p>

										<p><p>If that&#39;s the case, there are other modules that are causing the same issue. I&#39;m using PayPal, Barcode and StyledLabel. So no, the issue isn&#39;t resolved I&#39;m afraid :(</p>
