			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am trying to play a short video on load of an app on Android.<br>I am using Titanium 1.7.3, Android 2.2</p>

</code></pre><p>Anyone know why it is not able to access the movie from the Resources folder? It used to be directly in the Resources folder, but I read in one of the postings that it should be moved to another folder under Resources, so I moved it to a folder &quot;videos&quot; under Resources.</p>
<p>I checked the properties on the file, and it is Readable. Is it really that the file is not found, or is it something else that is causing this error?</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>
<p>Sri</p>

							<p>The clue is in the error. It thinks that your file is compressed. So the problem is probably that you are trying to play an .mov file on Android. This would work fine on iphone, but not on Android. Try converting the file to an mp4, should work fine.</p>

										<p><p>So, does that mean we cannot use .mov files with videoplayer in Android at all?  and how do I convert a .mov to .mp4?</p>
<p>It will be good to know for the future too.</p>
<p>Thanks for your answer.</p>

										<p><p>This is correct. You never could use .mov files on Android and the chances of that changing are slim. When dealing with video, you need to understand the limitations of your target OS, .mov is an Apple created video format, which is why it will work by default on iOS.</p>
<p>As far as conversion, there are any number of ways to convert video. It really depends on what OS you are using. Again, video conversion is one of those topics that you really need to understand what it is exactly you want to do and what tools you can use to do it. A quick <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=online+mov+to+mp4+converter">google search</a> will usually point you in the right direction for online converters. If you happen to have VLC or something similar, you can easily do this from your computer. It all really depends on your OS.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks so much for your response and the information, Anthony!</p>
<p>I did not know that .mov is an Apple thing. That makes so much sense. </p>
<p>I will look into converting .mov to .mp4. I will post on what I did.I am so glad I found some direction now!</p>

										<p><p>hey Anthony, I am still getting the same FileNotFoundException - with a .mp4 file. I put the file in different directories - under resources, same folder as the file with the videoplayer, and under resources&#x2F;videos. It still gives me the FileNotFoundException.</p>
<p>Any idea why it is doing this? I am kinda stuck here, because this intro video is important to the app. so frustrating!</p>

										<p><p>The filename says &quot;ipad&quot; coz it was first developed for iOS, but it should still play on Android if it is a .mp4 format, right?</p>
<p>Also, when i put this code (basically from KitchenSink) into another blank project, it works fine. Its only complaining it cannot find the file, when I add it to my main project file.</p>

										<p><p>hey Anthony,</p>
<p>I think I got it working. I am keeping my fingers crossed! It worked when I commented out everything else in the file (and project) and ran the videoplayer. </p>
<p>Its either that, or I think (and hope) it was the video format. I had converted the .mov to .mp4 format using some online converter that was free. That file was giving me the problems. But it started working, when I used the .mp4 file that I got from a coworker. </p>
<p>But I still dont know why I was getting the problem even when I used the file from the KitchenSink project. hmmm…</p>
<p>Anyway, I am hoping this is it. I will update this post with my results.</p>
<p>Thanks for answering all my questions, Anthony!</p>
