			<h1>httpclient fails on some android devices</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>In my production app there&#39;s a registration form: on submit the app calls httpclient to connect to a remote PHP script.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> url = Alloy.Globals.REGURL;


<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> client = Ti.Network.createHTTPClient({
     onload : <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{
    ... <span class="hljs-keyword">do</span> something ...    
     },
     onerror : <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{
         alert(<span class="hljs-string">'No data connection'</span>);
     },
     timeout : <span class="hljs-number">5000</span>  <span class="hljs-comment">// in milliseconds</span>
 });
 client.open(<span class="hljs-string">"GET"</span>, url);
 client.send();
</code></pre><p>Recently many users always receive message &quot;No data connection&quot;.</p>
<p>Some usefull information:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>only some users has this problem, most of them are able to register.</p>
</li>
<li><p>the remote server is Ok. I have monitored it for a week, no problem of any kind</p>
</li>
<li><p>Last app update was built with android 4.4.2 API 19 (Ti 3.4.1) instead of Andriod 4.1.2 API 16 (Ti 3.4.0) (i mention it just to be sure that API 19 hasn&#39;t some iusses with httpclient)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Users who received error have different phones (brand or model) and different android version, so It&#39;s not something connected to a specific device or android release.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I&#39;m not able to replicate the problem on my device, so I don&#39;t have information about the error type</p>
</li>
<li><p>Have tried to set timeout to 10000, but without success.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So I&#39;m asking if someone has faced a similar problem or knows any issue regarding httpclient.<br>Please help me to understand, because I really don&#39;t know how to work-around it.</p>
<p>Many thanks<br>Nick</p>

							<div><p>Did you try using POST method as this method is most preferable for form submission ?,  &amp; check the SERVER side also whether it accepts POST or GET..?</p>
<p>I know your issue is quite critical so try using POST first as i always use POST method &amp; have never faced any issue..Thanks</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;ve already tested it: Server answers correctly both using GET and POST and returns the right XML. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried to change the PHP file to generate an error ( if a=b without brackets) and the app reached the on load function than was unable to read the XML.</p>
<p>For this reason I&#39;m asking an help… the problem is not connected to the response of the remote server (even if it&#39;s a &quot;FATAL Error&quot;), but happens because app &quot;thinks&quot; that server isn&#39;t answering at all.</p>
<p>Finally as I wrote, I&#39;m not able to replicate the error because on my devices, app works perfectly.</p>

										<p><p>@Nick, yes exactly…..use argument &#39;e&#39; of <em>onerror</em> function which will lead you to know the exact error..</p>

										<p><p>To be frankly original code is something like: </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">onerror : <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span></span> {
         Ti.API.info(e.<span class="hljs-built_in">error</span>);
         alert(<span class="hljs-string">'No data connection'</span>);
     }
</code></pre><p>I&#39;m in production so I decided not to output it in the alert. </p>
<p>Error messages are in English (and sometimes a bit long)… my italian users will never report them in their reviews.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll try to use an &quot;alert(e.error)&quot; and see if someone will write me something.</p>
<p>By the way, if someone has any information about httpclient and this strange behavour, please let me know.</p>

										<p><p>Its really NOT that much trouble to put up an alert with something like:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">alert<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-quoted">'There</span> was a problem during registration. <span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-quoted">'+client</span>.status+')</span>')</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>And showing the user the http error code.  They would at least have a piece of information they could send to you.  Thats one piece of information you didn&#39;t have before.</p>

										<p><p>The error handling is extremely limited - the assumption is that any failure to return data is due to a lack of connection.</p>
<ul>
<li>You should be testing if there is a connection before firing a call to the server.</li>
<li>You should be checking ALL available information returned in the error.</li>
<li>You should be looking for patterns in when failures occur - log the time of each call for example and burst send from a cache file when a good connection exists.  You MUST seek the users permission for such returned data though</li>
<li>You should check the logs on the server to see if a pattern exists</li>
<li>You should add a header record to help you determine additional factors in the server log files</li>
<li>You should be keeping a record of the last x calls and how successful they were, including the time to respond from the server.  With this information you can adapt the app  timeouts if required.</li>
<li>Never assume you will or can gain any information - always build in the ability to gracefully fail</li>
</ul>
