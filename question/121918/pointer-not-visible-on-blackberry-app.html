			<h1>Pointer not visible on BlackBerry app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>After jumping through dozens of hoops to get around the missing pieces in the BlackBerry SDK, I was finally able to get an app that works fairly well in the Simulator.  Nothing fancy, just a few buttons to emulate a Tab Bar, and a WebView to show the &quot;pages&quot;.</p>
<p>As I said, all works well in the Simulator.</p>
<p>On the actual phone itself (a BlackBerry Bold 9650 in this case) the cursor is not visible.  I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s hidden, or perhaps it&#39;s behind the app, but it&#39;s not anywhere to be found.  If I get lucky and click in the right place, the app does function, but with no rollover highlights or &quot;mouse&quot; pointer it&#39;s like navigating blind.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>PS:  It&#39;s July 1st.  <strong>Please</strong> tell me that we&#39;ll see an updated SDK with <strong>tons</strong> of bug fixes next week!</p>

							<p>Bryan,</p>
<p>While an SDK is in beta and it&#39;s early releases, we rely on the bleeding edge developers, such as yourself, to build on and help track down the issues with each component to the platform. You&#39;ve probably found the first of many quirks that will need attention as we develop this SDK. That being said, if you don&#39;t find what you&#39;re looking for in Q&amp;A, which is very likely with BB stuff, you may want to bounce over to the bug tracker and see if there is an open ticket for the issue already. If not, then we always appreciate it when developers can help us locate and squash bugs. </p>
<p>As for your particular issue, I couldn&#39;t immediately find an open ticket for it, and I&#39;ll see about replicating and getting a solid test case to see what kind of issue we&#39;re looking at here.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the response Anthony.</p>
<p>As an Indie developer, I can&#39;t open support issues (a point of contention for a paying customer).  I&#39;ve found <strong>lots</strong> of problems with the BlackBerry SDK though.</p>
<p>For this particular issue, would it help to have the actual code?  I could send it to you.</p>
<p>Lastly, any idea when the next version of the SDK will be ready?  &quot;Late June&quot; was the last official word.  I&#39;ve got a client job held up waiting for a more stable version.  Needless to say, I&#39;m climbing the walls and counting the seconds…</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>While I&#39;ve got your attention, can you also raise this issue up the flagpole as well?</p>

										<p><p>Hey Bryan,</p>
<p>You&#39;re correct, as an Indie you can&#39;t open trouble tickets through the paid support help desk, however you can search, create, comment, and&#x2F;or follow issues through Jira, our issue tracker. Here is the url: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org</p>
<p>You can register using the link below the login form if you don&#39;t have a Jira account.<br>In many cases, including yours I believe, this is ideal simply because if you were to raise a help desk ticket that turned out to be a bug and not an issue with your code, the person helping you would likely need to create a new issue there in order to help you resolve your support ticket. </p>
<p>Now, as far as what you are currently experiencing, I can&#39;t say whether or not it is a code issue, so if you would like to send me the code, I would be more than happy to take a look at it and investigate further, as well as take a look at the webview tab issue.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re currently using, but the BB Beta 2 is out now, though I&#39;m not sure when then next release is …</p>
