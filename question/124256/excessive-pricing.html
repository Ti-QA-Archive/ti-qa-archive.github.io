			<h1>Excessive pricing</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;d be surprised if I&#39;m the only one. After researching the available tools I ended up looking at Titanium as the ideal tool of choice. Then I got a look at pricing. $195 a month? I mean, what?! I don&#39;t mind paying say $495 for a license, but a price per month? Get serious. And I gotta call a sales guy if there&#39;s more than a few devs in the team? Great, enterprise pricing.</p>
<p>Honestly, the tool looks good, but this kind of pricing only works without competition. This is no way to build a developer base. Just my opinion.</p>
<p>Kind regards,<br>Marc</p>

							<p>I&#39;m just one guy who trying to make a living doing consulting, websites, mobile apps, stuff like that.  I called and they told me that I should check out the partner program. </p>
<p>So I&#39;m waiting to hear back.</p>
<p>I still don&#39;t understand them - but basically it seems like it&#39;s free to individuals doing apps for themselves… and enterprise licensing is for businesses. The pricing for enterprise was extremely high… but that makes sense. Customers would get priority support and enterprise integration would be vastly more expensive and time consuming.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know how much the partner program is yet - and what I also don&#39;t know is if a small business pays me to make an app do they have to buy an enterprise license..</p>
<p>The sales guy seemed to know next to nothing about the partner program.</p>

							<p>I used to pay a good bit more than that for my Visual Studio licenses.  A copy for each dev was about $800 each.  Granted, I did GET a whole lot more for my $800.  Microsoft has always been very good to their developers.  Access to  clients, server architectures, tools, all the MSDN information.</p>

							<p>I prob wouldn&#39;t mind paying even that, but it&#39;s the monthly pricing and this &quot;call us for pricing&quot; that seriously bugs me. This is not electricity.</p>

							<p>just to add to Martin Slater point, I&#39;m a free loader here… and I think I&#39;m going to stay that way until I need the extra bells and whistles (like ads, more analytics and what not)…</p>
<p>since I&#39;m not a fan of the Studio anyways, I kinda wish Titanium still supporting the good ol&#39; Ti Developer. Now I still code in Coda and use the Studio with nothing but the console open.</p>

							<p>I understood that the free version had &quot;Appcelerator&quot; advertisement. Just wondering if there are any real limitations apart from not having access to some premium components. This was the impression I got</p>

										<p><p>nope, you&#39;ve misunderstood. <strong>no Appcelerator branding</strong> anywhere in your app on free version.</p>
<p>however if you want to put non iAd advertisement in your app, like admob, it&#39;ll be supported in the premium version. I think it&#39;ll still possible to do it on the free version, would require some Obj C know how though…</p>

										<p><p>I wouldn&#39;t say there are &quot;limitations&quot; with the free community edition.  I&#39;d classify it as &quot;extras&quot; for a paid subscription.  Until recently one of those extras was the debugger in Studio, but that has been opened up to the community as well.</p>
<p>Thus what you get is access to the Ti+ extension modules, early access to beta programs (for example Blackberry SDK or Mobile Web), access to the helpdesk, etc.  See the comparison at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;plans-pricing&#x2F;">plans and pricing</a>.</p>
