			<p>So I have an app written in classic. I started the app about 3 years ago. Last week I decided to rewrite the app from scratch using Alloy. Here is the scenario I am facing.</p>
<ol>
<li>The app has a window that plays a video</li>
<li>Depending on what video the user selects, the video player behaves differently. For example, Video A you are allowed to drag the playhead at any time whereas Video B, you can drag the playhead backwards and forwards but only as far as you&#39;ve watched (you cannot skip forward).</li>
</ol>
<p>The video window shares all the same UI and quite a bit of functionality. In my old app using classic, I just did a <code>Ti.include(&amp;#39;path&amp;#x2F;to&amp;#x2F;certain&amp;#x2F;playtype.js&amp;#39;);</code> in my window.</p>
<p>That worked for classic. In terms of Alloy, I want to be sure I do this the right way and not just redo what I did in classic. Can anyone offer up a suggestion as to how I do this?</p>
<p>The example I provided above was just the tip of the iceberg. There is a lot more functionality differences. Enough to where I wanted the files separate as it would be easier to read the code and edit.</p>
