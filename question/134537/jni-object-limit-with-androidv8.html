			<h1>JNI object limit with Android/V8</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have an app that functions well in Rhino, but when I build with V8, I get an error saying that I&#39;ve hit the JNI object limit (which, apparently, is 512).</p>
<p>Is there a way to increase this size? Is this something that can be configured?</p>
<p>Some of you are going to read this and say, &quot;What the hell are you doing with 512 objects? You should refactor.&quot; Trust me, I would if I could, but my app makes an enormous amount of data accessible with a few taps, so I can&#39;t reliably decrease the number of objects.</p>

							<div><p>w00t?! 512 objects, I exceed that number in one small form :D</p>
<p>Anyway, I had issues with that (and still have) … it seems that issue is caused by circular references. I didn&#39;t isolate that issue yet, so I&#39;m not sure that is the case, but app works fine when I comment out the part that creates circular reference and it works fine in Rhino (with CRs).</p>

							<div><p>Can you isolate and post the code that causes the issue? Is it a bug, or is it something that is inherent to having circular references?</p>
<p>I have also noticed that the same code works in Rhino, so I hope it&#39;s easy to fix.</p>

							<div><p>Yeah, my code also works in Rhino, so I suppose that&#39;s a bug (circular references are valid structure).</p>
