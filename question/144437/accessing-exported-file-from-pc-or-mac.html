			<h1>Accessing exported file from PC or Mac</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I need my app to export data to a csv file which can be retrieved by the user by plugging their iPhone&#x2F;iPad or Android device into their computer. The user can then change the data in that file and put it back on the device for import into the app.</p>
<p>I have tried writing the file to the applicationDataDirectory and, whilst I can find it on the iPad Simulator, I can&#39;t find it when I run the app on an Android device and look for the exported file when the Android device is plugged into the PC.</p>
<p>So where is best please to write the export file to so that it can be accessed as a file from the Mac or PCand replaced back on the device for re-import?</p>
<p>Also - I would like to be able to use a file picker in the app so the user can select one of several files to import. I would be very grateful for code to help with this.</p>
<p>The code I am using so far is this (where parseCSVdata is a seperate file containing a function called CSVToArray which converts a string of csv file contents to an array):</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">
     packageFile = 'mydata.csv';
    <span class="hljs-function"> Ti.API.info(</span>Titanium.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory + packageFile<span class="hljs-function">)</span>;
     var importfile =<span class="hljs-function"> Titanium.Filesystem.getFile(</span>Titanium.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory, packageFile<span class="hljs-function">)</span>;

    <span class="hljs-function"> if(</span>importfile.exists(<span class="hljs-function">)</span><span class="hljs-function">)</span> 
         {<span class="hljs-function"> Ti.API.info(</span>'file exists'<span class="hljs-function">)</span>; 


             var contents = importfile.read.blob;
            <span class="hljs-function"> alert(</span>contents<span class="hljs-function">)</span>;


             var parse =<span class="hljs-function"> require(</span>'parseCSVdata'<span class="hljs-function">)</span>;
              var importArray =<span class="hljs-function"> parse.CSVToArray(</span>contents,','<span class="hljs-function">)</span>;
             alert<span class="hljs-function"> (</span>'importArray:' + importArray<span class="hljs-function">)</span>;

            <span class="hljs-function"> Ti.API.info(</span>importArray<span class="hljs-function">)</span>;

             //<span class="hljs-instruction"> return </span>import<span class="hljs-instruction"> array
</span>                <span class="hljs-instruction"> return </span>importArray;  

     }
     else{
        <span class="hljs-function"> alert(</span>'Import file does<span class="hljs-instruction"> not </span>exist.'<span class="hljs-function">)</span>;

         //<span class="hljs-instruction"> return </span>import<span class="hljs-instruction"> array
</span>           <span class="hljs-instruction"> return </span>0; 
     }

							<p>Your solution relies on two things which will likely give you difficulty:</p>
<ul>
<li>navigation of the filesystem within the app (this doesn&#39;t feel very app-like, IMHO)</li>
<li>remote browsing of the filesystem from the host PC (which I&#39;m not sure is even possible in all cases)</li>
</ul>
<p>What if instead, you build a simple web service to accept the CSV data and make it available for editing via the web, and then download the edited data?  If you were really clever, you could integrate with google docs and use a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>I think spending 8-10 hours building that will result in less frustration than going down the path you&#39;re describing.</p>

										<p><p>You have summarised the problem perfectly Jason!</p>
<p>I have already gone down the road of hosting the data on a web server and using a php script to deliver the data back to the app. But I have a couple of reasons for not wanting to do that with this iteration of the app:</p>
<p>1) Some users will be working with very large data sets, so the download time would be too much</p>
<p>2) I want this version of the app to be mass-market capable and I don&#39;t want to have to build a web system that supports that yet. I would rather keep the entire thing as an app and desktop system.</p>
<p>It must surely be possible to find somewhere to stick a file where it can be browsed from the PC or Mac when the device is loaded as a drive? Other apps do this, so I would have thought it is possible…?</p>
<p>Many thanks for your time and attention to my question. It is much appreciated :)</p>

										<p><p>The fact that you&#39;re targeting the mass market makes me even less inclined to recommend a file-based solution.  I would imagine that would cause a lot of confusion for users, with many simply unable to use the system.</p>
<p>On android, you can write to external storage.  And if the device allows it, you can connect the device to the PC via USB and browse&#x2F;edit files in that storage.  I do not believe you can <em>ever</em> view or edit files in the application data portion of the filesystem.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;20381&#x2F;save-image-from-app-to-sdcard-on-android">Here is a thread</a> that may be helpful in writing to external storage.</p>
<p>However, I can tell you first-hand that my Android phone has been unreliable when trying to access it from my Mac as an external USB drive.  It connects properly with my current Mac, but my previous one (circa 2010) did not ever recognize it as a storage device.   It&#39;s a small sample size, but I&#39;d be willing to bet that a lot of users would not know how or even be unable to use the device this way.</p>
<p>As for iOS, I don&#39;t know much about it, but I can&#39;t make my test ipod touch connect as a drive at all (unsupported on ipod touch; is it supported on iphone?).</p>
<p>What apps are doing this well?  It&#39;s an interesting use case, and I wonder how they solve these issues.</p>
