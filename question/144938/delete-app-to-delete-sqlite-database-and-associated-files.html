			<h1>Delete App to Delete SQLite database and associated files??</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi All,<br>I&#39;m being developing a new app on a low-spec android handset (HTC Desire C).<br>My app has quite a few datacalls to a SQLite DB (open, writing, closing, reading etc).<br>Not a lot of data btw.</p>
<p>While I have been developing and adding more functionality, the app has gotten really slow, taking e.g. 10seconds to load the first page. This page has 5 views that each access the DB in different ways (dynamic datacapture form). </p>
<p>Question: is it possible that I&#39;m somehow filling&#x2F;bloating my SQLite database while I&#39;m testing?<br>And somehow the app has become huge and slow? I do call &quot;DROP TABLE IF EXISTS&quot; at the beginning of the app to try clean the tables.</p>
<p>If so, by deleting the app, should it delete the database&#x2F;tables I have created?<br>I have removed the app a few times but it is still slowing down.</p>
<p>So it could be that my code is too memory or there is something else going on…<br>Maybe that particular page is now just too heavy, </p>
<p>First time using SQLite so I don&#39;t know any of the issues yet.</p>
<p>Any thoughts&#x2F;tips&#x2F;hints appreciated.</p>
<p>Sorry I can&#39;t post the code, it&#39;s just too much.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Lee</p>

							<div><p>with the lack of pertinent information actually given, i might as well declare that your problem is caused by &#39;global warming&#39; or &#39;solar flares&#39;:</p>
<p>Missing from your question are a number of important pieces of information. I suggest you take a look at the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Using+Questions+and+Answers">Using Questions and Answers</a> article, specifically the Q&amp;A Question Checklist.  The missing information is critical to reproducing problems in a test environment and often indicates other factors that cause the undesirable outcome you are experiencing.</p>

							<div><p>Hi Stephen,<br>When one doesn&#39;t know what the problem is, one can&#39;t provide the right information to solve that problem.</p>
<p>Let me make this a bit easier to understand.</p>
<p>If your someone came to you with the following question:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Since implementing  SQLite actions, my app has slowed down considerably.<br>In your experience, what are the 3 most common causes of this performance issue&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>What would you say? </p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Holding on to Memory - Close your DB connection at the end of each function, or</li>
<li>Too many DB requests per page - spread your requests over multiple pages.</li>
<li>etc etc</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m not asking you to review and rewrite my code, I just need to know generally what the common pitfalls are of using SQLite and associated memory usage. Then I can start the process of elimination.</p>
<p>Alternatively,  if that&#39;s too difficult, can you please answer the first question:<br>&quot;If I delete the app from the phone, should it delete the database I have created?&quot;</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Lee</p>

							<p>I have an app that uses a SQLite database containing hundreds of thousands of records and it doesn&#39;t cause performance problems. Saying that I have carefully indexed and also tuned my queries.</p>
<p>You say in your post &quot;not a lot of data&quot;. Can you quantify? I suspect your problem lies elsewhere.</p>
<p>With regards deleting app. It should, but on Android at least you can look at the filesystem and make sure.</p>
