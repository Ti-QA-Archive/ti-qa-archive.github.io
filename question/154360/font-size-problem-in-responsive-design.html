							<p>OK, you need to get to grips with Media Queries to correctly implement a &#39;responsive&#39; design.  Checkout <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;Guide&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;Media_queries">this article</a> on MDN to get started. Essentially the technique is to include a specific css style sheet depending on the device dimensions.</p>

										<p><p>Can you confirm you have set your <strong>tiapp.xml</strong> file to use <strong>dp</strong> rather than <strong>system</strong>.  Also make sure you have cleaned the project before trying again.</p>
<p>Then it should be no more complicated than;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var lbl = Ti.Ui.createLabel({
    font: {
        fontSize: <span class="hljs-number">14</span>
    },
    text: <span class="hljs-string">'Put something here'</span>
});
</code></pre><p>This should provide very similar results in iPhone; non-retina and retina.  Android with most devices; keep in mind not all Android devices report back the correct density for the size of the device.</p>

										<p><p>So this problem will be the same outside of the app if you view the pages on the built-in browsers.</p>
<p>Consider adding this meta tag to each HTML page, it may well snap things into place.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">&lt;meta <span class="hljs-property">name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"viewport"</span> content=<span class="hljs-string">"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"</span>&gt;

										<p><p>You implement viewport settings as a last resort IMHO (When you dont have the ability to serve correct device content). Its just going to mess with the css layout by using that unless its <em>really simple</em> css</p>
