			<h1>Loading and xml resource via Python is not found</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a python thread running in the background to do some backend packet parsing between different servers. All is well for my python code and I wanted to integrate it into my Titanium application. Most all is well. I dealt withe first problem with a quick and dirty fix which I find a little puzzling. My includes were though sub directories which are done with <code>from Py.mod import piece</code>, however it seems that I can only include them from the root Resource directory (comments on this are also welcome).</p>
<p>Anyways, I also run an xml parser in python for various settings for server settings. This file is called settings.xml and located in the root directory just in case. I tried opening the file with &quot;settings.xml&quot;, &quot;.&#x2F;settings.xml&quot;, &quot;app:&#x2F;&#x2F;settings.xml&quot;, and some other combinations in between. Python does not recognize &quot;app:&#x2F;&#x2F;&quot; as a directory.</p>
<p>However, when I tried printing the current working directory it gave me: &quot;&#x2F;Applications&#x2F;Utilities&#x2F;Titanium Studio&#x2F;TitaniumStudio.app&#x2F;Contents&#x2F;MacOS&quot;, where the actual application is located in an entirely different directory. Running the application from the app didn&#39;t seem to make a difference.</p>

							<div><p>As an extremely temporary fix, I can provide the full path of the file for it to perform normally while I test other systems. But this is a fruitless fix since jimmy rigging the project with absolute paths mean absolutely nothing when it comes down to exporting the project for release.</p>
