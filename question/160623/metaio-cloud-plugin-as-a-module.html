			<h1>Metaio &#34;Cloud Plugin&#34; as a module?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Ti SDK 3.1.3<br>Platform: iOS</p>
<p>My understanding of module development is limited. To be honest, it is over my head. But I have successfully created apps with titanium, and I would love for my next one to utilize Metaio AR technology. I realize that setting this up so that I could utilize all the &quot;extras&quot; of the Metaio SDK would be extremely difficult&#x2F;impossible - but Metaio offers a &quot;cloud plugin&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.metaio.com&#x2F;cloud-plugin&#x2F;">Metaio Cloud Plugin</a> that I suspect could be turned into a module.</p>
<p>Right now, I can export a cloud plugin app from Metaio Creator to xcode, and all it does is show the AR viewer - which accesses content uploaded to the Metaio cloud. I would love to be able to put this in a tab of a titanium app, then be able to build the rest of the app the only way I know how, with Titanium!</p>
<p>I know appcelerator has module development documentation, but I am completely lost in the regard of turning the default auto-generated cloud plugin xcode project into something I can use in titanium.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any suggestions, tips, existing Metaio modules, tutorials, etc that would get me headed in the right direction to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>PS - I am aware there is a wikitude AR module. My company has already decided on Metaio for AR needs. It would be a great benefit to us to not pay an outside developer for each app that would utilize the tech.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m afraid that you will need to sharpen your native iOS skills a lot more before considering developing a native Titanium extension module. Developing modules requires <strong>deep knowledge</strong> of both the underlying platform as well as how the titanium Framework works under the hood.</p>
