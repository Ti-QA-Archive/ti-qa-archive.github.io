							<p>Hi<br>Loveea this is second time you are posting the spam to this site.If we have enough money to tour china we would be not doing the hard work of writing tons of JavaScript and mobile apps so stop this nonsense to detrack the people if u want to get advertised your tour i am 100% sure you would find many other sites than this non technical forum and if we would requiring your guidance we would be contacting you through Devlink</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>Actually christian the thing is that suppose if this question gets 100 views he had wasted the 100 minutes of professional time and 4-5 answers which could be done in this time was wasted because of this man only, i think it as ok to send it as email but doing such  a nonsense on the technical forum is not good at all</p>
