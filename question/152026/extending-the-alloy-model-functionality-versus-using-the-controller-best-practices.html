			<h1>Extending the Alloy Model Functionality versus using the Controller Best Practices</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a quick Alloy framework question for everyone.  I saw in a few of the examples on GIT (in particular the login example within the Models), that there are references to placing functionality such as login&#x2F;logout&#x2F;authentication, etc within the model itself, rather than within the controller, and simply calling the model&#39;s functionality from the controller.  I am curious if this is simply an Alloy best practice?  I have come from the WPF (MVVM), and ExtJS (MVC) world, where the model literally only was a POJO like model, which contained the column definitions, but no functionality (other than basic converters and the like), and the controllers or View Models handled tying the Views to the Models, or issuing network calls.  I noticed in the examples, the author mentions making network calls directly from the models, which is counter intuitive to my thinking on MVVM&#x2F;MVC.</p>
<p>Is this an Alloy best practice?  Just curious. Also, is there any performance implication here with this approach?  Curious for everyone&#39;s thoughts&#x2F;experience.</p>
<p>Hope all are welll<br>Chris</p>

							<p>Chris, good question. I think Alloy imposes the minimum in terms of restrictions to the MVC paradigm, which is why you find yourself asking this question. I would say the controller code vs. model code depends on the usage of the functionality. The &quot;login&quot; case is a good example it has certain functionality that needs to be available to all controllers (the logout) so it makes sense to have it in a centralized location. Whether this makes sense as a commonjs module of its own or putting it in the associated model I leave for the developer to decide. There should be no performance impact one way or the other.</p>
<p>I think the models will be used more widely than you are accustomed to due to a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The models themselves already carry a lot of functionality when employing sync adapters. Depending on the adapter this could be network calls, SQLite, etc… </li>
<li>Backbone.js, the core of Alloy models, lends itself to simple extension just like any other JS object. IMHO, it seemed capricious to me to arbitrarily limit that functionality. As stated before, we leave the decision up to the developer as it best fits their development.</li>
<li>Playing off what was just said, Alloy models are extremely malleable, allowing you to have them be as heavy or light as you want. </li>
</ul>
<p>I guess this is my long-winded way of saying that it depends on the case. But rest assured, there should be no performance concerns that depend on whether your logic is part of the controller or the model. Obviously if your model&#39;s behavior is specific to a controller, the controller makes the most sense as the home of the logic. But if the behavior spans multiple controllers, you may need to assess whether it makes more sense to include that functionality in the extension of the model itself.</p>

										<p><p>Definitely makes sense.  I did want to make sure there were no performance implications when I saw the various use cases with model functionality first and foremost, but it is nice that I have the flexibility in models (such as a User model in the case of the login example of the GIT project) to provide universal login&#x2F;logout functionality in one central location, available to all controllers.  Depending on style, I could move that core functionality probably to a CommonJS library as well, so now it just depends on what makes more sense.</p>
<p>Thank you as always.</p>
<p>Talk soon<br>Chris</p>
