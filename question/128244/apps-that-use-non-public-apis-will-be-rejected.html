			<h1>Apps that use non-public APIs will be rejected</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>App rejected on the following basis….. any ideas?</p>
<p>Nov 11, 2011 02:38 PM. From Apple.</p>
<p>2.5</p>
<p>We found that your app uses one or more non-public APIs, which is not in compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines. The use of non-public APIs is not permissible because it can lead to a poor user experience should these APIs change.</p>
<p>We found the following non-public API&#x2F;s in your app:</p>
<p>layout</p>
<p>If you have defined methods in your source code with the same names as the above-mentioned APIs, we suggest altering your method names so that they no longer collide with Apple&#39;s private APIs to avoid your application being flagged in future submissions.</p>
<p>Additionally, one or more of the above-mentioned APIs may reside in a static library included with your application. If you do not have access to the library&#39;s source, you may be able to search the compiled binary using &quot;strings&quot; or &quot;otool&quot; command line tools. The &quot;strings&quot; tool can output a list of the methods that the library calls and &quot;otool -ov&quot; will output the Objective-C class structures and their defined methods. These techniques can help you narrow down where the problematic code resides.</p>
<p>We appreciate that you may have made the precautions in your code for using non-public APIs, however, there is no way to fully accommodate the unknown. It is for this reason, that we do not permit the use of non-public APIs in App Store apps.</p>
<p>If there are no alternatives for providing the functionality your app requires, we encourage you to file an enhancement request. Or, try working with the Apple Developer Technical Support team to explore alternative solutions.</p>
<p>On occasion, there may be apps on the App Store that don&#39;t appear to be in compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines. We work hard to ensure that the apps on the App Store are in compliance and we try to identify any apps currently on the App Store that may not be. It takes time to identify these occurrences but another app being out of compliance is not a reason for your app to be.</p>
<p>For discrete code-level questions, you may wish to consult with Apple Developer Technical Support. Please be sure to include any symbolicated crash logs, screenshots, or steps to reproduce the issues when you submit your request. For information on how to symbolicate and read a crash log, please see Tech Note TN2151 Understanding and Analyzing iPhone OS Application Crash Reports.</p>
<p>To appeal this review, please submit a request to the App Review Board.</p>
