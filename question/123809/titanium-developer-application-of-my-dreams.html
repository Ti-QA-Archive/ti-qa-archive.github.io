			<h1>Titanium Developer application of my dreams</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>At a personal level, I hate both Titanium Developer and Titanium Studio, they contain limitations that are just really annoying and out of the &quot;Mac experience&quot;</p>
<p>I would like to &quot;freelance&quot; the development of this app (and then open source it)</p>
<p>The app will look like this (but with a badass design that I can provide)</p>
<p><img src="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;f.cl.ly&#x2F;items&#x2F;0G26050a3J1i3U1M2910&#x2F;01.png &quot;Screen 1&quot;" alt="Screen 1"></p>
<p>(this window should be a lot smaller) All you need to do is drop your folder project in there and the app window will change to something like this</p>
<p><img src="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;f.cl.ly&#x2F;items&#x2F;3x1W2k2C303V3N0g3H1c&#x2F;02.png &quot;Screen 2&quot;" alt="Screen 2"></p>
<p>That is all (like the app AppZapper or something like that) I assume another button will be needed for build to device or a clever way to keep this &quot;sexy&quot;</p>
<p>Any Desktop developers up for it? Quotes? I would love to see this come true</p>

							<p>Not sure what you mean by out of &#39;Mac experience&#39; (or why that is particularly important) but… this will quickly turn into Titanium Developer or something similar. There are certain things you will just have to do like setting up provisioning and distribution profiles, select Titanium &#x2F; Target OS SDK versions, configuring your tiapp.xml file etc. Then when you get further you will decide you need to see the console output from your app or debug etc. This is a big can of worms to recreate existing tooling with a slightly flasher UI.</p>
<p>So I guess I&#39;m curious as to what limitations Studio and Developer have that would draw you to creating an even more limited way of interacting with Titanium?</p>
<p>(and if you really are keen, then Titanium Developer is available from github, easiest way would be to grab that and hack on it rather than start from scratch).</p>

										<p><p>User Experience is everything in an application. But yes, that approach may lack some features of course, but that&#39;s why the &quot;full stack&quot; solutions are there for… I watched TiDeveloper include an IDE now (which is fine for a lot of people, and hard work for the creator) but totally &quot;bloated&quot; for everyone that has and love their own IDE)</p>
<p>The design has flaws of course, like proper &quot;console&quot; (which I guess can be fixed with the Terminal, and I assume options should arise when you click on distribute so you can sign the app.</p>
<p>I like your idea about stripping TiDev, that sure is the easiest approach.</p>

										<p><p>User experience is everything but it is not only based on UI but functionality as well, a beautiful platform conforming UI is nothing if it doesn&#39;t have the needed functionality. </p>
<p>FWIW I am on OS X and use TextMate for most of my Titanium coding, Studio is really only used as a debugger and for making small changes as I come across them.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not trying to discourage you (well maybe a little bit;) but I think a much nicer approach here would be to build plugins against your favorite IDE, not very much is needed for doing a lot of day to day things where you do not need a debugger; build, run, deploy, publish macros calling through to the titanium python build scripts would get you most of the way there with some fanciness to hook console output. For things you need to do rarely (modify tiapp.xml for example or setup profiles) or the complex stuff like debugging I&#39;d just leave that to Studio &#x2F; Developer.<br>And if you want to add some of that then building a standalone application that can be launched by a macro from your favorite IDE would be another approach, thinking just a simple tool that lets you modify profiles and app settings that takes a command line param to the project and another to show the appropriate dialog. Keeps it lean and mean and bindable to a key into any IDE that lets you launch an external executable.</p>
<p>I would just be wary of a can of worms here, things that start off simple like running a few scripts rarely stay that way and as it gains the features to become a potential replacement it could turn into a large project in its own right.</p>
