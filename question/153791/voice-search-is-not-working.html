							<div><p>Hello Arun, </p>
<p>for this kind of stuff, I&#39;m quite sure you will need an actual device. If you try to emulate this, you are playing with greater number of variables like if your OS has the micro properly configured, the input level, etc. </p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro </p>
<p>Ps. If you insist into using the emulator, open the record sound app in your emulator (or install one) and try to use it, to see if your mic and everything is working properly.</p>

							<p>Hi Arun,<br>           use avd manager and enable the microphone for your emulator device, make sure you have turned on your emulator and system microphone properly.</p>
<p>this is the only way to go, if there is some issue either in your emulator configuration or system the you have to use device.</p>
