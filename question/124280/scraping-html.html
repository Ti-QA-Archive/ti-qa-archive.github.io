			<p>I could not be any more brand-spanking new to Titanium, so even finding the right search terms is a chore, but I need to prototype a means of loading external content into a mobile app. Lots of random poking around has yielded the <code>url</code> configuration property of the <code>createWebView()</code> method, but there&#39;s a twist (didn&#39;t you know there would be?). Now I need to extract only a particular DOM node (the <code>div</code> with an <code>id</code> value of <code>content</code>) and display only that content.</p>
<p>As best I can tell, it looks like the Kitchen Sink app&#39;s &quot;XHR to Filesystem&quot; demo looks like the right way to go, but I don&#39;t want to spin my wheels. Can anyone confirm whether I&#39;m on the right track? If so, what&#39;s the best way to extract the DOM portion since Titanium isn&#39;t really DOM-centric from what I&#39;ve read.</p>
<p>I&#39;d appreciate any advice.</p>

							<p>You probably be better off creating a dedicated server based webservice to scrape the content you need, then spit that back at the app in a pre-formatted JSON data file, for example.  </p>
<p>I&#39;m not saying it can&#39;t be done entirely with JS and the DOM object, but you&#39;ll be trying to do a lot on the device. Also you need to provide a LOT fo &#39;fuzzy logic&#39; to deal with bad&#x2F;poor html etc.  It gets very messy very quickly.</p>

										<p><p>Yeah, I&#39;m not real happy about this, but I&#39;ve been overruled. I&#39;ve never been a fan of scraping on any devices because of the fragility of the approach, but it seems like this is just something I&#39;m going to have to deal with.</p>
