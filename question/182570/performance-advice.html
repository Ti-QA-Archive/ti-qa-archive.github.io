			<p>Hi all, I want to build a powerful titanium app. Please answer for my simple questions and give me any advice to build my app without a plenty of problems in further development.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Which way is better (I mean not easier but better in performance and maintain): to build my app based on webview or on native components (windows, buttons,fields etc. )</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do I have to use Alloy, could you advice me additional libraries which will help in development</p>
</li>
<li><p>I read about alloy models, does anybody know how much data I can store there without any problems with memory or a lot of crashes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please, keep in mind that I have about 5 hundreds of objects with more than 10 properties in it. I have to be sure that I won&#39;t meet  a lot of problems with memory and crashes. </p>
<p>Please, help me in lucky building of my powerful app :)<br>Thanks a lot, for your advice.</p>

							<p>Hi Victor,</p>
<p>This is Narendra here. I am a titanium certified developer and using titanium since past few years. Please find below answer&#39;s to your questions,</p>
<ol>
<li>Which way is better (I mean not easier but better in performance and maintain): to build my app based on webview or on native components (windows, buttons,fields etc. )</li>
</ol>
<p>Ans - Webview is heavy so I would suggest using native controls is better way to create app. However sometimes to display web content you need use webview, but try to minimise the use of webview.</p>
<ol>
<li>Do I have to use Alloy, could you advice me additional libraries which will help in development</li>
</ol>
<p>Ans - Yes. I would suggest to use alloy since its appcelerator official MVC framework which helps to keep your codebase clean and clear. Also it has in build support for Underscore.js (Javascript utility), Backbone.js (Models are based on Backbon.js), Moment.js (DateTime library), There are lot of widgets made in alloy are available on <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitt.io&#x2F;">gitTio</a>. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;alloylove.com&#x2F;#">Here</a> is link for one of the place where you can find alloy widgets.</p>
<ol>
<li>I read about alloy models, does anybody know how much data I can store there without any problems with memory or a lot of crashes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ans - You can save enough data using alloy model since all model data is stored on sqllite if you are using sql adapter. You can easily save 500 objets with 10 properties each. There is no hassel.</p>
<p>Hope this clears your doubt.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Narendra Raorane.</p>

<p>To answer your question, Nope if you are storing your content in alloy model(database) your app will not be laggy.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
