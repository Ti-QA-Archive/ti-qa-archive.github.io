			<h1>Distribute app in Titanium Studio</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m having a strange issue. I can&#39;t seem to get my app to upload to the iOS AppStore.</p>
<p>It builds in Titanium fine…it even Validates in Xcode. But when I try to upload the file, it SEEMS like it can&#39;t find the file and gives me an error stating the &quot;An error has occurred during Upload&quot;…but it doesn&#39;t say what that error is.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried at least 10 times over the last 3 days, but always the same result. It passes Validation, but fails upload.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think there is anything wrong with my connection…and I&#39;m not behind a firewall. Anyone have a suggestions? I don&#39;t even know what else to try. </p>
<p>My app is built using iOS SDK 5.1 and Titanium 2.0.1GA2.</p>

							<p>Dont use the studio to submit to Apple.  Use xcode.  Just do an Archive, and submit it form the Organizer.</p>

										<p><p>Not sure what you mean by &quot;Just do a Archive&quot;…can you be specific?</p>
<p>I&#39;m using Titanium Studio to &quot;Publish&quot;…it then creates a file named &quot;AppTerrier_19-27-43.xcarchive&quot;.</p>
<p>Xcode the opens up and I click on the Organizer button.</p>
<p>One there it shows two buttons &quot;Validate&quot; and &quot;Distribute&quot;. I then Validate the app…and it works fine.<br>Once I click &quot;Distribute&quot;…everything goes good, until it tries the upload…thats where I&#39;m having this issue.</p>
<p>It always give me an error &quot;There was an error while uploading your file&quot;, THEN it changes the &quot;status&quot; of my app to Failed Validation.</p>

										<p><p>Just wanted to give an update on this issue, in case someone has it as well.</p>
<p>It looks like my version of Java installed on my Mac was the issue. The uploader must be dependent on Java.</p>
