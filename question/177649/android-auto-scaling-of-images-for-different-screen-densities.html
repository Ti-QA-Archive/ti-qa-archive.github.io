		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I created two image views like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">Ti</span><span class="hljs-class">.UI</span><span class="hljs-class">.createImageView</span>(<span class="hljs-rules">{
    <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">width</span>:<span class="hljs-value"> Ti.UI.SIZE, height: Ti.UI.SIZE,
    image: <span class="hljs-string">'/images/green.png'</span>
</span></span></span>});
<span class="hljs-tag">Ti</span><span class="hljs-class">.UI</span><span class="hljs-class">.createImageView</span>(<span class="hljs-rules">{
    <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">width</span>:<span class="hljs-value"> Ti.UI.SIZE, height: Ti.UI.SIZE,
    image: <span class="hljs-string">'/images/blue.png'</span>
</span></span></span>});
</code></pre><p>and put the file green.png into the android&#x2F;images&#x2F;res-hdpi directory, and the file blue.png into the android&#x2F;images&#x2F;res-mdpi directory. The two image files are identical in size, 100x200 pixels.</p>
<p>I&#39;d expect these two image views to have different sizes when displayed, because the two images should be scaled differently by the auto-scaling mechanism in Android. For example, if I run the app on an MDPI-class device, the file(s) in res-mdpi should remain unscaled while the file(s) in res-hdpi should be scaled down. Similarly, if I run the app on an HDPI-class devices, the file(s) in res-hdpi should remain unscaled while the file(s) in res-mdpi should be scaled up. This is exactly what happens if I create an equivalent native Android app.</p>
<p>The Titanium app, however, shows both of these images at their original, unscaled size.</p>
<p>Does anyone know why this is happening?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Zsombor</p>

							<p>I think you might have a misconception as to what Ti.UI.SIZE does. This will show the image using the SIZE of the image. It will not scale, it simply creates an ImageView with the image 100x200.</p>
<p>If you want different sizes, then you must provide the images pre-scaled to the size you want in the directory for each resolution.</p>
<p>If you DON&#39;T want to do that, then you could use percentage (ie. a percentage of the screen size) to have it scale, or you could calculate the size you want based on the density that Titanium returns.</p>
<p>Malcolm Hollingsworth has answered quite a few similar questions over time. Check out his <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;153558&#x2F;where--how-to-use-images--icons-density-specific-in-android">VERY COMPLETE ANSWERS HERE</a></p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the pointers, I&#39;ll look through them. However, to clarify, I do not expect Ti.UI.SIZE to do the scaling. Android does the scaling, at least in native apps.</p>
<p>This: &quot;If you want different sizes, then you must provide the images pre-scaled to the size you want in the directory for each resolution.&quot; is simply not true. In native apps, the image is auto-scaled if it&#39;s not found in the directory that corresponds to the current device&#39;s screen density.</p>

<p>I found a paragraph in one of Malcolm&#39;s answers that you pointed to, which may indicate that this is a setting that can be turned on or off in Titanium apps. He writes &quot;In order to get the Android auto sizing images to work, edit your tiapp.xml to include this code block. &quot; and then provides a manifest block. I tried that and it did not work, but I find it encouraging that at least some point this was assumed to be working (assuming Malcolm is referring to the same feature…).</p>

										<p><p>As I was politely invited into this question by a new stalker (Hi Zsombor) and I first misread your name as Zombie, plus Ray is cool I will take a look.  Let me read all this and I will comment again in a short while.</p>
<p>BTW just for clarity, Titanium apps are native, they achieve this using a bridge between our code and the native apis mapping things in real time.  I mention this as I do not want anyone jumping in and shouting opinions on this.  Phone gap is not native as their apps use a native wrapper but all other content is HTML5.  Both have advantages and disadvantages - before I get grief from lovers and haters.</p>

										<p><p>Sorry Zsombor, I didn&#39;t mean for my answer to sound flippant. Just pointing out that it is NOT the same thing as a native app, so you can&#39;t necessarily compare them apples to apples.</p>
<p>The anydensity has been there for a long time. The issue is that, though it does not a bad job at adjusting density, there are other problems with it, especially when you start dealing with different resolutions. I have had it come back and bite me a few times, requiring that I redo many things. The best practice I have found is to deal, when required, with specific density assets. I would recommend that you try both approaches and see which works for you.</p>

										<p><p>Ray, no worries, I appreciate your input.</p>
<p>I did try anyDensity=false a while back, in a desperate effort to make life easier with Titanium apps on Android, but it didn&#39;t help much. Now I am firmly in the anyDensity=true camp, since that is the setting Google recommends and I don&#39;t see a reason to change it.</p>
<p>To clarify the impact of anyDensity=true on this issue (the Android documentation is a bit ambiguous on this, it says anyDensity=true indicates that &quot;the application includes resources to accommodate any screen density&quot;), it doesn&#39;t turn off auto-scaling (in native apps).</p>

<p>Some things to note;</p>
<ul>
<li>The referenced answer and one more are often used as guides i the Q&amp;A</li>
<li>They were meant as answers and for the specific questions at the time - so they are not &quot;a one answers fits all solution&quot;</li>
<li>That answer was written over a year ago and the other over two - things have changed</li>
<li>Good news, most stayed the same</li>
<li>Your use of the phrases &quot;scaled up&quot; and &quot;scaled down&quot; do not match with what I think your are saying</li>
</ul>
<p>So if we talk about what should happen if you want to support Android with the correct imagery for your app then this is what you do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use your 100x200 example dimensions and consider these 100%</li>
<li>We are going to ignore ldpi as this is now rare</li>
<li>Create image.png 100x200 and write mdpi on it, store this in the mdpi folder (100%)</li>
<li>Create image.png 150x300 and write hdpi on it, store this in the hdpi folder (150%)</li>
<li>Create image.png 200x400 and write xhdpi on it, store this in the xhdpi folder (200%)</li>
<li>Create image.png 300x600 and write xxhdpi on it, store this in the xxhdpi folder (300%)</li>
<li>Create a new default app and add a single ImageView and reference &#39;&#x2F;images&#x2F;image.png&#39;</li>
<li>Set width and height to Ti.UI.SIZE as you did previously</li>
<li>Add the following line of code to either; <strong>index.js</strong> or <strong>app.js</strong> (non-alloy)</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-attribute">Ti.API.info('Ti.Platform.displayCaps.density</span>: <span class="hljs-string">' + Ti.Platform.displayCaps.density);</span>
</code></pre><p>Run the app, do you see the correct image with the correct console entry matching the size yuo expected?</p>
<p>This is my usual screens section of my android apps inside the tiapp.xml android section;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">supports-screens</span>
    <span class="hljs-attribute">android:anyDensity</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"true"</span>
    <span class="hljs-attribute">android:largeScreens</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"true"</span>
    <span class="hljs-attribute">android:normalScreens</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"true"</span>
    <span class="hljs-attribute">android:smallScreens</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"false"</span>
/&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>I always set the system unit as dp, noted in the other answers;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">property</span> <span class="hljs-property">name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"ti.ui.defaultunit"</span> type=<span class="hljs-string">"string"</span>&gt;dp&lt;/<span class="hljs-keyword">property</span>&gt;
</code></pre><p>You should get the expected image on the screen with a matching entry in the console.</p>
<p>These are where your images should be located.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// Titanium app without the Alloy Framework</span>
{appname}<span class="hljs-regexp">/resources/</span>android<span class="hljs-regexp">/images/</span>res-mdpi/image.png

{appname}<span class="hljs-regexp">/resources/</span>android<span class="hljs-regexp">/images/</span>res-xxhdpi/image.png

<span class="hljs-comment">// Titanium app WITH the Alloy Framework</span>

{appname}<span class="hljs-regexp">/app/</span>assets<span class="hljs-regexp">/android/</span>images<span class="hljs-regexp">/res-xxhdpi/</span>image.png
</code></pre><p>In this case the images are not scaled - language may have not been clear in the much earlier answers.  So I will try and clear it up in a quick way.</p>
<ul>
<li>Assume we are only talking about the width of a device</li>
<li>The following example variations occur in all densities </li>
<li>MDPI width would be 320 pixels 320 dp (100%)</li>
<li>HDPI width would be 480 pixels 320 dp (150%)</li>
<li>XHDPI width would be 640 pixels 320 dp (200%)</li>
<li>XHDPI width would be 768 pixels 384 dp (200%)</li>
<li>The last two are different actual width but the same densities.</li>
<li>The second xxhdpi display in this case would be 64 dp (128 pixels) wider than the first one</li>
<li>Your image will remain 200x400 for both xhdpi examples, your ui however will be able to use the extra space</li>
<li>You should not expect the device to scale the width of these two to match each other</li>
</ul>
<p>Some time ago there was an option to allow all devices to stretch all images and use one set of density images.  This was a poor man&#39;s solution, and not a great one for the user.</p>
<p>Keep in mind Android devices do not always report back what they should be, most do these days - but earlier ones grabbed parts from all over and did not perform the due diligence required to correctly handle what they should declare.</p>
<p>I started this off with the intention of a couple of paragraphs.</p>

										<p><p>Wow, I appreciate the effort you put into this comment…</p>
<p>&gt; if we talk about what should happen if you want to support Android with the correct imagery</p>
<p>Not exactly… I understand that if I have different images for different screen densities and put them into their designated directories as you laid out, then an MDPI-class device will use the image from the res-mdpi directory, the HDPI-class device will use the image from the res-hdpi directory, etc.</p>
<p>My question, to really simplify it, is: what happens if an MDPI-class device wants to load &quot;image.png&quot; and it turns out that res-mdpi&#x2F;image.png does <strong>not</strong> exist, but res-hdpi&#x2F;image.png <strong>does</strong> exist.</p>
<p>In my experience, the answer for Titanium apps is that the image from res-hdpi&#x2F;image.png will be loaded as if it was res-mdpi&#x2F;image.png, i.e. unchanged in dimensions.</p>
<p>In contrast, in a native Android app, res-hdpi&#x2F;image.png will be loaded <strong>but</strong> it will be scaled down.</p>
<p>You said my use of the phrases &quot;scaled up&quot; and &quot;scaled down&quot; do not match with what you think I am saying so I double-checked the above sentence. I am fairly certain I really mean &quot;scaled down.&quot; </p>
<p>Specifically, if res-hdpi&#x2F;image.png is 100x100 pixels, it will be loaded into an MDPI-class device as if it was 67x67 pixels (in native apps, that is).</p>
<p>I would be really curious about this:</p>
<p>&gt; Some time ago there was an option to allow all devices to stretch all images and use one set of density images.</p>
<p>because this sounds pretty much like the behavior I am looking for. Note that auto-scaling doesn&#39;t necessarily mean stretching – it can also mean that I only provide an image for the highest density screen and everyone will scale down. And yes, I understand that this is somewhat sub-optimal, but it&#39;s the default behavior in native apps, so if this option was purposefully removed from Titanium then I think it would merit some documentation that clarifies that this was intentional and why it was done.</p>

										<p><p>OK I get the actual question now (again - I think).  &quot;If I do not supply an image my app depends on in the density folder suitable for device it is running on - what happens?&quot;  &lt; Really did not get that previously.</p>
<p>Are you asking so you know what does or should happen or because you wish to take advantage of the situation?  By this I mean - are you hoping to provide only one density set of images and the app rely on those for all densities?</p>
<p>If so, then this goes beyond a visual disservice to the user, but also means running your app on older devices would be more likely to run out of memory much faster as it has to map a larger image into a smaller space so it needs all the original pixel data (not file size) into memory and also have the correct sized allocation for the window, view or whatever it is sat on.  As devices with mdpi are more commonly older, they are also less likely to have much memory.</p>
<p>Jason notes in his commentary that you should use numeric dp values - something each of my answers linked above also suggest.  Ti.UI.FILL and Ti.UI.SIZE have great uses (more than Jason is comfortable with) but they can solve lots of issues - but if you know the image size, enter the 100% dp numeric value and provide the correct density image.</p>
<p>So if your question is more to understand the question but you have no intention of using it then all the info so far will have explained the best case ideals as you have note.</p>
<p>If you are determined to press ahead and ONLY provide one resolution, I will do some tests and report back - but I have to be convinced you are doing this for a really good reason - as simply not wanting to provide the correctly scaled set of images is not a sufficient reason - again for the reasons noted above.  My time is very valuable and often called upon, so I rarely spend it trying to prove something that should not be done in the first place.  So if you can convince me why this is worth my time - I will make the time.</p>

										<p><p>Malcolm, you already put more effort into this than I ever expected, so you definitely don&#39;t need to do any testing for my sake.</p>
<p>Since you asked, here is some background on where I am coming from with this question… First, even though I have been developing mobile apps for more than 3 years, so far I have created exactly zero (0) image assets for mobile apps. Not because there are no image assets in the apps I work on, but because it&#39;s always somebody else&#39;s responsibility to create them. So it&#39;s not entirely up to me what assets go into the app.</p>
<p>Secondly, not every project starts out with &quot;let&#39;s make a perfect app for Android.&quot; Some start out with &quot;here is a pretty good iOS app, make it work on Android.&quot; In such cases there might be an expectation that the assets used for iOS should be good enough for Android.</p>
<p>Thirdly, in my experience, the quality of the image assets is irrelevant during most of the development process. On the other hand, the amount of space the image asset takes up on the screen is relevant from day one. This is not to say that the finished app shouldn&#39;t have appropriately sized assets for every density, but if auto-scaling worked, we could leave the creation of all these copies to the end, when everything else is finalized. (Admittedly, I could automate this, as Jason suggested, so maybe I&#39;ll do that.)</p>
<p>Finally, I don&#39;t own the apps I work on, so what is considered a problem worth solving (visual disservice, older devices potentially running out of memory, etc.) is ultimately not my decision. I can only make recommendations based on what is possible and what is considered best practice. In this sense this discussion served its purpose as I can now point to it if anyone wants to know why we absolutely must have 5 additional copies of every image asset if we want to make a Titanium app work on Android…</p>

<p>Malcolm is right on – set your default units to &#39;dp&#39; when you first set up a project.  I tried dealing with iOS in dp and android in px.  It wasn&#39;t worth the hassle, and Ti today seems to do a great job if you want to just treat everything as dp.  (Question for Appcelerator devs: why isn&#39;t this just a default setting in every new Titanium project?  Why should we even have to think about this for more than 30 seconds?)</p>
<p>Build your graphics appropriately for the various resolutions.  Write automation scripts using tools like ImageMAgick to convert high-resolution or vector graphics into 0.75x, 1.0x, 1.5x, 2.0x, and 3.0x versions for your ldpi, mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, and xxhdpi devices (not to mention the iOS devices, which correspond now to mdpi (non-retina), xhdpi (retina), and xxhdpi (iphone 6 plus)).</p>
<p>Don&#39;t rely on things like SIZE and FILL.  In 4 or 5 apps with hundreds of views, I&#39;d be surprised if I used those more than 3 times.  They really don&#39;t seem very necessary to me, and now that I read your post, I&#39;m glad I stayed away from them.  Set the width and height on your views explicitly, or give them gravity to the left, right, top, and bottom.  I think the use of these constants is where your example broke down.  If you had set your ImageView to 100x200, your images would have behaved as expected.</p>

										<p><p>Well, I appreciate your comment but this has nothing to do with what unit you use and whether or not you use SIZE and FILL. In particular, this: &quot;the use of these constants is where your example broke down. If you had set your ImageView to 100x200, your images would have behaved as expected.&quot; misses the point completely. The point of this exercise was to show the raw size of the image asset and I used the SIZE constant to allow the ImageView to reflect the raw size of the underlying image. The expectation was that the two images would be of <strong>different</strong> size (like in native apps) and the result was that they were the same size. As far as I can tell the example breaks down because the behavior of native apps is different than the (default?) behavior of Titanium apps.</p>
<p>I understand that you will never encounter this difference if you diligently provide all the image assets for all the screen densities but the difference is still there.</p>
