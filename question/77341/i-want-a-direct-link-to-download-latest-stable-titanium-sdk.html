			<h1>I want a direct link to download latest stable Titanium SDK?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a terrible connection in a remote area using a direct satellite link, and Titanium developer cannot complete the SDK download before the connection is dropped. Then it starts the download all over again, which is extremely slow (and expensive). Is there a link to download the latest stable SDK (as there is with the nightly builds) so I can use my download manager to resume when the connection fails?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<div><p>I have just downloaded Titanium developer and installed it. When i run it for the first time, it attempts to download the latest SDK, but because of my bad Internet connection, it is unable to complete the download, so I have to restart the developer application, at which point it attempts the SDK download again from the beginning and predictably, the connection drops and so it fails again and the cycle continues. I followed the &quot;Download SDK&quot; link on the main download page, but it is actually linked to &quot;Titanium developer.dmg&quot;. If I can have a direct link to the SDK instead of relying on Titanium to download it for me, then I can use the link in my download manager to resume the download. </p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I can assure you that the 1.4.X branch of android SDK on the CI builds site is the most stable at the moment.</p>
<p>I am not sure about iOS. Why not install it, so that you can at least start working with Titanium?  Note that you can easily change between versions once installed at a later time using the TiDev Edit screen for each app.</p>
<p>I will find out where the stable iOS SDK is, and let you know next week. </p>
<p>Cheers</p>
