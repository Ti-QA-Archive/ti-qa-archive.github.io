			<h1>Apple Support is So Slow ...</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m trying to package and submit an app for approval, but while creating my distribution provisioning profile, their website freezes. No error messages or indication that a problem exists, other than nothing happening at all. I&#39;m using Safari on a brand new mac mini, so no problems there.</p>
<p>Upon contacting Apple and their support people not being able to re-produce the problem they escalated to the &quot;senior team&quot;.  I&#39;ve been waiting for 2 weeks for a response from the &quot;senior team&quot;, but nothing. I call almost every day for an update, but am told: &quot;it&#39;s with the senior team and in the right hands. All we can do is wait…&quot;.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve requested status updates 3 times, but nothing.  Any recommendations on how to get this moving?</p>

										<p><p>No. I only have one mac. If I had another, I could create another certificate and use that when creating the profile.  Perhaps I should delete my certificate and create a new one.</p>
<p>These are things I should be discussing with Apple Support.</p>

										<p><p>You don&#39;t need a mac to generate a profile.  You just go to the website and choose the profile name, seed bundle, etc.  You just need a mac to install it once its generated.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks. I just used a Win 7 box and attempted to create the profile. The same thing happened - which is that the website just did nothing after I submitted.  At least I&#39;ve eliminated any browser issues. I guess I&#39;ll just have to wait for the &quot;senior team&quot; …</p>
