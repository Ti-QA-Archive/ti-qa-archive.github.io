			<p>Hi</p>
<p>I am trying to use Titanium Studio to be &quot;the choice&quot; of tool for the development I do for mobile devices.</p>
<p>Now, I have a customer that requires a mobileweb app as a frontend to their web application. The target is iPhone - and there is a requirement for being able to take a photo (or use one from the photo library). This is pretty simple in html5 using:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">&lt;input <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">type</span></span>=<span class="hljs-string">"file"</span>&gt;....
</code></pre><p>And perhaps a little more speific for pictures:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">&lt;input <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">type</span></span>=<span class="hljs-string">"file"</span> accept=<span class="hljs-string">"image/*"</span>&gt;....
</code></pre><p>How can I do this in a Titanium Studio mobileweb?</p>
<p>I have tried to create a new project using the &quot;html5&quot; template - it just doesn&#39;t run (and that seems to be a <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-17441">well-known problem</a>).</p>
<p>Then I have created an Alloy application - and that works. However, I have found no way to make the special html5 input control that I need.</p>
<p>Any ideas or pointers are very much appreciated :-)</p>
<p>&#x2F;John</p>

							<div><p>I have done some further experimentation…</p>
<p>If I add a webview to my Alloy page then put the input control on that - I can select a file&#x2F;picture. I guess I just need to communicate back to the real mobile web page what file was selected. I am trying to use the Ti.App.addEventListener&#x2F;.fireEvent as <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Communication_Between_WebViews_and_Titanium">described in the documentation</a> - but no success with the trigger yet - and still uncertain as to whether I can &quot;grap&quot; the file and upload it via Ajax from the &quot;real&quot; mobile web page.</p>

							<div><p>Ricardo Alcocer asked for a little more detail (via Twitter) so here is an example of what I want.</p>
<p>First, I have to say that this solution needs to work for employees where we know they all use iPhones. So no cross platform issues at all at this time.</p>
<p>If I create a simple web page on the server that has the following markup (some implementation details left out):</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">html</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">body</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">form</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">method</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"post"</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">action</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"..."</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">input</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">name</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"file"</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">value</span>=<span class="hljs-value">""</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">type</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"file"</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">accept</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"image/*"</span>&gt;</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">br</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">button</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">type</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"submit"</span>&gt;</span>Upload<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">button</span>&gt;</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">form</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">body</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">html</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>… then the file upload control will present the user with the choice of taking a picture or selecting one from the camera roll. Once selected, the user presses the submit button and the file gets uploaded to the server. Pretty simple, actually…</p>
<p>However, I would really like to use Titanium instead of server side html forms - perhaps pepped up with some jQuery, or using Sencha Touch (that I abandoned in favour of Titanium). I would expect a mobile web app in Titanium to also help me make an efficient web app (caching, local processing, minified Javascript, potentially offline support, etc.) - instead of having to deal with these myself ;-)</p>
<p>Hope this clarifies what I am trying to do?</p>
<p>&#x2F;John</p>

							<p>Hi John! Sorry for the delay, I&#39;ve been out on holiday.</p>
<p>One way to do this is to build a Mobile Web module. Unfortunately, there is no documentation and I don&#39;t have bandwidth to code you up a sample.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, create a Mobile Web module and only use a single .js file. Multiple JS files do not work right now (it is supposed to work, but there&#39;s a bug). Next I would copy Ti&#x2F;UI&#x2F;TextBox.js from the Mobile Web platform directory. You&#39;ll need to rework it so that the domNode is a &lt;form&gt; tag, then place an &lt;input&gt; tag inside it.</p>
<p>You will probably want to do some CSS tricks to make the field presentable. I&#39;m not sure about mobile browsers, but in desktop browsers, I recall placing the &lt;input&gt; on top of a button and setting its opacity to zero, so nobody sees the field part of the file input and they think they are clicking the button below, but they&#39;re actually clicking the non-visiable &quot;choose file&quot; button.</p>
<p>I have no clue how to invoke a custom module like this from Alloy, so this may not be the best method.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Chris</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy your holiday - and take a break from work ;-)</p>
<p>But thanks for chimming in here!</p>
<p>Ok, it seems a littel less forward than doing it the &quot;traditional&quot; way, unfortunately. I also have to take offline into account (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;179330&#x2F;mobileweb-app-and-offline">as per another question</a>). </p>
<p>So…. I am not sure Titanium is the right tool for that  - at the moment at least. Right now I merely need a proof of concept to ensure that we are selecting the right tools for the job - and handling this (offline and file uploads) are hard enough without having to &quot;go behind the scenes&quot; of Titanium to tweek it into doing what I want…. I wanted to use Titanium to give me an advantage over coding it by hand - but it does not seem to be like that - if I have understood the process right?</p>
<p>&#x2F;John</p>

										<p><p>Appreciate that. In HTML5, however, it really is not that bad - even doing it offline (using the File API) ;-)</p>
<p>… but I would have loved to only have to work with ONE development framework :-&#x2F;</p>
