			<h1>is location using Network faster than using GPS?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>If I develop an app in which the first thing i do is to pin the users position on a map, should I use the network to obtain faster response (as I understand GPS can take up to 40-50 seconds i think).<br>As I understand PROVIDER_NETWORK is the only solution when you are inside a building.</p>
<p>What is the usual response time when using PROVIDER_NETWORK compared to GPS. Can I make it even faster?</p>

							<p>Phones don&#39;t have real GPS. They have A-GPS which stands for Assisted GPS and the way it works is, your location and satellites&#39; locations are retrieved from the internet somehow then you are connected directly to the satellites. So in my opinion PROVIDER_NETWORK and GPS should be equally fast. Unless you have real GPS on your phone (some do but not the modern models), in that case PROVIDER_NETWORK should be faster. GPS is used mostly for long term connections not just to get a position.</p>

										<p><p>well I tried my iPhone 4 in a remote area with no cell phone signal at all. It got the address right, and quite fast (15 sec).</p>

										<p><p>Are you sure you were not connected to a satellite when you had cell signal and then it just kept the satellite connection? Also keep in mind that if you are in an open space, the GPS can be pretty fast. I assume you were in a field which makes sense.<br>I know that the iPhone has an A-GPS but I&#39;m not sure if it still works without a cellular signal. Apparently it does.<br>Bottom line, supposing that the GPS works without cell signal which you confirm, if you are in an open field the GPS is quite fast, on the other hand if you are inside a car or in urban areas it would be difficult for the GPS.</p>
<p><em>GPS works in very high frequency transmissions and the higher the frequency the clearer the path between the two points (phone - satellite) should be.</em></p>
