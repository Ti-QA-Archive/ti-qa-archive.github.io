							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Rich apple has a policy that the app which runs on IPhone should also be running IPAD.Here is what they state:</p>
<p> <strong>iPhone apps must also run on iPad without modification, at iPhone resolution, and at 2X iPhone 3GS resolution</strong></p>
<p>And you know apple is much restrict about its policy.So better to avoid this.</p>

										<p><p>This is a little confusing, so I hope this clears it up.</p>
<p>That clause only means that any app created for the iPhone only must not take measures to stop working on iPad.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with creating a iPhone only app, and iPad only app or a universal app (same code but internally determines what to put where when on the device).</p>
<p>When an iPhone only app is running on an iPad is simply runs as a &quot;emulated&quot; using the same resolution and dimensions that the would on the phone.  With no changes to present the app specifically for the iPad.</p>

										<p><p>Yes of course.<br>In One of my apps I targeted both iPhone and iPad. It was rejected because the app should send SMS and iPads do not send SMS. I didn&#39;t know that at the time :)<br>So I rebuilt it targeting iPhone only.</p>
