			<h1>Encryption base64</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi everybody,</p>
<p>I wanted to know if someone know of the encryption works using Titanium base64encore and decode functions. I tried to find some explanation about the topic but couldn&#39;t get any clear info whether it is secure, what is the key used to encode data and if we can manually specify the key.<br>I would welcome all information on this topic.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance.</p>

							<p>Base64 is NOT encryption in any sense of the word, other than a VERY weak &quot;security by obscurity&quot;.</p>
<p>Base64&#39;s sole purpose is to allow non-text data to get passed via a text based protocol such as SMTP.</p>
<p>There is no key, because it is not encryption.  It is just an alternate way to &quot;encode&quot; but not &quot;encrypt&quot; data.  See the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Base64">wiki</a> definition of base64.</p>

										<p><p>Commenting on the first answer then. It is a mobile project, the first device is the iPad, but if it was able to work for all of them it would be even better. I am looking for a secure way to encrypt data that I&#39;ll store in the DB.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for moving the comment back to here.  It will help rank future searches by other users.</p>
<p>To answer the question, there are a few ways you can encrypt data using javascript:</p>
<ul>
<li>Javascript implementation of <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.movable-type.co.uk&#x2F;scripts&#x2F;aes.html">AES</a></li>
<li>Block <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.movable-type.co.uk&#x2F;scripts&#x2F;tea-block.html">Tiny TEA</a></li>
<li>Code a module and encrypt using native algorithms instead of js</li>
</ul>
<p>One obvious caveat is when you encrypt a field you store in a db, that value becomes useless as an index field or ORDER BY clause.</p>
<p>However, if you can store your keys in clear text and just encrypt the values, the above may work for you.</p>
<p>Appcelerator does not currently support one of the implementations of SQLite which stores the entire DB encrypted, with full support for indexes and ORDER BY etc to work on encrypted columns.</p>

										<p><p>IF I understand correctly; I can use any of the technologies quoted above to encrypt one field of the DB and then, by leaving the others clear I can still have indexes and research in the DB.<br>What isn&#39;t developed is a way to encrypt index right ?</p>
<p>Don&#39;t think I would need it, I&#39;ll have something like:<br>Index - Content (crypted) - date</p>
<p>Thank you for all these answers, I should have everything to build what I need !</p>

										<p><p>Yes, that is correct.  Use AES or Tiny TEA to encrypt one or more field values that are sensitive.  You just can&#39;t use those as an index or an ORDER BY clause.  To use in a WHERE clause, you&#39;d have to encrypt the value to test and use that encrypted value in the WHERE clause.</p>

							<p>Hi Doug,<br>Thank you for the information !<br>Last question: if I want to encrypt my data, to store them in the SQLite DB for example, which way should I investigate ?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>This Q&amp;A works best if you do not &quot;answer&quot; your own questions, but instead &quot;comment&quot; on another answer to ask for more information.  That helps keep the continuity of a &quot;thread&quot; on related replies, plus it means you can mark an answer as best&#x2F;correct when you have the information you need.  That impacts how the Q&amp;A search engine performs ranking, which helps future search results.</p>
<p>That said, you need to tell us if you are doing a desktop or mobile project, and what platform(s) you wish to target.</p>
