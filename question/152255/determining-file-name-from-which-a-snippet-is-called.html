			<h1>Determining file name from which a snippet is called</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, so I can see that I can retrieve a files name, without path, by making a snippets expansion equal the string &quot;$TM_FILENAME&quot;. This is fine, but the result also inserts the file extension. Quite simply, I want to process the file name before inserting the result into the editor. In simple terms, lets say I have a script called &quot;AnObject.js&quot;. I want to retrieve the file name (&quot;AnObject.js&quot;) and remove the file extension, truncating it to &quot;AnObject&quot;. Thing is, while making the expansion equal &quot;$TM_FILENAME&quot; or &quot;${TM_FILENAME}&quot;, I cannot access the result before processing the string. What the hell am I doing wrong? How can I retrieve the file name of the script without interpolating the variable in the context of the scripts contents POST insertion? ENV[&#39;TM_FILENAME&#39;] ALWAYS returns a Nil class, regular expressions are apparently ignored and result in empty strings, and the documentation is not very clear as to how to go about this. I can see use of ENV in commands, but not snippet. If possible, please explain the situation, and if its of any help, you can refer to and add to <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;16460559&#x2F;finding-a-script-name-with-an-aptana-3-4-snippet">my stackoverflow question</a> if that clarifies anything. Thanks a million!</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Your problem appears not to be related to Appcelerator or Titanium, your stackoverflow link implies the problem is related to a specific need in Aptana.  You will need to seek assistance elsewhere as the Titanium SDK does not provide the scripting features you are seeking and as I say appear to be Aptana specific anyway.</p>

										<p><p>@malcom, thanks for getting back to me, but there does indeed to be a confusion about which vendor actually supports the code base for Aptana which Appcellerator repackages as Titanium Studio. I have most definitely wanted to ask this question on Aptana, but there does not appear to be any support link that is mangaged directly by Aptana. I you visit the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aptana.com&#x2F;support">Aptana support page</a>, it links to Titanium Studio which conveys that IDE issues are now the remit of Appcellerator support. Please confirm and thanks again.</p>

										<p><p>@David, Titanium Studio was formerly Aptana.  However it has now become Titanium Studio, Aptana Studio does still exist and does have separate support;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aptana.com&#x2F;support">Support</a></li>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aptana.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;aphelp">Browse Discussions</a></li>
</ul>
<p>However the documentation appears to go to an old Titanium set of pages.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before the problem appears to be Aptana related as the code syntax you provided was not JavaScript, which is why I suggest you might not get help here as this support is all about Titanium.</p>
<p>It is not that we do not want to help - but I would be surprised if anyone here was ever exposed to the problem problem you are experiencing.</p>

										<p><p>@Malcom, while I realise that Titanium API, as opposed to Titanium Studio support is the primary focus of this forum, under the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aptana.com&#x2F;support">Aptana 3 support page&#39;</a> :</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aptana.com&#x2F;support">Browse Discussions</a><br>consists of flagged questions on Stack Overflow and does not appear to be actively supported by anyone bar the general public, and cover seems low. If you visit the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;tags&#x2F;aptana&#x2F;info">Aptana info page</a> it clearly states that Aptana &quot;is a product of Appcelerator, Inc., and forms the core of Titanium Studio.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aptana.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;apdocs">View Documentation</a><br>links to outdated Titanium Studio API documentation</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aptana.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;apbugs">View Bug Tracker</a><br>links to Appcelerator JIRA, where an account has to be set up in order to, supposedly, JOIN the project as opposed to get SUPPORT from the project (please confirm).</p>
<p>If this is essentially a Ecmascript support forum, I understand, but it is the only forum I can find to raise a question about a potential defect in the IDE. Please direct me to an Appcelerator support team to solve this issue. Thanks in advance.</p>
