			<h1>Web Service with x.509 Certificate Authentication under iOS 8?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>We have an app that connects to a web service.  This connection is using https (SSL), and also uses client &amp; server certificates for authentication.</p>
<p>Under iOS 7, we used a cryptoLibrary module (SealSign CryptoLibrary, third-party) that managed this for us well.  No issues running under iOS 7.</p>
<p>Under iOS 8, however, we&#39;re having problems.  Specifically, the server certificate is only parsed correctly the first time a web service call is initiated.  Subsequent web service calls fail to parse the server certificate correctly.  The crypto library was supposedly updated for iOS 8, but the developers indicate that the issue is with iOS, specifically onLoad events not firing correctly.</p>
<p>Is anyone using secure web services with 509 certificates under iOS 8 successfully?  If so, how are you managing the certificates (i.e., module, etc.)?  There seems to be nothing within the Titanium SDK for this, which is extremely odd and disappointing.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.  We&#39;re in a huge time crunch on this.</p>
