			<h1>How to use the ACLs effectively?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am having a hard time figuring out how to use the ACS Cloud Access Control Lists (ACLs) effectively. Since I cannot query them or query other objects&#39; associated ACLs, I have to copy the &quot;acl_id&quot; to a custom field and filter search results that way. This seems to defeat the purpose of ACLs as I can just create my own UUIDs for this purpose. Maybe I am missing something or thinking about it wrong but here is the use case I am trying to solve:</p>
<ol>
<li>Users can &quot;friend&#x2F;follow&quot; a system generated&#x2F;controlled &quot;profile&quot;.</li>
<li>I am representing this profile as an ACL to create a sort of &quot;stream&quot; for that virtual profile since all content (Statues, Photos) will be created by other users on behalf of the system created profile.</li>
<li>I want the real user to be able to see a &quot;stream&#x2F;timeline&quot; of content associated with that ACL.</li>
<li>I cant seem to do that without copying the acl_id to a query-able field which seems to defeat the purpose.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any help about how to go about this would be awesome and I apologize if I am missing something simple since It seems to me this should be already possible. Thanks in advance!</p>

							<div><p>You can always get a list of your content and check if your user has access to it with Cloud.ACLs.checkUser. More info <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Cloud.ACLs">here</a>. </p>

							<div><p>Thanks for responding Mauro. The user would have access to the right content because they would have been added to the ACL already, the problem is filtering the content by ACL. I need to do a simple GET -&gt; Cloud.Statues -&gt; where MY_ACL in status.acls. But this just doesnt seem to be possible without grabbing ALL statuses…</p>
