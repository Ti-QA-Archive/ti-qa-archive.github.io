			<h1>Push Notifications not received (Android) if app is not running (SDK 3.3.0 only)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>For the Android version of our app, push notifications can only be received by the device if the app is open or if the app is running in the background. This seems like a breaking change since the 3.3.0 SDK release. If i back down the SDK and cloudpush to 3.2.x, notifications are received if the app is not running. No code has been changed. Is anyone else seeing this? Any advice? Thanks.</p>

							<div><p>It would be great if this was given a little more support, or at least looked at to what could be causing this issue.  I&#39;m also having this problem, only in Android however.  My iOS notifications work just fine, both when the app is open and when it is closed.  The Android app, however, must be open for it to receive the notification.</p>
