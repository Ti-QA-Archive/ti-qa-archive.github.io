			<h1>KitchenSink Record Audio does not work...</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>With the latest KitchenSink and Ti 3.1.0 GA I can not stop the audio recording. There are other posts which mention the same problem but no solution.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Best,<br>Tony</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Some things just do not work on the simulator and requires a physical device, but this one should work.</p>
<p>In the past the issue was related to a space in the url used to store the file.  I will try and put a test app together later on today.</p>

										<p><p>Having reviewed everything including old situations - the problem is a weird issue that &quot;should&quot; have been fixed some time ago but still has not.</p>
<p>So for right now - audio recording cannot be done on the simulator.</p>
