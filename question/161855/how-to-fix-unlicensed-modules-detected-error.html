			<h1>How to fix Unlicensed module(s) detected error?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m using Titanium 3.2.0.GA and deploying for iOS 7.</p>
<p>I added the module <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;7209?restoreSearch=true#!overview">Locale by Share Our Ideas</a> to my project, but after doing that and tried to install the app on device I got the following message:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">License violation detected. Unlicensed module(s) detected.  You must be <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> subscriber <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> use <span class="hljs-constant">one</span> <span class="hljs-operator">or</span> more <span class="hljs-operator">of</span> <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> modules included <span class="hljs-operator">with</span> this project.. Please contact Appcelerator Support.
</code></pre><p>From <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;126870&#x2F;unlicensed-modules-detected-on-plus-modules#264492">this question</a> I was able to solve this with the <em>uuidgen</em> command, but I have to run that command everytime I try to install on device.</p>
<p>Before using that command I checked if the <em>guid</em> I had in my tiapp.xml was the same as the one in my Appcelerator account and it was the same. The user that created the project did it with the same Appcelerator account.</p>
<p>How can I make sure this error doesn&#39;t happen anymore? It&#39;s weird since i have other projects with different modules and none give this problem.</p>

							<div><p>This doesn&#39;t solve my question, I want a way to stop running the <em>uuidgen</em> command and replacing the <em>guid</em> everytime I have to install to device, more importantly I don&#39;t know if this will affect somehow when I release it to production.</p>

							<div><p>no effect when you&#39;ll release it. If it runs fine on the device, it&#39;ll be ok once in the store.<br>Unfortunately I couldn&#39;t tell why that happens,  I usually fix it like you said above.</p>

							<div><p>That&#39;s my main problem, every time I try to deploy to device I get that message, so I have to run <em>uuidgen</em> and replace the guid in the tiapp.xml. Every time.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know what extra steps I have to take to fix this, maybe there&#39;s something else to be done? So far haven&#39;t found a solution to this.</p>

							<div><p>I downloaded the module from the computer I&#39;m currently using, so if I log in another computer and download the project from a repository to continue working, I won&#39;t be able to do it? That&#39;s extremely restrictive.</p>
<p>What about if I want to release the app to the market? Users won&#39;t be able to install it cuz of this?</p>

							<div><p>@David you&#39;re wrong. When it says for instance &quot;$20 PER SEATS&quot; that means that you can buy as many seats as you want and use the module on unlimited computers. Swapping computers do not affect the validity of the module. The module is connected to your login. So if you use different logins across computers, you&#39;ll get the error, otherwise you shouldn&#39;t.</p>

							<div><p>@Alberto Then in my case, what is causing this problem? Will this only happen while in development? what about production?</p>
