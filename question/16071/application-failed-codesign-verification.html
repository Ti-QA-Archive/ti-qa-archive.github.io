			<p>I&#39;m trying to update an app that is already approved and in the app store two weeks ago. Last week when the 4.0 SDK came out, I installed that and have been unable to send updates using either iTunes Connect or Application Loader since. I have redownloaded and selected the distribution certificates to now avail. Other people seem to be having this problem as well. I&#39;m using Titanium 1.2.1 and SDK 3.1 (should apps be built using the 3.2 final now?).<br>Does anyone have instructions to fix this or to completely uninstall Titanium and or the SDKs if that is the issue?</p>

							<p>I&#39;m pretty sure that they (Appcelerator) haven&#39;t updated the Titanium tools to deal with the 4.0 SDK yet. Though I did read that they about to add that.</p>
<p>Have you tried submitting with 3.1.2 or 3.1.3?</p>

							<p>Yes, I&#39;ve tried with 3.1 and 3.1.3, but I think this is a certificate issue. I really like a way to completely uninstall Titanium and all the certificates to know that I&#39;m starting fresh (other than an OS reinstall which I&#39;m thinking about).</p>

							<p>Got it working!! SDK 1.2 on iPhone 3.2</p>
<p>I went though the same distribution painful ordeal yesterday, like yours, removed then regenerated certificate and distribution profile and nothing worked.</p>
<p>This morning, i installed both Titanium &amp; Xcode on a different machine. Create new project, copy all the files and recompiled, create new package then generate new Cert from the new machine, (just distribution cert, not development) went though the lengthy steps and voila. It submitted though.</p>
<p>Couple things i should mention, i am using some user Apple Developer account to create the Apple&#39;s end cert and profile, but that didn&#39;t stop me from getting development part to work. It installed on device just fine. May be the Codesign failed on distribution level because of account validation choked? not sure. </p>
<p>The new machine is belonged to the owner of Apple developer account however, with his name and everything. That&#39;s the first thing. The 2nd reason could be xcode failed to assign correct profile (search on goggle mention tons of this problem) or Titanium was to blame? </p>
<p>So if all things failed, perhaps reinstall Xcode or Titanium could be your answer?</p>

							<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure I read that 4.0 is developer preview&#x2F;beta, so wouldn&#39;t expect it to deploy, even if everything else was working. There are probably FAQs around this in the Developer portal.</p>
<p>Apparently you can have iPhone SDKs 3 and 4 installed on one machine, but you&#39;ll need two separate installations in two separate folders - according to some posts in the Apple developer forum - may want to check there.</p>
<p>cheers,<br>Chris</p>
