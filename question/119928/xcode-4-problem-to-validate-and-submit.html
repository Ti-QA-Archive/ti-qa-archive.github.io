							<p>Even though this question was asked so long ago, as I ran into the issue and it has to deal with the last steps of deploying to the app store (a very frustrating point to have errors) I will share my answer.</p>
<p>While I don&#39;t know the exact cause of this issue, I did find a liveable work around.</p>
<p>Go to your Titanium SDK folder, typically located at:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-regexp">/Library/</span>Application Support<span class="hljs-regexp">/Titanum/m</span>obilesdk<span class="hljs-regexp">/osx/</span><span class="hljs-number">1</span>.x.x.<span class="hljs-regexp">/iphone/</span>
</code></pre><p>OR </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">~<span class="hljs-regexp">/Library/</span>Application Support<span class="hljs-regexp">/Titanum/m</span>obilesdk<span class="hljs-regexp">/osx/</span><span class="hljs-number">1</span>.x.x.<span class="hljs-regexp">/iphone/</span>
</code></pre><p>Then open the Info.plist file. I replaced the &quot;Bundle version&quot; and &quot;Bundle versions string, short&quot; with my current version number. Titanium was leaving this as 1.0 when compiling and that was causing the error.</p>
<p>It should be noted while in my case it was an issue compiling, this can also be caused by bad version numbers. The number has to be greater and XCode is very specific in how it parses this as separate integers divided by periods. If you accidentally were to add a space to your version number it could mess things up for you.</p>
