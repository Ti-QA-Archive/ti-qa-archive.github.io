			<h1>security of js source files after packaging and install</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>I was wondering to understand a very important after-packaging&#x2F;install on device point and it&#39;s related to the security of the js source files containing the logic of my app.<br>For instance, i have a js file in which are reported webservices authentication credential in clear and I was wondering to know if after the installation it would be possible for an attacker to retrieve the js source file and access my information.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Fabio.</p>

							<p>Well if your sending the login credentials in the clear a packet sniffer could snatch up your users information pretty quickly.</p>

							<p>I don&#39;t know if this would be helpful, but have you thought of maybe obfuscating  your js file?</p>

										<p><p>it&#39;d be an idea, but i would like to understand if it is necessary or not. I mean, if it is impossible to access the js source files after packaging or install it would not be necessary to obfuscate it.</p>

										<p><p>To my understanding, anyone with access to your apk zipped file, will be able to unzip it and take a look into your working code. But you could make their lives a bit difficult by obfuscating it. My knowledge is a bit limited on those matters. I wish you the best of luck.</p>

							<p>you&#39;re right but that part is sent by an https packet so it should be alright, the point is on the js file itself on the device.</p>

							<p>You can&#39;t store credentials in the app. For example in the case of android, the .apk file is just a zip file. Anyone can unzip it and see your app.</p>

<p>What you have to do is run some type of proxy to the webservice on a webserver that only you (and people you trust) have control over. Then in your mobile app, connect to your server instead of directly to the webservice that needs credentials.</p>
<p>Then you have to have some type of authentication between your proxy and your mobile app so not just anybody can use your proxy. Perhaps by username&#x2F;password, or giving the device&#x2F;user a client certificate.</p>
<p>It is impossible to store the credentials to the third party service on the device with 100% security.</p>

							<p>Here is what I would recommend:</p>
<ol>
<li>Send the username &#x2F; pass over https. </li>
<li>From the server respond with either false or a token value. </li>
<li>Store the token on the device, use the token value from there on to authenticate any action for all other web services. You could also set an expire time on the device &amp; server.</li>
</ol>
