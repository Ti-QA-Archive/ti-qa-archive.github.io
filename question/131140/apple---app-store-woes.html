			<p>Hey, I&#39;ve been spending a few hours on this and I get an email returned back from apple stating &#39;Invalid Binary.&#39;</p>
<p>I have removed all all of my certificates, and redownloaded them. Anyhow here is the issue;</p>
<p>`Dear Developer,</p>
<p>We have discovered one or more issues with your recent binary submission for &quot;Pocket Invoice&quot;. Before your app can be reviewed, the following issues must be corrected:</p>
<p>Invalid Code Signing Entitlements - The signature for your app bundle contains entitlement values that are not supported. For the com.apple.developer.ubiquity-container-identifiers entitlement, the first value in the array must consist of the prefix provided by Apple in the provisioning profile followed by a bundle identifier suffix. The bundle identifier must match the bundle identifier for one of your apps or another app that you are permitted to use as the iCloud container identifier.</p>
<p>Specifically, value &quot;6L4QD9M9FD.*&quot; for key &quot;com.apple.developer.ubiquity-container-identifiers&quot; in pocketInvoice is not supported.</p>
<p>Invalid Code Signing Entitlements - The signature for your app bundle contains entitlement values that are not supported.</p>
<p>Specifically, value &quot;6L4QD9M9FD.*&quot; for key &quot;com.apple.developer.ubiquity-kvstore-identifier&quot; in pocketInvoice is not supported.</p>
<p>Once these issues have been corrected, go to the Version Details page and click Ready to Upload Binary. Continue through the submission process until the app status is Waiting for Upload and then use Application Loader to upload the corrected binary.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>The iTunes Store Team`</p>
<p>I&#39;ve never encountered this problem before, so no idea what to do here. The app uploads fine with Xcode Organizer.</p>
<p>What do I do before I gauge my own eyes out?</p>
<p>Regards,<br>Dimitri</p>

							<p>Hey Mr. Dimitri. we have also faced the same problem before and I didn&#39;t check my email address as It was my first publish on iTunes I passed around 7 hours behind that and Finally I got the solution was pretty simple. </p>
<p>Hope It will work in your case too.</p>
