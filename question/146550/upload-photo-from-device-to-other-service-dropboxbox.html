			<h1>Upload photo from device to other service Dropbox/Box</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I am sorry if i pollute the forum with questions about photo uploads but i dont seem to find the answers on what i want to do.</p>
<p>So i am asking for another view to my problem.</p>
<p>What i like is to publish a photo from my app (Camera or Gallery) to a Facebook fanpage.</p>
<p>That seems to be impossible if not every user is admin over that page.</p>
<p>So i am thinking in other ways to do it.</p>
<p>There is a great website called  ifttt.com (If this than that) that allows you to create recipes for actions.</p>
<p>So i think that if i can upload a photo to Dropbox or Box or similar i can create a recipe for that.<br>(If a photo is uploaded to my dropbox than post it on my fanpage)</p>
<p>But when i am looking around for ways to do it it seems like you have to log in to a dropbox &#x2F; Box acount to upload files.</p>
<p>Is there anyway to upload a photo to my Dropbox &#x2F; Box account without prompting the user for log in info?<br>I just want to send the file to my account.</p>
<p>And if you have any other thoughts on how to do something similar just let me know.</p>
<p>Thanx.</p>

							<p>Hello Richard,</p>
<p>I&#39;m afraid that what you are trying to achieve is not (to the best of my knowledge) possible. And the reason behind that makes sense when you think of it. How is you application supposed to know which Dropbox account to upload to if you don&#39;t specify it anywhere? Therefore, your user will have to log-into the service (at least once, then you can always keep the pwd on the device)</p>

										<p><p>Of course. That make perfect sense when you put it like that.</p>
<p>But isnt there any way to make an automatic login?</p>
<p>I think it is so strange that you cant post a photo to a Facebook fanpage without being an admin of that page. when you can post anything on it when you&#39;re on FB but not through the API. </p>
<p>If you like to look at my other Q about posting to FB here is the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;146496&#x2F;post-upload-photo-to-fanpage-on-facebook-with-page-token">link</a></p>
