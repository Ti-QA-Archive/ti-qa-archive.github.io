			<h1>Missing Push Notification Entitlement after app submission</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>I need help regarding on this. I&#39;ve already submitted 5 versions of my app in the app store and all of them got this warning. </p>
<p>Missing Push Notification Entitlement - Your app appears to include API used to register with the Apple Push Notification service, but the app signature&#39;s entitlements do not include the &quot;aps-environment&quot; entitlement. If your app uses the Apple Push Notification service, make sure your App ID is enabled for Push Notification in the Provisioning Portal, and resubmit after signing your app with a Distribution provisioning profile that includes the &quot;aps-environment&quot; entitlement. See &quot;Provisioning and Development&quot; in the Local and Push Notification Programming Guide for more information. If your app does not use the Apple Push Notification service, no action is required. You may remove the API from future submissions to stop this warning. If you use a third-party framework, you may need to contact the developer for information on removing the API.</p>
<p>Below is the info of Titanium SDK that i&#39;m using.</p>
<p>Titanium SDK version: 3.5.1 GA<br>OS: OS X Yosemite<br>iOS SDK: 8.4<br>Xcode Version: 6.4</p>
<p>I&#39;m not using any Push notification services and I didn&#39;t enable it in my app. I&#39;m not sure why I&#39;m getting this.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also tried commenting out the didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken codes in the Titanium core but it didn&#39;t help.</p>
<p>Any help is very much appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks - Mark</p>
