			<h1>Android memory leak when exiting and relaunching the app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>When I first run the app after installation it is using 30MB. But every time I exit the app by using the device back button and then relaunch the app, the memory usage goes up by 10MB. So if I exit and relaunch the app 4 times, my app ends up using 40MB of extra memory - for a total usage of 70MB.</p>
<p>To test this, while the app is running, I go back to the Android menu by pressing the device menu button (not the back button) and then I force an exit from within the Task Manager. In this case, when I relaunch the app it is back to using only 30MB memory.</p>
<p>The method I&#39;m using to exit the app (when using the device back button) is like so:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var mainwindow = Ti.UI.createWindow({
    <span class="hljs-string">fullscreen :</span> <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>,
    <span class="hljs-string">navBarHidden :</span> <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>,
    <span class="hljs-string">exitOnClose :</span> <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
});
</code></pre><p>While the main window is active, I press the back button on the device which causes the window to close and thanks to the exitOnClose property, the app then &quot;exits&quot;. Except, it seems as if it doesn&#39;t actually exit properly, otherwise why would the memory usage keep going up every time I relaunch the app?</p>
<p>Does anyone have an idea what the difference is between the back button and forcing an exit from the device&#39;s Task Manager and why the app won&#39;t exit (or clean memory) properly when using the back button?</p>
<p>I&#39;m using Titanium Studio with all latest updates (including latest SDK updates).</p>

							<p>Turns out the Kitchen Sink app experiences exactly the same problem on my Android device … even though it is to a much lesser degree (only about 2.5MB per open&#x2F;close instead of the 10MB seen on my own app).</p>
<p>From what I can tell, this is a combination of the way JavaScript handles it&#39;s memory management (using the garbage collector) and the fact that Android doesn&#39;t actually kill the app&#39;s process when you press the back button on the device. So the next time the app is launched, JavaScript creates a whole new set of objects in memory (identical to the set created the previous time the app was launched) but because the app was never closed properly, the first set of objects are never released from memory.</p>
<p>Basically what it boils down to is this: developers have to do their own memory management. For more information on how to manage memory in JavaScript just google &quot;JavaScript memory management&quot;.</p>
