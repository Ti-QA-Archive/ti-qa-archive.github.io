			<p>How do we setup Titanium Studio to deploy to the iPhone 4?  We thought it would be as simple as creating a new run configuration, but that doesn&#39;t seem to be the case. We also aren&#39;t sure how the provisioning profiles are setup…(as related to Titanium Developer). Also, I believe I read that there are issues having a hyphen in the application ID.  Can anyone provide any insight on this?</p>

							<p>firstly if not already done so, you have to register as an apple developer.</p>
<p>You will then need to create your provisioning profile within the apple developer area and assign the devices you want to test on.</p>
<p>once you have the provisioning profile you download it and from within titanium studio you generate the app to iOS device, this will ask you to upload your provisioning licence, select the file you downloaded and it will add it to Xcode (if your using Xcode 4). I tend to add it to Xcode first which is simple dragging it into the Xcode icon with applications.</p>
<p>This will put your app into iTunes and allow you to sync it to your device.</p>
<p>this is also the same for developer, but it is easier in titanium studio.</p>
<p>Also not sure what os your on but it does need to be mac.</p>
<p>your appid needs to be something like com.yourcompanyurl.yourappname</p>
<p>do not include - or any other characters than alphanumeric and dots in the format as specified.</p>
<p>Hope this answers you question.</p>

							<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;10278960">here</a> is a good video tutorial how to do it. Some things might look a bit different now, but it&#39;s still the same process. I have used that video too.</p>
