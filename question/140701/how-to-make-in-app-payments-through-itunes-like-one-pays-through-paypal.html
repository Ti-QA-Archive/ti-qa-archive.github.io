							<p>Hi Anuj</p>
<p>The store kit module available in the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;794?705877745#overview">Marketplace</a> is what you need.  This will allow you to use the iOS in app purchasing that you are after.</p>
<p>Be aware that you cannot use PayPal to purchase things that can only be used inside your app - like upgrades.</p>

										<p><p>No problem, it is the terminology that is the confusion then.  I understand - I had similar issues.</p>
<p>The storekit allows your app users to buy things USING the iTunes App store payment system, not allowing your app users to buy other apps from within side your own app. </p>
<p>You need to go to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunesconnect.apple.com&#x2F;">itunesconnect.apple.com</a> and add an app that you will be using the storekit with.  You then tell it you are using &#39;In app Purchases&#39; and it will update the certificate - which you need to add back to your development computer.</p>
<p>Then you add into this interface things YOU want your app to sell, for example;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Upgrade to Pro</strong>, this is considered a &#39;non-consumable&#39; as the user gain extra functionality within the app that is not a single use purchase or a subscription payment.</li>
<li><strong>Coins or points</strong>, this is considered a &#39;consumable&#39; as the purchase is a single use and can be purchased many times by the same user.</li>
</ul>
<p>You get to name what the things are, you get to set the price.</p>
<p>The storekit module - lets you then list those things to your app users, they can buy them and then you release the extra functionality.</p>
<p>One note, make sure you include a button so that RESTORE - without this your app will be rejected.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the answer Malcolm, it&#39;s a great help. One more question, please don&#39;t mind..</p>
<p>How do we set the price ,as u mentioned in the comment : &quot;You get to name what the things are, you get to set the price.&quot;…??</p>
<p>I&#39;ve created a &quot;Upgrade to Pro( $ 9.99)&quot; button in upgrade window, on click of which the payment has to be made, and more functionality has to be added in the app…!!<br>Now, when a user click on that button, how will the amount be credited from the user&#39;s account to the owner of the app through storeKit..??   </p>
<p>I may seem little annoying,  sry…    :)</p>

										<p><p>Not a problem</p>
<p>You add the &#39;virtual products&#39; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunesconnect.apple.com&#x2F;">itunesconnect.apple.com</a>.</p>
<p>When you have added your app into your developer account (you are not submitting the yet) then the blue buttons on the top right of the app page include one about &#39;In App Purchases&#39;.</p>
<p>You add your products here, you will be asked for as many products as you want to include, give each one a descriptive name and a price tier - do not forget the price will change depending on the country it is purchased in - but they all roughly equal the same amount.</p>
<p>Now you can use the store kit, the three main funcitons are;</p>
<ul>
<li>List the products you added above, this will provide you with the TITLE you entered and the PRICE you entered based on the TIER suitable for the country YOUR or your TEST ACCOUNT is setup for.</li>
<li>Buy action, the user selecting an item from the list will be asked to agree to the purchase, if they do APPLE will charge them (nothing to do with Appcelerator or StoreKit) - remember StoreKit is simply a wrapper (a nice one) that simplifies the process only.</li>
<li>Restore action, if you have any <strong>Non-consumables</strong> (pro upgrades for example) the user MUST be able to restore them - this process is handled for you and simply returns back info to you to let you know they have PREVIOUSLY legitimately purchased, useful if they have changed device.</li>
</ul>
<p>A recommendation - fully use the very receipt function after any purchases - there is a resourceful Russian man who has managed to fake purchases - if you check the receipt (as we all should - but many do not) then you have no problems.</p>
<p>Once you are is live and you have thousands of users - many upgrade - then Apple will credit your bank account once a month provided the amount is greater than around $100 cumulative.</p>
<p>You have to have provided Apple with your bank details and they will verify them - BEFORE you can do any of the above.  It is easy - just seems hard.</p>
<p>Have fun.</p>
