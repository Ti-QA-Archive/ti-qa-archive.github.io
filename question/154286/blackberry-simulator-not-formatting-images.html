			<h1>BlackBerry Simulator not formatting images</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>So I&#39;m making a blackberry version of an alloy app I made for android and iphone earlier this year, I&#39;ve set up the blackberry simulator (as I don&#39;t own a BB10 device at this time) and ran my app as is. The problem I have run into is that all the images are at 0,0 the background image has not scaled to fit the screen and none of the buttons work (at the place they&#39;re suppose to be or at the place they are) I&#39;ve tried 3 different ways of positioning the images, and even set alerts to output their location (this outputs the correct location) but they are always at 0,0 I cannot find any help on this topic. What can I do to correct this issue? Where should I look for future help with Blackberry development.</p>

							<p>There was a bug in BB image view when doing scaling. We have fixed it in recent builda. By recent I believe the fix got in a couple weeks ago.</p>
