			<h1>Is it possible to trigger &#34;go back&#34; event for the parent window by a modal window (trying to implement modal &#34;sign in&#34; form)</h1>
		</header>

			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am trying to implement the following flow. There is an app with different tabs, links, buttons, etc.. Most of those windows are powered by data that is retrieved via HTTP. When I make an HTTP request, I can receive two general responses: &lt;requested data&gt; and &lt;not authenticated&gt;. When I receive &lt;not authenticated&gt;, I popup a modal:true window with sign in form. User can exit it into ways: sign in successfully in which case I close the window and re-submit HTTP request for the original window. Or user can hit &quot;cancel&quot; in which case modal window closes however user ends up on an empty original page (because we can&#39;t load data since user is not authenticated). Is there a way to imitate &quot;back&quot; behavior navigating user away from that page and bringing him back to the place he arrived from?</p>
<p>I think one of the ways of solving this is to have a list of windows that might require authentication and before loading them always ask server whether we are authenticated. In that case when we popup &quot;sign in&quot; window, we are still on the old page and don&#39;t need to navigate back. However I don&#39;t like this way because we essentially double the number of HTTP requests sent to server and also introduce a place for an unhandled failure in case server responds that we are authenticated but the actual HTTP request that follows, for some reason says that we are not authenticated.</p>

							<p>Hi Eugene</p>
<p>Tip: Bullet points help us and you when explaining step by steps.</p>
<p>You have two issues here as I see it so we will split them up.</p>
<p><strong>POP UP</strong></p>
<p><em>Scenario</em>:<br>Your user selects something that trigger another window to appear, the content on that window requires authentication - so you show a pop-up login window.</p>
<p>Note: It does not matter if the user selects a tableviewrow, label, button etc - just &#39;something&#39;</p>
<p>Q: Can the cancel action cause both the pop-up window and the window requiring login to close back the the original window the user pressed the &#39;something&#39;.<br>A: Do it a different way.</p>
<p>When the user presses the &#39;something&#39; - at this point show the pop-up login window, this way you only need to close one thing.  This is smoother for the user and easier for you. You CAN trigger both closes but not the smartest move.</p>
<p><strong>Authentication</strong></p>
<p><em>Scenario</em>:</p>
<p>You need to know if the user is authenticated before they can see certain content.</p>
<p>Q: How do I simplify the authentication requests<br>A: Have a global variable (ok) or a function in a CommonJS (better) file that calls the authentication function.  This function does ALL the window pop up, talks to the server and stores the success&#x2F;fail within the global or the CommonJS object.</p>
<p>Next time your user attempts to use a section requiring authentication, you call the same function, however the first part of the function checks the boolean state for true&#x2F;false based on last request.  If they were previously authorised let them back in.</p>
<p>Tip:  For extra security store the last date&#x2F;time they were authorised and check that each authorise request, if it is longer than you want reset the isAuthorised boolean and show the pop up again.</p>
