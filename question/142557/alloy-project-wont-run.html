			<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I&#39;m starting to play with Alloy a little I&#39;ve used both npm and github versions of it. Everything went fine with the installation, so I created a new Titanium Studio default template project, went to the command line ran: <code>alloy new</code>, the folder structure got created in my project along with the Alloy &quot;Hello World&quot; app, then I ran <code>alloy compile</code>, everything went fine here too. But when I run the app using <code>alloy run</code> I get the following error messages:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[INFO] Performing clean build

							<p>OK, we figured out what&#39;s going on!</p>
<p>There is a bug in the iPhone build scripts when compiling a project that uses a module, that module is accidentally duplicated in the list of libraries to link with. Furthermore, it only seems happens when the module has a dependency on another native library in which case Xcode finds duplicate symbols from the module&#39;s dependencies.</p>
<p>So, to test this, you can remove the offending module from the tiapp.xml, clean the project, and build again. If it works, then you have two options:</p>
<p>1) Discontinue use of the module until the we ship a fix in a couple weeks</p>
<p>2) Hack your builder.py in the Titanium SDK&#39;s iphone directory by fixing the Python code to not insert duplicate entries into the module_lib_search_path variable around line 825 and 833</p>
<p>Let me know if the module was the problem. Good luck!</p>

										<p><p>The only module I have in the test app is: </p>

										<p><p>Shucks. Thought that could have been the issue. OK, when you build for iPhone, look in the &lt;project-dir&gt;&#x2F;build&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;build&#x2F;build.log at the bottom and see what it was doing just before erroring.</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s good news! I&#39;ll talk with the Alloy team about naming projects &quot;alloy&quot; and see what&#39;s up with that. We may have to blacklist that name. Anyways, good luck with your app!</p>

										<p><p>I get this much more descriptive error when attempting to do the same running 2.1.3:</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="project-name-alloy-conflicts-with-resource-named-x2f-users-x2f-tlukasavage-x2f-documents-x2f-titanium-studio-workspace-x2f-alloy-x2f-resources-x2f-alloy-cannot-build-please-change-one-">Project name alloy conflicts with resource named &#x2F;Users&#x2F;tlukasavage&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;Titanium Studio Workspace&#x2F;alloy&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;alloy: Cannot build. Please change one.</h2>
<p>The long and short is that the whole name of the project can&#39;t be the same as any commonjs module that are in the root of your Resources directory. In the case of Alloy apps, this would include app.js and alloy.js. So just don&#39;t name your app &quot;alloy&quot; or &quot;app&quot; and you should be all set.</p>

							<p>I just tested following your steps and the Hello World app runs for me. Also since alloy new and compile run as expected it appears it&#39;s not a path issue. If you not already done so can you npm install the latest Alloy, and try again? Another thing to try is run or debug the Alloy application project from Titanium Studio as you would do in non Alloy projects.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ve uninstalled alloy from npm and reinstalled it again, and then I followed my previous steps, and I get the same error. It&#39;s weird, I have Mac 10.8.2, Titanium SDK 2.1.2GA, Xcode 4.4.1 and the other apps I&#39;m running are just fine.</p>
<p>Debugging gets me to the same error. It seems it something related to the build process. Maybe I&#39;m missing some files from Xcode? I see that the error is related to clang.</p>

										<p><p>Can you create a project in Titanium studio and run it? It should be the default Tab group sample? If you can then do &quot;alloy new&quot; in the project folder. Then again from from Studio run or debug the project.</p>

										<p><p>This sounds like a timing issue in the build scripts. I&#39;ll talk to the team about the possibility of adjusting the flow control timing or if  some of our newer checkins have effected timing. We are also looking at a cleanup of the build scripts that should help with these sort of issues. As to helping the info you have posted is a good starting point and can ping you if we need more info.</p>

							<p>I saw this same error for the first time today. I was unable to figure out exactly what was causing the problem.</p>
<p>For starters, this error is NOT an Alloy specific error. It&#39;s not related to a specific version of the Titanium SDK either. It happened for me regardless what SDK version (2.1.1, 2.1.2, 3.0.0). Running clean did not fix the problem either.</p>
<p>I sorta forgot about it for an hour, then I manually ran builder.py from the command line and it worked. After that, I was able to successfully launch my app in the iPhone Simulator. After that, I can run the simulator from Titanium Studio again.</p>
<p>This may be a Titanium Studio bug. I&#39;ll keep an eye on it.</p>

							<p>I have a couple of projects with alloy in the name (AlloyHunter and alloy_fugitive) and they work fine. I&#39;m running Alloy 0.2.34 with the 2.1.3RC SDK. I haven&#39;t upgraded Xcode to v4.5 yet on this machine. I wonder what differs between our setups that I can use &quot;alloy&quot; in the name and you cannot?</p>
