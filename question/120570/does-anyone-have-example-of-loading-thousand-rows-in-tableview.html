<p>You want to load 1000 rows on a mobile device?  Are you crazy?! ;)  Don&#39;t you care about the UX? You wouldn&#39;t even do that for a web page targeted at desktops. Fortunately, your following question is a lot saner…</p>
<p>You would render a subset of the total rows (something manageable, like 20), and then configure an eventListener that loads 20 more as the user scrolls near to the bottom of the table, and repeat.</p>
<p>Here is a sample script created by Dawson Toth:</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;810391</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

										<p><p>btw, obviously you can experiment with loading different a different number of rows at once, although the performance will depend on what is being inserted into each row.  Try 20, 50, 100, and see what you can get away with for your data. I am very skeptical that a user could realistically digest 1000 rows at once, though.</p>

										<p><p>We are also in the same track where Ashok is at now. We have the requirement to load 10,000 records in table view. But if you render the subset of 20 rows each, how will the search bar work with in searching the table. The table will have only 20 records and the app is expected to show the records that are still not loaded? Do we need to query database for the search rather than a table search?</p>

										<p><p>Yes, that is what you need to do.  The search bar can only filter what is in the table.  It would be insane to try to put 10k rows in a table even on a desktop, let alone a mobile device.  You need to roll your own search handler.  I suggest a change listener, and with each keystroke use the current search value in a sql where clause, with a limit value of the number of rows you want to populate initially.  Then if the user scrolls instead of typing more characters, use an offset in the sql where clause to get additional records.</p>

										<p><p>Is the &quot;problem&quot; the search bar cannot filter data which is not in the table?  IMHO, that is not a bug or even a design flaw.  It is a &quot;feature&quot; because it helps make you realize that loading a large number of rows in a table in never a good thing.  Design your database with the right indexes and use SQL WHERE clauses with LIMIT and OFFSET in the search field change event handler, and you can provide near instant feedback with databases with tens of thousands of rows.</p>

							<p>To be honest, I don&#39;t see how the UX is improved by only loading a few rows and then loading other rows making the user wait. Sure, scrolling is a lot faster at first, but this is a Titanium realted issue, not a mobile related issue. I have Cocoa developed applications on my iPhone&#x2F;iPad loading huge number of rows with images and still scrolling smoothly. A couple of images per row in 20-30 rows tableview makes scrolling in a Titanium developed application very jerky.</p>
<p>Besides, the Kitchen Sink example will eventually still load a huge amount of rows because it doesn&#39;t remove the previous 20 rows but simply keeps on adding them, only slowly 20 rows at a time.</p>
<p>Tableview is possibly one of the few iOS related aspects of Titanium that really needs improvement in my opinion.</p>

							<p>&gt;I don&#39;t see how the UX is improved by only loading a few rows and then loading other rows making the user wait.</p>
<p>The answer to that is in loading the right rows initially, so the user never waits at all.  Long before the (potential) data for a table gets close to 1000 rows, it is highly likely that what the user is interested in at any<br>given time is a very small subset of the data.</p>
<p>I have databases that exceed 30,000 rows.  As the user types each character in a search field, a change event listener uses SQL to get the initial set of rows that match and (re)populates the table.  It is literally sub-second response time, dynamically filling the table as they key each character.  Generally speaking, you want to key enough letters so the entry you are looking for comes into view so you can just tap it.  But I use this same dynamic scroll technique, so that if the user instead opts to start scrolling the current search results, they can scroll to find what they want instead of entering more search characters.  I also let them configure their preference of how many rows to populate at once, from the number of visible rows to 50.</p>

							<p>Paul,</p>
<p>Are you crazy?!  No, but I am novice.  I wanted to learn how to load 20 or 10 records at a time using limit clause of the sqlite.  Your link will help me do just that.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Ashok</p>

							<p>I am trying example from https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;810391</p>
<p>when last row is selected following line executes in table.addEventListener(&#39;scroll&#39;, function(evt), but next 20 records are not loading as I expected.</p>
<p>loadData = true;</p>
<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
