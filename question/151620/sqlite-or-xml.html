			<p>We are building a content managed app that downloads a lot of data as XML for the apps pages from a server…<br>Would it lead to a better performance, to read the XML and store it in a database and then query the database for the relevant data, or just read the XML directly?</p>

							<p>Well, it depends on many things.</p>
<ul>
<li>The complexity of your data structure</li>
<li>Will this data be <em> searchable</em>?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have complex data and you are planning on giving your users the ability to poke the data in different ways like that. Then <strong>yes</strong> you would be more advised to store this data into a database.</p>
<p>If you are just displaying the data and doing nothing later with it, then there is little point in storing the data on the device other than keeping it for offline use.</p>
<p>Hope this clears this up for you.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Christian, it would be needed for offline use, although I&#39;m not sure why that would stop you from going down the XML route?<br>I think what I am trying to establish is, if the XML file is say 5MB in size, if every time they use the app they have to read the XML file and hold all that data in memory while they are using the app would be less performance than if the first time the XML is downloaded it is stored in the database and then I query the database?</p>

										<p><p>A 5Mb XML = put it in a database.</p>
<p>Traversing the file will be a performance hit every time and then the memory issue you have already considered.  The indexing of the database will mean your results are instantly (relatively speaking) retrieved.</p>

							<p>Hello,</p>
<p>the best practice would be having a middleware doing the transformation from XML to JSON; this machine in the middle has a lot of power and memory, doing this quite quickly and efficient. If you try to do this on the device, it will be bad (either if you process the XML and put it in SQLite or the other suggested way) because in both ways you will need to download the XML (huge in size compared to JSON) and process it (quite expensive in terms of memory, cpu and battery). </p>
<p>You can check <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sitepoint.com&#x2F;php-xml-to-json-proxy&#x2F;">this simple example</a> about how to implement a Proxy. </p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro</p>

										<p><p>While I think it&#39;s a nice idea for smaller XML files, keep in mind that he is talking about a 5 MB XML file here. And even if you converted to JSON data, it would still be quite big. Hence making it long to parse on a less powerful device.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll keep the link though, might become useful to me some day.</p>

										<p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>JSON is usually smaller than XML. Check <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;4862310&#x2F;json-and-xml-comparison">this</a>. </p>
<p>In practice, any mobile web service will be ALWAYS provide JSON output. It&#39;s natural to the device to decode (you alredy have the JS interpreter there).</p>
<p>Best,</p>

										<p><p>I am not sure the XML &gt; JSON conversion on the server is the right plan.  I am going to assume the file is a dynamic data feed, so the conversion would need to be done for each connection.  Many types of XML cannot simply be exported out as JSON without server side processing after the fact and I would much prefer having 1000 clients processing data as required than 1 server processing 1000 files before sending them out.  Distributed process power wins each time.</p>
<p>Whichever way you look at it XML NEVER lived up to the promise - JSON is better.  But sometimes you have to work with what you have got and if this is a dynamic XML file transfer to the client for processing.</p>
<p>Better still bite size the data - is the entire file really needed all at the same time - if it is then is sounds more like an initial data source, if that is the case package with the app and only receive updates.</p>
