			<h1>Displaying special character &#34;?&#34; or &#34;?&#34; not working</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi!</p>
<p>My environment:</p>
<p>Application type:    mobile;<br>Titanium SDK:        3.2.0.GA;<br>Platform &amp; ver.:        Android 4.1.2;<br>Device:            Android emulator;<br>Host OS:            Windows 8;<br>Titanium Studio:        build: 3.2.1.201402041146: </p>
<p>I am trying to read a json encoded string from a certain URL. There are certain special characters, that are important and must be shown correctly. These are Š ? and Ž (and lower-case variants). Š and Ž are working as expected, but I just can&#39;t get ? to work properly. I&#39;ve already read every thing I can find here and elsewhere but nothing fixes my problem. The characters are UTF8 encoded in the json string (i.e. \u010d). Even if I try to &quot;manually&quot; add these to the code, they do not appear in my application. By this I mean, that I hard code them like this:</p>
<p>$.someLbl.text = String.fromCharCode(269)+String.fromCharCode(268)+&#39;??&#39;+&#39;\u010D\u010C \u010d\u010c &#39; + &quot;?? \u010D\u010C \u010d\u010c&quot;; </p>
<p>As you can see, I tried basiclly four different variants (even single and double quotes, if that makes a difference) - nothing works. Insted of the character, a white space is show in the place, where the character is supposed to appear.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>You say &quot;…from a certain url…&quot; - this implies your own api on your own server.</p>
<p>On that basis then the problem is most likely that API itself does not encode out as UTF8 and the file used to generate the output is not itself saved as UTF8.  Does the API display correctly when called using a web browser?</p>
<p>You have found the correct way to encode UTF8 inside your app; <strong>\u</strong> + followed by the hex value of the entry numeric.</p>
<p>Keep in mind not all fonts on each device actually support all UTF8 character tables, custom fonts are even less likely to support them.</p>
<p>Check all those and see what happens.</p>

										<p><p>The URL was not the problem (because I also tried to show the correct char by hard coding it into the source of the application). It was actually the font itself, as you mentioned in the second part of your answer. Changed the font and it works. Thank you very much!!! :)</p>

							<p>indeed, forum has a font problem.</p>
<p>The font being used has to support the char.  If the char isn&#39;t in the font set, doesn&#39;t matter what you try to do.</p>
