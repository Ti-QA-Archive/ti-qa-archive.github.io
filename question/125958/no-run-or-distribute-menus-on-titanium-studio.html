			<h1>No Run or Distribute menus on Titanium Studio</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>We are ready to do a final build and distribution of an app, but when I imported the project into a coworker&#39;s computer, none of the menus for building the app are available. I know about the trick (which should not be necessary, by the way) of making sure there is an iPhone&#x2F; folder under the build&#x2F; folder, but that has not made a difference.</p>
<p>The project itself was imported from a git repository. Everything was imported correctly as far as I can tell, it just simply has no way to build.</p>
<p>Creating a test project from scratch does build, so there is no problem with Titanium seeing xcode. We&#39;re under a tight today deadline, so any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve had that problem on occaison as well when importing a project directly from a github repository. The simplest way to work around this is the do a <code>git clone YOUR_REPO_URL</code> on the command line, then import the resulting project directory into Titanium Studio as you would any other existing project. I&#39;ve never had the issue you&#39;ve described importing projects in this manner.</p>

							<p>You could try the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>With your project selected in App Explorer view, right-click on the empty space and select <strong>Properties</strong>;</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the new dialog, select <strong>Project Natures</strong> on the left;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make sure <strong>Titanium Mobile</strong> is selected on the right and set to be the primary nature;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Apply the change and see if the Run and Distribute menus are enabled and contain the necessary actions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
