			<h1>How to download Alloy samples from GitHub?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Probably a simple question:  How can I download the Alloy samples in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;alloy&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;test&#x2F;apps">the Alloy repo</a>?  It seems there is only a download for the complete Alloy project, but I already have the released version of Alloy, I only want the samples.</p>
<p>Thanks for letting me know what I must be missing as I&#39;m new to Appcelerator.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Yes - it can be confusing, this old dog learnt that new trick a while ago as it was not immediately apparent to me either.</p>
<p>This is the root of the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;alloy">alloy</a> project on github;  the Zip download link is in a line of buttons under the short description about 2-3 inches down the page.</p>
<p>This is direct link to the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;alloy&#x2F;archive&#x2F;master.zip">ZIP file</a> for you in case you still have problems.</p>
<p>Good luck and welcome to the Appcelerator Titanium platform.</p>

							<p>Thank you.  But, that&#39;s only 1&#x2F;2 the story!  In trying to import the samples into Titanium Studio, it seems I can only import them as &quot;Existing folder as New project&quot;.  (They are not recognized as Titanium projects, I suppose since Alloy has a different layout.  I tried this with the &quot;Login&quot; sample, and it&#39;s imported, but can&#39;t be built.  (The build drop-downs don&#39;t work.  (I believe it&#39;s a Mobile Web Application, which I haven&#39;t yet explored.)</p>
<p>Thanks for the tip!  At least I can now read and follow the samples.</p>

										<p><p>You are welcome</p>
<p>I do not think they are meant to be considered as a single or a group of projects, more examples of what can be done, from which you pick and choose from the provided code.</p>
<p>I have been doing that myself - simply looking up and see how they approached things.</p>
<p>I imagine we will get an alloy version of KitchenSink sooner rather than later and Alloy is already becoming an important part of the Q&amp;A so they will be lots to work from.</p>

										<p><p>If it helps, I was able to copy and paste the contents of a sample (assets, controllers, views, models, styles, views, migrations, etc) into a new Titanium Project using the Alloy template. Then I was able to build successfully at that point. It has worked for me for the two different samples I have tried.</p>
<p>I also tried the import &quot;Existing folder as New project&quot; option to no avail. I think Eclipse just creates it as a regular project instead of a Titanium Alloy project which has the necessary bindings for building. Hopefully that helps you.</p>
