			<h1>Tableview click changes search bar - how to preserve?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a popover that gets it&#39;s tableview by calling a function.  The tableview has a defined search bar which works fine.  When the user clicks on a row in the tableview however, the search bar loses focus and the original unfiltered tableview appears.  I want my tableview to behave like the one in the Apple Contacts app where the searchbar filtered tableview stays until the user cancels or clears the searchbar.  I can&#39;t seem to figure this out on my own, would appreciate help.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>You are benefiting from the built-in filter functionality provided by tables, however it is limited in the way it presents itself to the user.  You will have to create your own routines to emulate the way the contacts works.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first thing you will have to do is separate your searchBar from the table and then add the searchBar as an item on the window in its own right.</li>
<li>You then respond to the change event of the searchBar and create your own filtered results and set the tables data to the reduced set of data.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may want to use a second table to present the filtered answers that is invisible sitting above the normal results and ONLY made visible on searchBar change events, then made invisible when the cancel button is pressed in the searchBar.  This way you can have the user return back to exactly the same position they were prior to using the search facility.</p>
<p>It sounds a little complicated but it is simply this;</p>
<ul>
<li>Search bar added to window</li>
<li>Table added to window (for normal results)</li>
<li>Table added over the top of results table and initially invisible</li>
<li>search change event makes filter table visible and is the recipient of the filtered data</li>
<li>search cancel event hides the filter table</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the basis of any custom search filtering, everything else is your own choice, like dimming the results table with a semi-transparent view as soon as the search bar gains focus and then removing that once the change event is first fired.</p>

										<p><p>Actually, it turns out you can do this without going through all of the above.  I found this hidden in the guides…  hideSearchOnSelection is an iOS only property. With it set to true as soon as the user taps a row in the search results, the search box is cleared and the Cancel button is hidden. Set it to false and the search text and button would remain. The default value is true Android operates as if this value were set to false.</p>
<p>I tried it and…. it worked.  Thanks again Malcolm!</p>

										<p><p>Superb - good find, I had trailed the searchBar for information rather than the tableView.  As I am an old dog I thank you for a new trick :)</p>
<p>BTW you should mark the question as answered so other people can find out what YOU found out.</p>
