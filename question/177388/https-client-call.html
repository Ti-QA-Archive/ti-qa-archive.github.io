			<h1>HTTPS Client Call</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I was asked to create a mobile app for an organization that demands secure connections between their web services and the mobile app HTTP calls.</p>
<p>As far as I know, using an HTTP Client call and just calling the website (or web service) using https:&#x2F;&#x2F;…. does not encrypt the data.</p>
<p>How can I use a secure http connection&#x2F;call between a website&#x2F;webservice and the mobile app?</p>
<p>Please provide an example or something because I could not find any on the internet.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>You can use HTTPS in place of HTTP, as long as the domain has a valid SSL, and it will be sent encrypted.</p>
<p>HTTPS is encrypted by design, so any data that is sent using this protocol will be encrypted. If you wanted you could also use your own encryption on the data before it is sent, but that is your choice.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

										<p><p>Hi Luke,</p>
<p>Are you sure?</p>
<p>If yes, then what is <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;platform&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Modules.Https">this module</a> needed for?</p>
<p>I want to make sure before presenting our prototype to them.</p>

										<p><p>That module is only available to developers with paid subscription.</p>
<p>All it does is simply validate the chain of certificates, this is to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, and adds another layer of security. It doesn&#39;t encrypt your data any more than it already is.</p>
<p>The concepts section explains in more detail what the module is used for.</p>

										<p><p>So that means if I use https in my web services, I will have the same level of security as using https in my browser when calling those web services?</p>

										<p><p>HTTPS is simply a communications protocol, it provides bidirectional encryption of communications between a client and server. It will work the same way regardless of what client you use.</p>
<p>The only difference between an app and browser is that you are afforded the opportunity to inspect the certificates to decide whether you trust it, whereas through an API you are not.</p>

										<p><p>That was really helpful! But i would like to ask if there is any way i can encrypt the data being sent across? Also, anyway to make sure if the app is interacting only with the intended web server.</p>

<p>There are a couple of libraries out there which you can use to encrypt and decrypt your data, here is an example: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tumuski.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;04&#x2F;nibbler&#x2F;">Nibbler.js</a></p>
<p>As for the interaction with the intended web server, the HttpClient is only going to communicate with the URL which you provide it.</p>
