							<p>Hi Adnan</p>
<p>Using windows - especially when you first start coding - are the only place to start when separating out the functionality of an app.  However there are some newer UI conventions that can only be done by using views in a smart way.  Check out this <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;140279&#x2F;facebook-like-static-menu---ios">question</a> that really goes into the differences between windows and views</p>
<p>Good coding is more important for speed and memory efficiency, as poor code will cause problems no matter which which use.</p>
<p>Using the CommonJS module can really help it making your code more efficient in both memory and efficiency.</p>

										<p><p>So keeping views in memory and just hide and show? how are they efficient?</p>

										<p><p>HI Adnan</p>
<p>You do not have to keep views in memory, only those that are in use at the time, same as the windows.  Whilst windows (for the most part) have their own clean up routines to free memory with views you would need to manage that yourself by removing them from the context.</p>
<p>So you only have views loaded that your user is able to see (or would see if revealed - like the facebook example), others can (and probably should if they are detailed) be removed from their parent.</p>
<p>For example;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// create view 1</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> view1 = Ti.UI.createView(<span class="hljs-comment">{
    height: Ti.UI.FILL,
    width: Ti.UI.FILL
}</span>);
win.<span class="hljs-keyword">add</span>(view1);
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> lbl1 = Ti.UI.createLabel(<span class="hljs-comment">{
    color: '#000,
    font: {
        fontSize: 14,
        fontWeight: 'bold'
    }</span>,
    height: Ti.UI.FILL,
    text: <span class="hljs-string">'View 1'</span>,
    width: Ti.UI.FILL
});
view1.<span class="hljs-keyword">add</span>(lbl1);

<span class="hljs-comment">// create view 2</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> view2 = Ti.UI.createView(<span class="hljs-comment">{
    height: Ti.UI.FILL,
    width: Ti.UI.FILL
}</span>);
win.<span class="hljs-keyword">add</span>(view2);
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> lbl2 = Ti.UI.createLabel(<span class="hljs-comment">{
    color: '#000,
    font: {
        fontSize: 14,
        fontWeight: 'bold'
    }</span>,
    height: Ti.UI.FILL,
    text: <span class="hljs-string">'View 2'</span>,
    width: Ti.UI.FILL
});
view2.<span class="hljs-keyword">add</span>(lbl2);

...
<span class="hljs-comment">// later on - remove view1</span>
win.<span class="hljs-keyword">remove</span>(view1);
<span class="hljs-comment">// this removes the view and any children (lbl2 in this case)</span>
...
</code></pre><p>Whichever method you use, good separation of functionality into modular code is very important, the result of which will usually mean good window&#x2F;view management as a side effect anyway.</p>

										<p><p>Actually it would be the same given how I believe you are thinking about it.</p>
<p>If you had an app with three tabs then these would be the two different scenarios;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>windows</strong>, three tabs, each with its own window plus views</li>
<li><strong>views</strong>, view to handle the tabs, plus three parent views for each tab.</li>
</ol>
<p>You would only unload (remove) views that were no longer instantly required, in the same way you would not remove tab and its window if it was still required.</p>
<p>You could create a specific use view with children views for times when pop overs are required, in the same way you would load a new window in the tabgroup navigation or modally plus its child windows.</p>
<p>The principles are the same, the basic process are the same.  The only difference are that you may see more visual restrictions with using windows than you would with views, but you would have to manage the view more than you would the windows.</p>
<p>I mainly use windows for my apps, I do this because they make managing the app easier straight away, I could get there with views - but I would have to create my own management routines first, and there is not always the time or need.</p>
<p>But when want to create an interface that simply cannot be done using only traditional windows (like the Face Book example mentioned above), then you have to think differently.</p>
<p>I do not recommend either method because doing so ignore the type of app, what sort of development schedule you can allow, how much management you are happy doing or would rather leave it to the operating system, if you want a traditional looking app or something different (both are fine).</p>
<p>I would certainly never recommend doing a views style app and then make it look like a standard tabs&#x2F;windows app - there is no point.</p>
<p>The question of efficiency really comes down to management of what is visible and in memory at anyone time, if you load it up with windows or views then the result is the same.</p>
<p>Most efficiencies come from how the code resolves and presents the information to the user - rather than the views or windows.</p>
<p>For example; If you have 50,000 records in a sqlite db then a lot of your time would focus on indexes, getting information in and out, searches that return relevant results rather than lots of results, only showing what is needed and allowing the user to ask for more (load more - options on table views for example).</p>
<p>As this answer shows - it depends…</p>

							<p>Hi Adnan, i will suggest using single window multiple view approach. window is a heavy object in comparison to views.</p>
