			<h1>Application failed codesign verification: with iPad app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have been trying to solve this problem for the best part of a month now and I have managed to get nowhere.</p>
<p>Here is the problem, after packaging my app for distribution, I go to the build directory and zip the app package. I then use the Application Loader to send to Apple. The error response I get is : </p>
<p>&quot;Application failed codesign verification. The signature was invalid, or it was not signed with an Apple submission certificate.&quot;</p>
<p>I am using Titanium Developer 1.2.1.<br>I am compiling against SDK 3.2</p>
<p>Also there are problems with the package that is generated (not using the correct icons and also including an icon called icon-72@2x.png. Where this comes from I don&#39;t know. Anyway, before zipping the application package, I add correct versions of these icons.</p>
<p>So, the problem is not with my provisioning file, I have deleted and re-created from scratch all the certificates and profiles a number of times.</p>
<p>The problem is also not with my AppID.</p>
<p>xCode has been re-installed.</p>
<p>The app has been created from scratch.</p>
<p>I have read reams and reams of thoughts on the subject in the non-appcelerator dev world an no-one appears to have a definitive solution.</p>
<p>Over the past month I have tried, many, many combinations to get past this last hurdle with no success.</p>
<p>However, there is one thing that <em>COULD</em> be going on that I cannot resolve. </p>
<p>Is it possible that when my application is being built for distribution, it is using the DEV certificate and not the Distribution certificate?</p>
<p>Also, one possible solution would be to compile the distribution from xCode itself, but each time I try, I get an iPhone app, not an iPad app.</p>
<p>All thoughts and suggestions welcomed.</p>
