			<p>When I package for appstore, I do not get the usual &#39;whats the password for your key&#39; dialogue. I get one with &#39;assistive technologies not enabled&#39; </p>
<p>This is with studio 2.1.2</p>
<p>I need to send an ipa file today and I haven&#39;t got a clue how to set this right?</p>

							<div><p>Missing from your question are a number of important pieces of information. I suggest you take a look at the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Using+Questions+and+Answers">Using Questions and Answers</a> article, specifically the Q&amp;A Question Checklist.  The missing information is critical to reproducing problems in a test environment and often indicates other factors that cause the undesirable outcome you are experiencing.</p>

							<div><p>Actually it says that &#39;scripting for UI-elements not activated - plz enable assistive technologies&#39; or something to that effect.</p>
<p>I then enable it, and in subsequent package attempts it opens first xcode, then &#39;Organizer - devices&#39; with my provisioning profile highlighted.</p>
<p>No clue to why it does it, or what it wants me to do …</p>
<p>In the console it says &#39;performing clean build&#39; - and nothing more happens</p>
<p>This is btw. a new thing, I&#39;ve never seen it before</p>

										<p><p>Thnx - the problem has existed ever since 1.7.2 … and the suggested workaround does not help. This is the first time ever I encounter it. And I am missing a deadline …</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s it - it now shows me my provisioning profile and terminates with exit status 0</p>
<p>I already blundered by sending them an APK - not realising that 2.1.2 for the moment will crash the device but not the emulator. Spend an hour fiddling with that until it occurred to me that I could use 2.1.1. </p>
<p>I&#39;ll now send them an APK compiled with 2.1.1 and tell them: Sorry, even though I&#39;ve sent you one ipa to test after the other, I am not able to do so today. I&#39;ll call it a technical error, and they will think that I am an idiot. And I&#39;ll be thinking &#39;yeah, I probably am&#39; and my Boss will again use the word &#39;Fiasco&#39; in describing our Ti venture, and I will say &#39;nahh - but honestly …&#39; while thinking &#39;yeah …this is totally decrepit&#39;</p>
<p>Unfortunately I&#39;ve never worked with X-code, so I haven&#39;t got a clue on where to start my bughunt.</p>
