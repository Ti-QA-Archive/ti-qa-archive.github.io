										<p><p>Sorry, can&#39;t help with that, or at least not without more information.  I have not used Ti Dev 1.3.0 myself.  Now that you have it downloaded, I would suggest marking this question complete (it helps the Q&amp;A search algorithms) then starting a new question detailing the errors you are getting.  Somebody who uses 1.3.0 may be able to help.</p>
