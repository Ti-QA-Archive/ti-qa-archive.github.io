		<section>
			<p>Hey, how would i have a recursive tableView?</p>
<p>That is, i have tableView a. with a bunch of things.</p>
<p>And each thing is in itself a tableView, with a bunch of things.</p>
<p>Ideally it would look like:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-attribute">title</span>:
  part1
  part2
<span class="hljs-attribute">title2</span>:
  part1 
  part2
<span class="hljs-attribute">title3</span>:
  part1
  <span class="hljs-attribute">part2</span>:
  part3
</code></pre><p>or is this impossible?</p>

							<div><p>I know there is an answer below that says this is possible, but please DO NOT try to put a TableView inside of a TableRowView. This is something that terrible HTML writers used to do in the 90s. Stephen&#39;s link to the TableViewSection below should be sufficient for what you are trying to do.</p>

							<div><p>It is a completely wrong interpretation of my answer. All I did was pointed the OP to Kitchen sink to look at the examples of nested tableview. I think tech experts in this forum should go beyond the words by reading between the line of what the asker is really asking as they are likely to e new to Titanium. I am disappointed that you tried evaluating the answer on the basis of the title of the question. At the last, I agree it will be a terrible idea to add a tableview to a tableviewrow and never suggested or provided the code for it.</p>

							<div><p>you can be as disappointed as you want to be, but this isn&#39;t the Psychic Support Network.  As with all things on the net, the asker of a question has an opportunity to write an accurate, eye catching title, and then an area in which to add specific details, relative to the title, to clarify their need.</p>
<p>Now, you have used the term <strong>&#39;expert&#39;</strong> twice in a derogatory manner within 24 hours in this forum.</p>
<p>Many of the &#39;experts&#39; you seem to be deriding DONATE their time to help others here.  That time has value.  </p>
<p>The <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Using+Questions+and+Answers">Using Questions and Answers</a> article, specifically the Q&amp;A Question Checklist saves time.</p>
<p>You have had an account on this forum for nearly 2 years and in that time have only given 21 answers, thats an average of less than 1 a month.  I&#39;m not entirely sure you are in a position to comment on the actions of others in the forums.</p>

							<div><p>All I am asking is to look at the complete context of the problem and not just title or body. Enough said, I think we have beaten this dead horse enough. I am learning and take the point that I should have better worded my response but it was an honest effort to point the OP to kitchen sink where there are examples on the subject. </p>
<p>Now I am not against everyone in this community and respect that people are donating their time but so am I. I have spent few hours in this forum in last 2-3 days answered about 20 questions (i know its not many but I am trying), about 4-5 of which were accepted as the correct answers. So you see I am in the same boat and donating my time also. However, I am relatively newer to Titanium and open to learning from other (experts in this forum) but I am just offended by the fact that someone has been down voting my answers. Dont just say I am wrong, tell me why so I can learn. I believe most of the people here are more knowledgable on the subject and hence they are expert from my standpoint but I hate the fact that someone (mind you <strong>not everyone</strong>) does not realize that another person who is also donating their time and trying to help gets discouraged this way. So please dont try to make me look as someone against the community, I am just demanding a reasoning behind downvotes I got. Its fairly reasonable right? </p>
<p>Regarding my account history, the length of the account has no bearing on when you gain enough knowledge to be able to help others. If you did you research right you would see that I answered almost all the question in last 2-3 days which is because I am finishing up my first app now. </p>
<p>At the last, sir - I expect such a senior person (in terms of knowledge) to be less competitive with new comers - really it is very discouraging. Remember, with power (knowledge) comes the responsibility ;)</p>

										<p><p>can i enquire what the platform i&#39;m using has to do with it? I am - as the fairly protracted discussion under my question asserts - somewhat new to titanium. I&#39;m assuming by &quot;platform&quot; you&#39;re meaning &quot;android  or ios&quot; (although why would anyone use titanium if they wanted to focus on a particular system seems inefficient to me)?<br>I&#39;m working for both ios and android - or maybe platform means Something Else?</p>
<p>Anyway, this worked a treat, thanks!</p>

										<p><p>Android and iOS are different beasts. Because Titanium maps its UI api to native objects, those objects may or may not exist on a particular platform, may or may not look the same, may or may not behave the same.</p>
<p>If you read the API docs located at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com</a> you will find that there are android specific api calls and iOS specific api calls.</p>
<p>As such, when posting, please be as thorough as you can be. Answers may vary depending on the platform you are targeting.</p>
<p>In other cases, users have failed to mention the platform, and get all ticked off when an ios solution fails to work on their android only project.</p>

<p>I too wonder about this as well. But we have iOS only devs using Titanium and Android only devs as well around here.</p>

							<p>It is Possible and there are different ways to do this . Look at the kitchen sink on base ui-&gt; table view for examples.</p>
