			<h1>Secure storing of API keys</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all. </p>
<p>Hoping to tap your collective brains &amp; experiences for the following questions…</p>
<p>Question 1:</p>
<p>Is it considered secure to store API keys within the JS of a Ti App?</p>
<p>From what I&#39;ve researched, Ti will obfuscate the JS code when compiling, however the code &amp; keys can conceivably be reversed engineered. Even when using ACS, API keys are added to the tiapp.xml, which are even more clearly visible in an compiled app.</p>
<p>Question 2:</p>
<p>So, what&#39;s the best way to secure API keys within a Titanium app?</p>
<p>Question 3:</p>
<p>If the only solution is a custom encryption module or a custom implementation of something like AES, won&#39;t that cause problems when submitting the app to Apple and Google given their encryption policies?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance to everyone who lend some advice!</p>
<p>Titanium SDK: 3.2.0 GA<br>Platform &amp; version: iOS 7, Android</p>

							<p><code>From what I&amp;#39;ve researched, Ti will obfuscate the JS code when compiling</code></p>
<p>Your search is resulting in OLD information.</p>
<p>Your js files are more than obfuscated, they now are combined and encrypted.  These are stored within the compiled native binary and decrypted at runtime. I cant find the reference, but 128b AES I believe.</p>
<p>Understand that anything you write to a property is available from the .plist file created on the device.  </p>
<p>Understand that nearly anything written in bytecode (android) can be r-engineered.</p>

										<p><p>Apple&#39;s policies regarding encryption are pretty straight forward.  Pretty much anything goes if you only distribute to the US market.  If you plan to distribute overseas, you have to prove your case to the USG and if all the paperwork is approved, Apple lets it go through.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the info Stephen! It certainly makes me feel a lot better now. Out of curiosity, I tried to find the encryption used at compile, but couldn&#39;t find a formal statement from Appcelerator. I even skimmed through the release notes for version 2.x and up. Maybe someone else has seen this somewhere?</p>
<p>As for encryption policies, do you still require a CIN &amp; ECCN if you&#39;re just in the US market?</p>

										<p><p>Take a look in the titanium github repo.  There are a couple of binaries (titanium_prep, encryptor) for which the source code is not released.</p>
<p>Takes a combination of <strong>#$%@@$%@</strong> and <strong>%^#$@$#%</strong> from your project and adds in a <strong>!@$!#*(@!@#</strong> thats known only by appc</p>
