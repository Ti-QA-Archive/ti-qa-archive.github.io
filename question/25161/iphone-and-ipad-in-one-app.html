			<h1>iPhone and iPad in one app?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi!<br>With Apple&#39;s native tools it&#39;s possible to build apps that run on both the iPhone and the iPad, with one app.<br>While it currently is possible to build either an iPhone or an iPad app with Titanium, AFAIK it currently isn&#39;t possible to build one app that runs on both platforms.<br>2 questions:<br>1: Maybe I&#39;m missing something, and this currently is actually possible? If, so, how?<br>2: Is this planned for a later version? When?</p>

							<p>Hey panman, good to see more Dutchies around here :)</p>
<p>You could, in essence, cross-copy the code from one app to the other, but you would still have to compile each and submit both separately to the AppStore which is not what you desire I would assume.</p>
<p>Another option is to simply build an iPhone app and have it run on the iPad as well by means of pixel-doubling. This would, however, result in funny looking apps that are not heavily graphics based but consist mostly of input fields and other text controls.</p>
<p>As a thought, you could potentially use Titanium.Platform.DisplayCaps to figure out if you are running on the iPhone or the iPad and load different graphics based on that, possibly even alter all the other parts like input field heights and fontsizes…</p>

							<p>You could have one code base by detecting the size of the screen and have different UI elements (graphics images, etc.) to use depending on the screen size but….. that means your single on app will have extra stuff to pack, making it bigger in size.</p>

							<p>Martijn,</p>
<p>looks like the Appcelerator team is working on getting Universal support in there:</p>
<p>Quoting Kevin Whinnery from <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;26911&#x2F;universal-apps-on-ipad-and-iphone-how-do-you-do-them#57841">over here</a>: </p>
<p><strong>It&#39;s on our to do list, but no, we don&#39;t currently have universal binary support.</strong></p>

							<p>Martijn,</p>
<p>I think you&#39;d still have to set up two projects and just cross-copy the code from one repository to the other every time before yo compile.</p>
