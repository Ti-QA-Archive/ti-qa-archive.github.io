			<h1>Calling objects in global scope from a commonJS module BUG</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve encounter a strange little bug on Android… I have a commonsJS module that returns a window (with controls in it). That commonsJS uses the &quot;namespace&quot; object I&#39;ve defined in the global scope of my app (lets call it &quot;MyNamespace&quot;.</p>
<p>I have a button on my main window, that once clicked creates my commonJS object and opens the window. on iPhone everything works fine, but on android it pops up an error message saying the MyNamespace is undefined.<br>This happens even if I attach the event to a view, label… it seems that once the object is declared from an event listener - it loses the global scope.</p>
<p>Now here is the weird part - If I create a tableView and in that table I place a tableViewRow and attach the click event to the row and call the exact command I called from the button click event - everything works and my global scope object is known and working.</p>
<p>Can anyone explain that? Am I doing something wrong or is it a bug? if I&#39;m doing something wrong - shouldn&#39;t that also not work on iPhone?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>Actually. You do not have a global scope in commonJS… The fact that it works in iPhone is actually a bug.</p>
<p>If you use SDK 1.8.0 then this allows for global scope but again it is a bug.</p>
<p>SDK 1.8.0.1 and 1.9 from the nightly builds do not allow for this.</p>
<p>That being said I am just refactoring an app from global Namespace to commonJS and I have pretty much got the architecture to now work, I just need to finish the refactoring. This is maybe not the best forum to give you the complete answers but I will try and give you a quick guide.</p>
<p>There is no Global Space so you have to sudo make one if you want to use global variables.</p>
<p>In a file globalVars.js</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">exports</span><span class="hljs-class">.globalVars</span>
{
    <span class="hljs-attribute">field1</span>:        <span class="hljs-string">'a value'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attribute">field2</span>:        <span class="hljs-string">'another value'</span>
};
</code></pre><p>you can then require this in all your other modules(files) i.e.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> VARS    =    <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'globalVars'</span>);

Ti.UI.createLabel
({
    text:    VARS.globalVars.field1,
    left:    <span class="hljs-number">20</span>
)};
</code></pre><p>Hopefully that should give you an indication of how to set a static global variable without using the global space. There is also a solution for updating these and also accessing global functions but again going into great length here is not the ideal solution.</p>
<p>Please ping me on the IRC or over Skype and I will happily talk you through the solutions of moving from global namespace to commonJS. Not that I have all the answers yet. oh thewarpedcoder IRC and Skype.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>T.</p>

										<p><p>So everyone who wrote stuff the way I did need to rewrite parts of their app in order to use future SDKs ?</p>
<p>I saw some open bugs about these stuff on Jira - why doesn&#39;t the Appcelerator team close them as irrelevant, is there no future option to fix those? why wouldn&#39;t a module be able to call global scope anyhow?</p>
<p>thanks</p>

										<p><p>basically yes… I cannot comment on open Jira bugs and appcelerator but you could be right they should be closed.</p>
<p>There is a certain amount of refactoring to do especially if you have used the global namespace architecture.. me about 8000 lines of code in one app :(</p>

										<p><p>that sucks.</p>
<p>I adopted a method from a lesson I saw Forging Titanium about creating cross platform navigation control. In that lesson, every window that was opened (every screen on my app) is a module that returns a window.</p>
<p>because I have basic functionality that repeats what I did was write the global NS and call global functions that do common stuff from my modules.</p>
<p>What you are actually saying is that I need to convert my NS to an &quot;Infrastructure&quot; object and require it in every module. correct?</p>

										<p><p>effectively yes. with a few gotcha thrown in… like you have to modify each file from an anonymous function with namespace functions to exports, and if you need global functions then you need to fire an event to call them I found out badly that file require recursion is really bad.</p>

										<p><p>actually no.. because it does only actually require it into memory on the first instance, requiring it again just gives you access to it in that module.</p>
<p>You cant require a file in a file required by the calling file. if that makes sense.</p>
<p>But actually no it should give you better performance, depending on the implementation. From what I have xperienced the titanium implementation is up to scratch.</p>

										<p><p>It is working that way in 1.8.0.1 and 1.9 don&#39;t trust in in other releases. haven&#39;t checked the 1.8 which has just been released but it was based on 1.8.0.1 so it should. You do not need to monkey patch it.. Hope this answers it… but I am open to being proved wrong. I am setting variables in modules and they are accessible in the other modules with the new values.</p>
<p>So from a code point of view it is working that way.</p>

										<p><p>what do you mean by &quot;I am setting variables in modules and they are accessible in the other modules with the new values&quot; ? I thought modules variables are only available in the scope of the module.</p>
<p>how can you do a case test to check that no monkey patch is needed?</p>

										<p><p>I have done a test case to prove that to myself.</p>
<p>The SDK is currently changing rapidly as things get implemented and items get finalised. The way I solved this was to build a file with variables in</p>
<p>in globablvars I put a function</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">exports</span>.updateField1 = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(inValue)</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">{
    field1 = inValue;
}</span>;</span>
</code></pre><p>now if you created a file which required globalsvars and alerted the field1, then updated field1 and then switched screen and required the globalvars file in that the value of field1 would be the new value.</p>
<p>Well that is how I proved it to myself. I am not sure what you are trying to obtain by applying a monkey patch. But I do have it all working with only using the SDK.</p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s exactly the same case. In your case - can you read the variable?</p>
<p>This only happens to me when the event is from anything but a tableViewRow. unfortunately issues that has to do with commonJS on Android (and there are a few) had not yet been addressed to on the 1.8 RC1 (or anywhere). Which leads me to write workarounds that I just to want to write because it&#39;s not the cleanest way to accomplish my mission.</p>

							<p>Shlomi, personally I use something like Trevor&#39;s approach. But an alternative is that the <code>Ti.App</code> object is accessible globally. So you can attach objects to it.</p>
<p>For example <code>Ti.App.myGlobalObject = {a:&amp;#39;a&amp;#39;}</code>, etc.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks. I guess you can see that I don&#39;t use it. :)<br>Before I saw this most recent comment, I was going to write that the reason I like the CommonJS way without using a global scope, is that it forces you to write more modular&#x2F;cleaner code and if you put your requires up the top, it makes it cleaner&#x2F;simpler to reuse code as your dependencies are all there.</p>

										<p><p>I also like commonJS - I think it&#39;s much more modular and oop.</p>
<p>In my specific case I had a global namespace that contains common functions and values that I use. and in my commonJS modules I used them - which turned to be a problem… so now I&#39;m working had on fixing it…</p>

										<p><p>David, I would love to read that post, for that is the way commonJS should be used, but I think in Shlomi and my case we already have apps with global namespace functions and variables and they need to be adapted rather than rewritten.</p>

										<p><p>OK. So I have solution for you. Instead of using <code>var myapp = {};</code> create an empty file called <code>Global.js</code> and in your app do <code>var myapp = require(&amp;#39;Global&amp;#39;);</code> as well as at the top of each of your CommonJS files. (Note: I use the require_patch).</p>
<p>I created a test app and put it on github <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dbankier&#x2F;TiGlobal">here</a>;</p>
