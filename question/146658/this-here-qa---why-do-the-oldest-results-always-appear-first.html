			<h1>This here Q&amp;A - why do the oldest results always appear first?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>When I&#39;m searching this Q&amp;A forum the oldest results appear first, quite often these apply to older versions of Titanium and are no longer applicable - would it be possible to reverse this? Or to use a more sophisticated ranking algorithm that combines the age and popularity of a thread?</p>
<p>I&#39;m no expert, but this thread reckons a good algorithm would use a decaying logic based around:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.linkibol.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;05&#x2F;07&#x2F;how-to-build-a-popularity-algorithm-you-can-be-proud-of&#x2F;</p>
<p>While not <em>directly</em> Titanium related, a small tweak like this would make my experience vastly improved :-)</p>

							<p>Because we use Apache Solr to do full text searching and it sucks. We tried setting up a boost value for items with a more recent date, but it simply does not work. Things were much better back in the day when we used Google Search, but we had to switch when we were hitting our daily quota by 1pm and that&#39;s with a paid account.</p>
<p>Until we get a better replacement for Apache Solr, I recommend using Google with the &quot;site:&quot; option:</p>

										<p><p>Oh I can feel your pain, we used Solr for about a month before switching to SphinxSE on MySQL. Oh well, back to trusty google :-) Shame really cause I hate to break the Ti experience…</p>

										<p><p>@David, how is SphinxSE? Does it do a pretty good job searching data? Does it have a HTTP based protocol? Was the migration from Solr easy or painful?</p>

										<p><p>I found it somewhat easier to use and manage - the SphinxSE is really just a way to go via MySQL directly to the search daemon as a virtual table, you can then &quot;join&quot; to the real data trivially.</p>
<p>Not sure about a HTTP protocol as I&#39;ve not been down that route, but I should imagine it does.</p>
