							<p>For past one month, the answer has always been that they are fixing issues in order to release a stable build.</p>
<p>If you need iOS4.0 features in your app then you&#39;ll be lucky if appcelerator supports them by October (based on their past delivery promises).</p>

							<p>Personally I don&#39;t think it will be too long. Having spoken to Kevin at Appcelerator I know they&#39;ve been working their backsides off trying to get 1.40 in.</p>
<p>In the meantime, download 1.3.2 its actually 1.40 Release Candidate, or if you can find the link there&#39;s a 1.3.3 available somewhere.</p>

										<p><p>would not recommend using this unless you&#39;re interested in helping the dev team.  It&#39;s completely unstable and the majority of the continuous builds I&#39;ve attempted to use completely fail to even launch the app in the iPhone Simulator.</p>
<p>1.3.2 on the other hand (1.4 RC1) does mostly work:  http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2010&#x2F;06&#x2F;1-3-2-1-4-rc1-release-now-available.html</p>

										<p><p>Agree, those can be hit or miss. Also, recent builds of 1.3.3 don&#39;t compile the zip for App Store submission.</p>

							<p>Should be released &quot;soon&quot;…they are working as hard as possible I think, but it is a shit load of work ! Was supposed to release on july 16th.</p>
<p>You can see tickets still opened for the 1.4 release here : <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32238-titanium-mobile&#x2F;milestones&#x2F;70627-release-14">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32238-titanium-mobile&#x2F;milestones&#x2F;70627-release-14</a></p>

										<p><p>I certainly wouldn&#39;t argue that they are working hard, I&#39;m sure they&#39;d like it finished as much as we would.  I just wish there was better communication with the (according to their homepage) 57,792 active developers.</p>

										<p><p>No doubt they are working hard and many thanks for that, but  we have own deadlines and milestones, I told to my partners that TI dev team said Blackberry support will be by the end on June, now I have to say &quot;Sorry guys, still not ready&quot;. Ok, no problem, I will wait.</p>

										<p><p>Are they going to attend and fix all those bugs&#x2F;pending tickets before 1.4 get released? Why they just cant release it now and fix those pending in the 1.4.1 version?</p>
