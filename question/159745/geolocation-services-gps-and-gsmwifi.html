		<section>
			<p>I use GPS coordinates to show my current position on the Google Maps and it follows my position on the map in a real time when I drive a car(like car navigator). But, once I am going in the tunnel device loses connection with satellites and my position is stopped on the Map. After passing tunnel I still stand on that position where lost connection. Is it possible in this case to make a check if device lost connection with satellites then get geolocation info from GMS&#x2F;WiFi to continue follow my position on the map? Looking for such or similar approach on Titanium.<br>P.S. Application runs on Android 2.3 - 4 only.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Have you tried using a third-party app to test if they are able check inside of tunnels?</p>
<p>When you are detecting location based on wifi you are not being tracked - instead the physical location of the wifi router is noted - so your position will be marked as THAT position not relative to that router.  So if the router is in the middle of the tunnel and you are lucky enough to gain that signal from the edge of the tunnel your position could only be shown as the centre of the tunnel until you exit the tunnel.</p>
<p>GSM does not have built in GPS - this instead attempts to use the triangulation of cell towers to estimate your position.  So the ability to determine your position based on this is dependant on having at least three towers in range - others the only position information is within a single circle from that one or two towers.</p>
<p>Also the ability for any device to use either aGPS (WiFi version) or cell tower triangulation is dependant on if the device has that software and circuitry built in.</p>
