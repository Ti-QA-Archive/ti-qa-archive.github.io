			<h1>Should I use titanium for building my App or no?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, I am a rookie as far as Titanium platform is concerned. I am building an application, details of which are as under::</p>
<p>Application type: mobile<br>Titanium SDK: 1.8.2<br>Device: iOS simulator<br>Host Operating System: MacOSX 10.7.2</p>
<p>Intended application is a simple password-locker where we can place a lock over the apps installed in the iphone as well as the pre-existing apps. Is building such an app feasible under the titanium platform i.e.,Does titanium provide features to fetch a list of all iphone apps as well as an option to prevent the apps from opening?<br>If no, then what approach should i take to develop such a kind of an app?</p>
<p>I am expecting a lot of views as well as replies from vast pool of experience that this forum holds.</p>
<p>Thanx Guys for helping!!</p>

							<p>Due to the sandboxed nature of iOS, you cannot control another application.  You cannot list other installed applications.</p>
<p>It is possible on a jailbroken device but not on a regular iOS install.</p>

										<p><p>There was a way to guess at installed apps based upon sniffing cache locations but I think that disappeared in iOS 5.0</p>
