			<p>I&#39;ve made a topic on it and now I&#39;ve figured out a way to get it to behave the way I want, I&#39;d like your opinion on this workaround. </p>
<p>Okay, here&#39;s the issue..  when opening windows on my ipod 4 touch, the styles get applied after the window opens, there&#39;s a split second where I see the elements unstyled, sitting in the middle of the view or at the top and quickly shift to their position, it really doesn&#39;t look professional. </p>
<p>My Solution was to set the container view&#39;s tss as &#39;visible : false&#39; and add an event listener to the window on &#39;open&#39; to show() the container view… this workaround works but I&#39;m wondering if anyone has ever dealt with similar issues.  </p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;m not doing anything complex, I&#39;ve got a window with some views and labels, styled in app.tss ( and the windows&#39; associated tss file, I&#39;ve moved those around since style priority checks app.tss last, but that didn&#39;t seem to fix anything )   at first, I had the layout set to vertical in a container window and some of the views had a top property set to add padding, what happened is that the views would initialize at top: x from the main window and not the containing view but within a few ms they would appear at their intended position.        </p>
<p>like I said, simply adding an open event listener to show the hidden container view seems to fix this problem and the end user doesn&#39;t see a difference, at least I don&#39;t.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>This seems like a logical solution.</p>
<p>Usually in my apps, I will create a loading view with an Activity Indicator. This will sit over the top of my window until everything finishes loading and then I would remove this view to reveal the main window.</p>
<p>This informs the user that something is loading and allows you to load everything in the background. Of course if you make the view slightly transparent, then the user will still be able to see the page as it loads. But because the user is informed that this is meant to be happening, this isn&#39;t usually a problem.</p>
<p>Now you could take the best of both these solutions, as your solution I&#39;m assuming, will leave an empty page until the container finishes loading, so showing a loading view might help and the user won&#39;t see any un-styled elements until you show them. </p>
<p>Hope this information is useful.</p>

										<p><p>I appreciate your answer but the thing is, it&#39;s not a problem with pages taking a long time to load and display,  my lightest window opens with 3 imageViews with very small images and  the problem still occured until I used my work around.      </p>
<p>it&#39;s something that happens within a few milliseconds, but adding the event listener to &#39;open&#39; on the window is basically invisible to the user but it certainly looks much more pleasing than seeing Labels flashing on the screen..</p>
