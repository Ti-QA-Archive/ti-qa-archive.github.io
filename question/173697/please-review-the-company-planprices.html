			<p>Hi boss (if you are reading)!!!</p>
<p>Today I&#39;ve received a news letter with the new Parse plans&amp;prices. I&#39;m an happy as Appcelerator developer, because all you are doing and giving to us is incredible. And I want to use all what Appcelerator can give to us at good prices. The unique problem are the plans. </p>
<p>We only have 2 options: </p>
<ol>
<li>A free plan, which is excellent to start a little experiment or even to begin a business to see if it grows.</li>
<li>Grow to Appcelerator Platform, which is incredibly expensive (I will not give the price publicly because for some reason it is hard to get it or contact sellers to give it to you), and you still have limitations.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think this plans are poor. Free plan is too limitant, but it&#39;s free, so nothing to discuss. But the jump to Pro is… impossible for a growing business.</p>
<p>In my specific case, what I&#39;m focusing is in push notifications, a growing market. But Appcelerator is really weak in this case.</p>
<ul>
<li>Free plan: 250,000 API calls per day or 5 Million per month (this includes every push notification sent to a device). If I understood it well, This simple pseudocode for a device will consume the daily limit for 75.000 users.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="hljs">login <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> user <span class="hljs-operator">in</span> <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> app (<span class="hljs-number">1</span> API call * device = <span class="hljs-number">50.000</span>)
<span class="hljs-built_in">read</span> <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> list <span class="hljs-operator">of</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">items</span> (<span class="hljs-number">1</span> API call * device = <span class="hljs-number">50.000</span>)
<span class="hljs-built_in">send</span> <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> push notification <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> all <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> users (<span class="hljs-built_in">from</span> <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> web console, <span class="hljs-operator">not</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">from</span> device) (<span class="hljs-number">50.000</span> API calls)
<span class="hljs-built_in">read</span> <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> list <span class="hljs-operator">of</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">items</span> (<span class="hljs-number">1</span> API call * device = <span class="hljs-number">50.000</span>)
<span class="hljs-built_in">send</span> another push notification <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> all <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> users (<span class="hljs-built_in">from</span> <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> web console, <span class="hljs-operator">not</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">from</span> device) (<span class="hljs-number">50.000</span> API calls)
</code></pre><p>So, in practice, you only can send 1 or 2 push notifications before consume all your daily credit. Ok, it&#39;s free plan, what you wanted?</p>
<p>Then you make a great effort for your 50.000 users and jump to Appcelerator platform. You grow a little and you have now 100.000 users</p>
<ul>
<li>Appcelerator Platform: 500,000 API calls per day or 10 Million per month. Uh? You pay the price and only have double API calls per day? I doubled my users and I&#39;m now in the same situation that with free plan: only 1-2 pushes per day.</li>
</ul>
<p>This are not good plans.</p>
<p>I think Appcelerator must change it fast. Parse gives now UNLIMITED push notifications to devices, in other words, they counts only subscribed devices and you can send 1, 2 or 10 push notifications to 50.000 users, and you will not exceed the 1 Million limit for free (in the new plans it&#39;s not clarified, but they do not say nothing about 1 push = 1 API call, so it seems that push service is independent). And… you can buy more subscriptions for low prices, without the need of jump to an enterprise plan.</p>
<p>And Parse it&#39;s not the only one. ApiOmat also offers push notifications by device number, with unlimited pushes, and they sell you packs of 50.000 devices for low prices, so you can grow easily.</p>
<p>For now I will use Appcelerator with for push notifications for little projects, but I think you must re-think the push service and get the market tendency of unlimited pushes.</p>
<p>In any case, thanks for this great platform, I&#39;m proud of all what you accomplished and today Appcelerator is an incredible and helpful platform.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>A few thoughts;</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have 50k-100k users then I imagine you are making money?</li>
<li>If you have those users and are not making money then I hope you have investment to keep yo going until you do.</li>
<li>Either way with those numbers surely you would not expect someone else to pay the bill for your users of your app for the services you provide to your users?</li>
<li>Side note; Should everything be free? Nice world but we are not there yet.</li>
<li>You are not restricted to using the ACS versions of anything - not happy - use someone else&#39;s service with Titanium</li>
<li>You are welcome to create your own server side cloud implementation - many do, offers greater control when you scale and all in house.  You can even create your own push notification server - nothing stopping you doing that ether.</li>
</ul>
<p>I must say that whilst I think the paid version is too big a financial jump from the free version - you are forgetting that the cost does not simply purchase another set of push and api calls.  It provided SLAs, telephone support, access to enterprise level modules and more.  You may not need any of those other things - but that does not mean they have no value.</p>
<p>5 million push notifications per month is a large number without you having to pay a fee or manage the infrastructure yourself.  If it does not match the needs of your largely successful app then should you really still be getting things for free?  The leg up that Appcelerator provides suits those who are starting up not at the level you appear to be.</p>
<p>Saying all that; there are many push services that offer many different free and paid levels.  They also have different degrees of implementation times and difficulties.  So the choice becomes.</p>
<p>As Stephen says; what would you pay, but I go further; &quot;at what point should you consider your large requirement of push notifications puts you out of a free band and not a band more suited to the obvious success you are receiving through the free Titanium Studio&quot;?</p>

										<p><p>Hi Malcom and Stephen.</p>
<p>First responding Stephen briefly: my wish is to pay as I grow. Actually with Appcelerator I can go for free or for all. I think it&#39;s so radical. Intermediate steps will be welcome.</p>
<p>Malcom, I really appreciate your comments, but I&#39;m writing this post only to show the weaknesses so that Appcelerator can improve and be the best for a long time. There are a lot of cases for a lot of developers, but you cannot generalize.</p>
<p>Can you have 50-100k users without win money? Of course, if you are trying to get a critic mass to be relevant or &quot;visible&quot; to others. Even that number of users is low depending on the service.</p>
<p>I&#39;m alone, no investors, no money, just ideas to make a product and see if it works. But I cannot pass from a free to an expensive contract just because I grow. I need to grow consistently and waste money at the same rate.</p>
<p>My personal opinion is that nothing must be &quot;for free&quot;, I don&#39;t like &quot;the all free&quot; wave that exists, because our work is not for free, but again, the Appcelerator jump is so, so big from free to pay.</p>
<p>And that is the reason because I was looking for other push notifications providers, to mix it with Titanium. In fact, actually I have a product that uses Node.ACS but uses ApiOmat push notifications, because is the only way I can grow step by step, if my user number grows. And what I would like is to be able to do the same with Appcelerator.</p>
<p>I cannot build from scratch all what you propose, you know exactly all the dificulties I will find if I try to do it.</p>
<p>Finally, I know that the paid version offers much more things than more pushes, but I don&#39;t need all those things, except for SLAs which are good. But let me say that there is <em>another</em> issue with the paid version: if I need to duplicate my users again, from 100.000 to 200.000 daily (as in my example) I need to pay again… the same amount. So basically, the more users I have, the more money I lose (in my case, obviously, where I only need push notifications).</p>
<p>But don&#39;t misunderstand me: I don&#39;t want to win money without waste my money. I want to pay, or, at least, I want to be able to pay. But today I cannot see the way to do it fully inside Appcelerator.</p>
<p>Again, thank you for your great efforts. This community is really great.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Stephen, please read my answer to Malcom.</p>
<p>My wish is to pay as I grow. Actually with Appcelerator I can go for free or for all. I think it&#39;s so radical. Intermediate steps will be welcome, or even have the option to pay for individual components, e.g., be able to increase only push notifications without getting the full (and expensive) pack.</p>
