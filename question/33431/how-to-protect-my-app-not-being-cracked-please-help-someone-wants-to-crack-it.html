			<h1>How to protect my app, not being cracked! Please help, someone wants to crack it!</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,<br>I finally released my paid app last week.<br>I look up Google searching for any pirate copies of my app are in process of being cracked. In fact, I found one guy asking for a cracked version of my app.</p>
<p>Please is there anyway I can protect my app?<br>Is there a unique transaction ID from the AppStore for legal users who purchased the app so I can verify each user against a callback from my server. So, I can catch the cracked copy and shut them down?</p>
<p>Also, is there a method to shut the app down?</p>
<p>Thank you, please help me!<br>This sucks!</p>

							<p>There is no unique callback ID you can verify as far as I know.</p>
<p>What you can do is try to access something outside your apps sandbox; if that works, you can quite safely assume that you are on a jailbroken phone.</p>
<p>Please note, however, that not all apps running on a jailbroken phone have to be pirated.</p>
<p>You can get around piracy by making only a free app and adding premium features as an in-app purchase. One of the upcoming Mobile SDK releases will support this.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you for helping!<br>But a jailbroken app doesn&#39;t really mean that the user has a pirate copy!<br>Do you have any idea when is the &quot;in-app purchases are coming&quot; ?</p>
<p>Also, I&#39;m wondering if I can read the signature in the info.plist from my app, I think I can catch a cracked version of my app!</p>
<p>Thank you friend!</p>
