							<p>Hi</p>
<p>There is no magic switch to make your app go faster as your short question implies you are hoping for.</p>
<p>There are many factors why an app would be slow and it is your job to test for them and improve each section of your app at a time.  This is what all developer should all do.</p>
<p>As you have not said if this is Android, iOS something else or a combination these will be generic.</p>
<p>Here are a few things your app might be doing that you should take a look at;</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding too many views at the same time to a loading window</li>
<li>Having too many images in any view but particularly tableViews (this is where people normally go wild), consider reduce the number, loading as needed, caching the images locally</li>
<li>If you call any APIs of your own, test them for performance;<ul>
<li>how quickly do they return the actual data before you process it</li>
<li>return too many items at the same time - lazy load results instead</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Have to many windows open at once, be smart about when to add new windows, consider caching previous window contents (not easy for newbies)</li>
<li>Display lists of things - where the list is massive</li>
<li>Access db locally and return lots of data at once, call often but smaller</li>
<li>App contains many assets, reduce the number of the assets if possible, run images through lossless compression routines, photographic images save as jpeg and play with quality settings</li>
</ul>
<p>You should determine actual bottlenecks by storing the time it takes to start a window open and when it completes, when you call an api and it returns the result and then when it has finished processing that data - and so on.</p>
<p>Once you have this data - look for the biggest and narrow down the problem and reduce the times by the methods above.  Then go to the next highest bottleneck and repeat.</p>
<p>Keep in mind not all hardware is equal, older Androids are very slow - not much you can do about that unless you reduce the things in the app which is not smart - so just know they will be.  Test on as many devices you can get your hands on - real physical devices - the emulators and simulators can be good - but real world testing is the only proper way to go.</p>
