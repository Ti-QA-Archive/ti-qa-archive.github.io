			<h1>Bus Errors, Bad Access - Any Ideas For Tracking Down?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We have an app that for the most part runs great, but every once in a while and pretty unpredictably the app will crash and in the console it says &quot;BUS ERROR 10&quot; and EXC_BAD_ACCESS</p>
<p>Any ideas for tracking this problem down, or what might be causing it in terms of the javascript code? Assuming it means we&#39;re trying to access something in memory that no longer exists but I&#39;m not sure what to look for to track that down.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>Many of these items are cross context calls (e.g. directly calling a function that was originally defined in another window). The 1.7 SDK added new memory management handling to Titanium, which has caused items to stay in scope less than it used to. For example attaching a function to a window on creation and calling it is <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-4618">no longer recommended</a>.</p>
<p>There are numerous posts &amp; tickets surrounding these issues and while I believe most of these items are probably developers doing cross context calls, there still might be a few of these items that will need to be corrected in the SDK itself.</p>
<p>You may want to read through the comments&#x2F;answers of these questions for ideas:</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Be sure to expand all of the comments. Personally, I am reworking my app to executed within a single context. Not easy, but better long term.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Mike, this is super helpful. I&#39;ll have a look through the links you posted. For a different app we had converted to a single context but had no end of memory management issues to the point where we had to split back out into multiple contexts. This was using 1.6 however, so maybe 1.7 will be better?</p>
<p>How is your memory usage as you switch to a single context? Is it a complex app?</p>

										<p><p>My app is complex, perhaps overly so. I had been using Ti.App to store global namespaces off of. The 1.7 SDK pretty much has put a stop to that, though I did make my own minor changes to the SDK which helped out, but not enough.</p>
<p>So far, I&#39;m only 3 days into the single context rewrite and so far it is looking good. Though I will say, I didn&#39;t completely understand how to do single context correctly until diving into the Tweetanium source and asking lots of questions here.</p>
<p>You might look at the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.krawaller.se&#x2F;titanium-application-structure-learning-from">Struct project</a> for an idea how to layout single context apps.</p>
<p>Additionally, I would recommend looking at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;122521&#x2F;learning-more-about-titanium---a-reading-list">this quesiton</a>.</p>
<p>That is not to say you are doing it incorrectly, just that if you didn&#39;t think of the approach that is being taken by most developers I could see it not turning out so well. It took me awhile to grip the concepts.</p>
<p>As for will 1.7 be better for your single context app. I would suspect so, being as objects in memory have been clamped down more. Though you might just be going from things in memory too long to not long enough. You will just have to try and see.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Mike. All really helpful. I don&#39;t use the global namespace for much except a couple variables, for example storing the currently logged in user. Is this a no-no or is it more about functions?</p>
<p>Single-context is appealing in general so I may need to start shifting in that direction. Would love to hear any more lessons you learn as you migrate your app that way.</p>

										<p><p>It depends on what you mean by global namespace. If you mean appending to Ti.App this is officially a no-no. Prior to 1.7 it simply wasn&#39;t recommended, but worked just fine.</p>
<p>Since you are only using simple variables, it likely won&#39;t crash, but it is not the right way to do things. The Appcelerator team seems to indicate some changes are coming that will break this even more in future releases, so I would migrate away from it before you are forced to do so (as I was with 1.7).</p>

										<p><p>Good to know. Yes I&#39;m talking about appending variables to Ti.App – so sounds like we&#39;ll have to stop doing that! Thanks.</p>
