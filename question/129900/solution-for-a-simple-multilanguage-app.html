			<h1>Solution for a simple multilanguage app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello</p>
<p>I am quite new to Titanium and also no veteran JS coder so please be patient with me.</p>
<p>I have a simple app which I am looking into translating to english and german. I have so far not quite figured out the best way to do it.</p>
<p>There is of course the &quot;proper&quot; way of doing it using i18n and externalize all strings. What I don&#39;t understand is, would it then be possible for me to let the user set the desired language from within the application or is it depending on the system locale and language? For example I need someone with ie. a Danish locale to use the english version of my app.</p>
<p>Is there perhaps a simpler way of dealing with multiple languages?</p>

							<p>Hi Johan. In fact, i18n files are quite easy. While in other languages and platforms internationalization is a nightmare, in Titanium is really really fast and easy to maintain.</p>
<p>Regard your question, by default the user will not be able to select which language to use if their local language is not supported by your app. You can easily emulate other languages changing iPhone or Android settings (on iPhone emulator, goto settings &gt; general &gt; international &gt; languange). This way, you can see what the user will see.</p>
<p>You can create your own locale resource system, but I suggest you to use i18n and try supporting the most popular languages for your users.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you very much Javier, I am starting to see the benefits of doing it the proper way. If a certain language is not supported by the app is it possible to implement fallback to a default language, i.e. English?</p>

										<p><p>Johan,</p>
<p>I believe that En is the default if the user&#39;s language is not available.</p>

										<p><p>I agree with Stephen, but I can&#39;t assure since I&#39;ve never seen this afirmation in any apple doc (probably it is somewhere :)). Neither I know what happens if you do not support english. Anyway, you can test as I said before.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, I will do some tests to verify but it does sound reasonable to have english as default language. I can&#39;t really think of a plausible alternative.</p>
