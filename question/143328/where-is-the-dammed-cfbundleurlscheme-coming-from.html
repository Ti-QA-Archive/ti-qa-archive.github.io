			<h1>Where is the dammed CFBundleURLScheme coming from?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am ready to launch an app called 123 Magic Toolkit. The problem is that validation fails if the CFBundle scheme does not start with a letter. I tried changing everything but the actual app name (that has to stay the same) and Titanum keeps building an info.plist entry with 123magictoolkit.</p>
<p>I am assuming that Titanium is auto generating the value based on the app name. I had read about a way to have Titanium produce a custom CFBundleScheme and it does insert the new one into the info.plist file but also leaves the incorrect one.</p>
<p>Is this something I can change by hand after Titanium generates the info.plist?</p>

										<p><p>According to the thread you entered it as a bug, right?</p>
<p>I changed the package info.plist by hand and it validated and uploaded to the app store. It&#39;s waiting for review now.</p>
<p>Is there a reason I cannot do this in the meantime?</p>

										<p><p>I think the bug was that the settings from tiapp.xml were being duplicated or not carried over.</p>
<p>The user in that thread had a dirty custom info.plist (its buried down in the comments)</p>
