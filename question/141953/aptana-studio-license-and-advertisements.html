			<h1>Aptana Studio license and advertisements</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Reading the terms and conditions here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;www&#x2F;appc-appexplore-agreement.pdf it says (last few sentences of point 2.3) that Appcelerator can place ads within the Apps that are built using Appcelerator products.</p>
<p>Please could you tell me if this is applicable only if we use Titanium Studio as the IDE for development or does Appcelerator still hold the right to place random ads in the apps if we use the Aptana Studio as the IDE (instead of the Titanium Studio). </p>
<p>Since Aptana is open source under GPL , while Titanium Studio is under Appcelerator&#39;s license - which has a free and commercial plan, I would believe that Appcelerator would not place any ads if we use Aptana Studio.</p>
<p>Also, technically, is the origin of the ads into the Apps the Titanium SDK or the Studio&#x2F;IDE?</p>
<p>Please let me know as this is a very important issue for us.</p>

							<p>Vineet,</p>
<p>Thanks for your inquiry. As you suggested, the Aptana Studio SDK is under the terms of the GPL license (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;copyleft&#x2F;gpl.html). The AppExplore EULA, which Titanium Studio uses, does not apply with use of the Aptana Studio SDK. You can refer to the GPL license for more information on using Aptana Studio SDK. </p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Greg</p>

										<p><p>Dear Greg, Thanks for your answer. I have looked at the GPL license however it does not mention anything around ads. The link you have sent is to the GPL license terms in general however in context of Aptana IDE use, please could you help me understand if Appcelerator holds the right to place ads in apps even if we use Apatna IDE (instead of Titanium Studio). </p>
<p>We plan to use the apps built using (Titanium developer + Aptana Studio + Titanium SDK) for commercial purposes (i.e. for our clients - to be submitted to App Store &#x2F; Google Play marketplace). </p>
<p>If we develop apps using the software mentioned above, does that still fall under the AppExplore plan ? and secondly please could you clarify if Appcelerator can still place ads into the apps. (please note that we do not use ACS)</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>Vineet,</p>
<p>The AppExplore EULA (and the right to display ads) would not apply to the set of components you&#39;re referring to. Taking this approach though would prevent you from utilizing key features of TiStudio (debugging for instance). </p>
<p>If you are concerned about any stipulations in the AppExplore EULA, I would recommend looking at the App Accelerate Standard or other enterprise versions of Studio.   </p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Greg</p>
