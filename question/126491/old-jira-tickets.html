			<h1>Old JIRA tickets</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Are there any plans to resolve&#x2F;close older JIRA tickets? It seems to me that they are being ignored, but, IMHO, there are number of important older tickets waiting to be resolved while newer tickets (and some of them are not so important) are constantly being resolved.</p>
<p>Correct me if I&#39;m wrong. :)</p>
<p>Thanks for an answer.</p>

										<p><p>Matt, I&#39;m talking in general. There are tickets that are very old, for example:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-60">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-60</a></p>
<p>That one affects Titanium version 0.5!</p>
<p>There are about 1700 opened tickets and it is hard to track and find useful tickets in that mess. I think old tickets should be checked and closed if they are not valid anymore.</p>
<p>Also, some older tickets are IMHO badly prioritized. For example, this one: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-3378">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-3378</a> is reported in version 1.6, it has &quot;trivial&quot; priority and fix version is &quot;TBS&quot; (to be scheduled). That functionality is the most basic functionality that there is.</p>
<p>What&#39;s the point in having &quot;add&quot; functionality if &quot;remove&quot; doesn&#39;t work? What if &quot;add&quot; method would not work and &quot;remove&quot; would work? :D</p>
<p>I really don&#39;t understand how this issues can be &quot;irrelevant&quot; while other issues that are edge cases are being solved very quickly. </p>
<p>For example, take a look at this issue: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-5388">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-5388</a></p>
<p>It&#39;s resolved immediately, while the problem is the edge case (who starts file names with underscore anyway …).</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t seen this kind of ticket solving behavior in any other product. I don&#39;t mean to be offensive, I would really like to see quality in Titanium (and there are positive steps in that direction) like the one that exists in other products.</p>
<p>I hope you&#39;ll find my arguments valid. :)</p>

										<p><p>Ivan makes a good point. I&#39;ve using Titanium since v1, and been an active watcher in the bug tracker and QA. The prioritizing of tickets have never made sense to me. It&#39;s clear that you&#39;ve always prioritized features over stability&#x2F;bugs, that&#39;s your choice, but what is somewhat annoying is all the bug reports that aren&#39;t even reviewed. It&#39;s not really tempting to post bug reports when I know they&#39;re never going to be reviewed and fixed. You should go through all old tickets, close the ones that&#39;s already fixed, and prioritize the rest.</p>

										<p><p>What they&#39;re talking about in that blog post is for new tickets. Something must be done with the old ones too. And if you read the comment by Matthew, it still seems to be an issue.</p>
