			<h1>Cannot call property fieldCount in object [Ti.TiResultSet]</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am porting the code from an iOS app to an android app. </p>
<p>I am getting this error in my code -</p>
<p>org.mozilla.javascript.EcmaError: TypeError: Cannot call property fieldCount in object [Ti.TiResultSet]. It is not a function, it is &quot;number&quot;.</p>
<p>What is Ti.TiResultSet - I thought it was &quot;Titanium.Database.ResultSet&quot;, which has the method fieldCount. Then right after that, I get an Cursor not closed exception - </p>
<p> Finalizing a Cursor that has not been deactivated or closed. database = &#x2F;data&#x2F;data&#x2F;com.intel.vaandroid&#x2F;databases&#x2F;vadb, table = null, query = SELECT  i.*, strftime(&#39;%m&#39;,created) as posted_month, strftime(&#39;%Y&#39;,created) as posted_year, category<br>E&#x2F;Cursor  (  269): android.database.sqlite.DatabaseObjectNotClosedException: Application did not close the cursor or database object that was opened here</p>
<p>I am closing the resultset after reading it though. </p>
<p>Does anyone know?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Sri</p>

							<p>Ti.TiResultSet is the internal object type of what was complained about in the error message.  It is what gets returned when you use execute a Select command.</p>
<p>The <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;latest&#x2F;Titanium.Database.ResultSet.fieldCount-method.html">fileCount</a> is documented as being a method – that is you must add the () to the end to distinguish it as a function instead of a variable.</p>
<p>However, I recall reading in a previous Q&amp;A that the iOS and Android mobile SDKS differed in this regard.  One had as a method, thus you need:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> count</span> = resultSet.fieldCount();
</code></pre><p>while the other had it as a property, thus you need:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> count</span> = resultSet.fieldCount;
</code></pre><p>I have not needed to use the fieldCount, and I don&#39;t remember which OS needed which of the above.  I just recall it being mentioned in a thread here once.  OTOH, maybe that has been corrected and is now consistent.</p>
<p>Just something to try.</p>

										<p><p>Doug,<br>Thanks for your immediate response. I tried what you said and made it just a field instead of a method. I also tried &quot;getFieldCount()&quot;. Now I get this error instead - </p>
<p>Javascript Exception: Cannot convert _id to java.lang.Integer<br>E&#x2F;TiScriptRunner(  270): org.mozilla.javascript.EvaluatorException: Cannot convert _id to java.lang.Integer</p>
<p>Any idea?</p>

										<p><p>Or maybe this is a different error and the fieldCount error did get fixed. Let me look into this again.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

										<p><p>It won&#39;t be getFieldCount(), and SHOULD be fieldCount() since it is documented as a method and not a property.</p>
<p>I just remember reading in the Q&amp;A that someone had trouble with it in one OS (don&#39;t recall which one) and discovered it used a property name instead of a method.</p>
<p>OK, found it.  Look <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;15001&#x2F;bug-fieldcount-a-property-on-android-function-on-iphone">here</a>.  It says that in android it is a property, so try resultSet.fieldCount.  And that a ticket for it (still open) exists <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC-267">here</a>.</p>

										<p><p>Ok that worked! Just using fieldCount as a property on a ResultSet for android, worked great.</p>
<p>So for Android, it is - rs.fieldCount<br>for iOS it is - rs.fieldCount()</p>
<p>Phew! This error is fixed - now I will attack the rest - which is quite a few more….</p>
<p>Thanks for your help, Doug!</p>
