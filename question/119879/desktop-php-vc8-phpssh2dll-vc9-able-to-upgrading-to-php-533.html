			<h1>Desktop, PHP VC8, php_ssh2.dll VC9, Able to upgrading to php 5.3.3?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Ok, so I need to use the php_ssh2.dll file, I found that the location for the dl() function to gain access to the dll&#39;s is to put the dll&#39;s into the C:&#x2F;php5&#x2F; folder. For my project this is not an issue, the issue comes down to the following error after the dl() function tries to initialize the php_ssh2.dll.</p>
<p>Warning: dl(): ssh2: Unable to initialize module</p>
<p>Module    compiled with build ID=API20090626,TS,VC9</p>
<p>PHP    compiled with build ID=API20090626,TS,VC8</p>
<p>These options need to match</p>
<p>I&#39;ve looked all over the internets for a VC8 version of the ssh2 dll, but found &quot;work arounds from vc9 to vc8&quot; and non-working &quot;vc8&quot; versions of the ssh2 dll. None of this works, so my next bet was to try and upgrade PHP, from 5.3.1, to php 5.3.3, which I read somewhere is &quot;VC9&quot;.</p>
<p>Not fully understanding what the &quot;VC&quot; is in the first place, is what confuses me further.</p>
<p>Is it possible to select a higher version of php to be installed? Or is it possible to install it with &quot;VC9&quot; or what ever?!?</p>
<p>Else</p>
<p>Does anyone know where I can get an ssh2.dll thats VC8? Or know how to get the ssh2.dll to work at all within Titanium Developer?</p>

							<p>Hmmm, after a long deep search of the internets, I found the issue to be more on the side of PHP then on Titanium Developer. So here is the fix I finally figured out… As weird as it sounds…</p>
<p>The issue with php_ssh2.dll is the VC#, ONLY that… so no need to re-compile the dll in Visual C++ 2005 (VC8) from its original Visual C++ 2008 (VC9), all you have to do is go download XVI32 (a free hex editor) http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chmaas.handshake.de&#x2F;delphi&#x2F;freeware&#x2F;xvi32&#x2F;xvi32.htm</p>
<p>Then open the php_ssh2.dll with XVI32, do a search for VC9 in the text string. Once found, change 9 in VC9 to 8, save, and try again. This now works.</p>
<p>Also, as above says, you have to put the dll into the C:&#x2F;php5&#x2F; folder, and call it inside php with the dl() function.</p>
