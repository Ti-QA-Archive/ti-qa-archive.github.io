			<h1>change splash screen??? ANDROID</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I would like to get rid of the &quot;Appcelerator&quot; splash screen with triangle A logo and replace it with my own. I have made a default.png with lower case &quot;d&quot; in every size and placed them in the appropriate Android sub directory such as :</p>
<p>Resources\android\images\res-long-land-hdpi</p>
<p>When I try to deploy the application to the device I keep getting the following error:</p>
<p>Failure [INSTALL_PARSE_FAILED_INCONSISTENT_CERTIFICATES]</p>
<p>Nothing else has changed in my app except that yesterday I created a certificate and signed my app for deployment to the Market. I am not trying to package for deployment now. I am trying to test my changed splash screen on my phone, using Studio to run it on my phone.</p>
<p>Finally, I copied all the original, red appcelerator default.png files back to the various directories and I get the same error when trying to deploy.</p>
<p>What has happened to break my app???</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>Actually nothing..</p>
<p>I am guessing you installed your distribution version on your phone.</p>
<p>If you now want to put a development version on you will first have to delete the distribution version off your phone.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
