			<h1>Odd crash with WebView</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>I am developing an app that is using a WebView and evalJS to modify its contents. The app is quite dynamic, so there are quite a few calls going to evalJS.</p>
<p>I use the app for a few minutes, and then it inevitably crashes with the following error in the console:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-type">bool</span> _WebTryThreadLock(<span class="hljs-type">bool</span>), <span class="hljs-number">0x7df8c40</span>: <span class="hljs-type">Tried</span> to obtain the web lock <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> a thread other than the main thread <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> the web thread. <span class="hljs-type">This</span> may be a <span class="hljs-literal">result</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> calling to <span class="hljs-type">UIKit</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> a secondary thread. <span class="hljs-type">Crashing</span> now...
</code></pre><p>Any idea how to fix this?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<div><p>More info that may be significant:</p>
<p>Much of the calls to evalJS take place in a timer (delayed function call via setTimeout). The error seems to suggest that I am trying to access the webview from the wrong thread. Do timeouts run in the main thread? If not this could be the problem?</p>

							<div><p>Hi,<br>From what I understand, there is a memory leak associated with setTimeout. </p>
<p>Are your timeouts and evalJS, etc. being set in the main application code? Or in script elements within the html of the webview?</p>

							<div><p>Yes being sent from the main application. So setTimeout (which triggers evalJS after the delay) is in appcelerator code.</p>

							<div><p>OK. What are your evalJS calls evaluating? If it&#39;s simply JSON data, you should use JSON.parse instead. </p>
<p>It would help if you could make a small test app which does part of what you&#39;re trying to do to localise the issue. </p>
<p>If you have various functions and scripts in differnt &#39;contexts&#39; then this will also cause problems.</p>
<p>Also, you didn&#39;t mention which platform you&#39;re developing for (Android, iPhone, iPad) and also what Ti SDK version.</p>

							<div><p>iPad Ti SDK 1.6.2. Maybe I need to upgrade?</p>
<p>The evalJS calls are sending lists of elements that need to be changed inside the webview. So the outer appcelerator code is loading data from a database and sending it to the webview to be displayed. The data is passed into the webview as json encoded data surrounded by a function call.</p>
<p>I suspect this issue may be triggered when evalJS tries to call the webview when its still running the previous command, as a) if I reduce the time taken inside the webview (return instantly for example) it works fine and b) the error suggests its trying to obtain a lock to wait for the previous command to finish.</p>
<p>I have experimented putting all appcelerator code in one app.js file. Same issue occurs.</p>
<p>I will try to produce a localised test case.</p>

							<div><p>Any reason why you&#39;re using a webView at all, instead of a tableView or scrollView? </p>
<p>And yes, I would definitely upgrade from 1.6.2.  1.7.2 is the latest now.</p>

							<div><p>Yes, using a table view was very slow. Each update moves (or adds &#x2F; removes) many elements to the display. It appears using standard appcelerator components caused the layout to update on each change (e.g. every time I added or removed a view) and this caused the application to crawl. Its much faster in a webview.</p>
<p>I will update and see if the issue remains.</p>

							<p>Hi,<br>Without seeing some of the specific code you&#39;re using in your app, it&#39;s impossible to help out.</p>

										<p><p>Unfortunately its a huge project, so hard to share. I will see if I can isolate it as a self-contained issue.</p>
<p>I was mostly wondering if anyone with experience of iOs could give a hint as to what may cause the above. It seems a thread based issue, so may be core to appcelerator.</p>
