			<p>I would like to write an HTML mail, where I reference attached images and<br>understand this can be done with Mime Messages: </p>
<ul>
<li>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.faqs.org&#x2F;rfcs&#x2F;rfc1873.html</li>
<li>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.faqs.org&#x2F;rfcs&#x2F;rfc2387.html</li>
</ul>
<p>Is this possible with the existing Appcelerator email dialog? </p>
<p>If not, could you make available a &#39;Content-Type&#39; property, allowing me<br>to write the necessary header myself?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I think you are referring to embedding as appossed to attaching, but just in case you do just mean attaching there is a sample code set below.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var emailDialog = <span class="hljs-type">Ti</span>.<span class="hljs-type">UI</span>.createEmailDialog<span class="hljs-literal">()</span>
emailDialog.subject = <span class="hljs-string">"Hello from Titanium"</span>;
emailDialog.toRecipients = [<span class="hljs-symbol">'foo</span>@yahoo.com'];
emailDialog.messageBody = <span class="hljs-char">'&lt;b&gt;Appcelerator Titanium Rocks!&lt;/b&gt;'</span>;
var f = <span class="hljs-type">Ti</span>.<span class="hljs-type">Filesystem</span>.getFile(<span class="hljs-symbol">'cricket</span>.wav');
emailDialog.addAttachment(f);
emailDialog.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span><span class="hljs-literal">()</span>;
</code></pre><p>If you do mean embedding (old phrase from original email specs I have not read in years), where images are attached inline and can be directly referenced from inside the HTML - then, according to the docs no.</p>
<p>There is no provision to add an attachment as an embedded image as that is encoded differently than a simple attachment, which I guess you already know as you refer to the headers.</p>
<p>There is no low level access to the email headers or attachment headers either, so that will not work.</p>
<p>There is one possibility but I am not near my dev machine to test.  Add an attachment using a specific file name and then try referencing that file, make sure the folder path is simple or matched.  This has worked in some email clients for me in the past, but it is hit and miss.</p>
<p>Lastly (and if you are brave) you could uses sockets to send the email yourself and encoding the attachments and embeds as base64 but you will have to handle ALL the server side comma and handshaking.  It can be a pain, or at least it was 12 years ago when I built my first email marketing server app.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Malcolm, </p>
<p>thanks for summing that up for me.<br>I was looking for a way to embed images into a multipart message. As far as I can see,<br>all that&#39;s preventing me to do so, is I cannot set the appropriate headers on<br>an email. Wikipedia has an example of how such a multipart message looks like<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;MIME#Multipart_messages</p>
<p>Maybe a future version of Appcelerator can offer more configuration options here.</p>
<p>For the time being, I will use jspdf. According to another thread here, you got that<br>working with images, right :)</p>
<p>So if that works, I&#39;m good. Thanks a lot.</p>

										<p><p>You are welcome, writing your own wrapping is painful and not fulfilling in any way, so yes hopefully it is something that will be added later or becomes available as a module in the market place.</p>
<p>As to jsPDF with Ti image support, yes I have cracked it.  It is currently in private beta but fully working, I am hoping to add GIF and PNG support but for now it is JPEG images only.  If you want in, send me a <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;devlink&#x2F;profile&#x2F;427941&#x2F;malcolm-hollingsworth">DevMail</a> and I will email you the details and a link to download the revised libraries and example app..</p>
