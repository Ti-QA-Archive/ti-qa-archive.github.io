			<h1>MobileWeb and Pickers...</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I was trying to use a date picker in MobileWeb, however, even though the picker renders properly, the values don&#39;t seem to be available… (getting errors where the picker doesn&#39;t pass the value that is clicked). I imported the latest Kitchen Sink to take a look, but turns out that the Picker is not an object that KS exposes when you run it in a mobile browser… So does that mean that the Picker object is not supported in MobileWeb or has problems? </p>

							<p>Unfortunately browser support for date-picker is really spotty. If you check out <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;caniuse.com&#x2F;input-datetime">Can I Use</a> you will see that only Opera fully supports it. For what it&#39;s worth, the Mobile Web platform does support them on browsers that support them natively.</p>

										<p><p>You could create a mobile web module (not a CommonJS module) that wraps a 3rd party library that offers a date picker, although it might be difficult to integrate the UI depending on the architecture of the 3rd party lib.</p>
