			<h1>Resources folder in alloy, works on simulator, doesn&#39;t work on device</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>###Background</p>
<p>I published version 1 of my app before Alloy was released, and I am now preparing to publish an update which is the entire app rewritten using Alloy.  </p>
<p>in the first version of the app I used an sqlite database to track the reports submitted by the user. In the Alloy version of the app I am storing this information in a collection (which is again stored with sqlite).</p>
<p>###Problem<br>What I want to do is: Get every record from the old .sqlite database (which was stored in Resources &#x2F; models) and store them as models in my Alloy collection.</p>
<p>This works fine in the simulator. I have tried it a few times, and it works no worries. But It doesn&#39;t work on my iPhone. The code that causes the error is::</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    var databasePath = '/models/app_data.sqlite',
          databaseName  = 'databaseName';

    //<span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">check</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> previous reports
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> db = Ti.<span class="hljs-keyword">Database</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">install</span>(databasePath, databaseName);</span>  

    db.execute('<span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> * <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> savedRecords<span class="hljs-string">');</span></span>
</code></pre><p>##Summary<br>If I install the first version of my app on my iPhone this same code still works fine. </p>
<p>If I run this code in my alloy app in the simulator it works fine.</p>
<p>If I run this code in my alloy app on my device is fails and gives the error &quot;db is not an Object&quot;</p>
<p>I am testing with an iPhone 3GS running iOS 6<br>Alloy 1.1.3<br>Titanium 3.1.1</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

							<div><p>Hi Tony,</p>
<ul>
<li>So the sqlite db was originally stored in my resources directory in a folder called &#39;models&#39; (this was pre alloy).</li>
<li>Sorry, you are correct there was more to the error.<pre><code class="hljs">{

  }
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<p>-I&#39;m not sure that this is exactly a test case, but the clearest illustration of this problem that I can think of so far is the different results between device and simulator for this code </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    <span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> resourcesDir</span> = Titanium.Filesystem.resourcesDirectory;
    <span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> dir</span> = Titanium.Filesystem.getFile(resourcesDir);
    <span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> dir_files</span> = dir.getDirectoryListing();

    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> i</span>=<span class="hljs-number">0</span>;i<span class="hljs-type">&lt;dir_files.length;i++){

        Ti.API.info(prefix + dir_files[i].toString());

    }</span>
</code></pre><p>I have pasted the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;13QfmXs">different outputs to a doc here </a> Again, the particular folder in question is called &#39;models&#39;. It is on the simulator and not on the device.</p>
<p>I can confirm that the file is actually still on the device somewhere because I can &#39;update&#39; the app on my device back to the non alloy version, and my report history is still intact.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time mate.</p>

							<div><p>No its not a test case. A test case would allow me to run it on my end and reproduce your issue. So the best I&#39;m going to be able to do is guess based on what you tell me.</p>
<p>The error is clearly telling you that you are using the wrong path to open the database file. I don&#39;t see anything named app_data.sqlite in that listing, so that would explain why you are getting the error. You are either attempting to reference the database by the wrong name, the path to it is incorrect (try withou or without a leading slash on the path), and also on iOS devices paths are case sensitive, so make sure that you have the proper casing in the filename as well.</p>

							<div><p>Hi Tony,</p>
<p>I&#39;m very sorry, I don&#39;t think I have explained clearly enough.</p>
<p>I understand that the error is indicating that there is a problem with the path to my db file. The next step I took to diagnose the issue is to print out a list of all the files in my resources folder. What I discovered from this is  <strong>When I update my old app with a new version written using Alloy, the contents of my resources folder are different on the device and on the simulator.</strong></p>
<p>So what my code can reproduce (and the output I provided confirms) is that there are folders and files that <strong>are on the device</strong> that I can&#39;t see when running an alloy app. I can see them on the simulator, and on a previous version of the app not written with alloy.</p>
<p>The steps to reproduce the error is</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an app without alloy, and in the resources folder create a subfolder called models, and in that folder create an sqlite db and add some records.</li>
<li>Create an updated app using Alloy and update from ver 1on the device. At this point you can no longer locate the sqlite file</li>
<li>update the app on the device back to the non alloy version, and the db records created on the device are still there. These records were created on the device, and (as far as I know?) couldn&#39;t have persisted anywhere but on the device.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, I really appreciate any advice or direction that I can get.</p>

							<p>The simulator is not case sensitive, yet devices are. So, if your db file name is something other than &#39;app_data.sqlite&#39; (all lowercase) then it will exhibit the behavior you describe. Also, have you tried without the leading slash on the databasePath?</p>

										<p><p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time mate. That is a great thought about the case of the file, unfortunately it is indeed all lower case.</p>
<p>I have tried a heap of variations without luck (including the use of Ti.Filesystem.resourcesDirectory &#x2F;  with and without the leading &#x2F;).</p>
