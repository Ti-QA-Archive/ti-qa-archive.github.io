			<p>Hi,<br>I have a couple of questions regarding Appcelerator&#39;s licensing policy for Enterprises. </p>
<ol>
<li>If want to develop an application for the employees of my company, do I have to pay a licensing fee? </li>
<li>If I do not want to purchase the enterprise plans mentioned in the page, http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;plans-pricing&#x2F;, can I still develop enterprise applications for my employees for free?<br>This information would be helpful in proceeding further.</li>
</ol>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>You can build any app for any audience for free.</p>
<p>The difference is if you need the &quot;extras&quot;, most of which relate to actual support (rather than just this Q&amp;A), performance testing, analytics, monitoring, live view and more.</p>
<p>The studios are basically the same, you can build the same apps, but you can manage the development process faster, easier and with less errors by using the &quot;extras&quot;.  But you can build the same apps.</p>
<p>I stress the &quot;same apps&quot; as they are the same apps - the tools and support are the big differences.  There will be extra modules available to the paid branch - so it would depend on what you need.</p>
<p>There are no licence fees for any of the versions, but for the enterprise editions you will need to keep up the service costs to continue using the benefits (plus minimum contract periods).</p>
<p>So if you want to create an app for a small, medium, large or enterprise - public or private audience you can do this with any of the strands - including the free one.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks a lot Malcolm. if i understand you right, i can build an app for free. And for support, I have to choose a plan. By &quot; you will need to keep up the service costs to continue using the benefits&quot;, you mean the 2 enterprise plans mentioned on the website right? Or is there any other cost?</p>

										<p><p>Just to clarify the paid strand is much more than just support, but not a different development system.</p>
<p>If you do choose to sign up to either of the paid plans then you will be subject to a minimum contract period and minimum number of users for that plan.  Included in those plans come all the extras.  If you decide after the initial contract period to cancel the paid plan then you loose the extras, but not the apps you have created so far.</p>
<p>There are extra costs, but not because of the plans.  Some modules in the market place are sold, some are rented.  The ACS plan has a level below which it is free, above you HAVE to swap to a paid plan.  If you exceed the paid plan levels there will be overage charges.  These extra costs will be shared with you before you reach them.  If you do get to these levels you will know you will need ot pay as you will be using a lot of the extras.</p>
<p>Remember though the initial ACS (push notifications cloud storage etc) are generous prior to having to pay for the first paid strand.</p>

							<p>The difference is if you need the &quot;extras&quot;, </p>
<p>Do I have to install these &quot;extras&quot; separately? In this case, I can be sure, that I wont use them.<br>Or are they already installed with Titanium - so I would not realize, that suddenly I have to pay licensing fees.</p>
<p>Just to make it clear - We all live from Licence fees, but I simply want to avoid surprising situations.</p>
