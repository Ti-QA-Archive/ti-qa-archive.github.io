		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m just curious, and possibly a little jaded, but is it possible that</p>
<ol>
<li>Nobody here really knows anything about development with Appcelerator beyond the absolute basics</li>
<li>Appcelerator Titanium&#39;s documentation is SO basic and incomplete and LACKING EXAMPLES, that getting anything advanced accomplished requires days, if not week of Googling</li>
<li>No one really wants to help</li>
<li>Appceleraor as a company WANTS to keep it&#39;s users in the dark in order to sell their training?</li>
<li>Beyond simple view&#x2F;table&#x2F;nav based apps, Appcelerator is simply not ready for prime-time?</li>
</ol>
<p>I could be WAY OFF and out of line, but having developed apps with xcode for years, it should not take me two weeks to figure out how to record an audio stream, how to make my buttons look nice, etc.. in Appcelerator!</p>

							<p>While I agree the docs have always been a bit thin on the ground, I find the KitchenSink exmaple application has nearly always been the place to find a basic sample of just about anything I have needed to build. </p>
<p>In order to go &#39;beyond the basics&#39;, for me it&#39;s been a question of learning-while-doing, trying out ideas and expanding on the examples out there. There are also many developers out there putting out tutorials themselves in how to do more things. </p>
<p>There is also a &#39;living&#39; document growing over on the Wiki here : http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F; which has a ton of ever-increasing information. </p>
<p>Regarding your point &#39;3&#39;: there are plenty of people here willing to help. :) Honest! </p>
<p>Regarding point 5: there&#39;s plenty you can do with the elements which Titanium provides which go way beyond simple view&#x2F;table&#x2F;nav apps. The only limitation is imagination and willingness to try out ideas. :)</p>
<p>Yes, the main documentation section here is awful, but I think they&#39;re working hard on ways to get all that up to scratch in a way that will be as useful to newcomers as it is to &#39;seasoned&#39; Titanium developers. </p>
<p>Don&#39;t give up. ;)</p>

										<p><p>ps: I use images to make my buttons looks nice ;) Pixel perfection is easy. Also, there&#39;s a demo of Sound recording in the KitchenSink app. See &#39;Phone&#39;[tab] &gt; Sound &gt; Record</p>

							<p>I think with any platform, the learning curve can be steep but its well worth the effort. And I agree with the posts here – use the kitchen sink as much as you can and try experimenting. Having just gone through the agony of creating an app with AIR for the Blackberry Playbook, I have a much better appreciation for the docs on Titanium :-)</p>

							<p>I dont know man, but I just switched from creating apps with the adobe AIR platform, and I&#39;m blown away from how easy it was.  Easy enough that I was able to port an app built in AS3 to appcelerator JS in less than a week, and the performance boost is off the charts.  Only thing i wish they had was better XML implementation.  </p>
<p>Going from Xcode i could see your point i guess.  I think this is still a new company and product that is on its way though.  Since i started a week or so ago, a new SDK has been released and a whole new IDE.  </p>
<p>to answer your questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Kitchen Sink</li>
<li>Kitchen Sink</li>
<li>Kitchen Sink</li>
<li>Kitchen Sink - but yes a company does have to make money, the SDK&#39;s are free remember</li>

							<p>I agree, but you&#39;re posting in the wrong spot.  They rarely respond to anything here in the forums.</p>
<p>However, its good for more than &quot;simple tableviews&quot;.  My app does a lot of geolocation and what not, has about 3k downloads in 3 days…so they did something right.</p>

							<p>A) no really, the documentation is lacking big time.</p>
<p>B) more then enough examples, the kitchensink provides with you with enough examples to start off with.</p>
<p>C) ppl do want to help, but i dont believe the amount of developers titanium has, cus its quite on the Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>D) i dont take your post to serious, you cant even keep your emotions under control</p>
<p>E) try to make an android and iphone app in xcode, ktnx bye.</p>
<hr>
<p>offtopic, Titanium could really use a REAL forum with sections and stuffs, this Q&amp;A is awfull for finding what you need at times</p>

							<p>if it takes you 2 weeks to figure out how to draw layouts with Titanium, I&#39;m not sure what you developed in xcode. Sorry dude, don&#39;t have my sympathy</p>
