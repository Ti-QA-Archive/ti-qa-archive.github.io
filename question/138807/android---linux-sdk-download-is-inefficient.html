			<h1>Android - linux SDK download is inefficient</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m sitting at a restaurant in an island in Spain on a slow café Internet connection, preparing for some android development, and are installing the android sdk. After downloading rev 18 from http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;sdk&#x2F;index.html which seems to be the only one available, pointing to the directory in Titanium Studio, it goes ahead and download rev 17!? <strong>Is this really necessary?</strong></p>

							<div><p>puh! Just 6 and a half hour of downloading extra stuff for Android development. And I thought that having Titanium Studio pre-installed was pretty much all I needed. Guess you only get how big the Android SDK really is when you&#39;re on a 50kbit line somewhere in Spain..</p>

							<p>Jon, It does need the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinja.ws&#x2F;Mwp7Sn">Desktop-SDK</a>.</p>
<p>It is also my guess that TiStudio still has verification code that looks for the Desktop SDK even though it isn&#39;t required&#x2F;supported. Until that check is removed, installing it is a viable workaround.</p>

										<p><p>Hmm…The ticket is <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TISTUD-1428">here</a>. Evidently I misspoke–we will still warn about it missing, though you don&#39;t need to install it in order to get out of the dialog box.</p>
<p>However, in Studio 2.1.1, we&#39;ve removed it entirely and are publishing it as a separate download for those who wish to use it.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m sorry I wasn&#39;t clear. I&#39;ve read the compatibility matrix. I was just pointing out a usability flaw in Titanium Studio, that has so far cost me 3 hours due to the slow Internet connection here.</p>
<p>Titanium Studio doesn&#39;t require rev 17 but works just fine with rev 18. Someone hard-coded this dependency, which is IMHO a mistake. The Android SDK is really a bootstrap for loading the APIs that Titanium requires, such as <em>Android SDK Platform-tools, revision 11</em> and <em>SDK Platform Android 2.2, API 8, revision 3</em>.</p>
<p>Aside from that I could point out another issue which Studio appear to want the Titanium SDK directory to be named <em>sdk</em> while it&#39;s in fact named <em>mobilesdk</em>.<br><strong>[Titanium SDK Home] The Desktop-SDK root path &#39;&#x2F;home&#x2F;napp&#x2F;.titanium&#x2F;sdk&#x2F;linux&#39; is not a directory</strong> from my terminal: <strong>~&#x2F;.titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;linux&#x2F;2.0.2.GA</strong> where <strong>~&#x2F;</strong> is <strong>&#x2F;home&#x2F;napp&#x2F;</strong></p>

										<p><p>woa @Chaim simultaneous post! You actually provided the best answer even though the original question was about something a little different.  If you could post the link as an answer I can mark it as best answer. BTW. do you know where Titanium Studio is saving the files it <em>auto</em> fetches (or is it just in-memory)?</p>

							<p>Titanium Studio is only going to download a version of the SDK if you don&#39;t point it to one initially.</p>
<p>So, the process is either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download Android SDK</li>
<li>Open Titanium Studio, start configuring Android and point to the existing Android SDK</li>
</ul>
<p>or</p>
<ul>
<li>Download Titanium Studio</li>
<li>Point to a folder on disk, and it will download the Android SDK into that location.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no hard-coded check inside Titanium Studio for a version of the Android SDK. There is only a link to download a known good version if the user doesn&#39;t have one installed. That link is updated regularly, but Google has rolled out a number of SDK releases very quickly.</p>

										<p><p>What you mean is that if I go through the Preferences wizard Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Aptana Studio -&gt; Titanium and select Android SDK Home, Titanium will detect the Android SDK? Pointing to the directory in the pop-up in Studio does not detect the SDK as I explained in the question.</p>
<p>Further more I&#39;m now installing Titanium Studio on a Windows Vista and have preinstalled the Oracle Java 6.0.33 JDK but Studio insist on downloading the 6.0.25 JDK.</p>
<p>All I&#39;m saying is that Titanium Studio is heavily missing feature detection on the system it&#39;s install on. Which is really apparent when you are on a slow Internet connection.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Jon,</p>
<p>We actually do a number of things to find Java–we see if we can find javac on the path, try and find Java under Program Files in a variety of configurations, and we don&#39;t install a new JDK unless we don&#39;t find an existing one. It seems you&#39;ve had a number of unexpected problems that shouldn&#39;t happen–if you would be so kind as to file a bug about them, it would be appreciated so we can figure them out.</p>
