			<p>ok, I have spent a lot of time just trying to install and set the whole thing up. It&#39;s not as easy as somebody claims to be and I am very disapointed before even launching my first HelloWorld example.</p>
<p>I have installed Titanium. I didn&#39;t know that I have to separately install Android SDK. I did this also. I remembered that I have to choose separate API levels due to a training I took few months ago when I was about to start working with Java. I did that (no need to mention the fact that this took ages and yet we live in 2012). I installed it. Created my Android AVD.</p>
<p>Created my first project, and when I try to launch it in my simulator i get this error.</p>
<p>An internal error occurred during: &quot;Launching Android Emulator&quot;.<br>java.lang.NullPointerException</p>
<p>Traceback (most recent call last):<br>  File &quot;C:\Users\George\AppData\Roaming\Titanium\mobilesdk\win32\1.8.1\android\builder.py&quot;, line 2021, in &lt;module&gt;<br>    s = Builder(project_name,sdk_dir,project_dir,template_dir,app_id)<br>  File &quot;C:\Users\George\AppData\Roaming\Titanium\mobilesdk\win32\1.8.1\android\builder.py&quot;, line 203, in <strong>init</strong><br>    temp_tiapp = TiAppXML(self.project_tiappxml)<br>  File &quot;C:\Users\George\AppData\Roaming\Titanium\mobilesdk\win32\1.8.1\tiapp.py&quot;, line 52, in <strong>init</strong><br>    data = codecs.open(self.file,&#39;r&#39;,&#39;utf-8&#39;,&#39;replace&#39;)<br>  File &quot;C:\Users\George\AppData\Local\Titanium Studio\plugins\com.appcelerator.titanium.python.win32_1.0.0.1313011725\python\lib\codecs.py&quot;, line 817, in open<br>    file = <strong>builtin</strong>.open(filename, mode, buffering)<br>IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: &#39;C:\Users\George\AppData\Local\Titanium Studio\7\tiapp.xml&#39;</p>

<p>Couldn&#39;t this be a little bit easier and descriptive so that we can understand what the problem is?</p>
<p>I will give it more try before quitting.</p>
<p>George</p>

							<div><p>Hell Stephen. I understand. But there is no way for the whole community to know this. What I suggest to exhaust every single resource and make a self-explanatory installer to avoid all this mess. I am sure that many people had this problem in the past and many feel that since they can&#39;t find an easy setup to start, they will be looking for alternatives.</p>

							<p>My first guess?  Long file names in your android sdk directory:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">C:<span class="hljs-command">\Program</span> Files (x86)<span class="hljs-command">\Android</span><span class="hljs-command">\android</span>-sdk
</code></pre><p>Regardless of the fixes that have come down the pike, we install to <code>c:\android-sdk</code> here so that nasty bug doesn&#39;t come up anymore. (also applies to the sdcard issue from 1.7.x)</p>
<p>Also, what is the name of the project you are trying to build? I ask because this <code>&amp;#39;C:\\Users\\George\\AppData\\Local\\Titanium Studio\\7\\tiapp.xml&amp;#39;</code> looks suspect.</p>

							<p>Well, the problem was that although the Android SDK was installed, the javac path was not added into Windows Environment Variables.</p>
<p>So, a quick 1-2-3 guide would be:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Install Java SDK (1.6, not later!)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ensure that javac is added into windows environment (right-click &quot;Computer&quot; then &quot;Advanced System Settings&quot;, then &quot;Environment Variables&quot;, then edit variable &quot;PATH&quot; and append into the list the value &quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_30\bin&quot;, or whatever your path to java bin is!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Install Android SDK and follow all documentation of appcelerator on how to configure a android under titanium.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#39;s one of the most important how-to&#39;s that appcelerator.com should have on the site. Even with a video presentation. If wannabies appcelerator developers cannot figure how to do this they will just consider appcelerator as crap and proceed to an alternative (like as I was ready to do to be honest).</p>

							<p>After long time of trial &amp; error I have found out that the problem was the path to the Java SDK, this needs to be set at the Windows Path. Also the Java Version of the SDK needs to be 1.6! (I had the latest).</p>
<p>I just feel that this should be more straight forward … </p>
