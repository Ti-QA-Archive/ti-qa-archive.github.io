			<h1>selected provisioning profile app id X does not match project app id X (X being the same)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I can select the provisioning profiles but they have a red X next to them, everything else is good (ticks). Any ideas?</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure its a pretty simple solution but i just can figure it out. I have the developer account etc. as suggested all the others are ticks, the above appears when i try and select a provisioning profile.</p>
<p>Any pointers? maybe someone else cant sort this one item?</p>
<p>I tried matching the app name in the manifest file?</p>

							<p>You need to check wether on developer.apple.com–&gt; member centre: is your provisioning file associated to correct certificate, for trouble shoot, open the project in Xcode and try to set the certificate and provisioning file manually and run the project.</p>

										<p><p>Hi, thanks for your help, but i finally found the solution: hope it helps someone else: the error message suggested the app Id was wrong but this was correct.

										<p><p>instead of putting answer as separate answer, you should put into comments and accept the answer for future reference for some one else. Still same can be done.</p>
