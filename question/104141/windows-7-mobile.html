							<p>&gt;Strategically Windows 7 Mobile is now a big deal for MS.</p>
<p>Even if true, that does not necessarily make it a big deal for many of the rest of us – at least here in the USA where their market share is poor.  I&#39;d much prefer to see the resources focused on getting the blackberry support going.  I&#39;d even put webOS above WM7 here in the states.</p>
<p>But my SWAG is that until WM7 supports HTML5 at a minimum, and maybe SQLite3 as well, getting a compatible WM7 version is highly unlikely.  And HTML5 support seems pretty far out for WM7 based on the reading I have done.</p>
<p>But that&#39;s just my personal opinion.  I have nothing to do with Appcelerator other than being a user.  The official roadmap seems to be <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;doc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;roadmap&#x2F;">here</a> but is obviously very dated since it talks about targets for July 2010.  Many priorities are sure to have changed with the staff expansion and additional funding. That said, pay attention to the last paragraph:</p>
<p>  &quot;Don&#39;t see something on the list?</p>
<p>  &quot;We regularly poll our community to discuss new features and you can contribute to which features are added and when. If you&#39;d like to accelerate an item (or more) on the roadmap, we have commercial alternatives too. Please contact us at sales@appcelerator.com for more details on your needs.&quot;</p>
<p>So if WM7 is central to your plans, I&#39;d suggest you contact the above email as a first step.</p>
<p>Just my .02</p>
