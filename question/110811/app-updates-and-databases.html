			<h1 id="question-1">Question 1</h1>
<p>Sure this has been covered, but I have looked around and couldnt see any topics so thought I would just.</p>
<p>If I make an update to my app and submit it, If a user then decides to download it if there are no changes to the database structure will they lose any data that resides in the old verison?</p>
<h1 id="question-2">Question 2</h1>
<p>Ok Assuming that the above question answer is Nope all data and structure remains, then what would be the best practice for updating the table structure? Does SQLLite support the ALTER syntax?</p>
<p>Cheers All</p>

							<p>For question 1, is the database included in your Resources folder (or a subfolder) and then the app uses the Ti.Database.install() method?</p>
<p>If so, then it will be upgrade safe and left alone.  It is really no different than launching the program a second time.  The install() method first checks if the database named in argument two already exists.  If it does, it just opens it.  If it does not, it copies the database named in the first argument to the app&#39;s storage sandbox then opens it.  Subsequent opens will find the db already exists and skip the copy step.</p>
<p>The same is true of an application update – unless of course the user does a full delete of the application first.  When an iphone app is deleted, all associated information such as databases etc are also removed.</p>
<p>For question 2, yes SQLLite does support the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sqlite.org&#x2F;lang_altertable.html">ALTER TABLE</a> commands.  I have a vague recollection of reading in some thread it may have some limitations, but I can&#39;t find such a reference now.</p>

										<p><p>In my experience, android is forgiving with ALTER TABLE and iOS is not. Namely, if you try to alter a table to add a column and that column is already there, android will ignore it and move on; iOS will throw an error and stop. Also, you can&#39;t remove a column (SQLite limitation, not android&#x2F;iOS). Beyond that, I haven&#39;t played with it enough to find other limitations.</p>

							<p>Yes I am running the Ti.Install method. So with that in mind, if I was to update the core database in the app would the install do the structure change keeping the database records or will it just perform a complete rebuild of the database?</p>

										<p><p>If you change the structure of the database included with the app in the Resources folder (or below it), that only affects new users or existing users where you remove the database first.</p>
<p>By definition, the install() method will NOT overwrite an existing database.  So existing users would just open the previous database format.</p>
<p>Two choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you do not need to retain data, you can delete the old database and use install again, using a variation of:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="hljs">// First remove prior instance of db, if any
// We can't remove until we open, so <span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">do</span> that
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> db = Ti.<span class="hljs-keyword">Database</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'myDB'</span>);</span>
db.remove();

// Now <span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">install</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">fresh</span> copy <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> db
db = Ti.<span class="hljs-keyword">Database</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">install</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'myDB.sql'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'myDB'</span>);</span>
</code></pre><ul>
<li>If you don&#39;t want a fresh database <strong>every time</strong> the app is run (and chances are you don&#39;t, assuming you update the db), then you can&#39;t use install() for updates.  You need to issue ALTER TABLE commands, as you asked about in your first question.</li>
</ul>

							<p>Cool. I dont want to recycle the database everytime. </p>
<p>If  someone updates the app the Ti.install method wont fire because they would already have the database installed which is perfect and what I want it to do. So with that in mind:</p>
<p>Option 1: I would just write sql scripts to Add Columns or New tables etc based on the App Property of the version number (Assuming this is stored globally and not made null on application update)</p>
<p>Option 2: Add a new database to the build (Lets call it db2) then run like above a script that pulls from db1 and populates db2.</p>
<p>Thanks for your advice</p>
<p>Let me know if you think im going the right way with this.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">/* Application Core Properties
----------------------------------------*/</span>
var applicationVersion = Titanium.App.Properties.getInt(<span class="hljs-string">"version_number"</span>);

<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (!applicationVersion &gt; <span class="hljs-number">0</span>)
{
    Titanium.App.Properties.setInt(<span class="hljs-string">"version_number"</span>,<span class="hljs-number">1</span>);
    applicationVersion = <span class="hljs-number">1</span>;
};


<span class="hljs-comment">/* Update Scripts For Database Changes
----------------------------------------*/</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (applicationVersion == <span class="hljs-number">1</span>)
{
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Update To Version 2</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// SQL GUBBINS HERE</span>
    Titanium.App.Properties.setInt(<span class="hljs-string">"version_number"</span>,<span class="hljs-number">2</span>);
}

										<p><p>Steve: yes, that is right idea.  The method you propose for tracking the previously installed version should work fine.  Alternatively, you can just reference Ti.App.version, which will return the string you entered in the Edit tab for the project.</p>
<p>However, that version does not auto-increment and you must remember to do it yourself.  Also, the db layout is not likely to change as often as the app itself.  So you may prefer the method you outline and just have it reflect the db layout as opposed to the application version.</p>
<p>At any rate, once you consider your question resolved, marking an answer as best will help future search results as those which are resolved float to the top of the search results and most people prefer to read replies which solved a problem similar to their own.</p>
