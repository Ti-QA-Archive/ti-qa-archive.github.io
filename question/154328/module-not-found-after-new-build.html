			<p>Apparently, I don&#39;t understand anything about Titanium on Android.</p>
<p>I rebuilt my <em>working</em> app.  Literally all I did was remove an alert.  Rebuild, install, run on my android device, and I now get this exception:</p>
<p>07-01 10:32:42.603: E&#x2F;V8Exception(30775): Exception occurred at ti:&#x2F;module.js:279: Uncaught Error: Requested module not found: ti.map</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I am going to guess as there is not a lot of info here (chances are you have no more info to give).</p>
<p>You are on Android, the error complains about a map.  I am wondering if the problem is due to either;</p>
<ul>
<li>You are still using the old version of Ti Maps which has limited support and only for apps that already have a version 1 Google Maps api key.</li>
<li>You are using the new Google Maps for Android Module but the module reference has not been set or has somehow been unset.</li>
</ul>
<p>Possible solutions;</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are creating a new app or do NOT have an existing Google Maps for Android API key already issued before Google stopped handing them out - then you need to swap to the Google Maps for Android version 2 module</li>
<li>If you have an existing app AND an existing already issue version 1 api key, try cleaning the the project un-installing from the device and trying again.</li>
</ul>
<p>References for Google Maps version 2;</p>

										<p><p>Forgot to also suggest that you confirm you have the map module selected (version 2)</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Explorer (left side of Studio</li>
<li>Select your app</li>
<li>Expand tree (small triangle)</li>
<li>Double click <strong>tiapp.xml</strong></li>
<li>Locate Modules section (top right)</li>
<li>Check Maps entry (ti.map) is displayed</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>No joy there.  Unfortunately there is no more information from the app, just the crash.  But a subsequent build (didn&#39;t even do a clean) makes it work again.  I&#39;ve run into other similar issues with Titanium on Android.  It feels like there is a packaging issue when building Android APKs</p>
<p>I&#39;m already running on V2 maps; that was the module it though was missing, but again, now it&#39;s working again.  I literally did nothing but remove the app from the phone and recompile.  It took 3 tries, then it worked.</p>

<p>So is this answered now then?</p>

										<p><p>Well, it&#39;s not answered… I still think there&#39;s a packaging bug (see my other post on hanging splash screen), but it&#39;s at least working again.</p>
<p>I dev on Android 80% of my time (native Android, not titanium) and I know it can be a pain, but the Titanium Android integration really needs to improve.  I feel like it&#39;s a bit better than it was 6 months ago, but it&#39;s still pretty painful. </p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

										<p><p>Not sure I can fix a packaging problem ;-)</p>
<p>I agree about the Android issues, had a lot of them myself on a large iOS port to Android - not been pleasant.</p>

										<p><p>For Android, I find it sometimes simpler to use the command line and the android monitor, for what it&#39;s worth.  That&#39;s helped me avoid a lot of the problems that are &quot;eclipse-oriented&quot;.</p>
