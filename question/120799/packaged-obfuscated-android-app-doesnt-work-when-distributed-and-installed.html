			<h1>Packaged Obfuscated Android app doesn&#39;t work when distributed and installed!?!</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>So the debug version of my Android app, works like a charm when installed on my phone. I should also mention the javascript aspect of my app has been Obfuscated in the debug version.<br>Now the time came to sign, zipline, package and distribute my Android app.I then installed my distributed Obfuscated app into my phone from the market. To my horror, my project in the webview section doesn&#39;t WORK!! Whats happening here? I don&#39;t get it. It worked just fine before it was packaged?!?!</p>

							<div><p>I managed to install the unsigned and signed .apk file on to my Nexus S phone. The app it self doesn&#39;t work. It might just be that obfuscating the js may not be the problem. I&#39;ll update this posting as soon as I narrow down the problem. Any one with any feed back is great appreciated!</p>

							<div><p>I have run into this problem as well. And I think it&#39;s a bug. In the build script they remove all JavaScript files, but they shouldn&#39;t remove files in the Resources folder as if you have local javascript libraries loaded in a webview.</p>
