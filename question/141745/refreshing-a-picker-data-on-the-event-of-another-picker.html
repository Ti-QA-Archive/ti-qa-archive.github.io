			<h1>Refreshing  a picker data on the event of another picker.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all, I have two single column pickers one for Car makes and one for Car models. I want when a Car Make is selected its corresponding Models are loaded in the Car Models picker. e.g if I select Honda in the Car Makes picker then only Honda&#39;s models should appear in the Car Models picker and no other company&#39;s models should be there. Also the Models are coming from a nested JSON object. Here is how I am trying to do this but the Models picker is always blank with no rows:-</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">pkr_Make_btnDone.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>,<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{        <span class="hljs-comment">//When a value is selected in Makes Picker</span>
        txt_VM.value =  pkr_VM.getSelectedRow(<span class="hljs-number">0</span>).title;
        pkr_VM_view.animate(slide_out);

        Ti.App.fireEvent(<span class="hljs-string">'make'</span>,{name: txt_VM.value})
    });

Ti.App.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'make'</span>,<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span>
</span>{
    limit=models[e.name].length;  <span class="hljs-comment">//models is the JSON object that contains Car Models</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> Mdl_data=[];

    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> i=<span class="hljs-number">0</span>;i&lt;limit;i++)
    {
        <span class="hljs-comment">//populate the dictionary for Models picker with selected Car Make's Models</span>
        Mdl_data.push(Titanium.UI.createPickerRow({title: models[e.name][i]}));
    }
    pkr_Mdl.add(Mdl_data); <span class="hljs-comment">//add the data to the models picker.</span>
})
</code></pre><p>Is there a way to do this??? If its not possible then please suggest some alternate method to do this easily.Plz somebody help ASAP. I am stucked with it for last two days. Thanks in advance.</p>

							<div><p>@Aaron when I run this code every thing works fine except nothing shown in the model picker as expected. The model picker exactly looks like as when an empty array is passed in <code>picker.add(empty_array)</code>. You can see it <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;leaser.us&#x2F;cmb_model.png">here</a></p>
<p>@Jason Yes it is inside the scope of make event listener. var models have the JSON data shown in the above comment link. Yes <code>e.name</code> is the name of the selected car make in the <code>pkr_Make_btndone click event</code> above which is matched with JSON object to get its corresponding models. The alert shows everything fine but only model names aren&#39;t visible in the model picker.</p>
<p>If anyone can give me email address I can mail the complete code (includes 3 files) so that you test yourself and better understand the problem and help to resolve it. Thanks</p>

							<div><p>Can someone tell how I make separate picker rows dictionaries for each item of <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;leaser.us&#x2F;get_models.php">this JSON object</a>. e.g. separate array of picker rows for honda, separate dictionary for suzuki and so on, so that when a  car make is selected I add the corresponding dictionary of models into the Car Model picker.

							<p>OK – I think I have your answer.  This was a strange one.  The main problem seems to be that calling <code>Ti.UI.Picker.add()</code> <em>after</em> the picker has been added to the view doesn&#39;t seem to work.  Note that it works if you add it to a view, but then don&#39;t add that view to the window (which your original code does with the <code>pkr_VM</code>, which is added to <code>pkr_VM_view</code>, but <code>pkr_VM_view</code> isn&#39;t added to the window until the timeout).  But once you&#39;ve added the picker to the window or a child view of the window, it doesn&#39;t seem like you can call <code>add()</code>.</p>
<p>So what&#39;s the workaround?  When you have new data for the picker, remove the picker from its parent view and create a new one.  This is a good idea anyway, since there&#39;s not really a good way to remove the data from the picker.  With your code, if the user chose a different Make, you&#39;d be <em>appending</em> the models for that make to the picker (that is, <em>if</em> you were able to call add() after adding the picker to the window, which you can&#39;t anyway).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve posted the modified code <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.ca&#x2F;2202874">here</a>.</p>
<p>I also found a few issues in your code that you should be aware of.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Avoid use of App-level events when control-level events would be perfectly serviceable; see my code</p>
</li>
<li><p>timeout is not a good solution – set the controls disabled until the network results are back and the lists are populated; then enable them; see my code</p>
</li>
<li><p>naming conflicts: cancel, done, spacer, toolbar: use CommonJS modules and require() so that you don&#39;t have to worry about these sort of things; I made quick-and-dirty name changes for you</p>
</li>
<li><p>pkrModelData is loaded, but unused</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that your code won&#39;t work on android, if that matters to you.  My <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;smorgasbork.com&#x2F;component&#x2F;content&#x2F;article&#x2F;38-titanium-mobile&#x2F;135-titanium-mobile-beyond-the-prototype">TitanUp</a> library has a view called &quot;SimplePicker&quot; which behaves like yours on iOS but also works on android.  Note that it will have trouble with dynamically updated pickers, too.  I don&#39;t think the changes would be too hard; it would need a <code>setValues()</code> function, which would have to recreate the PickerPopup each time the rows are changed.</p>
