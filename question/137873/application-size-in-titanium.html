							<p>If you had 500 image and 500 sound files, and each approached 70KB then you&#39;d have up to 70MB of media files, not counting the application.  Although technically it could be compiled in Titanium (at least AFAIK), you would run afoul of app store guidelines.  Or at least Apple limits app store sizes to 20MB last I knew.  Even if 70KB was the largest, you&#39;d have to average well under 20KB to fit under the Apple guidelines.</p>
<p>If you do not install via the app store&#x2F;Google Play (for example using an Apple Enterprise certificate) then it may technically be doable.  But you also need to consider that anything you bundle will be part of the Resources folder (or a sub-folder), and on the device this is read-only.  That means that your app would have to use them directly from the Resources folder.  If you copied them to another location you&#39;d essentially use twice the space on the device, because you cannot delete from the Resources folder once copied because the folder is read only.</p>
<p>I&#39;d highly recommend NOT bundling more than a core sampling of media files – if that – and make the user download them (or a subset of them) upon first use of the application.  That keeps your install package size within submission requirements, and lets you put them in the folder of your choice instead of needing them to be in the Resources folder or below.</p>
<p>YMMV</p>

<p>Is it possible to download all the files from remote server  while application start up. Then use it locally(without internet connection). Is it possible or it will cause any problem?</p>

										<p><p>Yes, that is very possible and in fact is what I was trying to suggest when I said &quot;make the user download them (or a subset of them) upon first use of the application&quot;.  The only &quot;problem&quot; it could cause would be if the user never tried to launch your program until after they no longer had internet connectivity.  </p>
<p>When your application starts, check if you have downloaded the files yet.  If not, put up a message saying they must be downloaded and give an approximate size and suggest they may want to use wifi (or 4G-LTE) and not 3G.  I&#39;d give them the option to not continue with the download at that time.</p>

							<p>Why not store the images and audio files remotely and then stream them down on demand when you need them? You can either use your own storage and services, Ti.Cloud, or Amazon S3 storage for this.</p>

							<p>The maximum iOS app size atm is 2GB. For over the air downloads it&#39;s 50MB. See App Size Tips in https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunesconnect.apple.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;iTunesConnect_DeveloperGuide.pdf. </p>
<p>Looks like for Google Play it&#39;s 50MB for the apk + 2 * 2GB expansion files. But it doesn&#39;t look like Titanium supports expansion files yet.</p>
