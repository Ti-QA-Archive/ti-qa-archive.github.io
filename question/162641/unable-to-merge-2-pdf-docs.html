			<h1>Unable to merge 2 pdf docs</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am trying to merge 2 pdf documents and neither file.append(otherFile) or file.write(otherFile, true) works.  All it does is overwrite the first file.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the code I&#39;m working with:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var f = Ti.Filesystem.getFile(filename);
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (f.exists()){
    Ti.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">'File exists, deleting: '</span> + f.deleteFile());
}

f.createFile();

f.<span class="hljs-keyword">write</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">file</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">read</span>(), <span class="hljs-keyword">true</span>);

var termsCond = Ti.Filesystem.getFile(Ti.Filesystem.resourcesDirectory,<span class="hljs-string">'TermsConditions.pdf'</span>);
f.<span class="hljs-keyword">write</span>(termsCond.<span class="hljs-keyword">read</span>(), <span class="hljs-keyword">true</span>);

termsCond = <span class="hljs-keyword">null</span>;
f = <span class="hljs-keyword">null</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">file</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">null</span>;
</code></pre>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>A PDF document can NOT be appended by simply joining the two files together.</p>
<p>The PDF internal format is not linear - it has an internal structure that allows for internal compression and re-use of objects already defined when used again.  The pages themselves are referenced as an internal lookup list to other anchor points within the document itself, the same goes for images.</p>
<p>Because of this simply appending one to the other will create a corrupt file that cannot be read or understood by any PDF software.</p>
<p>This is the same for all images, MS offices files, XML documents - basically anything that is not a simple text file that does not have any internal structure to define the document itself.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your quick response Malcolm!  I was afraid that was the answer.  I am aware that Adobe has licensed software for merging pdf docs for other platforms like Java and .NET.  Has anyone done anything for the Titanium platform?</p>

										<p><p>You will most likely require a server side service to manage the PDF merging as it will need to open each document as an actual PDF file and then use an append page command (not the same as simply appending the file itself).  You could then return the document.</p>
<p>There are many you could use for many different server side scripting languages (not on the phone or tablet), this is one;</p>

										<p><p>Sorry no - I have just checked for any modules that could offer the option to read a pdf file in and then insert pages from another file before re-saving - but nothing is showing up.</p>
<p>It would need to be a server solution as far as I can see.</p>

										<p><p>I am using com.factisresearch.html2pdf, so the simplest solution for now might be to just create an html version of my Terms &amp; Conditions doc and append it prior to creating the pdf.</p>

										<p><p>That would work as you are avoiding the entire issue - whilst I have not used this myself - it looks more than capable.</p>
