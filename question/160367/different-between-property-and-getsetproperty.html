			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I&#39;m wondering what the difference is between accessing a property directly (file.size) or via the method (file.getSize())? It seems pretty redundant to have the two if there&#39;s no difference and in addition, accessing the property directly is probably faster because of no function call overhead.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>As far as i&#39;ve ever been able to work out, this seems to be a difference in Objective-C and Java that somehow they managed to surface into the javascript API. The most irritating thing (less so now) was that they weren&#39;t consistent implementing across all getter&#x2F;setters methods and properties so I personally always keep to the properties as they seem to be implemented everywhere.</p>

										<p><p>Hey,</p>
<p>yeah, as I said I&#39;d like to do that too. But I&#39;m sometimes a bit afraid that maybe directly getting&#x2F;setting the property has side-effects or does not always give the most current value, because well, when using the methods, Titanium can probably do any related housekeeping, while when setting the property directly, it probably doesn&#39;t know the exact moment when I do it, and probably the effect isn&#39;t immediate? No idea how the internals work…</p>

										<p><p>No, i don&#39;t think this an issue, they ultimately both do the same, which is persisting the value.  The bigger issue, as I said, has previously been the coverage of implementation of both</p>

							<p>I&#39;ll go into the performance issue.</p>
<p>An object has properties, like height, width etc. When you create an object you set those properties directly.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">
var view = Ti.UI.createView ({
    height: <span class="hljs-number">50</span>,
    width: <span class="hljs-number">75</span>
})
</code></pre><p>Now to update those properties you can do either of these …</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">
view.setHeight = <span class="hljs-number">100</span>;
view.height = <span class="hljs-number">100</span>;
</code></pre><p>From a coding point of view using the setHeight is the logical way to go, but as Nick has said, the setters and getters are not always implemented on all the properties of an object.</p>
<p>The setters and getters are functions like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">setHeight</span><span class="hljs-params">(_view,  _value)</span> </span>{
    _view.height = _value;
}

<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">getHeight</span><span class="hljs-params">(_view)</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> _view.height;
}
</code></pre><p>So a setter or getter is a simple function which receives the object and the new value and sets it, from this it becomes obvious that you have a major performance hit by using the setters and getters, as well as them not always having been implemented.</p>
<p>Dan Tamas gave a great talk on this at the European TiConf earlier this year.</p>
<p>You can use either, for my dev team I shoot them if they use the set and get methods.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the details… so, in effect, the set… and get… functions are unnecessary and only add overhead, and are not always implemented. So, why have they been introduced in the first place? I mean, this only adds confusion, performance and maintenance issues.</p>

										<p><p>@Trevor. Am I right in thinking from what you&#39;re saying is that the creation of a new stack frame by using a method is what is adding the performance hit ? Would also be interested in your thoughts as to why both appeared in the API ?</p>

										<p><p>Correct this only adds confusion and unnecessary overhead, but using setters and getters is the correct programming methodology. So I assume that is why they are included.</p>
<p>As for the creation of a new stack frame. I am confused as to exactly what you are asking. (terminology differences I guess) You should always set any properties you can at object creation. It is the best performance. Also if you don&#39;t set a value trying to update it later can cause issues.</p>
