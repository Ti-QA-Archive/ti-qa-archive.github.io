			<h1>Pass the id of my TextField in my custom function OnClick</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,<br>I try to pass the id of my textfield in my function to work with id.</p>
<p>Because i&#39;m not sure i&#39;m clear and because i&#39;m a beginner i will post you the cost and what i want it to do</p>
<p>xml:</p>
<p>&lt;TextField class=&quot;little_square&quot; id=&quot;TextField0x0&quot; onClick=doClick()&gt;&lt;&#x2F;TextField&gt;</p>
<p>js:</p>
<p><code>function doClick {</code></p>
<p><code>$[&amp;#39;TextField0x0&amp;#39;].addEventListener(&amp;#39;change&amp;#39;, function(e) {</code></p>
<p><code>Ti.API.info(&amp;#39;Text field has changed!&amp;#39;);</code></p>
<p><code>});</code></p>
<p><code>}</code></p>
<p>This is my actual code, it works fine, but i want to make it dynamic and don&#39;t have to write the id textfield in my js and pass and get it easily.</p>
<p>Because i&#39;m a beginner i don&#39;t know how to do this</p>
<p>I try something link doClick(this.id), doClick (id), doClick(self.id) but no one is working.</p>
<p>Can you help me asap please ? It&#39;s for a project I have to present on next week.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>Could you explain why you chose to mark an answer as correct when is had simply duplicated the answer of the already provided answer that clearly resolved your problem?</p>
<p>Right now I am simply trying to work out why, I will reserve judgement as you may have a good reason.</p>
<p>I am keeping an eye on this question now.</p>

							<div><p>Narendra answer fully  the question, not just the js part.</p>
<p>I try xml part with passing an argument through the function and it&#39;s not work.</p>
<p>Moreover Narendra was more courteous than Stephen which response is same as &quot;RTFM&quot;, I know I have difficulties with JavaScript but tell me I should learn it, it&#39;s not a good answer in my opinion…</p>

<p>There was nothing there that added anything at all to what you had already been provided. So if you were able to move forwards then the answer already provided was the answer.  I do not like the idea of rewarding people based on lack of merit.</p>
<p>You may not like the phrase <em>&quot;Maybe you should learn JavaScript.&quot;</em> but is there any reason why someone should suggest you understand the core of JS before working through and API model added on top of it?  The comment was immediately followed with the answer that solved it for you, you just failed to realise that for some time.</p>
<p>So whilst you may not like the idea that someone suggests you learn the basics that would have allowed you to have determined this yourself the answer was provided so you would know what to look for in the future.</p>

<p>I have marked this answer as the correct one as it was provided first and the originally marked answer was a simple but very blatant duplication of this one.</p>

<p>Duplicating someone else&#39;s answer verbatim (EXACTLY) as was already provided is just wrong and will not be tolerated.  I will be keeping an eye on your answers going forwards and will be reviewing your previously provided answers to see if further comments or actions are required.</p>
<p>Whilst providing help to others is obviously encouraged and very much welcomed - the act of such obvious cheating is not.</p>
<p>You did not even spend the time changing a single comment, line break or even order of the code you took. Did you seriously think this would not be spotted?</p>
<p>I will also mark this question down and the more suitable answer will be assigned.  I was going to delete this answer but I feel leaving such a blatantly obvious and stupidly placed contribution would serve the community better.</p>

										<p><p>Before providing any judgement at least try to hear out that person. Here is my explanation,</p>
<p>I tried that code on my personal machine and changed the doClick method in view file, Which if you had done it then this situation will not arise. Before posting anything I am checking at my end.</p>
<p>I agreed that i copied your content but i feel this not race whos going to get correct answer. My personal view to see Q&amp;A forum is to help people not to get points. This is open source community and idea behind this forum is to help people to grow this beautiful community.</p>
<p>Still I am apologizing for the same.</p>
<p>Rest I am leaving to your sense of jugemement.</p>
