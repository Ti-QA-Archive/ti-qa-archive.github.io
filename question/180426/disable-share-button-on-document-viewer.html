										<p><p>I don&#39;t really have a good suggestion. I think that is why Muhammad was asking about PDF requirements. There are some PDF viewers that don&#39;t include sharing, but they are PDF specific. If you are going to view documents of different formats, I don&#39;t have any options.</p>
<p>Sorry…</p>

										<p><p>Unfortunately, the documentViewer does not seem to allow child objects (so can&#39;t add a view over the share icon). Also, the only events that seem to fire are Load and Unload (All of the others don&#39;t fire) so there doesn&#39;t seem to be a way to capture interactions with the documentViewer view. I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t think of anything to help you.</p>
