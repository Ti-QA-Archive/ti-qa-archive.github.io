			<h1>Updated to iOS6 - Test Running app on device not working</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi</p>
<p>I have recently been having problems with appcelerator and xcode after updating to xcode 4.5.1 and the 6.0 SDK.</p>
<p>Another problem i am having is that when testing my app out on my iPad through Xcode - it&#39;s picking up an older version of the app files not the very latest.</p>
<p>Is this a problem for anyone else?</p>
<p>It seems to be that xcode is running the build as it was just before i had updated the software. As for example i now have an alert dialog and a progress bar within my app (that were not in place before updating). The simulator in appcelerator picks this up and runs the latest app version but anytime i go to actually running on device (through xcode) it is running an older version without both of these elements on the ipad.</p>
<p>I have tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>removing all traces on the simulator</li>
<li>several clean builds in the folder structure</li>
<li>deleting the previous app from the iPad device</li>
<li>even running the exact same code as a seperate new app with a different name</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above result in the same outcome</p>

										<p><p>Hi Stephen, Thanks for the reply. I had tried all of your bullet points thinking they may solve but no luck. The seperate name point made me question it too - i know it sounds odd but honestly thats what happens. I have deleted the app from the iPad but it doesnt reside in iTunes as its only testing it</p>
