			<h1>Cannot compile new unmodified 1.7.x project with Ti Studio</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Until this week, I have still used Ti Developer hoping that by the time I tried Ti Studio the most glaring issues would be resolved.  But so far, I have had zero luck with studio.  When I try to import existing projects from Developer, I cannot build them at all as both the debug and runtime icons are disabled.  Even when I change the SDK level to 1.7.x</p>
<p>So I created a brand new test project in Studio, and the debug and run icons are available.  Alas, I have tried a few 1.7.x SDK levels and the compiles always fail with TiUITiOSAdViewProxy.m referencing undeclared ADBannerContentSizeIdentifierPortrait and ADBannerContentSizeIdentifierLandscape.</p>
<p>This is a brand new project, with no changes to any file except defining what is necessary in the TiApp editor tab for tiapp.xml</p>
<p>If I change the SDK level back to 1.6.x the run icon will build and launch the app fine.  The debug icon becomes disabled since it is 1.6.x, which is understandable.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t find any references to the TiUITiOSAdViewProxy problem, and the only suggestion I have seen for imported projects is to not do that, but create new projects instead and move the files over.</p>
<p>But I can&#39;t get new projects to build either!</p>

										<p><p>I really didn&#39;t expect this to work, but upgrading XCode from 3.2.4 to 4.0.2 actually did the trick!  So thanks!  Now I just need to get imported projects to build..</p>
