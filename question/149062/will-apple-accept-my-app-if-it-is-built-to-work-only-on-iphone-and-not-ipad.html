			<h1>will apple accept my app if it is built to work only on iphone and not ipad</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>iPad nowadays seems to be able to run the iphone apps (it shows 1X and 2X buttons in the bottom right)</p>
<p>So, is it necessary that I should build it for both iphone and ipad.</p>
<p>The reason I ask is because my app display layout is optimized for iphone but not for ipad.</p>
<p>I hope you can understand the question, as there are two ways of doing things.<br>a. Build for iphone , Build for iPad (check both boxes in tiapp.xml)<br>b. Build for iphone (without checking the box for iPad), but let it run on iPad</p>
<p>Has anyone submitted such an app to apple and got it approved ?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Good news - you choose what your app is designed for;</p>
<ul>
<li>You can have iPhone only (works on iPod touch as well)</li>
<li>You can have iPad only</li>
<li>You can have a universal app that works on both.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only thing to keep in mind is whichever one you choose, make sure you support the different densities of images.</p>

										<p><p>Quick follow-up;</p>
<p>By different densities I mean;</p>
<ul>
<li>iPhone&#x2F;iPod Touch, provide images for non-retina and retina devices, as well as iPhone 5 support with tall images where required (at the very least the splash&#x2F;start-up screen)</li>
<li>iPad, provide images for non-retina and retina devices</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than that - you choose.</p>
<p>You can even have the same app but one for the iPhone and another for the iPad, there are many reasons for this for example image and content demands that make it more sensible or different feature sets.</p>
<p>When designing for both platform then Universal (iPhone &amp; iPad in the same app) is preferable as users prefer it, but it is your choice and the decision should be based on user and device needs.</p>
<p>If you build for iPhone only - it will still work on the iPad as you note.  You obviously gain a bigger audience as iPad native apps are preferred - but do it at your pace.</p>
<p>Having built many apps for both platforms - I can assure you iPhone only is fine when going in the store.</p>
