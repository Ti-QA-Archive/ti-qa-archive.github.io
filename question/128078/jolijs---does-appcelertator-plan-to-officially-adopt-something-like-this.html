			<p>Hello everyone, not having a problem - this is more of a crystal ball question. I just watched  <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;30143695">Xavier Lacot: Abstracting Databases Access in Titanium Mobile</a> from the Codestrong Conference and was impressed with the ease of handling DB calls etc. This, just after I got a SQlite DB working in a demo app.</p>
<p>I guess I&#39;m just looking for advice going forward. Now that I have a good understanding of SQlite (enough to be dangerous) I plan on making two apps. for my company that will heavily depend on SQlite. Do I use something like joli.js because it seems easier to work with or keep going the manual route which seems safer and more dependable through Studio updates, iOS updates, etc? ORM is new to me in practice but I can see its power and enabling qualities. Not looking for the answer to the meaning of life (I have Siri for that) but some advice from people who may be working with JOLI.JS (or any other ORM within Appc.) on what might (or should) be a &#39;best practice&#39; one day. Thanks! I plan to communicate directly with Xavier Lacot and wanted to include the community as well. Thanks!</p>

							<p>Hi Bill. You can contact Xavier without hesitation, he is very friendly.</p>
<p>I&#39;m using Joli ORM for some time. At the beginning it was very cool tool, but soon I found it limited. Because of it&#39;s design, it&#39;s hard to override some things. Also, I don&#39;t like it&#39;s model limitation to one database table and even more, model limitation to database models only.</p>
<p>What I would like to have is database abstraction layer, so SQLing is easier and I would like model part to be generic, so I can work with database models, but also with XML models, JSON models and so on. I&#39;m planing to rework my model part and I think that will be enhancements (among some others).</p>
