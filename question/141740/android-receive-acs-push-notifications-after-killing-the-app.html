			<h1>(Android) Receive ACS Push Notifications after killing the App.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Afternoon.</p>
<p>Is there any way to receive the Push Notifications after I kill the App? I noticed this on the guide (for CloudPush):</p>
<p>&gt; But if the user intentionally kills your application and its services in their task manager, push notifications will be disabled and this property will automatically be set to false.</p>
<p>That means that if I kill the app I won&#39;t receive the push notifications anymore.</p>
<p>Will I have to implement Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) instead?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

							<p>if you just close the app, it will not shutoff the background service that listens to the push, unless you purposely shutdown the backgroun service as well. the backgroun service restarts after your phone reboots.</p>

										<p><p>First of all, thanks a lot for your time and support. I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>However,  I&#39;m not sure why I&#39;m only receiving the push notification after I register and subscribe to receive them (without closing the app).</p>
<p>If I close the app on the task manager, the phone won&#39;t receive the notifications anymore (until I restart the application and re-register for the notifications).</p>
<p>Is anything wrong with my implementation? Or this is the expected behavior?</p>
<p>I&#39;m using this code as reference:<br>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;railskarthi&#x2F;acs_android_push</p>
<p>However, I execute the whole code (the code for retrieving the device token, login, etc) after a button click. Is this fine?</p>
<p>If needed, I can provide my code as reference.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

										<p><p>Which CloudPush version do you use? You can find it in tiapp.xml.<br>And after restarting app, if push works fine on background (app closed)?<br>If still does not work, could you send your token to me (plv@appcelerator.com) for further investigation?</p>

										<p><p>Morning Paul,</p>
<p>It does work when I close the application in a regular way (by hitting back button a couple of times), but if I <em>kill</em> the application on the Task Manager (Android) I won&#39;t receive any other notification.</p>
<p>If I re-register the device to receive the notifications (after killing the App) I receive all the pending notifications.</p>
<p>I&#39;m using CloudPush 2.0.7. Let me know if you still need my code and token.</p>

							<p>bump.</p>
<p>I&#39;m also looking for an answer to this question. I am able to get push messages on Android phone just fine when the app is open, or when I close the app using the back button a couple times, BUT if I completely kill the app in the task manager then I never get a push message until I reopen the app. Is there anything we can do to get push messages even if a user completely kills the app from the task manager? Should I setup a custom background process to look for incoming push messages?</p>
<p>Any help anyone can give me&#x2F;us please let me know, it would be very helpful! :)</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p> -Mark</p>

							<p>Hi all, there&#39;s a new GCM module in the Marketplace called uPush for Android push messages, got it working with my project today in about 10 minutes, saved me so much time.</p>
