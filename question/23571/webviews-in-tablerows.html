			<p>Has anyone had any luck using webViews in tableRows?</p>
<p>This seems to be the only way possible to have href links in the &#39;title&#39; of the row. (rather like a twitter client might have url links in the &#39;title&#x2F;tweet&#39; in a tablerow)</p>
<p>I seem to be getting some inconsistent results. </p>
<p>Any help would be most appreciated. </p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Kosso</p>

							<p>I haven&#39;t tried doing this, but I would recommend against it.  The web view is the most expensive and slowest component in Titanium to initialize.  Couldn&#39;t you use a custom table view layout (examples in the Sink), and then have clickable links in specific portions of the layout?  I would recommend trying to use table view layouts and subviews before even bothering to debug web views in table view rows.</p>

							<p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>Thanks. But there has to be a way to do this. Look many iphone twitter clients (eg&quot; Echofon) - all urls, @usernames and #hashtags are clickable on the row.</p>
<p>Surely, the only way to do this is by using a webView area of some sort on the row?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been in touch with Jeff about this and modified the &#39;Table with Remote Images 2&#39; demo (which I built originally) to try and find a way.</p>
<p>Try this test case (which has some comments in it about the issues I&#39;m seeing) http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;953428</p>
<p>In a possibly related issue, the current (1.3.0) way that tables are doing auto-height is broken (in the KS auto-height demo too). The way that the rows seems to animate to get to the right size just looks and feels very wrong. It doesn&#39;t feel or look &#39;native&#39; at all when it does it.</p>

<p>Ya never know captain, it might just work!!! ;)</p>
