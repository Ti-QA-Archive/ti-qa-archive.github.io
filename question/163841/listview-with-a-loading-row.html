			<h1>Listview with a loading row?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey,</p>
<p>i am using the &quot;new&quot; Listview and so far everything works fine and as expected :) Just one thing is driving me crazy - I&#39;ve set a marker to listen for scrolling to the last item to load new items from the server.</p>
<p>The simple question is:<br>How can i add a loading Row to the list? Since all items are rendered by the template (for the rows) i don&#39;t see any solution to add a loading row which differ in it&#39;s visual apperiance ?! (cause the template is for the whole list)<br>?!</p>
<p>Another try was to set the footerView to show a loading message and icon, but then my problem is how i can scroll the complete list to have this &quot;view&quot; on the screen?<br>(User scrolls to the last element –&gt; marker –&gt; Command to scroll the list to the really bottom - including the the footerView. That&#39;s something that i can&#39;t realize at the moment.</p>
<p>Any idea? Help would be great.</p>
<p>Best,<br>Nico</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>One way to achieve this and a technique I have used in the past with tableViews as well is to use the footer.</p>
<p>Do not create a row - create a view with label and activity indicator (or whatever you want), keep this as a variable locally scoped to wherever your listView controller is.  When your marker is triggered add the row to the footer using the variable.  When the httpClient call is complete remove that view from the footer.  </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">// remove the previous view reference
listView.setFooterView(<span class="hljs-keyword">null</span>);
// your footer view will still exist <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> course
// <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> ready <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">use</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">next</span> <span class="hljs-typename">time</span>
</code></pre><p>If you are using Alloy then create a controller just for this job and the return view is the &quot;variable&quot;.</p>
<p>This technique means you do not have to worry about pulling out rows or determining which row should still accept clicks and which should not.</p>
<p>Also - if you choose to have a &quot;load more&quot; instead of &quot;auto load&quot;, the footer view has two states; normal state is a clickable indicator to let the user request more data and the loading state which is the same as above.  The only code difference is instead of removing the view you are swapping them in and out.</p>

										<p><p>Hey Malcolm - thanks for your answer. I did it exactly that way - but (to make my main question more clear)</p>
<ul>
<li>how you can scroll to the bottom of the added footerview ? Cause if the user is scrolling to the marker it&#39;s not the end of list at all. </li>
</ul>
<p>So it&#39;s more a visual problem :) </p>
<p>Would be great if you can help.</p>
<p>Best, Nico</p>

										<p><p>Simpler than you think, you do not want this to be triggered when you are at the end - you want this to be trigger just before you get there.  This way the call to add more has already occurred </p>
<p>Plus the marker is triggered when in display - so setting a little earlier makes sense anyway.</p>
