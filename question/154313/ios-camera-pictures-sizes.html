			<h1>iOS Camera pictures sizes</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey,</p>
<p>I have some issues with the camera and pictures sizes.</p>
<p>A quick explanation:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have a button when I press it I activate the camera</li>
<li>The user takes an image and chooses to use the image</li>
</ol>
<p>Now I have a space in the screen (a view were I want to set the taken image). The space are 320widthx400height. </p>
<p>So what I want to do is:</p>
<ol>
<li>I want to place the taken in that view but I dont want to destroy or crop the image in any way (I can resize the views width and height, but dont know which width and height to set).</li>
<li>When I save the image I want it to be in the original size from where I took it the first time.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have tried some solutions but I can´t get it to work.</p>
<p>Does anyone have a clue?</p>
<p>Appreciate your answers!</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Easier than you think, just create a new image based on the original image;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var croppedversion = imagefromcamera.imageAsResized(<span class="hljs-number">320</span>, <span class="hljs-number">400</span>);
</code></pre><ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Blob-method-imageAsResized">imageAsResized</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>croppedversion</strong> version of the image is a new distinct version of the one returned by the camera, so you now have two in memory.</p>
<p>So you display the <strong>croppedversion</strong> and save the <strong>imagefromcamera</strong>.</p>

										<p><p>You are saving the cropped image to the gallery - this the problem.</p>
<p>This line takes the cropped image you supplied from the camera;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> f</span> = imageView.toImage();
</code></pre><p>You need to save the original image to the gallery.  You can do this one of two ways;</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an imageView that is hidden and save the ORIGINAL image to that, if the user chooses to save the file use that imageView.</li>
<li>Save the ORIGINAL image to a file system file as a cached file (or a temp file), then is the user chooses to save the file use that file</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>Another question related to this, I have downloaded Kitchensink project  and I´m working with overlay of camera, is there any possibility to change the size of the camera? Right now, it´s full size and I can add a square in the middle (where it will take photo), but can I change the height of the camera so it is 400px instead? And if this is possible is it the same thing with saving the pictures both cropped and original, as I do now?</p>

										<p><p>Good question - however the answer is no I am afraid - there is currently no way to adjust the dimensions of the camera view, only to add an overlay view as you have already found.</p>
<p>I understand that it is possible natively so it may become possible in the future with a custom module.</p>

										<p><p>Ok hope they fix it, but is it possible to add for example add a cropped image to my view add something to the picture for example a smylie and then save that image with the smylie?</p>

										<p><p>Not directly from the camera image as the view you provide is an overlay that simply visually sits over the camera.  You could however take the returned image and place it into an ImageView, create your smilie as another imageView and place both inside a parent view.  Then toImage the parent view.</p>
<p>Same end result.</p>

										<p><p>I tried to create a new empty imageView and I added my croppedImage and my smylie image (from another imageView) and it worked but after that I have saved the image the screen went white for some reason. </p>
<p>I also tried to add the smylie to my croppedImage and it worked but theres a strange bug when I save the image to my photo library, when I save the image the smilye moves up 40px for some reason…</p>
<p>Do you have any ideas?</p>
