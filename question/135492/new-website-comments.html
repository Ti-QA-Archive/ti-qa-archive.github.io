			<p>Not really a new one, just a polish of the top menu and also a restructuring of the service plans. Looks good, although I haven&#39;t studied it much. I can see new pricing plans. The only think that I really tried to check was whether the online exam came out, but unfortunately, not.</p>
<p>Oh, guys, check the menu with IE compatibility 7, it&#39;s not working. Also the forms in Contact Sales are not properly shown!</p>
<p>More feedback to come soon!</p>
<p> working</p>

<p>Seriously?  Let me pull out netscape 2 and test to see if it works.</p>
<p>IE 7 was released 5 and a half years ago.  IE in all its versions represents less than 20% of the browser usage space.  IE 7 represents only 2.5% and has been dropping at a rate of .1-.2% each month.</p>
<p>The same reasoning that says we can&#39;t continue to support older versions of Android or iOS applies to browsers as well.</p>

							<div><p>Stephen, as I am in the Web Industry, you will be amazed by the number of clients that pay us to keep their website&#x2F;application fully compatible with IE7. Yes, I know, it&#39;s a nightmare, but the client is a client. </p>
<p>Besides, I am giving my comments here, it would be good for Appcelerator to know, doesn&#39;t mean they will take action.</p>

							<div><p>Yeah, I agree with George. Things in EU are bit different, Window XP is still top OS, IE6&amp;7 still present. A lot of companies are stuck with old versions of Windows and IE because of the software they use that does not work with new OS versions (banks also use IEs! no kidding, they upgraded to IE7 two years ago). Anyway, you don&#39;t want to not to support this kind of clients because they are also potential buyers of your product. ;)</p>

							<p>I hope somebody is checking this list. When I try to update my Organization Field, in my profile, the change does not take effect. Strictly speaking, I believe this issue was in place even before the recent update.</p>

							<p>I am getting fed up with the URI too long issue (cleared cookies, keeps happening) - plus the site doesn&#39;t work properly in Chrome (top-right drop down). All very frustrating and begs the question &#39; why wasn&#39;t this new site thoroughly tested before release?&#39;</p>
