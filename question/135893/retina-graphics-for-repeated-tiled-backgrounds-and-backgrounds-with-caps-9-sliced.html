			<h1>Retina Graphics for Repeated (Tiled) Backgrounds and Backgrounds with Caps (9 sliced)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am working with the 2.0.1.GA2 SDK and have found that while most retina graphics (@2x) work fine, tiled backgrounds and backgrounds using caps do not.</p>
<p>For tiled or Repeated Backgrounds, I have found that the retina image (@2x) is not scaled down to 1x size, it is kept at 2x it&#39;s size.  So the tile appears at twice the size it should on a retina device.</p>
<p>For backgrounds with caps, I have found that the 2x graphic is not scaled down to 1x dimensions, so if the cap amount is 10, it is not creating a cap that is 20 for the 2x graphic.</p>
<p>Has anyone else experienced this?</p>

							<div><p>Just to &quot;pitch in&quot; - I just experienced the same - backgroundImage for retina is repeated, but not scaled down to 1x size when tiled.</p>
<p>Did you report this as a bug yet ?</p>

							<p>Hey Mike,</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t seen (or tried) the repeated background image problem, but I have had problems with background caps on retina displays. </p>
<p>Retina display support for background caps seems to be highly dependent on the type of object Ti Object. For example, it seems to always work on buttons even as far back as 1.7 SDK (my previous work around was to use a button with touchEnabled: false when needed).</p>
<p>In the 2.0.1.GA2 SDK however, background caps seem to be supported on labels as well for retina devices. So, I would recommend using labels in place of standard views where background caps are needed. Background caps might work on other objets as well, but as most display objects are just views with added functionality, a label seems like a good base object to work with.</p>
<p>tl;dr: background caps work on labels, use them in place of views.</p>

										<p><p>We&#39;ve been discussing this same issue here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;135848&#x2F;backgroundrepeat-not-working-on-ios-device</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been using <code>Ti.UI.createLabel</code> to make the retina graphics look right, but the label won&#39;t let any of its children receive click events. I have buttons inside the label, and they&#39;re not responding.</p>
<p>Any idea why?</p>

										<p><p>Clifton, what version of the SDK are you using? Under 2.0, I don&#39;t seem to be having the problem of children not receiving click events (I have a text area added to a label that uses a background cap and I am able to highlight text in the text area). </p>
<p>When I was having a similar problem (of children not receiving click events) with the older SDK though, my workaround was to create another view the same size as the object with an endcap set but a higher zIndex. I&#39;d then add all my children to this same-sized transparent view with the endcapped object just sort of sitting beneath.</p>
