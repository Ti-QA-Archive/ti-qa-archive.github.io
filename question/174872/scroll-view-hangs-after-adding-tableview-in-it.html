			<p>It&#39;s two weeks i&#39;m stuck on this and the deadline is coming, so i surrend asking here.<br>Something really weird happens only on iOS Devices: After rendering the table view, the scroll view that contains it hangs for a while and even no event seems to get fired.</p>

<p>What are you trying to achieve by using this structure? Can you explain what you are trying to achieve?</p>

							<div><p>It doesn&#39;t seems to be related to the structure, I even used normal views to recreate the tableview behavior and the issue remains. I also added some debug lines to log the time used by the code to run and the freeze seems to last for seconds after the rendering. Debugging the code when that happens is of no help, no code seems to be executed in that timespan…</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Have you tried switching your ScrollView for a simple View?</p>
<p>Have you tried creating a test app with just the TableView, and populating that table to see if it&#39;s something in this process?</p>
<p>What is the purpose of having a TableView, which already scrolls, inside of a ScrollView which also scrolls?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>Maybe I&#39;ve posed the question in the wrong way, but I&#39;m sure the problem is not related to the tableview inside the scroll view, I&#39;ve made lots of tests before asking.<br>I think that something weird is happening because everything works as expected on my Nexus 5 and on the iOS simulator. The problem only occurs on the device itself.</p>

										<p><p>Ok, well if you have tried and tested these suggestions, then the next thing I suggest is to litter your code with debug to identify where it crashes in your code.</p>
<p>Once you identify the section of code you think it is, remove it and see if the app starts to run correctly across the board. You can then narrow down what the source of the problem is for us to help you further.</p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t understand why you&#39;re taking insult, you came to the Q&amp;A for help.</p>
<p>At this point, with out the app in front of me, I can&#39;t test it myself. You haven&#39;t told me what test&#39;s you&#39;ve already done, I am merely making suggestions and trying to gather more information to help you.</p>
<p>As frustrating as it is when something doesn&#39;t work, being sarky with people giving free help and time won&#39;t get you anywhere.</p>
