			<h1>Android 1.5  and titanium - how ? and why not ? </h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, </p>
<p>Unfortunately I closed my previous thread but it is NOT  solved. </p>
<p>Although android version 1.5 is still present in titaniums&#39;s launchg menu, with the current version of titanium it is NOT possible to load or launch any simple application under android 1.5 emulator. It is not possible to run the titanium-build app on a 1.5 device (Samsung galaxy i7500) either.<br>I was told here in a different post the other day that one could build android applications for android 1.5 with an &quot;earlier API (0.8.1)&quot;.<br>Can somebody tell me please where this API or titanium version can be downloaded ?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance</p>
<p>rb</p>

							<p>Thank you don, </p>
<p>but will compiling a previous version of the mobile SDK solve my problem ? And which version of the mobilesdk will I need to compile ? </p>
<p>Just can&#39;t believe that this is so difficult. Don&#39;t be kidding - if I develop an android application and put it on the let&#39;s say android market, last years version of android (1.5) must definitely be supported - doesn&#39;t it ? I have spent nearly a week now fiddeling around with these problems - and I will not start coding as long as I do not find a way to run and test the app on an (my) android 1.5 phone, which unfortunately is not upgraded right now.</p>
<p>What I would appreciate is a direct link to a android 1.5 compatible titanium mobilesdk which can be unzipped in the c:\program data\titanium\mobilesdk directory and selected on TD&#39;s  mobileapp edit page - and will pop up f.e. a simple app or an early version of kitchensink in the 1.5 emulator or on the 1.5 phone itself.</p>
<p>I just need one answere here: Can that be done ?????  </p>
<p>The HOWTO pages mentioned in your post (tnx) do only explain what is needed for building the mobilesdk, but not the process of building the mobilesdk itself.  I have spent so much time on fiddeling around with TD and android versions, that I&#39;ve lost hope that another approach compiling may come to a good end. </p>
<p>So one more time:  Has ANYBODY succeeded to build an android application for last years android version 1.5 with titanium 1.0 ?? If yes how step by step ?  </p>
<p>If not possible, guys, this product limitation (ANDROID 1.6 and higher only !)  should be mentioned on the first appcelerator webpage to avoid frustration ….. </p>
<p>If not supported, the logical next question would be: Will building android 1.5 compatible applications be supported in one of the next updates of appcelerator ? </p>

							<p>Ok I was told that the actual TD (titanium developer, 1.p0 ? , 1.1 ?) version does not support android 1.5.<br>I have tried to download 0.8.3 from github but I do not know what to do with this ZIP. I am running windows 7, and have all Android SDK&#39;s installed.<br>Where to copy thos files ? Do I have to compile them ? What do I get ? An exe ? if not: where to copy the result ? on windows ? </p>
<p>Three other problems present (on this website):<br>(1) Web login on there pages (authentification) seems not to survive a simple session. Every time I open a new tab in the browser I have to re-login.<br>(2) Marking the &quot;best&quot; answer automatically closes a thread in Q&amp;A. This is bad - there should be a warning before.<br>(3) reloading a page can cause doubling &quot;answers&quot; in this forum system. happend several times in many Q&amp;A entries. </p>

							<p>Additions: </p>
<p>(1) In case I try to run the android 1.5 app (simple test app with Tab 1 and Tab 2) on the android 1.5 emulator nothing happens. No error message. &quot;Your application should be up and running&quot;. </p>
<p>(2) In case I try to &quot;run on device&quot; the android 1.5 app on my android 1.5 phone (i7500) nothing gets installed. No error message in TD. There should be an error message.   </p>
<p>(3) Testing with android 1.6, 2.0 and 2.1 worked fine on the emulators. </p>

<p>The new additions to a question should be at the end of the page, not directly behind the initial question. Otherwise content gets unreadable. </p>

							<p>There are 10.000&#39;s if not 100.000&#39;s of (partially not updatable)android 1.5 phones out there - Titaniuum should support them. And if not, PLEASE remove the 1.5 testing entry from TD&#39;s emulator or display a warning. </p>
<p>OR: Please Provide a link for the old version of titanium which supports 1.5. </p>
<p>Link = download link for an windows msi installer for a complete titanium system in which 1.5 works. No tricky compiles please.  </p>

							<p>btw: no problems to reload the Q&amp;A page hundreds of times and increase your &#39;view&#39; counter to the max. </p>
<p>Something else on the todo list I guess ….</p>

							<p>All the old information is still <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.codestrong.com&#x2F;timobile&#x2F;">here</a> for now. The howto section has documentation on building from source. </p>
<p>Removing the platform-1.5 tools from your ADK is up to you. Simply run the <code>android</code> command from the ADK&#x2F;tools folder and uninstall those platforms if you don&#39;t want to see them.</p>
