							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Android does not have a distinction between the phone and tablet in the same way iOS does with the iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p>There are no extra APIs, no different UI ele,nets and in fact no way to enquire what type of device it is.  The general method (which can bring false positives) is to say a tablet is a device with either dimension greater than 799 pixels.  But as screen resolutions increase this is not the safest single point and should be used carefully.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Malcolm,<br>do you know if there are any plans to integrate such mechanisms into Titanium? I know that it is possible to define a formFactor attribute to Views in Alloy. But it would be very nice if you could provide different layouts for multiple screens (like <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;training&#x2F;basics&#x2F;supporting-devices&#x2F;screens.html">the native way</a>).</p>

										<p><p>This is not a problem of Appcelerator, it is Google who have not added anything to differentiate the platforms.  They believe every app should work on both rather than targeting each specifically.</p>
<p>You can however create two variations of the same app and build two APK files and upload them to the Google Play Store setting each to the respective platforms.  This is part of the ability to target specific builds to different hardware that Google allows - or more correctly is required to becuase of the fractured nature of the platform.</p>
<p>Whilst this might seem extreme (you can use the same code just build to different device specs) it is actually a convenient way to branch an app out.</p>
<p>So in short not Appcelerators fault - not this one at least ;-)</p>
