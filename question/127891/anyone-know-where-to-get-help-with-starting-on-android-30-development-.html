							<p>I&#39;m involved in a real project for the Samsung 10&quot; tablet with android 3, and this is what I can tell you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Titanium does not support specific android 3 API</strong> yet. But all the 2.x API is available and works fine. </li>
<li>This means that you can install the regular KitchenSink sample in an Android 3 without problems.</li>
<li>Forget work with the android simulator for version 3. Really. If you think the android emulator was slow, with v. 3 you will discover a new concept of &quot;SLOW&quot;. In my macbook i7 8GB ram, the emulator used to launch pretty well. But, I have to insist one more time, the emulator at 1280x800 pixels is impossible to work. </li>
<li>Finally, I can&#39;t wait anymore to see the new android implementation with the V8 JavaScript machine. Bigger screen means bigger images, more controls and more resources and Rhino is absolutely not prepared for this, as I have verified. AFAIK, this will happen in a very short time. I hope!</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>I develop on device (tablet), emulator is awful, slow, unstable … in short - sucks big time. Unfortunately, debugger works only with emulator. That gives us options to use slow emulator with debugger or fast device without debugger. Great.</p>
<p>V8 could be excellent addition, but I think people are too much happy about it at the moment (like it&#39;s going to solve all Android problems). It could bring speedup, but could bring a lot of new bugs also. That&#39;s why I a bit skeptic about it, but want to test it ASAP. :)</p>

							<p>Thanks for your feedback Javier. Mush appreciated. Im thinking it might be best to move to Java for Android 3.0.</p>
<p>Does anyone think Im wasting my time doing that?</p>

										<p><p>it depends of your requirements. The emulator issue will be the same in Java, since this is a emulator issue and not related to titanium.</p>
<p>If you can avoid use specific API&#39;s from version 3 and you already have experience on android with titanium and feel confortable with (as I do), I think is worth continue with Titanium. In my case, I do not need API 3 and, as I told, the V8 is about to go, which will (supossedly) solve the speed issues. But if you want to build a &quot;real&quot; native android 3 app, go for it.</p>
