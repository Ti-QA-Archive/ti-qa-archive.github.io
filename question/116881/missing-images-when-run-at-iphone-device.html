			<h1>Missing images when run at iPhone device</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>My app runs without problems under the iPhone simulator, but when I install the app at the actual device, all images were missing - icon, background images, all pics gone.</p>
<p>What could be the cause of the problem? Anyone help would be much appreciated!</p>
<p>I am using the 1.6.0 SDK with Titanium Developer 1.2.2.</p>

							<p>I had this same problem and was happy to see that the solution was a simple one in my case. I had placed my files in a folder called &#39;Images&#39; with an uppercase &#39;I&#39; in my project folder but had referenced it as &#39;images&#39; with a lowercase &#39;i&#39; in my code. As soon as I changed the folder name to &#39;images&#39; with the lowercase &#39;i&#39; everything worked fine.</p>

							<p>One possible reason for this discrepancy is that image and file names on the iOS device are case-sensitive, whereas they are not on the Mac OS filesystem the simulator uses.  This is one potential cause for the problems you&#39;re experiencing.  </p>
<p>It could also be that our build scripts are running into problems processing your images - the most common culprit for this in the PNG Crush utility we use to try and minimize the final size of your binary by compressing .png images.  However, if an image has a .png extension but is in fact just a renamed file of another type (JPEG, GIF, etc), that will cause PNG crush to fail, which may cause problems.</p>
<p>Before diving in to either case, the first thing to try is clearing out the contents of the build&#x2F;iphone directory (leaving the directory intact), and allow Titanium to regenerate all of the native files necessary for your application.  If that doesn&#39;t work, check the two items listed above.  If THAT doesn&#39;t work, pastie.org the contents of your build&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;build&#x2F;build.log file to give the community a little more insight into what could be amiss.</p>

							<p>Thanks Philip and Kevin! :D</p>
<p>I just found out I did what Philip was talking about - &quot;Images&quot; instead of &quot;images&quot;, everything backs to normal when I change the &quot;i&quot; into lower case…. :P</p>
