			<h1>Desktop Browsers and Mobile Web App with ACS</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I know that desktop browsers are not recommended (or maybe even supported&#x2F;tested) for running Mobile Web Apps, but I have some clients who would like to use the same web interface from their Desktop browser and their mobile browser.</p>
<p>Currently with ACS and v3.0 of the API, there is an issue with Firefox and IE connecting to the ACS servers. When you try to run code, you get the error &quot;Can&#39;t reach host&quot;. The same code works find on Chrome (windows and mac) or Safari… I think, from what I have read that this is because of &#39;cross-domain requests&#39;… Just wondering if anyone has found a workaround for this?</p>
<p>I still simply point clients to using Chrome to access the site. I was hoping that maybe 3.0 had changes that might have fixed this, but I just re-compiled in 3 and still the same problem.</p>
