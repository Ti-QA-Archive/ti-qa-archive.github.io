			<h1>Android EventListeners Not Firing</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am running build: 1.0.2.201107130739 of Titanium on Mac OSX.  I have written application code that successfully runs on the Iphone but I am experiencing major issues while trying to get it running on Android.  An overview of these issues includes, EventListeners are not firing on imageViews or buttons, tableView&#39;s not able to scroll, childViews such as labels are not showing up when added to parent views such as buttons, and imageViews, random crashes, ie. &quot;OutOfMemoryErorr: bitmap size exceed VM budget&quot;, although I am not using any bitmap images anywhere and the list goes on.  </p>
<p>The particular issue I need help with is understanding why my event listeners are not firing on android.  For example, I&#39;ll create a button with a title and add the listener and add the button directly to a view yet it will not fire.  The table view that is directly below the button will only scroll if you drag it on the extreeeeeemeeee far right hand side.  I&#39;ve noticed that when you add an imageView on top of another view it seems as though it&#39;s event listener doesn&#39;t work.  Overall this just seems very finicky.  I&#39;ve spent 45 min reading the forum and I&#39;ve discovered others have had similar problems but there posts are sometimes a year old so I&quot;m thinking if these are bugs they would have been adressed by now.  Are these bugs in the framework? I&#39;ve spent many many hours trying to move images around and add them differently, and do this and that to no avail.  Any Help?</p>

							<div><p>Some code would be helpful.<br>Also, you mention that you are running a certain build of Titanium, is it form the continuous build page?</p>
<p>Also, how is you configuration regarding Android? Since <strong>nothing</strong> is working (with code that should…). It could well be a configuration issue.</p>
<p>Have you tried creating a brand new Android project using the wizard? If so, does it work properly?</p>

							<div><p>Thanks for the comment.  I avoided posting code because I didn&#39;t think it would be helpful since my code for implementing buttons and things is very standard, out of kitchen sink and documentation. I have not tried starting a new project, that&#39;s a good Idea.  I have noticed that If I put buttons directly on the window that seems to work verses putting them on views. I am going to just have to simplify my implementation a GREAT deal to get it to work on ANDROID. Thanks Again.  I have not however been able to get rid of the &quot;OutOfMemoryErorr: bitmap size exceed VM budget&quot; error, and i&#39;m not sure how or if there is a way to increase the VM budget. I basically just created new files to run on android that are much simpler than what I amd running on Iphone</p>

							<div><p>As Christian mentioned, a small working snippet of code that exhibits your issues would help us greatly in troubleshooting this.</p>

							<div><p>I definitely see now it is important not to layer views on Android and that seems to solve the event Listeners not listening issue. However the outOfMemory issue persists.  I have removed just about all PNG&#39;s yet it still crashes when navigating around.  Are there still memory leak issues? (I read about them on this forum but assumed they had been fixed as the posts were from 1year ago)  Where can I go to read about these issues or how can I get around them? @Christian, I have not modified an configuration settings for Android, and I&#39;m not sure I know how to do that.</p>
