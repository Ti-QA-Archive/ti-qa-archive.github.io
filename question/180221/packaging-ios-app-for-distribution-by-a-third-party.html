			<h1>Packaging iOS app for distribution by a third party?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have developed a Titanium app for a 3rd party.  We are now ready to publish to the Apple iTunes Store, but the third party are reluctant to give me access to their Production Distribution Provisioning Profile.  Is there any way that I can package the app without it, so as to deliver it to them and allow them to embed the provisioning profile themselves and upload to iTunes at a later date?</p>
<p>I&#39;m working with Titanium SDK  3.3.0.GA, Xcode 5.1.1</p>
<p>Any advice appreciated.</p>

							<p>The same problem I have published 3 days ago.</p>
<p>You need the provisioning file and the private key (p12) from customer. Now You can create inside Titanium with Package&#x2F;iTunes Store. After compiling you have an *.xarchive in xcode organisator. This folder you can zip and send to customer to sign. For self signing you need full account. Maybe the customer makes an account export in this xcode and you can import. In this case you can generate the ipa by your self.</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve sent archives by opening the Titanium project in Xcode.  From there you have to sign with a developer certificate and archive the project.  Open up the &#39;Organizer&#39; find the archive by right clicking on it and select &#39;Show in Finder&#39;.   Send the file to client and they will be able to re-sign it with their distribution certs.</p>

										<p><p>Yes. I&#39;ve got customer who will not give us access to distribution keys.  They will however add us as developers to their account so we can at least use the same provision and appIDs.</p>

										<p><p>Aha, this is an other way: the developer is part of the enterprise team. In my case I&#39;v got private key and provisioning file  and can compile with it. But I cannot build an IPA, only xarchive. For IPA and for iTunes Store I would need the account.</p>
