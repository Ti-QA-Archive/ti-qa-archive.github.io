			<h1>iOS app falsely rejected - Do I HAVE to resubmit?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Apple&#39;s reviewer rejected my app b&#x2F;c it uses a background audio process. He claims that my app doesn&#39;t use a background audio process so it should not be there. But my app very well can use background audio depending on how the user is using my app. So, I wrote back last night to explain why my app needs to have the process enabled. </p>
<p>But its been about 12 hrs now and I haven&#39;t heard back. I realize that it may take longer for a reply but I&#39;m wondering if maybe I should resubmit the same build again to get it back in front of him. Do I HAVE to resubmit a rejected app or can the review approved the already rejected app he has?</p>
<p>Anyone with experience with this? Thanks!</p>
