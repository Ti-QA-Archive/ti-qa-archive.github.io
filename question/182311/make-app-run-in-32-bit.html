			<h1>Make app run in 32 bit</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello, I inherited a prototype app that runs on old iPads, but not on iPad Air or 64 bit systems.<br>One of the modules is not 64 bit… so I was wondering if there was a way to force the App to work in 32 bit mode on a 64 bit processor?</p>
<p>e.g. the emulator works in everything but iPad Air and iPad Retina 64 bit.</p>
<p>It worked on my iPad Air with the old version of Test Flight, but the iOS 8 stopped that.</p>
<p>When I put the app into the new test flight, it doesn&#39;t work on iPad Air.</p>
<p>Any thoughtS?</p>

							<p>As quoted from Apple &quot;As we announced in October, beginning on February 1, 2015 new iOS apps submitted to the App Store must include 64-bit support and be built with the iOS 8 SDK. Beginning June 1, 2015 app updates will also need to follow the same requirements. To enable 64-bit in your project, we recommend using the default Xcode build setting of “Standard architectures” to build a single binary with both 32-bit and 64-bit code.&quot; You need to update any outstanding modules to run in 64bit.  If you open the modules Xcode project and follow the steps <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides2&#x2F;iOS+Module+64-bit+Support">HERE</a>, you should be good to go.</p>

							<p>Thanks – what if one of the modules isn&#39;t available in 64 bit? Am I out of luck?<br>I guess I can do Ad Hoc distribution as 32 bit only for now?  This is just a prototype we don&#39;t want to lose access to.  The Developer of one of the modules does not seem interested in compiling a 64 bit version.</p>

										<p><p>Compiling the module for 64bit should be pretty straight forward when following Appcelerator&#39;s steps.  Is the modules xcode project available on github or somewhere else?  I&#39;d be interested in looking at it.</p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anyway to get around it.  Maybe someone else will give their 2 cents, but to my knowledge everything must be 64bit if run on iOS 8+.</p>

										<p><p>Turns out – I was able to get rid of the old 32-bit module.  It didn&#39;t seem like it was being used in the code anyway.  Getting rid of it, the app still works under 32-bit with ti.paint 1.1.  However, when I upgrade to ti.paint 1.4 and 1.4.1, the app cannot draw or add text, etc. in both 32-bit and 64-bit modes.  Meaning, I think it&#39;s ti.paint 1.4 that is causing the issues.</p>
<p>My next step might be to try to recompile ti.paint 1.1 in 64-bit.. unless there&#39;s a better suggestion?</p>
<p>It looks like there were errors with touch events on 1.4, so 1.4.1 was posted but removed.</p>
