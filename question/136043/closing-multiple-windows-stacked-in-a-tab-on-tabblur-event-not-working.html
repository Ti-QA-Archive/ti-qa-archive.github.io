			<h1>Closing multiple windows stacked in a tab on tab.blur event not working</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve read multiple posts about closing windows stacked on a tab in a tabgroup. The only reliable solution seems to be to maintain a stack manually and closing windows (probably most recent window first). The problem that I now have is the following. Suppose I have two tabs with 2 windows in tab1 and 5 windows in the tab2 and the user selects tab2 and navigates to the 5th window, but then clicks on tab1. What I want to accomplish is that if the user clicks tab2 again, he starts at the first (root) window of this tab.</p>
<p>I thought I would be able to do this by attaching a &quot;blur&quot; event handler on the 2nd tab. However, this event is only triggered if the user is navigating away from the root window of tab2 and not from any subsequently opened windows. Is this a bug or should I try some other way to get this working?</p>
<p>How would I otherwise distinguish between these events: 1. user navigating back and forth between windows within one tab, and 2. user switching tabs?</p>
<p>It would also be very convenient if there was a method that would close any opened windows in a tab, except the root window (feature request?).</p>
<p>Please let me know what you think,</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jeroen</p>

										<p><p>Great, this works. Just make sure to have all app events close any windows that might have opened, but don&#39;t close the root window of each indivual tab!</p>

							<p>Usually your issue is achieved through double tap on a Tab. This Feature is build in and there might be situations where I do not want to go to the root view but you forced me.  With a double tap it was my decision.</p>
