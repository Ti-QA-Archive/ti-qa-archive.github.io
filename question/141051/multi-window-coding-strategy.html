			<h1>Multi-window coding strategy...</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Am working on an app that has multiple tabs. the tabs have windows, which in turn open other windows.</p>
<p>Should these windows be created by using Ti.include or Ti.require –&gt; which is the &quot;correct&quot; way of doing this?</p>
<p>Require seems to be the way to do things in the CommonJS format which is being pushed by accelerator. although this would mean multiple JS contexts right? multiple contexts is not recommended…</p>
<p>what would the difference be of opening a window by url rather than using require? doesn&#39;t look like much differences……</p>

							<p>if you use Ti.include or Ti.require your application will no be a multiple contexts. The multi contexts applications are the ones that you create using the url property on a window the points to a different js file</p>

										<p><p>Best practices are to use CommonJS (Ti.require), the older way, is to use the url method.  I strongly recommend going the CommonJS route, you will be much better off in the long run. :)</p>

										<p><p>But when using require, the windows lose access to variables defined in app.js?</p>

										<p><p>When you use Ti.include function what its actually doing its inserting the code of x.js into your app.js that&#39;s why you can access the variables because its all in the same file. now the problem with this is that you are loading all your code at once.</p>
<p>On Ti.require you are only loading the stuff that you need. So basically anything that you export in your x.js file is like a public function and the other stuff that you don&#39;t its private. If you need to have access to some of your variables declared in app.js what you can do is save the variables in a Titanium.App.Properties this will give you global access to your variables. Another thing you can do is pass the value as a parameter to your module.</p>
<p>In the long run with commonJS your code is going to be more manageable</p>

										<p><p>So I have created some custom UI commonJS modules. In each of the windows, I will need to re-require these UI modules? This seemed like code repetition, so just wanted to confirm.</p>
<p>Thanks! :-)</p>

										<p><p>Yes you have to do a require every time, but this doesnt mean that the code its getting repeated only the sentence that says require(&quot;foo&quot;); .The code for that module its getting cache by Ti on the first time you do a require after that all you have to do is let Ti know where to load the code from. Very different from Ti.include that inserts your code into the app.js every time you do a Ti.include(&quot;foo&quot;).</p>
