			<h1>ACS - Object Ownership and data safety</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>A few things related to ACS….</p>
<p>Point 1:</p>
<p>Is there any way to make created objects (i.e places, custom objects… anything) at a root level without having to use the appcelerator interface?</p>
<p>Senario 1:<br>Multiple users use an app to create public points of interest (places), the user then stops using the service and deletes the account. All the points of interest that where created by the user also get deleted. The user created the POIs for the public domain?? Is there a way that the ACL can take ownership?</p>
<p>Senario 2:<br>I want to bulk load 10,000+ places which is foundation of app. Currently has to be done using a user account (admin or regular). Say account gets deleted (these things happen) bang goes app!</p>
<p>Does this mean that I have to keep every user account created?</p>
<p>An isDeleted (true&#x2F;false) custom field isn&#39;t really a manageable solution. </p>
<p>Could ownership be transfered to an admin account?</p>
<p>Is this a future feature - if yes how long?</p>
<p>Point 2:</p>
<p>Are ACL&#39;s supposed to bridge the gap between admin users and regular users?</p>
<p>Senario:<br>Both admin user and regular user belong to same ACL with read&#x2F;write permissions. Admin creates object, regular user want to update it. I cannot get this to work?</p>
<p>ACS is awesome and life is soooooo much easier with it, but compared to stack mob and other PaaS it just doesn&#39;t feel mature enough to run in production.</p>
<p>Last question(s) -say I lost my data by mistake - even if I have to pay is there a way to restore it? When will back up be available?</p>
<p>Even running just small time projects - my customers data and therefor my lively hood is on the line.</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>IJ</p>

							<div><p>Solved my problem regarding point 2. Make sure that the ACL has an admin as an owner assigned on creation. This seems to make the ACL play nice in all usage cases.</p>

							<div><p>Moved to Stackmob for my backend - in a different league to ACS if you have serious data to manipulate. ACS is great for quick prototyping though as integration is so tight.</p>

							<p>Thanks for the feedback. for point 1, we will add a feature that you can transfer ownership of an object to a different user. We are continue working on to make ACS more flexible.</p>
