<p>I&#39;d like to be able to do something like this, where I can open a window that on top of everything else.</p>
<p>Is this possible?</p>

							<p>For ipad, its called a popover, just style it to match your app. check the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;latest&#x2F;Titanium.UI.iPad.Popover-object.html">popover api docs</a> for more.</p>

										<p><p>The popover &#39;hovers&#39; by design. You can place it wherever you want it by using the <code>center</code> property or the <code>top</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, and&#x2F;or <code>bottom</code> properties. All of this is in the link that I pasted in the answer, it only takes a few minutes to review.</p>

										<p><p>Note that in his screenshot there is NO popover arrow in any direction and it does not seem anchored to any view.  It is not clear to me how you can achieve this look using the popover class.  I tried a few variations on the Ti.UI.iPad.Popover.show() method and would either get a runtime exception or not duplicate the look requested.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate on your answer &quot;just style it to match your app&quot; by giving example code which styles it the way requested in the screenshot?  I could not figure out how to &quot;just style it&quot; that way, and I have used popovers.  But always anchored to a view.</p>

<p>Look, I understand that it&#39;s frustrating to have people clogging up the forums with things that are documented and it&#39;s fairly safe to assume that I didn&#39;t review the material you suggested to me. But I came for help and I followed up and it still wasn&#39;t clear.</p>
<p>I did review it before making this post. It still appeared that it was for an anchored popover widget. I apologize, but it wasn&#39;t very clear to me that a popover could do what I wanted to do, as the documentation heavily suggests that it&#39;s an button-anchored UI element.</p>
<p>I appreciate your help and will use a popover as suggested. Thank you.</p>

							<p>That is a modal window.</p>
<p>Just add modal:true to your window properties</p>

										<p><p>That is usually true on Android but not iOS.</p>
<p>The modal window style will determine if it is full screen or not. Unfortunately in Ti you can&#39;t control the size very well if at all depending on the style for the window you&#39;ve selected.</p>

							<p>Okay, so here&#39;s an update.</p>
<p><code>Titanium.UI.iPad.Popover</code> does not do what I&#39;m looking for. It wants to be anchored to a button or a view.</p>
<p>Opening the window with the <code>modal: true</code> parameter opens a window that covers the entire screen.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>A ton of iPad apps seem to use this UI element, which leads me to believe it&#39;s a standard issue in the iPad SDK. There must be a way to pop up a modal window like in a similar manner as the screen shot I posted earlier.</p>

							<p>As shown by Alexander, choose one of the modal styles from <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;latest&#x2F;Titanium.UI.iPhone-module">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;latest&#x2F;Titanium.UI.iPhone-module</a></p>
