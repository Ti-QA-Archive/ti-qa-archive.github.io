			<p>Is anyone able to build properly off of them? I&#39;ve cleared out my &#x2F;build&#x2F;iphone&#x2F; folder.. restarted Ti.. etc.. they build and push to the simulator fine, but crash immediately upon launch.</p>
<p>I have to go back to 1.4.1 to get it to run in the simulator. </p>
<p>And yeah… I have been switching the build in my project options..</p>
<p>anyway.. I was just curious…</p>

							<p>I started with iOS SDK 4.2 and 1.5.0 and it did not work.  I went back to iOS 3.2&#x2F;4.1 and 1.5.0 and I can get clean builds that work and my current project runs fine.  To me it looks like a problem running the beta iOS 4.2.</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve been having the same problem, glad it&#39;s not just me.  Luckily 1.4.1 works for me too.</p>

										<p><p>Same problem, though older versions of iOS seem to work fine, while the newer ones crash instantly on device.  Annoying since this was a problem in the continuous builds even before 1.4.1 was released. Luckily the official 1.4.1.1 works though.</p>

							<p>I just tried creating a new mobile project using 1.4.2 and copied my Resources folder into it and it works fine there.  I guess deleting the build folder isn&#39;t always enough (though not sure why it wouldn&#39;t be).</p>
<p>Try making a new project and copy your Resources folder into that new project and see if that fixes things for you.</p>

<p>still a no go. Launches.. then crashes.. with this in the Ti. Console..</p>
<p>Detected an attempt to call a symbol in system libraries that is not present on the iPhone:<br>mmap$UNIX2003 called from function _Z20TCMalloc_SystemAllocmPmm in image ctz9d.<br>If you are encountering this problem running a simulator binary within gdb, make sure you &#39;set start-with-shell off&#39; first.</p>

										<p><p>Hey Critter,</p>
<p>Are you trying to use iOS SDK 4.2?  If so, I get the same crash on launch but 3.2&#x2F;4.1 work fine with the continuous builds that I have tried.</p>

							<p>Are you guys working with the newest continuous builds? They&#39;ve just upped it to 1.5.0 and I would get an exception when starting up my app with Android (a 1.4.2 build from about a week ago works fine). My bet is because of the recent refactor branch merges in the past few days, the dev builds are a bit unstable right now.</p>

							<p>Hey Robby..</p>
<p>I just tried the 1.5. No go.. Even creating a new blank project in any of the builds fails for me..</p>
<p>however, if I go back to 1.4.1, then everything works as it should..</p>
<p><em>shrug</em> </p>
