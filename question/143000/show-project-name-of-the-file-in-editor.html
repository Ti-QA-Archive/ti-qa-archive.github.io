			<h1>Show project name of the file in editor</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi guys.</p>
<p>First of all, sorry if the title is not clear because I couldn&#39;t come up with better name.</p>
<p>I want to know if it&#39;s possible to show project name of the file in editor tabs, I hope you know what I mean. It&#39;s something like when you open similar file name, let&#39;s say app.js and app.js but they from different projects, the tab in editor will show something like this, &quot;app.js | Project 1&quot; and the other one would be &quot;app.js | Project 2&quot;.</p>
<p>Since I usually copy some parts of code to other projects, sometimes I edited the code in wrong projects. I just want to avoid this kind of mistake in the future. If anyone maybe has tips to avoid this, I would love to try. Thanks in advance =)</p>

							<div><p>if you open different project&#39;s files haveing same name like project1 and project2  and you open app.js of both of the projects then you can see in your editor that it shows app.js | project1  and app.js | project2   </p>
<p>and most probably you dont need same file names for different projects thats why there is less need to append project name with files opened in editor  having unique name</p>

							<div><p>Indeed, it&#39;s just on rare occasions since the only similar file name would be the app.js. I just thought it would be nicer if there is option to show the project name beside the file name since it&#39;s a bit confusing at times when you&#39;re working on multiple projects at once.</p>

							<p>Many people here gave more detailed answers, so I can&#39;t give more details than that.</p>
<p>But a shorter answer would be:</p>
<p>The project&#39;s name will be displayed in the tab <strong>only</strong> when two files with the same name are opened. There is no setting to change that. Of course, you could <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.1&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Rubles">customize Studio using Rubles</a>. That would be the best approach.</p>
