			<h1>Internationalization Methods</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Recognizing that Titanium has a built-in internationalization platform; I am not a huge fan of the XML based <code>name</code> identifiers and am more of the fan described by GNU gettext. I am curious on two fronts, is it technically possible to use a different internationalization platform other then the built in one (like using gettext)? Also what are some of the reasonings behind using a custom platform such as XML (in the case of Titanium) or say YAML (in the case of Ruby on Rails). Seems the topic of reinventing i18n in a development environment is not commonly discussed.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>It is not commonly discussed as the solution provided is usually suitable &quot;enough&quot;, though I do understand your points.</p>
<p>You can use any method you like, there is no need to use the built in version, it is there for convenience but you are welcome to create your own implementation.  However you will not be able to use the extra i18n properties such as; textid, titleid and more.  You will also need to create your own <strong>L</strong> macro equivalent, but that is not that hard either.</p>
<p>The simplest way would be to create a CommonJS module that handles the find and return function, you pass it a string it returns back the correct locale version.  Inside this module you will already have determined the current locale and internally referenced a lookup file for your dictionary.  It will be up to you to read in the file in whichever method you find more suitable.</p>
<p>Then in your app you could reference it as follows;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var lbl = Ti.UI.createLabel({
    <span class="hljs-variable">height</span>: Ti.UI.SIZE,
    <span class="hljs-built_in">text</span>: require(<span class="hljs-string">'locale'</span>).L(<span class="hljs-string">'example'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'fallback'</span>),
    <span class="hljs-variable">width</span>: Ti.UI.SIZE
});
</code></pre><p>Of course as you are responsible for the module decoding the string tables, it may simple be easier to use the built in support.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
