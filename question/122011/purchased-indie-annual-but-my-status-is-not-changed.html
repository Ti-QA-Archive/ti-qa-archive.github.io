			<h1>Purchased Indie Annual, but my status is not changed.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I purchased Indie Annual last week, and I checked my money is gone. </p>
<p>However, my status is not changed to Indie Annual. (Currently Community)</p>
<p>I sent emails several times, but appceleator doesn&#39;t answer.</p>
<p>How can I contact to the manager?</p>
<p>Please reply my email or just refund my money.</p>
<p>$499 is not cheap.</p>
<p>This is almost 5~6 time to ask this.</p>
<p>I will wait for the answer.</p>

										<p><p>Mehmedov, Thanks.</p>
<p>I know no one can help here.</p>
<p>However although I tried to contact them several times, they didn&#39;t answer me.</p>
<p>I expect that they saw this question, and reply any word.</p>

										<p><p>Kyoungwon, as Tony has explained, we cannot find a transaction made by a user account with your name. Would you please send us the details (email address, username) to community@ that you used to subscribe to the Indie plan, and we will happily rectify the issue for you.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
