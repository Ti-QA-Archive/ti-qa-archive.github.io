			<h1>Improve table view performance?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m having trouble getting TableViews to perform well when scrolling.  Scrolling is not smooth.  I&#39;ve tried adding the className attribute to my rows and custom rows which seemed to help some, but scrolling is not performing up to par with what I would expect from a native app.  </p>
<p>Anyone have any ideas on how to improve performance?  I do have one table view that contains 1000+ rows with a search bar.  Is there a way to load the table view after at least 1 character has been typed into the search bar (similar to an autocomplete).  Note with a scroll view I can scroll even a 1000 rows very quickly.</p>
<p>So far I like appcelerator, the only show stopper for me right now is how poorly the table views perform.  Even in the kitchen sink app table views don&#39;t perform on par with what I&#39;ve seen in other apps.</p>

							<p>Hey,</p>
<p>A trick I found out that really helps tableview performance (this trick was originally posted to improve native iOS performance, but it also works wonders in titanium):</p>
<p>If you have a cell with multiple subviews (labels, images, etc…) - render all of them into a single image and have the cell contain only that image (as shown below). You&#39;ll be surprised how this improves scrolling.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    <span class="hljs-comment">//... put all elements into "view"</span>
    var blob = view.toImage(<span class="hljs-keyword">null</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">true</span>);
    var tempImage = Ti.UI.createImageView({
        <span class="hljs-variable">height</span>:<span class="hljs-variable">height</span>,
        <span class="hljs-variable">width</span>:<span class="hljs-number">320</span>,
        <span class="hljs-built_in">image</span>:blob
    });
    cell.<span class="hljs-built_in">add</span>(tempImage);
</code></pre>

										<p><p>OMG! Yoav: thank you very much!!! I can&#39;t believe how well it works! I have a published app and we had a very hard time with this issue. With the blob image the scroll has improved but also the &quot;click&quot; event is faster right now… I&#39;ve noticed that when you have a table inside a tabgroup and you load the table before it&#39;s loaded and opened, everything works ok. But when you load the table with the &quot;postlayout&quot; or &quot;open&quot; event, you will have issues with the table &quot;click&quot;… sometimes delaying the click for even 10 secs. With the blob image is fixed now!!!…. again, thanks!</p>

										<p><p>Really good trick, man!</p>
<p>This obviously requires a slightly longer time creating the row, but then it improves a lot scrolling performance, specially with complex layouts. Thank you very much for sharing!</p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t know why but it is not working for me. It only shows some of my subviews at the end of the process. I have 5 elements but it only renders 2 of them… Strange!</p>

							<p>I think I figured out part of my problem I was storing around 1000 records in a global application variable.  I removed the records that were being held in memory for the lifetime of the app and my table views are performing better.   At least for views with up to a couple of hundred rows.  I revamped my UI to provide drill down so that there would never be 1000s of rows in a table view.  This seems to have helped my performance.  Occasionally, I notice the tables don&#39;t scroll perfectly smooth but it seems to be related to memory usage on my device.</p>
