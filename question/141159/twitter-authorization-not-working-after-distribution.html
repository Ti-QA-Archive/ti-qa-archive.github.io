			<h1>Twitter authorization not working after distribution</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I recently distributed an update to my app to include the ability to send tweets with an automatic hashtag added. I used the jsOauth found here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.bytespider.eu&#x2F;post&#x2F;3032429995&#x2F;twitter-client-using-titanium-and-jsoauth-part-1 as it seemed to work for both Android and iOS devices.</p>
<p>The intent is for the window where the tweet will be written to be opened, and then a check is done to see if the user is authenticated, and if they are not, a modal web view opens the twitter authorization page. This works perfectly fine in android, and in all our development copies of the iOS version, but once the app is downloaded from the iTunes store, the twitter login page never loads and the activity indicator just spins indefinitely.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried talking to apple about the issue and they have no idea. I also reuploaded the binary in case it was somehow corrupt but the problem still persists. Other web views still work so I&#39;m unsure what can be causing the problem.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, when the problem only exists in the live copy, it&#39;s pretty hard to diagnose so any ideas would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Many thanks!</p>
<p>Andy</p>

							<p>I think I had a similar issue when working with an older version of jsOauth that was missing a comma in a variable declaration.  Around line 96, check to make sure there is a comma at the end of the <code>parser</code> variable declaration:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">        var args = arguments, args_callee = args.callee,
            parsed_uri, scheme, host, <span class="hljs-keyword">port</span>, path, query, <span class="hljs-built_in">anchor</span>,
            parser = /^([^:\/?<span class="hljs-comment">#]+?:\/\/)*([^\/:?#]*)?(:[^\/?#]*)*([^?#]*)(\?[^#]*)?(#(.*))*/,</span>
            uri = this;
</code></pre>

										<p><p>I had this exact same issue, a single comma caused the whole problem.  You can do an &#39;AppStore&#39; test before submitting by making an ad hoc version of the app and running that on a device. This way you know it will work in the store rather than having to wait for errors after submission.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks that solved the problem! And ad hoc is a great way to test as it suffered from the same issue before I tried adding the extra comma. Thanks again for both of the tips!</p>
