			<h1>Analytics in Ad-Hoc build</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve activated analytics for an app that I&#39;ve just submitted to the queue of the apple app store.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also built an ad-hoc build that I use to send to a couple of users.</p>
<p>Currently, I&#39;m not seeing any analytics data, not even the name of the app in my apps.</p>
<p>I would assume that analytics would work on ad-hoc builds, but is this the case?</p>
<p>Do I have to wait for the app to go live in the app store?</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Kelv.</p>

<p>The analytics issue is an unusual one. We have resolved it for you now, but are unclear about the reasons it occurred or whether any other users have experienced it before. Thank you for raising it; my team will be on the lookout for similar incidents, with a view to establishing the source and correcting it as soon as is possible.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>So if I build a new app, just as an ad-hoc build, should analytics work or is it just for published app store apps?</p>
<p>And if it does work, how long should it take before the app shows up in my.appcelerator?</p>

										<p><p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>Basically you need to try and get the attention of the Appcelerator support staff. They were unable to diagnose why my app wasn&#39;t showing up in My Apps, but they were able to resolve it on their end.</p>
<p>Personally, I think it may be related to the fact that when I first ran the app on device, analytics was switched off… perhaps there&#39;s some kind of registration the app does with my.appcelerator on the first build or something.</p>
<p>Sorry couldn&#39;t be of more help, but double check you&#39;ve got analytics turned on and if you have (as I did) try and bend the ear of the support guys.</p>
<p>Kelvin.</p>
