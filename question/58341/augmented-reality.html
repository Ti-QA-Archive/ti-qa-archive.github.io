		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am wondering if anyone has successfully completed a Augmented Reality (AR) application in Titanium?</p>
<p>Just wanted your feedback on how it runs as I am trying to decide if to build one native or with TI</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

							<p>Hi guys, sorry for the long delay.<br>Since my post, I tried to review and comment a little bit my code, however I found that on iOS 4 devices it isn&#39;t working properly, while it seems to work as expected inside the iphone emulator.<br>Anyway, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.dropbox.com&#x2F;u&#x2F;1222934&#x2F;ARTest.zip">here</a> you will find a zip file that contains the necessary files to be dropped in the Resources directory of a newly created project.<br>Please consider that this was only an experiment. Use it at your own risk ;-)</p>
<p>As soon as I&#39;ll have some more spare time I&#39;ll try to have again a look at the code in order to figure out why it isn&#39;t working properly. I&#39;m looking forward to test it on the upcoming 1.5 SDK… Anyway I&#39;m planning to factor out some core parts from that code in order to create a more handy JS library.</p>

							<p>Am I correct in saying that TI cant do camera overlays in Android ?</p>
<p>If not, will it be possible in the 1.5 sdk?</p>
<p>I tried to find the example in Kitchensink, but failed or it didn&#39;t work on android.. Can you direct me there ?</p>

							<p>Hi, around 3-4 months ago I&#39;ve been conducting some experiments with augmented reality on Titanium&#x2F;iPhone (i.e. viewing text labels representing actual points of interest correctly overlaid on a camera view).</p>
<p>If I remember well, I had some performance problems when processing large sets of POIs, however I didn&#39;t have time to perform some serious measurement and eventually optimize the code.</p>
<p>If anyone&#39;s interested I can manage to polish the code and post it somewhere.</p>

							<p>Hi all, I see that my post generated a bunch of requests, but lately I&#39;ve been quite busy… </p>
<p>Anyway don&#39;t despair. I plan to release the code during this week.<br>I&#39;ll post a link here and if you want to get notified by mail, please drop me a line at (olivier dot morandi) on google&#39;s mail service :-).</p>

							<p>Hi All</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been playing around with the GREAT source code developed by Oliver.<br>I think the reason for the code not working on the device is down to line 477 of the code, which states</p>
<p><strong><code>if (Ti.Platform.model != &amp;#39;Simulator&amp;#39;)</code></strong></p>
<p>I changed that to read:</p>
<p><strong><code>if (Ti.Platform.model ==&amp;#39;iPhone 4&amp;#39;)</code></strong></p>
<p>And it works on the iPhone.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t figure out why the Radar isn&#39;t working as yet though…<br>Hope that helps someone.</p>
<p>cheers<br>Simon</p>

										<p><p>Hi Simon, can you elaborate on how you got this to work. I&#39;ve downloaded the code and copied it over to a new mobile project (1.6.1). The overlay appears but no POI&#39;s get plotting in either the radar or onto the overlay. </p>
<p>Using if (Ti.Platform.model ==&#39;iPhone 4&#39;) makes no difference as it was working before but I did spot the error in a case sensitive variable currlocation and changed that to currLocation. Still no luck. </p>
<p>What did you do and on what device&#x2F;os did you get it working on?</p>
<p>Cheers, Phi</p>
