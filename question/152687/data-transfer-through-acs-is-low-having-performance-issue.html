							<p>Hello,</p>
<p>If you are starting the sync of your local db with the remote db (ACS or any other service) and the initial load is what you mentioned, it&#39;s likely to cause some issues. There is a lot of variables, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much time the ACS will take to execute your query and respond.</li>
<li>How much time will take to your app to download that response, according to the type and speed of connection you have.</li>
</ul>
<p>Being said that, what i would recommend is start the sync in background, requesting just some elements (20? 40? 50? at a time) and continue to downloading the rest, so the user gets the feeling that the app is working and still responsive.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro </p>
<p>PS. BTW, 40-60 secs for a &quot;setup&quot; sounds like a dream, specially compared to the usual times that it takes to many apps to do the initial setup. IF you explain to the user what is happening and why is important, with an activitymonitor, should be reasonable.</p>
