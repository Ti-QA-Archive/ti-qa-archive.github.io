<p>Bearing in mind that Titanium Developer reached end of life some time ago, and therefore is no longer supported, can I assume you are using Titanium Studio?</p>
<p>You seem to have the 64bit of JDK, which isn&#39;t supported. See <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Installing+Oracle+JDK">Installing Oracle JDK</a> for information about installing 32bit JDK instead.</p>
<p>Also, if you don&#39;t have all the android packages installed, then Titanium Studio will not recognize the SDK. Would you check yours against the ones shown in the screenshot at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Installing+and+Updating+Android+SDK#InstallingandUpdatingAndroidSDK-SummaryofInstalledAndroidPackages">Summary of Installed Android Packages</a> and let me know if it helps.</p>

										<p><p>Just small correction, Titanium Developer is not longer supported by Appcelerator, but is supported by community. For more details use cool new search. :)</p>

										<p><p>Pedro, would you mind doing this another time?</p>
<p>Please follow the instructions at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Installation+Troubleshooting#InstallationTroubleshooting-InstallDiagnosticsforWindows">Install Diagnostics for Windows</a>. Copy the output and paste it to your preferred <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;">pastebin</a> service, and paste the link to it here. It&#39;s important that you do not modify it <strong>in any way</strong>, as this could mask problems with your configuration.</p>
<p>Also, please create and share a screenshot of your android installed packages, using something like <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;imageshack.us&#x2F;">ImageShack</a></p>
<p>State the processor and RAM installed to your system.</p>
<p>Lastly, run the command <code>systeminfo</code> at the commandline and share it in a gist.</p>
<p>I want to get to the bottom of this! :&#x2F;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>Yesterday I got new machine with x64 Windows and I had to go through all horror of Titanium installation. :)</p>
<p>Documentation miss things, for example, in my case, &quot;javac&quot; could not be recognized although I did everything from the docs (yes, I installed JDK, not JRE, put all env vars, etc.). I did some search and found that &quot;CLASSPATH&quot; environment system variable has to be set to point to Java&#39;s bin directory. As Paul mentioned, Java 32-bit is required, the best is to install JDK and JRE in &quot;C:&#x2F;Java&quot; directory because there could be problems if directory name has spaces (like &quot;Program files&quot;). </p>
<p>Then, next thing was that Android SDK could not be recognized, but it was installed (all versions!) and everything worked fine (I could launch emulator with AVD manager), only Titanium studio could not recognize it. There was a bug reported regarding this and seemed to be solved, but it seems to me that it&#39;s still present. Solution in my case (&#39;cause other people had some other solutions that didn&#39;t work for me) is funny. Really funny. I needed to move Titanium SDK to other location, so I changed that in preferences (Studio -&gt; Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Aptana Studio -&gt; Titanium -&gt; Titanium SDK Directory) and then Android SDK was recognized. I was WTF-ucked, I lost couple of hours to get that work and then I managed to solve it accidentally. :)</p>
<p>I hope Titanium Studio will become quality product as Aptana once was, I want to press &quot;Next&quot;, Next&quot;, Next&quot; … and not to loose whole day just to install basic stuff for development.</p>

							<p>I made a fresh install of android SDK, Java32 jdk and Titanium SDK. My new windows test results are: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;1354801</p>
<p>It passes on all tests but titanium doesn&#39;t detect my android sdk.<br>The tests that i made on my system are referenced in the Installation Troubleshooting Wiki.</p>

<p>It&#39;s best to use the comment facility rather than answering your own question, as it makes it easier for others to follow the conversation.</p>
