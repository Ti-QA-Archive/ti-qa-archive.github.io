			<h1>Classic vs Alloy?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>When I attended a general mobile course about 10 months ago, we where learning only the classic version of Titanium (approx 10 weeks where dedicated to Titanium). I have then understood that this approach is more or less outdated and that Alloy is the way to go in the future.</p>
<p>I am new to Titanium so before I dig down into Alloy (already having so much to learn), I wonder if you think I am doing the right thing = Will classic soon be outdated by Alloy and is that the way to go?<br>What does your crystal balls say?</p>

							<p>You should be using Alloy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alloy provides a common way to organize code, making it easier to switch between projects, bring on new developers to a project, or join other developer&#39;s projects.</li>
<li>Alloy makes development faster by providing many convenient layout shortcuts and productivity enhancements. Our sales teams talks of 70% code reduction, which is probably best case. But you will write a whole lot less code with an Alloy app.</li>
<li>Alloy apps can run faster than classic apps due to code optimization and additional tools for platform-branching that generate platform-specific code</li>
<li>Alloy provides conveniences for creating app-wide styles, creating themes, and reusable components. Each of those would require a separate custom solution with Classic code.</li>
<li>Alloy helps you create more uniform code that conforms to the principle of separation of concerns (MVC). This will speed development as noted. But it will also help you create code that is easier to maintain (reducing total cost of ownership) and in principle have fewer bugs.</li>
<li>Alloy provides a consistent directory structure for assets, libraries, and core app code, a structure that won&#39;t change between projects or as developers join&#x2F;leave projects.</li>
<li>Most sample apps and documentation that we create are being prepared for Alloy first, with Classic examples coming later. Most new component development by the community is being done as widgets (Alloy components) not Classic oriented modules.</li>
<li>You can use all the same extension modules you would use for a Classic project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that Alloy is a pre-processor. It takes your MVC code and generates Classic code. You still need to know the API (which means knowing Classic code). It just removes the code mess that many developers created to organize their projects.</p>
