		<section>
			<p>I need to generate a SHA-256 with salt which I will use for each server request to verify the user. Is it safe to store the salt within my app?</p>
<p>I know that Titanium converts javascript to objective-c and that the app IPA file is encrypted. But I also know that you can decrypt an IPA. What happens then? Would it be difficult to find my salt passphrase?</p>
<p>PS - I have ported over a HMAC SHA-256 javascript quite nicely to titanium.</p>

							<p>I would like to know the same, is it safe? Any chance that you would share your HMAC SHA-256 solution?</p>

										<p><p>After much research and not very direct answers from Premium Support I decided NOT to use the encrytion. For several reasons.</p>
<p>1) Firstly, and most importantly, Apple makes a big deal about encrypting anything in your app and there are very strict procedures regarding it.<br>2) I chose to use Facebook&#39;s authentication where it validates via my server which remotely processes encryption.</p>
<p>In both cases it was a hassle. If you are using Facebook look into option 2. If you have a username&#x2F;password to your server, let your server due the encryption.</p>
<p>Anyone wanting the JS file (SHA+HMAC) to &quot;include&quot; I can provide you with the file. It&#39;s just a short function call to do the encrypting. Very easy. Email me at ryan + eagledevelopers.net</p>

										<p><p>Oh and as far as I know, storing the &quot;key&quot; for the encryption will definitely vulnerable if someone goes rummaging around your app&#39;s files.</p>

										<p><p>Hmm, well it&#39;s not Facebook and I have to sign my request using HMAC SHA-256 encryption to be able to receive any data from the API call. Maybe I&#39;ll go for Objective-C programming for this one after all. Anyway, thanks for the reply. I&#39;ll drop you an email just to se what I can do.</p>
