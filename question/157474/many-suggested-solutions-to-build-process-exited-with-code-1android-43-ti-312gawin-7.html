			<p>I&#39;ve read most of the &#39;solutions&#39;  for the above mentioned error and the responses indicate that one or more of those solutions works for some people. In particular, what I&#39;ve seen most is the androidsdk&#x2F;build_tools has two files and a folder that belong in androidsdk&#x2F;platform tools (aapt.exe,dx.bat and &#x2F;lib). It&#39;s necessary to copy from build_tools to platform tools. This, they say, is caused by later versions of the android sdk. However, this bug was supposedly fixed in 3.1.1.GA, but it didn&#39;t work for me. I&#39;ve tried most of the suggested solutions, such as:<br>Ensure Android SDK 2.2 installed<br>Updated Python to 2.7.0.<br>Ensure Android SDK 2.3.3 installed<br>Copy build_tools aapt.exe, dx.bat and &#x2F;lib to platform_tools.<br>Set JAVA_HOME to c:\program files\java\jdk1.7.0_40<br>Add jdk1.7.0_40 to path<br>Ensure c:\program files\java\jdk1.7.0_40\bin in path<br>Ensure Android SDK in path</p>
<p>I started having this error in the project I built. Since I couldn&#39;t solve the issue, I created a default Ti Studio &quot;Hello World&quot; project, but get the same error with it.<br>I could really use some help with this. I&#39;ve seen various of the above solutions work for others, but none work for my simple project. Plus I&#39;m fairly sure I&#39;ve read all the google search responses to the question of this error.  Thank you in advance for your assistance.</p>
