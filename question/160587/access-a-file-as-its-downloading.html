			<h1>Access a file as its downloading</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi</p>
<p>i have an app which plays audio , at the minute im streaming the audio and saving a local version via a xhr request. I do this so the next time the user plays this song it will play the local version and not stream it ( to help a user from using data).</p>
<p>However this approach is a bit flawed in sense this means that the file is downloaded twice when a user plays a song (once to stream and once to download)</p>
<p>What i would like to do is:<br>when a user clicks play, start downloading the file.<br>Then do not stream the audio instead access the file as its being downloaded.</p>
<p>My issue is:<br>I cant find a way of accessing the file before the download is complete. I have no idea where the temp directory is (its not Ti.Filesystem.tempDirectory).<br>The audio files are around 6MB so waiting for the download to be complete before playing song is not an option.</p>
<p>My Question is:<br>Does anyone know how to access a file as its being downloaded, i thought there may have been a way via the ondatastream event but i had no success.</p>
<p>Any insight into this would be great</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Gary</p>

							<div><p>Gary, I have never done this, but your question got me curious too! So I decided to take a look at the docs and found a <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Network.HTTPClient-property-file"><strong>file</strong></a> property for the <strong>Titanium.Network.HTTPClient</strong>. Have you tried it? I would test it but I am not on my pc right now.</p>

										<p><p>Hi thanks for your answer however this isnt what im looking for, im hoping to find a way of accessing a file as its being  saved to the DataDirectory.</p>
<p>im trying to avoid streaming it and downloading it .<br>If i cant access the file as its being saved then i will just have to stick with streaming it and not download it.<br>i dont wish to do both .<br>your link was for streaming the file, however I am trying to access a saved file, i already have the streaming part covered.</p>
<p>Thank you for your input .</p>
<p>Gary</p>
