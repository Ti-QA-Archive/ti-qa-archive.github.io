			<p>I am working under windows and can work under UNIX.   I believed appcelerator&#39;s hype about developing both iPhone &amp; Android on the same platform.   I was naive believing a presentation to a major bank,  the website,  and third party manuals.   The fact you can develop for iPhone only on a Mac was missing in all of them.    Many years ago,  I had to deal with a firm called MSA Software.  At one  point MSA was the largest software company in the world.   Most people have never heard of it as it crashed and was bought.  MSA had the same high ethical standards as Appcelerator.   (I know this post will never see the light of day.   But you have been warned)</p>

							<div><p>Acting as a moderator.</p>
<p>Whilst you are very welcome to your opinion; be it right or wrong, I do wonder how given the following points you believe someone pulled the wool over your eyes;</p>
<ul>
<li>You have had an account for 18 months</li>
<li>You have had access to the docs for the same amount of time</li>
<li>The requirement for OSX is stated in multiple places</li>
<li>I assume you understand this is a cross platform development solution, as such it develops for each platform natively, thus requires the tools each native platform requires and thus is bound by THOSE rules not its own.</li>
<li>There is nothing on the main page, download page that says you can run all platforms from windows, or anywhere else</li>
<li>Configuring your SDKs requires you read &quot;Studio begins downloading and installing each SDK you selected, according to the settings you specified. In the case of iOS, Studio launches the App Store application installed on your Mac to the XCode download page.&quot; &lt;- spot anything</li>
<li>If you had created any apps you will have seen no option for iOS apps, attempting to configure the environment would not have allowed it either</li>
<li>You saw a powerpoint demo which was either wrong and you failed to perform any due diligence prior to choosing a platform or you saw the presentation and misunderstood the content (more likely) but still failed to perform any due-diligence</li>
<li>You say the website says you can develop for all mobile operating systems using any desktop OS - if so where does it say this; url please</li>
<li>I will make it easier where on the website does it say you can create an iOS app using Windows; url please</li>
<li>Which books say you can create iOS apps using Windows?</li>
<li>This fact is not hidden, it is public, it requires no explanation as it is obvious; iOS requires xcode which requires OSX.</li>
<li>If you did not know this, then you failed simply failed to read any of the docs during any of the install phases, the platform setup, the SDK setups, configuring the environment or running an app.</li>
<li>Signing up for an Apple iOS developer account tells you what is required.</li>
<li>The licence for xcode states it CANNOT be used on any other operating system other than OSX</li>
<li>A google search would have given you the answer</li>
<li>A search using the Q&amp;A search box lists the very first question with the answer</li>
</ul>
<p>I understand you are disappointed to have only worked this out 18 months very much later as you failed to perform the most basic of due-diligence - but that simply points to your short comings - not other peoples.</p>
<p>But I understand what you mean - if only there was some way you could have known.</p>
<p>As to why you felt it necessary to share with the world you also made a mistake some other company is unknown to me.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;I know this post will never see the light of day&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>As a moderator I have the power to remove questions or answers that are not appropriate, irrelevant, rude or insulting.  This however falls into a different category; it can stand to show others what happens if you fail to perform the tasks of a competent developer, manager or anyone else who is charged to make decisions.</p>
<p>You can of course get a Mac.</p>
