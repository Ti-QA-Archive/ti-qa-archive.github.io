							<p>Hi,<br>Select the project in Titanium and under run configuration, choose iOS device. when you do that it will ask for you a valid certificate.<br>make sure you have a valid certificated you created for your app from your apple account.<br>If not you can use the default certificated from Xcode. you can find that certificate in xcode, i.e. launch xcode then from top menu choose window–&gt; organizer then look under provisioning profile.</p>
<p>select the required certificate, revel that certificate in finder.<br>Once you know where that certificate is in the disk, then just locate that certificate to the titanium window asking for certificate.. press finish.</p>
<p>you will be running your app in iphone now..:)</p>

										<p><p>No..There is a process for it..</p>
<ol>
<li>make sure that your device has the same provisioning profile that you are using for the development of this project.</li>
<li>If your device has it, then you have to go to the project directory under the build folder you will find an yourProjectName.app file. drag this files to itunes. then you can synch with your device.</li>
</ol>
<p>instead of going through this long method</p>
<p>just plug your device, click on the run option iOS device. It will ask for the provision profile, give the required to it and then just press finish. It will install the app in your device and you can test your app.</p>
