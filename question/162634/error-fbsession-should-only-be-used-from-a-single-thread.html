			<h1>Error FBSession: should only be used from a single thread</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey, I know there is already multiple threads with possible solutions to this, but I think many like me are still having many problems. I&#39;m using Titanium on iOS using the Facebook module. I can run my app fine normally(Not launching from iOS notification). I log in Facebook and I can use facebook graph calls without any error. </p>
<p>Next I just have setup my app in the Facebook app settings on the website. I have my app setup so I can launch it from a notification from Facebook. My app launches correctly from Facebook but as soon as I call a function or anything that is related to Ti.Facebook it gives me the above error  FBSession: should only be used from a single thread. It don&#39;t matter what I call or call first anything coming from that module will not work since I&#39;m on a new thread I guess. But this is the very first Window that opens in my app witch would be the login screen, so I can;t possibly see how I&#39;m on a new thread my app just launched and my first piece of code could be a call from the Facebook module and it will give me the error right away.</p>

							<div><p>Just to be clear I&#39;m using the module and doing var fb = require(&#39;facebook&#39;); I even tried to put it in my main and I get the error right away. I only seem to be able to use it if I don&#39;t launch from the iOS notification</p>

							<div><p>I seem to have determined that it has to do with logging out. It&#39;s like when I launch from the notification it&#39;s like starting the app over again and it starts in a new thread. If you log out the app when closing the window on pause then I don&#39;t get the error. but heck I can&#39;t force the user to login every time the window closes, so this solution doesn&#39;t seem to make sense. I&#39;m wondering how others are getting their apps to work, maybe they&#39;re using native code witch would probably solve this by searching for FBSession instances.</p>
