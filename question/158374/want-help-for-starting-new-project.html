							<p>On one side you will need to develop a server application to manage your books&#39; uploads, store the .pdf in the server filesystem and keep a record with related and useful infos for each them (as a simple json file, or using a database table…). </p>
<p>This server app will then need to manage mobile client-apps requests, responding with the available books list (as json) and serving the single pdf files of user choice.</p>
<p>On the other side there will be your client titanium app: it will need to make proper request to the server application to receive the updated book list and to download the pdf files choosen by the user. It will receive the pdf and store the file in the local app storage space for future access without a second download (at this purpose the client should keep a trace of books already available locally, or just check their presence at runtime…).</p>
<p>The pdf can be displayed with the use of WebViews under iOS, not with Android at the moment, as far as I know. You should also give the users the ability to delete a pdf file when not needed anymore.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure how much this can help, nor if it is a good approach to your task, but I hope it could be something to start with.</p>
<p>Code strong!</p>
