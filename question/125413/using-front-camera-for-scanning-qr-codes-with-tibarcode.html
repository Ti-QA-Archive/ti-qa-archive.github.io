							<p>Are you using iOS or android or both?  (It is always a good idea to mention that, pleas.)</p>
<p>Looking at the Ti.barcode docs, it is clear there is not currently an option to specify the camera.  </p>
<p>Since the docs say it uses the Zxing library, I did a simple <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lmgtfy.com&#x2F;?q=ZXing+front+camera">google search</a> and can see several people asking how to do this and even one who requested <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freelancer.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;iPhone&#x2F;Need-Zxing-for-iPhone-use.html">bids</a> for modifying the library for iPhone to allow this.  (That request was canceled and not awarded.)</p>
<p>On many devices, the front facing camera is much lower resolution than the rear facing camera.  Therefore I would expect the scanning speed or success ratio to be much lower, even if you could do it.</p>
<p>But you have my curiosity piqued, what is the usage scenario where the front camera is better positioned for QR scanning then the rear camera?</p>

										<p><p>Currently I&#39;m doing it on iOS and specifically for iPad 2. Android could be an option we&#39;ll look into later on but not now, so iOS is priority. Having the front camera actually makes it easy for users to do self scanning.</p>

										<p><p>Self scanning?  Like a kiosk display where you hold up the QR to the ipad?</p>
<p>I can&#39;t help anymore on this – I don&#39;t use this module myself.  I do all my scanning with the Linea Pro hardware attachment (for iPhone&#x2F;iPod Touch).  Maybe someone who is a pro subscriber or higher can ask support for an official answer.</p>
