			<h1>Concerns</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been looking at Titanium and have some concerns.</p>
<p>There are two posts that raised alarms. They&#39;re both from 2011, so perhaps the points in them are no longer valid, but if you head to the bottom the comments on the second post you&#39;ll see they&#39;re recent and plenty of people have concerns.</p>
<p>I&#39;m asking that those in &quot;the know&quot; look at these posts and provide me with feedback.</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.technologyfirst.org&#x2F;magazine-articles&#x2F;90-june-2011&#x2F;634-the-pros-and-cons-of-appcelerators-titanium.html</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;usingimho.wordpress.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;06&#x2F;14&#x2F;why-you-should-stay-away-from-appcelerators-titanium&#x2F;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Mike</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Easy one this, they are wrong.</p>
<p>How can I say this when two people have said they have issues with the platform and a few commentators have agreed - easy, I use the platform and I do so every single day of my life.</p>
<p>Appcelerator currently has more than 465,000 users of the platform.  136,202,185 devices currently have an Appcelerator platform based app on them.</p>
<p>As you note those two articles were created some time ago - in computer years a century ago.  I have been here since just after the start and before both articles were written.  I have written a large number of apps using the system and and am doing rather well for myself - apps are my business.</p>
<p>You are correct one of the articles has a few comments from more recent dates - but not by anyone that actually uses that platform - mostly a mix of triers and moaners.  One guy suggesting that the star rating on the NBC app somehow equates to the quality of a platform.  My answer to that is simple;  Quality !== Platform, Stars !== (quality || platform) - see what I did there, showing off a little.</p>
<p>What you need is an old dog like me that was there from the near start and still uses the platform today.  I currently know in excess of 20 programming languages, a dozen database standards, I started on desktops, moved to web and then to native mobile.  I have been a professional developer for more than 25 years and owned my own business for 20+ years.  I say all this to point out something obvious - professional people do not have to or want to deal with bad ^&amp;*% (use your imagination as to what I was going to say).</p>
<p>Whilst the early days of the platform were a little bit wild west like and the documentation was rather shocking, the platform did what it said - it made apps for multiple platforms using the same code (give or take platform specific things).  It does this in a way that means you can create an app in significantly less time than other platforms (I have tried them) and giving you the option to build for more than one platform.</p>
<p>Do you have to do any work to get your app written - yes, this seems to be a big problem with many of the commentators on the post - they wanted everything but failed to give anything.  Do you need to learn something - hell yes of course.</p>
<p>Did the platform start up with less than it has now - yes, but do not all things?</p>
<p>If you want to create a professional app, build for one or more platforms, achieve it quickly - then Appcelerator&#x2F;Titanium is a great route to go.  Is this the only route? No.</p>
<p>Try it for yourself - it is free, free to use, free to publish, free to make money from, free to use the cloud services (there are limits but very large ones).  If you want more service, more debugging tools pay for it.</p>
<p>Just to confirm this answer is not designed to suggest you in anyway think Appcelerator&#x2F;Titanium is bad - just to qualify that the articles you referred to are very out of date.</p>
<p>More importantly a handful of detractors do not out-way the extremely large support base and user base of this platform.</p>
<p>Do they always get everything right NO, but then neither do I.</p>

<li><strong>The one article stated that the &quot;system stores your source code in a resource folder for each device …&quot;, therefore enabling a thrid party to view it. Is this true?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>All apps that are created using any platform are capable of being opened by third-parties and code being read that is the nature of the storage type used by the platforms.  The storage format is a zip file containing all the assets for your app.</p>
<p>So in answer to your question - no more or less than any other app.  You should always take whatever measures you deem necessary to reduce the risks - perceived or otherwise.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Does the current version of Titanium leak memory?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes of course, but so do all other languages, memory leaks are caused by bad coding styles and failure to tidy up after yourself if you have attached things to objects that persist beyond housekeeping.  However as with all platforms memory leaks can be reduced and even removed by following good programming standards.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>And lastly, is the Android app less efficient than the iOs app?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>No and yes or yes and no - depending on your view point.  The question is loaded (I know not intentionally) but the question should be <strong>does using Titanium favour iOS or Android and does that favouring mean that the Android app is not as good as the iOS app?</strong>.</p>
<p>Still a problem here as well - as the thing this does not take into account is the actual platform and not the development system.  Are iOS and Android the same or equal?  No is Android better than iOS? Yes and no.  Is iOS better than Android? Yes and no.</p>
<p>The problem is a much more complicated one, in the old days Titanium did favour iOS, but before that they favoured Android in my opinion - right now it is 50&#x2F;50 (again IMHO).  Why?  Partly due to the platforms themselves, they both have roll outs of new features at different times and with different levels of ability.  Some features are so wildly great and direction changing they are put in right away - some less ones are not, the quickest are put in right away - or sometimes later on.</p>
<p>This is a business after all.  So maybe we ask this question <strong>Can I create great apps using all the features of the standard OS for both Android and iOS without worrying that my app will be limited on one or the other?</strong> Yes</p>
<p>I will add a final question;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Does Titanium make you a better developer?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>No - certainly not.  Can you become a better developer with Titanium - Yes, but not everyone will.  You have to be willing to put the effort in (sounds like you would) and you have to make the most of the platform.</p>
<p>I am significantly better at writing apps now than I did the very first day - because I now know how to get the very most out of the platform.  But in 6 months I will tell you I am much better then as I learnt more than I thought possible right now.  We have to learn more we have to get better and the platform is only a tool to do out job.</p>
<p>Remember that saying &quot;a bad workman blames his tools&quot; - same stuff here.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind (if you are a gamer or have a passing knowledge of the consoles).  When the XBOX and PS came out (does not matter which generation) the games looked great, much better than the previous stuff we saw.  Look at the games now on the same version and they are MUCH better, same hardware, same development system, same coders - they learnt to get more out of the platform.</p>
<p><em>If nothing else you have learnt I like to type.</em></p>

										<p><p>Malcom,</p>
<p>I guess I&#39;ll have to look at the source that gets stored because the article stated it&#39;s the &quot;source&quot; code, not the compiled code. That would be a big problem, and quite ridiculous.</p>
<p>The point about memory had to do with the generated code, not coding acumen and discipline. So then the code generated by Titanium is solid, and doesn&#39;t introduce memory leaks?</p>
<p>I wouldn&#39;t use the term &quot;as good as&quot; when describing the generated Android code, but rather &quot;effidient&quot;. Sounded to me like the code generated for the Android platform is not as efficient as for iOS. I guess I&#39;ll have to try it and find out. App size and Logcat will tell me all I need to know. </p>
<p>As to your point about Titanium teaching the world to be a better developer, it&#39;s the same with any platform. The person has to first realize they could be better, and then do it (Developers Anonymous anyone?). </p>
<p>In the end I will need to answer all of my questions for myself. It was always my intention to do so. However, I figured it would ask experienced Titanium users in advance and get feedback on what I&#39;ve been reading.</p>
<p>Thanks for your input.</p>
<p>Mike</p>

										<p><p>Mike,</p>
<p>if you compile an app to distribute, the js code will be included scrambled. I don&#39;t know how level of encryption you will need, but it&#39;s not simple tasks to clone an app as happens with phonegap, that literally will held the entire html directory and you can read the actual code. </p>
<p>Best,</p>

							<p>Hi, Malcolm. Thanks for your response.</p>
<p>I understand your point about a few commentors, however I find those to be very helpful in evaluating any product because the company that creates the product will never admit to its shortcomings.</p>
<p>I too have been developing for over 25 years and in that time have seen software come and go for various reasons. In evaluating Titanium I assumed it was a mature product, then I read comments from as recent as last week that cast some doubt.</p>
<p>So, at this point, my main concerns are code security, memory usage&#x2F;clean up, and application size and, if you have a few more minutes I&#39;d like to ask you the following questions.</p>
<p>The one article stated that the &quot;system stores your source code in a resource folder for each device …&quot;, therefore enabling a thrid party to view it. Is this true?</p>
<p>Does the current version of Titanium leak memory?</p>
<p>And lastly, is the Android app less efficient than the iOs app?</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>Mike</p>
