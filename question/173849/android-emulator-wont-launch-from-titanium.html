			<h1>Android Emulator Won&#39;t Launch from Titanium</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Application type: mobile<br>Titanium Studio: 3.2.3.201404181442 - 4&#x2F;18&#x2F;14<br>Device: Android emulator<br>Host Operating System: OSX 10.9.2</p>
<p>This is an odd one. Everything was working fine before the OSX Mavericks upgrade. Now that I&#39;ve upgraded, I&#39;m trying to run the Kitchen Sink (or anything that previously ran). When running on any version of iOS emulator it builds and launches the emulator as expected. No problems there. When I switch to android…</p>
<ol>
<li>I click Run</li>
<li>It pulls up the &quot;Run Configuration&quot;</li>
<li>I confirm that there&#39;s an Emulator selected.</li>
<li>I confirm that there&#39;s a log level of info.</li>
<li>No keystore, since it&#39;s just a test.</li>
<li>Click &quot;Run&quot;.</li>
<li>Little bar motion in the bottom right for a fraction of a second as the window goes away. &quot;Launching: Invoking &#39;Studio Builder&#39; on &#39;&#x2F;KitchenSink&#39;.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Run Configuration&quot; window comes back.</li>
<li>Rinse and repeat.</li>
</ol>
<p>No output in the console window… no nothing. No build log file either. So I try running the emulator outside of Titanium and it works like a charm. Comes up no problem. Go back into Titanium and it looks as me like I&#39;m speaking Greek. I would expect there to at least be a log with an error message but there&#39;s nothing. I&#39;ve tried:</p>
<ol>
<li>Running a fresh download of KS</li>
<li>Cleaning and then running in Droid</li>
<li>Cleaning, running in iOS, and then running in Droid</li>
<li>Cleaning, running in iOS, cleaning again, and then running in Droid</li>
<li>Launching the emulator outside of TI, then running in Droid</li>
</ol>
<p>Nothing works.</p>
<ul>
<li>All the android SDK&#39;s are installed and up to date</li>
<li>The latest version of Java is installed and up to date</li>
<li>The emu launches outside of TI</li>
</ul>
<p>Help? :) </p>
<p>Thanks! :)</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Stop using the android emulators - they are just bad. Use the GenyMotion emulator instead it is VERY fast, very easy - and you will not think about self harm.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2013&#x2F;12&#x2F;using-genymotion-with-titanium-3-2&#x2F;">Using Genymotion with Titanium 3.2</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Seriously everybody does this now.  I have given this answer at least 8 times this week and every single one is very happy with it.</p>

										<p><p>The Genymotion is pretty sweet!!! :) </p>
<p>I got it all setup and the Genymotion ADV&#39;s appear in Titanium when selecting the run command, but I still have the following issues. These issues are the same whether the Genymotion emu is closed or already open and running.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Still stuck at the run config screen within Titanium. It doesn&#39;t seem to want to &quot;build&quot; and move on even with the Genymotion emu selected. There&#39;s also still no console activity or visual errors during this process.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When I build from the command line it works perfectly. However, when I then try to install the KitchenSink it errors out [INSTALL_FAILED_MISSING_SHARED_LIBRARY] which I&#39;m assuming is Google Maps. No idea how to get around this as this wasn&#39;t a problem with the previous droid emulators.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When I build a custom app that doesn&#39;t use Google Maps and install it from the command line it works beautifully. However, when it eventually errors out during runtime the app freezes and I don&#39;t see any log&#x2F;error readouts in the console or anywhere else like when I run it through the TI GUI. No idea how to get around this either.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for the help so far Malcolm.</p>

							<p>Thanks Malcolm. I&#39;ll check that out.</p>
<p>However, after sleeping on it I realized that the problem may not be the emulator launching. It may be the studio builder portion that&#39;s failing. The process seems to crap out here:</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Launching: Invoking &#39;Studio Builder&#39; on &#39;&#x2F;KitchenSink&#39;.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>I don&#39;t know what that is&#x2F;does, but it bombs and goes back to the run config window. The problem may actually be here instead of at the emulator level.</p>
<p><em>PS - After an entire day of troubleshooting this, self harm was thought about many… many… many times.</em></p>
