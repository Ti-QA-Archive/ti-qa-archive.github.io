			<h1>Android App - 3MB - ?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I created a new Project, compiled&#x2F;built it for Android, and saw that it&#39;s 3MB (with just 2 tabs and not much else).<br>I thought Titanium compiled the code into native binary, so a runtime wouldn&#39;t be needed; are all Titanium libraries being included in the build, even when they are not needed?<br>3MB is kinda huge for an app that does nothing but show 2 tabs…. is there any way this can be optimized to be much (much) smaller and &quot;realistic&quot;?<br>Thanks.</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve also found the binary size for a Titanium mobile app to be bloated. A simple app on iPhone is around 3MB as well.  My guess is that the entire Ti library is being built in, whether needed or not for an app.  I don&#39;t know of any way to reduce the footprint. :(  In comparison, a &#39;hello world&#39; mobile app on the Ansca Corona framework is ~300K.</p>

							<p>Yeah I saw that they are working on this for 1.5:</p>

<p>I&#39;m going back and forth between Corona and Titanium.  I like them both for different reasons: Corona better for gaming; Titanium&#39;s support for the open source scrolling DatePicker for Android is a huge plus for productivity apps)</p>

										<p><p>I agree that both are good for different reasons.  I think it&#39;s a good market differentiation that Ansca started leaning towards game development with their Corona Game Edition. Titanium has much more native UI integration than Corona, and thus makes a better fit for productivity and enterprise apps.</p>

										<p><p>Errr.. I just recompiled with 1.5RC2 - and it&#39;s still 3MB. Are we still shooting to improve this in 1.5 Release?</p>
