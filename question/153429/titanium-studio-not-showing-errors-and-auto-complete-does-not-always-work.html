			<h1>Titanium Studio not showing errors and auto complete does not always work</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have just attempted to start creating projects in Titanium studio. I have had bad experiences with eclipse in the past and I am now trying to use it again to create a very simple application. The problem is the IDE is refusing to display any form of errors or the &quot;Red crosses&quot; next to the lines in which the error is present. I have spent hours trying to fix it in the settings and restarting the studio several times but it simply wont display out errors. </p>
<p>Previously, it was not using its content assist to auto-complete my code but after completely remaking the project it appears to be working now. Why are there so many frustrating bugs before I even start to develop on it? Please help me fix them. Thank you.</p>
