			<p>Hi ! In Application I have a lot of scrollViews in which are images. User can change zoom of image by pinch gesture. What I need is set default zoom ( 1.0 ) after double tap on view. Problem is listener…</p>
<hr>
<p>scrollView.addEventListener(&#39;doubletap&#39;, function(e){<br>        e.source.setZoomScale(1, {animated:true}); &#x2F;&#x2F; NO<br>                e.source.zoomScale = 1; &#x2F;&#x2F; NO<br>                e.setZoomScale(1, {animated:true}); &#x2F;&#x2F; NO<br>                e.zoomScale = 1; &#x2F;&#x2F; NO</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The zoomScale is a factor value so it is the different between the parent and the child.</p>
<p>So if you have a child view (or image) that has a width or 640x640 and the parent view is 320x320 then the initial zoomFactor would be 0.5 to show the whole image scaled to fit and 1.0 to show the image at the correct size where you would only see a quarter of the whole image.</p>
<p>If the parent view is 320x320 and your have three child views; 320x320, 640x640 and 960x960 then the zoomFactors (or at least scaled initial ones) would be; 1.0, 0.5, 0.3333.</p>
<p>If you have aspect ratios that differ between the parent and the child then you can choose to scale down to the greater or the lesser difference, so you either have empty bars either side (top&#x2F;bottom or left&#x2F;right) or have overlapping clips.</p>
<p>So choose the dimensions you want to scale to suit your needs.</p>

										<p><p>Just to confirm; a factor of 1.0 is NOT 100% if you are after the view to be fit to zoom.</p>
<p>This is the right syntax.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">scrollView</span><span class="hljs-class">.addEventListener</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'doubletap'</span>, <span class="hljs-function">function</span>(e) {
    <span class="hljs-tag">e</span><span class="hljs-class">.source</span><span class="hljs-class">.setZoomScale</span>(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, {<span class="hljs-attribute">animated</span>: true}); 
});
</code></pre><p>Make sure the factor you are setting is between the min and max you also set.</p>

										<p><p>Quick tip; (in case the code snippet above was not just a mistake);</p>
<p>When you add code snippets always add 3 <strong>~</strong> on a blank line above your code and another 3 <strong>~</strong> below you code on another blank line - you will see the difference when you preview the comment. (you are not being told off)</p>
