			<h1>Is It possible to animate a view inside a ListItem?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m using a ListView Object that&#39;s fed with some data. In the template for that ListView, one of the views is an indicator that the value changed. Whenever I change an Item in the ListView, i set this view&#39;s opacity to show the person which Items were modified in the List.</p>
<p>What I would like to do is that this View had a Fade Out animation, so It would result in a Blink visual for the view in the list item. </p>
<p>I tried tying a postlayout event for that view in the template so I could execute an animation on the e.source(the view that had the opacity changed), but that doesn&#39;t work. Seems like that eventing a child view to postlayout on the ItemTemplate for the ListView does not work. The event does not Fire when I change the Item to have the view&#39;s opacity set to 1.</p>
<p>I Also tried to access the views through getItemAt(), but this function gives U access to the dictionary of the Item&#39;s properties for the applied template, not the views inside It.</p>
<p>Anyone can imagine a solution to this?</p>

							<p>Hey Leonardo,</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t think this was possible until I started playing around with it and discovered how to get something relatively straightforward to work. As a bonus, it doesn&#39;t even involve convoluted event binding and triggering.</p>
<p>You have to set up a bindId for the element you wish to animate, then simply set the &#39;animation&#39; property of that bound element to a Titanium.UI.Animation object &#x2F; dictionary.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a template defined in an XML file:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">Alloy</span>&gt;</span>
  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">ItemTemplate</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">name</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"myTemplate"</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">View</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">id</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"listItemContainerView"</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">onClick</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"animateMe"</span>&gt;</span>
      <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">View</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">bindId</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"viewToAnimate"</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">backgroundColor</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"#F00"</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">width</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"26"</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">height</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"26"</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">borderRadius</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"13"</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">bubbleParent</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"true"</span> /&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">View</span>&gt;</span>
  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">ItemTemplate</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">Alloy</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>You would do something like:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">animateMe</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{
  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> item = e.section.getItemAt(e.itemIndex);
  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> identity = Ti.UI.create2DMatrix();
  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> expandingFade = Ti.UI.createAnimation({
       transform: identity.scale(<span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>),
       duration : <span class="hljs-number">250</span>,
       curve: Titanium.UI.ANIMATION_CURVE_EASE_IN_OUT,
       opacity: <span class="hljs-number">0</span>,
       autoreverse: <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
  });

  <span class="hljs-comment">// Applies the animation to the Ti.UI.View even though it's not documented as a property that you may assign</span>
  item.viewToAnimate.animation = expandingFade;
}
</code></pre><p>This produces the inner circle to expand and fade out, then fade in and shrink to it&#39;s original size when completed. I&#39;m sure you can adapt this to your specific situation!</p>
<p>By the way, I don&#39;t believe the &#39;listItemContainerView&#39; element isn&#39;t necessary, but I&#39;ve never had much luck operating on <code>ItemTemplate</code> objects directly as you noted, so I usually just encase a lot of my inner layout stuff inside of a container view and work on that.</p>

										<p><p>So, I&#39;m going to add a reply to my answer… It seems like manually setting the &#39;animation&#39; property of the view isn&#39;t a good idea. I end up with the warning:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[WARN] :   New layout <span class="hljs-built_in">set</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> view [object TiUIView] animating: Will relayout after animation.

[WARN] :   Ti.View.animate() (view &lt;TiUIView: <span class="hljs-number">0x7a175600</span>; frame = (<span class="hljs-number">134</span> <span class="hljs-number">71</span>; <span class="hljs-number">52</span> <span class="hljs-number">52</span>); transform = [<span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>]; clipsToBounds = YES; alpha = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; autoresize = LM+RM+TM; layer = &lt;CALayer: <span class="hljs-number">0x7a175700</span>&gt;&gt;) could not make animation from: (null)
</code></pre><p>My animation causes the view to disappear entirely, and spit out that error every time a I recreate items for the list. I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s the row items being recycled and trying to animate again when they&#39;re created.</p>
<p>This happens only when multiple elements are in the list, which is why I didn&#39;t catch it before. So as of now there doesn&#39;t seem to be a way to do this correctly.</p>

										<p><p>Did you find a solution to this as having the same issue. When updating a listitem model my animation seem to randomly apply itself to 1 or 2 other rows.</p>
<p>Using a TableView is not an option for me, as I get much better performance from a listview.</p>

										<p><p>No - I never found a reliable solution for this; so we had to change the scope of what we wanted to do instead of trying to fight Appcelerator.</p>
<p>The reason why your animation is being applied to other rows is because ListItems are pooled and recycled. The ListView is taking your ListItem object from an available set, and applying the animation to a row that has been recycled into the pool and reused for another row. You can test this out if you&#39;ve stored that ListItem in a variable, and call .animate() on it, you&#39;re going to occasionally see an animation applied to the wrong row of the ListView.</p>
<p>The accepted way to retain state on a ListItem is to update the properties object with data you need (and then any items that have a bindId that match are subsequently updated. No idea how to properly get things animated - though, thats why I switched to a TableView (and that its self has issues).</p>

							<p>You&#39;re probably not going to like this answer, but the solution to my problems was to just use a TableView. YMMV, though. I was able to add my view controller to the table view row I created and directly access view elements using their IDs this way.</p>
<p>ListViews are great for performance, but bad for anything more than basic.</p>

							<p>Actually the concept behind list view is, its data driven and tableview is view driven.</p>
<p>Generally when you don&#39;t want to play with views inside your row, select list view approach else go with table view. Your requirement is itself suggesting to use table view instead of list view.</p>
<p>Hope this put light on List View and Table View concept and best use case of each one.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
