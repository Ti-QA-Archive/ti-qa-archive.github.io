			<h1>HTML for future native iPhone apps</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I have a background in web programming which I haven&#39;t used for some years, but I am now considering making an iPhone app. I saw this interesting alternative to create apps, and since I already know web programming it would be a smooth transition for me. However, there seem to be some disadvantages with these kinds of apps. Can&#39;t just Apple forbid all other ways of making apps other than the native iOS programming language, and then all of a sudden this knowledge is worthless when it comes to making &quot;native&quot; apps? It would be interesting to hear your opinion on this matter. Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>Viktor</p>

							<p>Viktor, there is no way to do a promise related to any technology you want to use to develop apps when is about Apple. They can do this even with objC, is their company, their product, and they do take this kind of (stupid) decisions sometimes.</p>
<p>The way Titanium does the apps is approved by Apple because Ti is respecting exactly the guidelines and rules imposed by this so it should be no issue in the future.</p>
<p>Related to your web knowledge, you must understand that Ti is not using HTML or JS or CSS to make the app. The code you write in javascript is split in 2 parts - the UI is converted in native components and the &quot;background&quot; part is executed using the javascript core that exists on the os.<br>The difference between Ti and Phonegap is that you get a native app (UI, sql, hardware access, etc) that is driven by a javascript logic. Phonegap is a webview to wich are exposed some hardware functions.<br>For Ti a button means a real objC button while for Phonegap it means some html styled element.</p>
<p>So from all your prior web knowledge the only thing that will help it will be JS (and by this I mean pure JS and not jQuery or whatever other framework).</p>
<p>The transition is not easy, you need to really understand how the way the mobile apps works which is different from a web page (is more close to the way a desktop app works) but I can tell you that it worth every single sleepless night or hardtime you might have (I&#39;ve been there myself, a former web dev converted in a fulltime mobile developer) :)</p>

							<p>I think you should to take a look at the documentation, the sample code and read the wiki to determine if you have the appropriate skills to utilize this framework.</p>
<p>Being a web developer makes you a web developer and not necessarily a mobile application developer. If you want to leverage the HTML experience to develop mobile apps the use phoneGap. If you want to take it to the next level, learn JAVASCRIPT and then try to build an app using Appcelerator… but like Dan said above, it is completely different than building a web page… it is not right, it is not wrong, it just is and you need to decided if it is the right framework for you.</p>
