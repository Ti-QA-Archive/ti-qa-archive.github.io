		<section>
			<p>Hi. I&#39;ve been developing and testing on my iOS simulator while I&#39;ve been waiting for my company apple dev to come through, which it did today. I need to get my app onto some devices for testing asap but I&#39;ve run into a problem packaging and running on my iPhone.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve got a build error, something about a storage class. Please see below.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[INFO] Performing clean build

</code></pre><p>I&#39;m targeting iOS 4.3 and Titanium 1.7 but I&#39;ve tried different combos of SDK versions with no luck. Any help would be greatly appreciated. The client&#39;s sick of seeing screen captures of things in the simulator, really need to get a working app packaged.</p>
<p>Thanks  in advance.</p>

<p>I was having the same issues last night (same error on build, even same line of code in the .py files)</p>
<p>What took hours to find in the end was that I had mucked up my provisioning profiles. In the Apple Dev center, it showed my profile as having a generated code before my ID, e.g: ZKSJNFVSKRBG.com.appname.app.</p>
<p>I then used that ID in Titanium (because that&#39;s what Apple Dev Center claimed it was). I decided to change it back to what I originally entered i.e. com.appname.app, then:</p>
<ul>
<li>deleted build&#x2F;iphone folder</li>
<li>clean project</li>
<li>rebuild to iOS Device</li>
</ul>
<p>And suddenly it worked perfectly…</p>

										<p><p>That sounds promising! Let me get this straight - you set the app id in titanium to the same as in the apple provisioning portal&#39;s id. Then it worked? Or did you change the app id and then changed it back and it worked?</p>
<p>Either way I&#39;ll have a play in a mo once I&#39;ve updated xcode. Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>So basically, when I &quot;chose&quot; my apple ID i entered<br>com.appname.app</p>
<p>But then in the portal it adds an auto-generated serial before it (e.g. ZCNOI43556D.com.appname.app</p>
<p>Naturally, this is the one I put into Titanium. So i decided to change it back to my original entry i.e. com.appname.app</p>
<p>I also re-downloaded the provisioning file, deleted the one in Titanium and replaced it. Worked well.</p>

										<p><p>Agree - Let me know how you go. I&#39;d be interested to see if it was the same issue. In addition, It also wouldn&#39;t build when I had 2 identical certificates in key chain.</p>
<p>It seems to deploy to a device all the APPLE DEV stuff needs to be 100% spot on, which I failed to see until I went through the error log with a fine tooth comb.</p>

										<p><p>The nightmare continues…</p>
<p>I&#39;ve followed all the above advice. I created a new dev certificate (following the certificate assistant process in keychain). When I downloaded and double clicked the new certificate from apple, for some bizarre reason this resulted in two identical certificates in my keychain. So following @Peter V.&#39;s advice I deleted one. </p>
<p>Then I created a new provisioning profile with the new cert and downloaded that. Still no luck. So to follow Peter&#39;s process exactly I changed my app id in Titanium to include the code generated by apple and tried that - no luck. Then changed my app id back - no luck.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, in between each step I&#39;ve been cleaning the project down.</p>
<p>My only option now is to completely rebuild my app one file at a time, building after each step. Which is time I can&#39;t really afford to waste. Aaaah! </p>
<p>I&#39;ve put my console output into a <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;1037843">gist if anyone&#39;s willing to take a look</a>. I think it&#39;s entirely possible that there&#39;s a problem with my Apple set up, but if the console output says anything about it I can&#39;t spot it. It&#39;d be great to have a more helpful error log at this point.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Steve. I&#39;ve tried that and no joy I&#39;m afraid. I&#39;ve just tried creating and packaging a new project and that worked fine. So I&#39;m going to try and create a fresh project and move my source back in in stages.</p>

<p>Hi all. I think there are several things conspiring to screw me. One of which is xcode. Each time i import a new provisioning profile I end up with a duplicate developer cert in my keychain. Which is annoying but easily dealt with.</p>
<p>That doesn&#39;t seem to be the whole story though. I&#39;ll keep digging and keep you posted.</p>

<p>Well finally identified the problem, and it&#39;s not where I expected it to be. I was packaging some web content as part of the app. The web content had it&#39;s own js library which included modernizer.js. Now modernizer wasn&#39;t actually called in any page or script so I never expected it to cause a problem. But obviously Titanium must evaluate every file in some way during build and modernizer was doing things it didn&#39;t like. I deleted it from the folder and everything&#39;s working great.</p>
<p>Phew!</p>
<p>Is this a gotcha worth posting somewhere? I know the goal of Titanium is to do more than just package web content but we&#39;re converting our web stuff to native in a phased plan, which I&#39;m guessing is quite a common development path. Worth identifying where web js can interfere with the titanium project build.</p>
