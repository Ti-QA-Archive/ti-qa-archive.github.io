										<p><p>I&#39;ve had a couple of questions unanswered, but for the most part, I&#39;ve been pleased with the community support.  Paul has been very supportive and insightful (shall I say patient also?)</p>
<p>But, it does bring up a question on &quot;how&quot; to re-submit a question that has NOT been answered, in such a way that it doesn&#39;t become a pest. A lot of forums have a policy that if you &quot;answer&quot; or &quot;comment&quot; on the post, it jumps back toward the top of the list.  I have had a post regarding exit errors in Titanium Developer after you click the &quot;STOP&quot; button, but it&#39;s never been addressed.</p>
<p>But it would be nice to be able to occasionally nudge the community that a question hasn&#39;t been answered.  I don&#39;t really know how to do that except ask it again in a new post.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Korky, thanks for the compliment! To nudge a post, you just post a comment under your question. Try it with your unanswered question, and I will take another look.</p>

										<p><p>Shane, while I respect your right to vote an answer down, I don&#39;t get it.  Staffing has absolutely nothing to do with this forum, and that is all I was trying to point out.  Where&#39;s the beef?</p>
