			<h1>Is Alloy a good choice for my 2-page map based application?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>I&#39;m very new to Titanium and Alloy framework, recently I&#39;m working on developing a mobile version (Android and iOS) of my web based application.</p>
<p>For you reference, the web version demo is: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dishesmap.com</p>
<p>The mobile version should be very similar with web version: just two pages, one is for map and another one is for specific place details. Once you click some icon on map page, it will flip to a restaurant detailed information page.</p>
<p>Now, my questions is: is Alloy framework the best choice for this project? Or I should stick to Titanium APIs? </p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Dong</p>

							<p>As I&#39;m the project and engineering lead on Alloy and obviously incredibly biased, I&#39;ll keep it brief and allow other developers to weigh in. This 2 screen app seems like a perfect fit for a simple Alloy app. Beyond that, what is even more compelling about Alloy is that if you choose to extend or modify your app, Alloy makes it easier. Whenever you decide to add more views, platform or form factor specific functionality, color and asset themes, etc… Alloy will make it brain dead simple. </p>
<p>Plus I&#39;m neurotic when it comes to Q&amp;A and answer almost every Alloy question in here. :)</p>

										<p><p>I agree with Tony here, I just did a 2 screen app using Alloy and it&#39;s wonderful (even just for learning purposes it&#39;s a good thing) Now the app after literally 2 days is complete and cross platform</p>

							<p>Hi Dong Wang,</p>
<p>It&#39;s best choice to stay update in technology. Latest technology have lot more functionality and it is useful for us but there is an choice always consume a time and cost so its better when you have write choice and write technology in your hand.</p>
<p>As per my knowledge and experience, there is nothing wrong to choose Alloy for two screen project, It has more extra functionality added in its SDK. Alloy is more effective for big project but it is not bad for small projects also.</p>
<p>I have developed same application in Alloy that you are thinking to develop and Its running awesome.</p>
<p>After all the choice is yours. Best of luck.</p>

							<p>Thank you guys! All your answers are very helpful. After playing with some sample projects, I think Alloy is the choice for my 2-screen project. Those Alloy sample projects in GitHub are perfect templates based on which I can build my app.</p>
