			<h1>Should test iAd always display?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Trying to figure out why my app that is live in the Apple store doesn&#39;t consistently display ads. I thought it was maybe only cause Apple doesn&#39;t always have ads for my type of app.</p>
<p>However, when running the developer version in iOS and on my device, sometimes the ad displays, sometimes it doesn&#39;t.</p>
<p>Should the Test Advertisement message from iAds display consistently, or does it not load all the time like a normal ad might?</p>
<p>If it is loading improperly, I can&#39;t figure out why - as I don&#39;t see any messages in Titanium. This is under Xcode 3.2.5 in Titanium 1.4.2 on the 4.2 SDK</p>

							<p>Apple asks that if the ad does not exists then nothing should be displayed ( no empty space ) so maybe this is the way they allow you to test it :)<br>For me it worked as the load event does not trigger if the ad does not exists.</p>

							<p>I think this is intentional from Apple so you can test the behaviour when you have a blank iAd frame.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m running into this with the dev environment as well, but I believe the author posted that his live app is not always showing ads.</p>
<p>Is this a problem with Apple, Titanium, or just the way it works?</p>
<p>That is, shouldn&#39;t iAd constantly be showing ads when it is live?</p>

							<p>Same issue here. Sometimes the test iAd shows up and sometimes it doesnt. When it doesn&#39;t it never shows up. Meaning that i&#39;d need to force quit the app to get it to show up. Definitely not normal behavior. </p>
<p>also if the test iAd does show up. it sometimes fades away and isn&#39;t replaced with another test iAd. i&#39;d also need to force quit and reload the app to sometimes get it to appear. I&#39;d think that giving a tab focus or switching tabs would cause that ad to appear again. but no luck.</p>
<p> Anyone have a similar issue and have a solution?</p>
