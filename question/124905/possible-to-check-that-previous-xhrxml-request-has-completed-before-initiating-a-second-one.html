			<h1>Possible to check that previous XHR/XML request has completed before initiating a second one?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have an XML based drill down menu that keeps crashing.</p>
<p>I think this has to do with sequentially XHR&#x2F;XML requests overrunning each other causing crashes.  </p>
<p>I was wondering if anyone know a good technique to check to see if a previous XHR request has completed before a second one initiates?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I&#39;m an absolute beginner, but have you considered setting up a variable (e.g. xhrCompleted) and setting it to zero on entry, and then setting it to one after an .onload or .onerror event? Of course you would check the xhrComplete for one before going on to your next xhr request. Also, you&#39;ll want to set up the variable to equal one prior to making your very first request.</p>

							<div><p>What I have is a tableview drill down menu that is based on XML data retrieved from a custom API.  If i drill down on the menu too quickly, the app constantly crashes.  </p>
<p>If I drill down slowly, the app does fine.  So I believe the crashes are happening because the app is trying to initiate a new XHR request for a new set of menu items before an old one has completed.</p>

							<p>It has been fairly well established that Titanium operates best with only a single httpclient active at a time.  So it is quite likely your hypothesis is correct.</p>
<p>In terms of a technique to make sure only one operates at a time, my suggestion is creating an array of the files to be downloaded.  The array would operate as a download queue.</p>
<p>In the onload (or onerror) event when a download completes, pop the first element off the array and see if another exists.  If so, start a download for it.  Eventually the array will be empty and the downloads will cease, at which time you can fire a custom event if your app needs notification all downloads are complete.</p>
<p>You can push files onto the download queue array at any time while the downloads are in progress they will just get queued.  Only if the array becomes empty would you need to restart the download queue.</p>

							<p>I suspect that when you navigate the menu too fast the callback to the xhr instance is referring to objects (menu items?) which no longer exists which might cause the crashing.</p>
<p>What you can do is call abort() on the previous XHR instance before starting a new one.</p>
