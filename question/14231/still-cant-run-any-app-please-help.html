			<h1>Still can&#39;t run *ANY* app... Please help...</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Having been pulling my hair out for a few days now I am very close to giving up, and assuming that the only chance of any support is when you pay for it… Which is totally fair enough I guess…</p>
<p>My setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mac OS 10.6.3</li>
<li>Java v1.6 (attempted in 64 and 32-bit mode)</li>
<li>xCode &#x2F; iPhone SDK v2.6</li>
<li>Titanium Developer v1.2.1</li>
<li>KitchenSink v1.2</li>
</ul>
<p>All installed (numerous times after clean removal) and all &#39;looking&#39; like it should work fine - i.e. The iPhone and Android SKD&#39;s are found fine and the install always looks correct… Until I try and run KitchenSink (or even an entirely empty new app for that matter)</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pastie.org&#x2F;909793">debug output in pastie</a></p>
<p>Loads of errors in the javascript and an entirely black-screened iPhone simulator.</p>
<p>(I have tried this with the iPhone version set to 3.1, 3.1.2, 3.1.3 and 3.2… all with the same outcome)</p>
<p>I have scoured these Q&amp;A&#39;s over the last few days and have so far had no joy at all.</p>
<p><em>ANY</em> help would be massively appreciated, as this looks like it would be a great tool - just never seen it work yet.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Hugh</p>

							<p>This may solve your problem (but no promises!)</p>
<p>Solution: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.appcelerator.net&#x2F;discussions&#x2F;support&#x2F;2260-new-project-doesnt-run-on-iphone-simulator-application-exits</p>
<p>&quot;I was able to resolve this, by opening xCode and changing in preferences under &#39;Building&#39; the option for &#39;Place Build Products in:&#39; back to &#39;Project directory&#39; I had originally changed this back when I was using xCode for development along with SVN, so my build wouldn&#39;t be put into my SVN repository..&quot;</p>

							<p>HURRAH!!!!!</p>
<p>Mark, you are my hero (and have made my night)</p>
<p>I too had changed my build directory for the same reason, and sure enough - the change back to &#39;Project Directory&#39; has made the app spring into life!</p>
<p>(still loads of javascript warnings though - but hey)</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Hugh</p>
<p>ps. The support link you used doesn&#39;t work… how did you get into the discussion forum? (at http:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.appcelerator.net… I would have searched in there too had I known about it)</p>
