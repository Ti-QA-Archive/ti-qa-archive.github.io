			<h1>Photo is always saved to gallery even with saveToPhotoGallery:false</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>The following code makes the photo taken appear 3 times!! in the gallery. One in the camera folder and two other in two folders called as my app. I only want to save the photo once in my application directory.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve read lots of posts about this issue and never found a solution. I&#39;ve changed all showcamera method parameters.<br>I&#39;ve installed the kitchensink example and theres only a Basic Camera option to review which has saveToPhotoGallery: true. People talk about other camera examples in the kitchensink app, but there is none in what i&#39;ve installed. Maybe i&#39;ve got an old version.</p>
<p>I&#39;m installing the app in android and have latest sdk.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Titanium.Media.showCamera({
         allowEditing:<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>,
        saveToPhotoGallery:<span class="hljs-literal">false</span>,
        mediaTypes:Ti.Media.MEDIA_TYPE_PHOTO,
        success:<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">event</span>)
        </span>{
            <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> captimage = event.media;

            image.image = captimage;

               <span class="hljs-comment">//Save the image and the path</span>
               <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> date= <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">Date</span>();
               <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> f = Titanium.Filesystem.getFile(Titanium.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory,<span class="hljs-string">'savedImage'</span>+date.getTime().toString()+<span class="hljs-string">'.jpg'</span>);
            f.write(captimage);
        },

        })

							<div><p>I&#39;ve tested it now and the Kitchensink basic camera example does exactly the same when installed in android. One photo in the Camera folder and the same photo twice in two folders called KitchenSink…  (saveToPhotoGallery: false).<br>Is this a bug? Can anybody confirm it?</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;m starting to find out the nature of the problem and it&#39;s kind of weird.<br>I think it&#39;s something related to the fact that i&#39;m using a spanish version of android.<br>If i set saveToPhotoGallery:false the described problem above happens. But if i set saveToPhotoGallery:true then there are no folders named like my app in my gallery but the photo taken appears in the &quot;Camera&quot; folder (english) and twice in the &quot;Cámara&quot; folder (spanish). It appears twice because the &quot;Cámara&quot; folder is the one that shows all the photos in the mobile so it shows the photo taken and the photo stored by my app in the &quot;Camera&quot; folder.<br>Any idea about how to fix this?</p>

							<p>Couple of things.</p>
<p>On android, the PhotoGallery, by default, scans the system and displays all images that it finds.  This includes temporary locations on the SDCARD. To prevent this, if this is a directory that you have created or have control over, you can add a .nomedia file to the directory.</p>
