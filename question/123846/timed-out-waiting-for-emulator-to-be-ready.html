		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am trying to get my first application running in Android with Titanium Studio. I am using Windows 7. When I attempt to run my &quot;Hello World&quot;, I get the following:</p>
<p><code>[INFO] logfile = C:\Users\username\My Documents\Titanium Studio Workspace\Test1\build.log
[DEBUG] C:\ProgramData\Titanium\mobilesdk\win32\1.7.2\android\builder.py simulator Test1 C:\Program Files (x86)\Android\android-sdk C:\Users\username\My Documents\Titanium Studio Workspace\Test1 com.companyname.test1 7 HVGA

[ERROR] Timed out waiting for emulator to be ready, you may need to close the emulator and try again</code></p>
<p>What am I doing wrong? This has been driving me nuts. Surely others have gotten an Android app running with Titaniumon Windows 7. Any help is greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

							<p>run the android.exe form inside the android-sdk&#x2F;platform-tools directory to make sure that the sdk tools can run.</p>
<p>When it launches, choose the titanium_7_hvga VDM if it exists to make sure it actually will launch for you.  If it does, then try to build to the emulator.</p>
<p>Steve is right, the emulator is flakey.  More so on windows than osx, but still flakey.</p>

										<p><p>I have to do this frequently.  If Ti times out waiting for emulator to be ready, then just launch the VDM.  Once it is ready launch your app.</p>

										<p><p>Where is android.exe located? I looked in android-sdk&#x2F;platform-tools and it wasn&#39;t there. However, I have all of the other executables, like adb.exe.</p>
<p>When I attempt to launch the titanium_7_hvga VDM from the &quot;Android SDK and AVD Manager&quot; the emulator appears like it tries to start. The &quot;Starting Android Emulator&quot; dialog appears and says &quot;Starting emulator for AVD &#39;titanium_7_HVGA&#39;. The text below the progress bar says:</p>
<p><code>invalid command-line parameter: Files.
Hint: use &amp;#39;@foo&amp;#39; to launch a virtual device named &amp;#39;foo&amp;#39;.
please use -help for more information</code></p>
<p>The dialog also has a button that says &quot;close&quot;. I have let it sit there for 10 minutes and nothing happens. What am I doing wrong?</p>

										<p><p>You didnt install the android bit correctly then.  It should launch a window and bring up the emulator (albeit slowly)..</p>

										<p><p>I figured it out. Oddly, it only worked when I installed the sdk bits in a path that did NOT include a space. In other words, the default C:\Program Files... does not work. Once I installed the sdk bits to C:\android, everything worked. Thank you for your help.</p>

							<p>Had it actually launched the emulator?  Sometimes it gets stuck and you have to kill it off and try again a few times.  The android emulator is a bit flaky</p>

										<p><p>No. It did not launch the emulator. I killed it off and tried three or four times. I tried restarting my computer and tried killing it off without any luck. Are there any more ideas? I assume you mean killing it off by killing the process via the task manager. Is there anything else I can try?</p>
