			<h1>Adding a web server for android 2.3 and 4.0 app using appcelerator</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m currently in the production of our final thesis. How could i possibly add a web server to an android app? The android app will just download the data needed from the web server, this is a monitoring system app so it needs data from the web server, another one, I&#39;m wondering if it is better that the data from web server is from a database or .txt file?. the application will not use a login system, so everyone who downloaded the app will see the same information. Hope someone will help me. I&#39;m working in a windows 7 operating system.Thanks in Advance. :D</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I am confused by this question as I am not sure if you understand what a web sever is and as such how you think it will &quot;add a web server&quot;.</p>
<p>A web server is just a server sitting anywhere on the Internet serving web pages and other documents.  You do not add this to an app.</p>
<p>You can have an app download any file or access any URL from that web server.</p>
<p>I think you should expand your question with a scenario that explains fully your example.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your answer… :D That&#39;s exactly what i need to do, to make the app download data from the web server, or syncing an online database with the database in the phone. Can Appcelerator Cloud Service  do this? I&#39;m developing the app in appcelarator installed in a windows OS but the database will be from an ubuntu OS and the data will then be uploaded to a webserver to be downloaded by the android app. Do you have any idea how to do this? thanks :D</p>

										<p><p>This all depends on;</p>
<ul>
<li>the type of data you are storing?</li>
<li>how many records the data will be to start with?</li>
<li>how many records will be added over time?</li>
<li>how many devices running the app will be connecting at the same time?</li>
<li>is the data static - does not change once stored?</li>
<li>is the data dynamic - changed all the time?</li>
<li>is the data limited to text or is there media like videos, images and audio involved?</li>
<li>if you are storing the data on the Unbuntu computer I guess this is locally held and some sort of admin console available to update the data?</li>
</ul>
<p>I have to ask if you are in the &quot;..production of our final thesis…&quot; then should you not be researching how a client&#x2F;server, app&#x2F;web server &amp; api infrastructures and models work before asking others?</p>
<p>What have you learnt so far, what techniques have you tried, where are you with your solution?</p>
