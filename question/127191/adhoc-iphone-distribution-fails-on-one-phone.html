			<h1>Adhoc iphone distribution fails on one phone.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I created an Adhoc version for 3 iPhones and 1 iPad, my Adhoc version works on 2 of the phones and the iPad, but on the third phone it&#39;s impossible to install the Adhoc. I&#39;ve tripple checked the UUDID on all devices and recreated the provisioning profile three times, but it still doesn&#39;t work on the third phone.</p>
<p>I&#39;m going crazy :(</p>
<p>Device 1: iPhone 4 (4.3) WORKS<br>Device 2: iPhone 4 (5) WORKS<br>Device 3: iPhone 4 (5) DOESN&#39;T WORK (This phone had a dev version of iOS5 installed earlier.<br>Device 4: iPad 1 (5) WORKS.</p>

							<p>This is going to be really hard to troubleshoot without access to the device obviously, as this seems like a very specific scenario. The fact that the non-working phone had a dev version of IOS5 on it I&#39;m sure is no coincidence. Have you tried deploying to any other devices? See if this is an issue with this phone alone.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ve tried on another iPhone and iPad and it was a success.</p>
<p>We factory reset the iPhone that had a Development version of iOS5 installed, and it successfully installed the application after that! But if we installed the latest security backup after the factory reset it didn&#39;t work to install the application.</p>
<p>Is this a bug with Appcelerator? Shouldn&#39;t we be able to run applications on development versions of iOS?</p>
<p>We tried appcelerator 1.8SDK and iPhone SDK 4.3 and iPhone SDK 5.</p>

										<p><p>Ah okey, strange though that it still is being recognized as a beta even if we &quot;factory reset&quot; and after that we do a backup from the &quot;security backup&quot;.</p>
