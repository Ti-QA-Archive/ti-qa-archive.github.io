			<h1>Android Debugger</h1>

			<p>So I&#39;m pulling my hair out with the Android side of things at the moment.</p>
<p>It seems that breakpoints beyond those in app.js aren&#39;t being triggered at all, and even when I set one in app.js and step through it doesn&#39;t follow through to the other files - instead the step buttons grey out and the app just runs.</p>
<p>I&#39;m struggling with an error that doesn&#39;t occur when running the app, but pops up with the &#39;stopped unexpectedly&#39; in the debugger when I attempt to transition to another window.</p>
<p>Can&#39;t understand why it works fine when running the app normally in the emulator but doesn&#39;t when I attempt to debug it.</p>
<p>Any help would be very grateful…</p>

							<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve seen the same issues in SDK 1.7.2, but they seem to be resolved in the the current 1.8.0 master build.  I would recommend using the latest SDK build from master:<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;index.html</p>

										<p><p>Hi Alan,</p>
<p>Apologies in the delay getting back to you.  I&#39;m still struggling on this. I have run the Kitchen Sink to make sure that it&#39;s not a general issue, and I can debug properly with that.</p>
<p>Both projects are built using the latest continuous build. So I&#39;m at a loss at the moment, as to what&#39;s the difference between my project and the kitchen sink as I cant even get to a breakpoint on line 1 of app.js on my project but its fine in the Kitchen Sink?!?!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried cleaning the project, restarting the emulator, but nothing seems to help - any further advice would be massively appreciated…</p>
</p>

										<p><p>Alan, thanks for the heads up.  I had a project that would not debug on Android.  I threw the 1.8.<em> up and it suddenly worked.  Of course, have some other issues with 1.8.</em>, but might be worth working around them.</p>
