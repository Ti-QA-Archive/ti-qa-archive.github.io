<p>I can only hope you have better morals than this question looks on the face of it, that you have a bullet proof server setup with more security that Apple had before their details were hacked - that you at least have a SSL in place and you have a whiter than white reason for this sort of data rape.</p>

							<p>Yes, of course. You would first look at the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Contacts-method-getAllPeople">Ti.Contacts.getAllPeople</a> method and then utilise the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Network.HTTPClient">httpClient</a> object to post that data in JSON&#x2F;XML etc to your service.</p>

										<p><p>And then hope your customers do not mind that their personal information has been harvested for unknown reasons to unknown people.</p>
<p>PLEASE make sure you INFORM people what you are doing as it is both polite and in many countries subject to strict rules about information collection, how long you can keep the information and remember ONLY the owners details are subject to the app users acceptance - everything else you captured is not and will likely cause huge fines and being run out of business.</p>
<p>There have been many high profile cases of this sort of data theft (remember only one person gave permission and not all the rest you just harvested) and some have now gone out of business.</p>
<p>It is only a matter of time before Facebook will be brought up on European charges and possibly even the US as well.</p>

										<p><p>Well, you&#39;re walking on <strong>very thin</strong> ice with an idea like that if you ask me.</p>
<ul>
<li>Best case scenario is that you app gets pulled from the App Store the minute someone complains about it to Apple. </li>
<li>Worst case scenario, you get sued for storing personal data on your own servers. (Keep in mind that every country in the world has its own laws about this sort of thing)</li>

										<p><p>Lets lower the hysteria guys. iOS very clearly asks you for access before allowing the App into Contacts. And hey - There&#39;s also something called iCloud that does exactly the same.  Are we now trusting Apple with our data more than anyone else (Recent NSA revelations come to mind….)</p>
<p>Android - different matter though. Security is screwed on Android now until every device gets a firmware update due to the recently discovered signing&#x2F;dup filename glitch.  </p>
<p>Dont get me started on GSM devices that can be now pwned with a single sms.</p>

										<p><p>@Nick - it is not hysterical to be concerned that someone is hiving EVERYones contact details and passing them to a web server - especially as only one persons permission is every sought which everybody else&#39;s permission is ignored.</p>
<p>This particular person is building an app to edit contacts - an app already exists for that, it is called contacts - the same app that is providing the contacts.  Plus there is no need to transfer all the details to another location in order to achieve this.</p>
<p>Is there any provision for security, is there an ssl, are there controls to restrict access, is it on a dedicated server with no external access except this?  Unlikely on all counts.</p>
<p>Nick if you are happy to have your details transfer away for unknown reasons and no knowledge or rights to reject that is fine.  The vast majority of people would not - and there is a huge difference between iOS asking the user if the contact details can be accessed to having all those details transferred.</p>
<p>I think you know enough about me Nick to understand I am a balanced person - this is based on that balance - this sort of ill-considered misuse of data is bad for all concerned, including the question author - I just hope they are not in the EU, UK or the US (shortly).</p>

										<p><p>@Malcolm - Recent revelations show your data is no more safe with Apple than anyone else. That was the point I was making. Code can be created for good or evil. That decision is with the coder. If something is possible then someone is going to do it….</p>
