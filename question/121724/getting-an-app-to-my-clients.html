			<h1>Getting an app to my clients</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve built an app specifically for my clients. I don&#39;t really need it to be on the app store (It is going to be free anyway). What would be ideal is if I could host the IPA file on my server, my client downloads the IPA file, plugs their iphone in and drags the IPA to their iTunes and it installs it. I attempted that with another phone and was prompted with something like &quot;cannot install because this device is not signed&quot; or something like that. I used the IPA file that was generated through the &#39;run on emulator&#39; tab.</p>
<p>What are my options? I want to avoid using the enterprise app store too if at all possible.</p>

										<p><p>It is not quite the ONLY way.  For the sake of the archives, I will point out there is also the Apple Enterprise Certificate approach.  It is similar to an ad-hoc distribution profile except that you have unlimited installs and no need to include UDID signatures.  You still have a *.ipa which can be installed directly outside the app store.</p>
<p>The caveat is that you need to qualify for the program.  It is designed for internal distribution of apps within an enterprise.  To apply for the program, you still need a D&amp;B number but you no longer need to have at least 500 employees in the company.</p>
<p>For the purposes of the original poster, this will not qualify as a viable approach since it is does not appear to be distribution within an enterprise.  Just wanted to point out for people doing future searches, that in the right circumstances this is a very valuable alternative.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I use<br>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;testflightapp.com&#x2F;<br>It&#39;s pretty handy to collect uidd and distribute builds through their app .<br>I use them to deploy for Beta testers.</p>

							<p>You have to ask ur client the device udid, add it in apple developer portal as test device, regenerate your provisioning profile to contain all the devices ( yours and his ) and compile the app using this profile.<br>After you have the ipa file, send it to him and the new profile file downloaded from the apple portal.<br>He should drag the profile and then the app on itunes and all should work :)</p>
