			<h1>Publishing an App with Apple</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am almost ready to publish my app but I am wondering if I should publish the app under my account or ask my client to create their own.  This is my first time creating and publishing and I&#39;m not sure what the best practices are legally and professionally.  Any advice?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>David</p>

							<p>As somebody on the other side of the equation (we have had some apps built for us out of house), I would highly recommend that the client manage the apple developer account.</p>
<p>Someday, they may wish to bring the maintenance of the app in house, or they may even need to use another contractor.  If the app wasn&#39;t published under their own account, they would have to move the app into their own account, which is a nasty process (it requires all app users to uninstall the old app and install the app from the new publisher).</p>

										<p><p>Yuck! Thanks, I asked them to set up their own account.  These are all good reasons.  I was only going to do it in mine to save time but it will be better in the long run to be in their account.</p>

							<p>I have a number of accounts with apple for my own means.  Additionally, when we do outside work the client wishes for it to be published under their own name.  For $100 a year, it is a very small additional cost for the client, in my opinion.</p>

							<p>it all depends on whether the client wants the app under their own name or not - but if youve been paid a fee for it i would always suggest to client they create their own dev account as if you leave the dev program and dont renew, their app will be deleted from the store - if they dont renew their account its their problem</p>
