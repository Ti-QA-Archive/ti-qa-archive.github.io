			<h1>Appcelerator and iOS 5.1</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Am I correct in saying that the current version of Titanium Studio (1.0.9.201202141208) does not support iOS 5.1 or Xcode 4.3.1?</p>
<p>I had XCode 4.3.1 running but as Titanium doesn&#39;t support it I was unable to run the iOS simulator. I downloaded the preview version of Titanium Studio, but unfortunately iOS simulator crashes when trying to run in that.</p>
<p>My solution to get everything working on the Mac is to have the latest Stable version of Titanium and Xcode 4.2. That&#39;s great in that everything works fine on the Mac, except I cannot deploy to my iPad 2 (iOS 5.1) in order to test, because of course Xcode 4.3.1 does not support iOS 5.1</p>
<p>This is a nightmare?!</p>
<p>Is there anyway to get my Titanium Studio App on my iPad 2 (iOS 5.1) in order to test?</p>
<p>My last ditch attempt would be to try and rollback my iPad 2 from iOS 5.1 to iOS 5. I think I can do this through iTunes as I have downloaded an iOS 5 disc image from Apple. I am just worried that this might some how kill my iPad?!</p>
<p>Any help anyone can provide would be most helpful!</p>

							<p>You can try loading it adhoc via TestFlightapp.com<br>Will require an adhoc provisioning profile from apple.</p>
<p>You can build your ipa via the archives in Xcode 4.2.x and sharing it</p>
<p>This should bypass the local loader problems.</p>

										<p><p>In Xcode you have the organizer that keeps tracks of profiles, projects, archives.  From the archives, you can select an archive (when you &#39;build for app store&#39; from titanium, the package is found here) and &#39;share&#39; it out as an ipa instead of submitting to the app store.  You can then upload this to test flight.  Now, inevitably someone will hijack this thread and scream &quot;YOU DONT HAVE TO DO THAT GRAB IT FROM THE ITUNES FOLDER&quot; but in your case that IS the problem. <em>grin</em></p>

										<p><p>Amazing!! Thanks Stephen! Took a little bit of back and forth getting the right distribution provisioning files in place, but I got this working great and deployed to my iPad 2 for testing. For anyone else that might be struggling with this, here is a great video tutorial for Titanium and Testflight which helped me out greatly as well… http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=pym-qWpApns</p>

							<p>Well, looks like rolling back to an older version of iOS is not an option.<br>The Xcode User Guide says it can&#39;t be done: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;mac&#x2F;#documentation&#x2F;ToolsLanguages&#x2F;Conceptual&#x2F;Xcode4UserGuide&#x2F;Devices&#x2F;Devices.html</p>
<p>Anyone else having this same issue I described above?!</p>

							<p>Thanks for the advice! I will give this a try.<br>I don&#39;t know what you mean by &#39;build an ipa via the archives&#39; but I will try following the guides on testflightapp.com and see where I get.</p>
<p>Thanks again!<br>Jay</p>
