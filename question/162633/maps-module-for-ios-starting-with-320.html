			<h1>Maps Module for iOS starting with 3.2.0</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I must be missing some important information about this…</p>
<p>The module required to use Apple Maps starting with Titanium 3.2.0 is not linked correctly in the new documents. There is only a link to the Google Maps by Appcelerator in that documentation.</p>
<p>A quick search only shows the Google Maps version in the Marketplace not iOS.</p>
<p>So, correct me if I&#39;m wrong but we need to download and install this module to have native Apple maps in Titanium.</p>
<p>I Googled for the module for iOS, and here it was at (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator-modules&#x2F;ti.map)</p>
<p>So I installed the iOS version which is 2.0.0 and somewhat it got upgraded to 2.0.1 which also does not exist on this Github address???</p>
<p>Another annoyence is the documentation at (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Modules.Map.View) mentiones a longclick which is only valid on Android and the documentation for longpress event is gone bye bye… (even though it still works)</p>
<p>Friends at Appcelerator, this one is for you, please fix this, we developers deserve better than this half baked support for Apple Maps. An apology is pending on your end, I&#39;ve wasted hours on this; as I&#39;m sure other fellow developers did. (if I&#39;m stupid and did miss something big about this subject then I apologize)</p>
<p>Thanks for reading,<br>Tony</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>As long as your current app is set to Ti SDK 3.2 or higher then you can select the iOS maps module by using the Tiapp.xml editor in studio.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open tiapp.xml in studio</li>
<li>Make sure you are in the visual side of the editor</li>
<li>Select the green plus next to the modules list</li>
<li>Choose the Maps module</li>
</ul>
<p>You do not need to download it - it comes with titanium now, but only shows up if your app is set to Ti SDK 3.2 or higher.  This module will come from the grouped modules within Titanium and you do not need to install it locally.</p>
