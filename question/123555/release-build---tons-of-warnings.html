			<h1>Release build - tons of warnings?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>HI, I just finished my application and did a &quot;Release&quot; build in xCode. The compiler gave me tons of warnings but the application seems to work as it should.</p>
<p>Is this a normal behavior and could I send it to Appstore with all the warnings?</p>

							<div><p>Are the warnings like … you shouldn&#39;t have functions within a loop? Or are the warning depreciation warnings?  Can you be more specific.  Warning are not normal behavior for a production app. Your warnings might cause mem leaks especially. Just my 2 cents…</p>

							<p>Yep compiling a titanium app in XCode will give you a whole bunch of warnings, you should be able to ignore these and regardless you will not be able to fix them without checking out titanium-mobile from github and compiling your own SDK which if you are trying to submit I would avoid doing otherwise you may pick up changes that affect your application.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, I checked some of the warnings yesterday and they where related to other stuff then I was using in my code :)</p>
<p>So, when I am gone send my app for approval to appstore? What is the best way to compile? Should I compile with all this warnings in xCoe and send that binary? </p>

										<p><p>You can just use deploy in Titanium Studio and yep ignore all the warnings. I highly doubt anyone else submitting apps built with titanium bothered to modify the source to build without warnings before submitting :)</p>

							<p>Not normal at all. Warning are just that: warnings! so, I suggest you to review each warning and solve it. Maybe lot of them are &#39;;&#39; missing at the end of line and things like that, but my experience is that Titanium works better if you fix that warnings (less builder hangs).</p>
<p>If these warnings are because you are including some kind of library from internet (such as Raphäel or any other javascript lib), you can change the extension of the library files. Rename files to &#39;.lib&#39; instead of &#39;.js&#39; and Javascript interpreter will not verbose warnings from these files.</p>
<p>Of course, you will have to change also your include line to Ti.include(&#39;whatever.lib&#39;) instead of &#39;.js&#39;.</p>

							<p>If I run the app within Titanium and turn on debug mode to &quot;Warning&quot; - I dont get one single warning? It is a very small application and is less then 600 lines of code. I get all the warnings when i compile the project from xcode?</p>
<p>No functions within loops - cant find any missing ;? No included third party scripts?</p>
<p>Any other suggestions? I cant manage to determ what all warnings mean from xCode…looks like garbage for me ;)</p>
