			<h1>Have to double tap to catch event</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am working with android mobile and TS 1.8.1 on an actual device.</p>
<p>I have set up my own navigation panels so that i can track each view that the user has seen. basically it is an array that just stores the view, and the program only uses one window.  so when I want a new view i just push a new view in the stack.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">generalIcon.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>,<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span>{            
    gb.ui.pushWindow(gb.ui.createGeneralInfoListWindow());
});
</code></pre><p>the icon I tap on is a label with a <code>&amp;#39;click&amp;#39;</code> eventListener.<br>this code works, but i have to click on the icon 2 times which causes the app to push 2 views on the stack</p>
<p>if i add in an alert then it works as it should with just one tap.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">generalIcon.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>,<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span>{
    gb.ui.alert(<span class="hljs-string">'pushed'</span>);            
    gb.ui.pushWindow(gb.ui.createGeneralInfoListWindow());
});
</code></pre><p>any thoughts?</p>

										<p><p>no, there are 6 icons, and I just hard coded the 6 icons in with their 6 respective eventListeners - they all behave the same</p>

							<p>Thanks Trevor!  you got me going down the right path so I found it.  The pushWindow() does multiple things other than just add the view, so with some more debugging I found out that the method was actually getting called, but the animations were not running and&#x2F;or the view was not being added.</p>
<p>What works now:<br>I was adding the view as <code>{left:$$.platformWidth, width:$$.platformWidth}</code> but it did not seem to register that the view was part of the window, so it would not animate.  as soon as i changed to <code>left:$$.platformWidth-5</code> it registered with the window and the animations worked.  additional views still work when i set them at <code>$$.platformWidth</code> it is only the first one that had problems.</p>
<p>I am still curious as to why that would be the case only on android (worked fine on iOS).  If anyone knows I&#39;m interested.</p>
