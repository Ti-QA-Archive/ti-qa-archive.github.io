			<h1>DB caching issue</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have two windows, each opens by it&#39;s tabs.<br>Both windows has table views and data is driven by two tables in SQLite Database.<br>Once i go to first window,(default) i need to do some operations and that will effect the data in the window 2.</p>
<p>How ever when i re-open the Window 2, data hasn&#39;t been change because its loaded up with its cache as its in the main app.js file.<br>How ever when i close the app and reopens it, then its all good and i can see its loaded with the correct data.</p>
<p>My question is, how do i get the latest data instead of the cache when i open this windows from tabs?</p>
<p>I tried do do this with Tabbed bar and with some views without using 2 windows. But its too much difficult to do it like that way<br>because the code is too big and messy and I prefer to use 2 separate window.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Rush</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>As you have chosen to not provide any code snippets to allow others to have a fighting chance or being able to review your code for; errors, misunderstandings, bugs, typos or simply what you are doing - if is going to be impossible to answer with out any certainty.</p>
<p>However, from your explanation it would seem that your &quot;db caching issue&quot; is no such thing and simply a misunderstanding of what your app is doing due to how you built it.  Again - no code to to confirm this with.</p>
<p>You say you have tabs and windows, your explanation suggests tab 1 house windows 1 and tab 2 houses window 2.  I would guess that during the app startup you load up data into a table on window 1 inside tab 2 and then you load up data into a table on window 2 inside tab 2.  Your app lets the user add data which should then appear in the second table in window 2 inside tab 2.</p>
<p>But as you have only told the startup routine to load the data and show it in each table - the update&#x2F;add does not tell the app to update&#x2F;append the second table each time.  So when you go to the second window - no data has appears to have been added as the routine to display that data fired only once during startup.</p>
<p>When you exit the app and restart - that single startup function grabs the latest data which does include the new stuff.</p>
<p>So this is NOT a caching issue or database fault - it is how you display the data.</p>
<p>You need to take your current process of updating the second table with data from the database, separate it form the table display and simply get it to update the setData method of the table (or listview).  So display the table only then call the function to get the data and use setData to push it to the table - this is the startup routine.  When you add something that should affect the display of the second table in window 2 in tab 2 - call that refresh function again and it will set the revised data to the table.</p>
<p>You should really use appendRow to get new data in a row at a time - but it looks like for now simply loading all the data back in will be the best move for you until you really understanding the process flow going on here.</p>
