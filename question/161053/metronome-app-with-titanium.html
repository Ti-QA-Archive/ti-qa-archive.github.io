			<h1>Metronome App with Titanium?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I&#39;m looking into developing my first mobile app, which will be a metronome. I have done a few music-related Java applets on a PC using the MIDI Synthesizer in Java and I was wondering if it was possible to something similar using Titanium for mobile devices. Titanium in general looks like it would be a fantastic platform to develop for multiple devices, but after doing a bit of research into developing a metronome app with Titanium I&#39;m worried it may not be possible for me to do.</p>
<p>I looked at the Titanium API and there doesn&#39;t seem to be anything for MIDI there. Searching the forum results in one 2 year old post on MIDI and the response was that it&#39;s not possible with the TI core. I&#39;m kind of surprised that there&#39;s not more interest in MIDI applications.</p>
<p>I also found a post about an audio metronome, but they said JavaScript has &quot;horrible timing&quot;…which is obviously no good for a program helping you to keep good time! :(</p>
<p>There doesn&#39;t seem to be much information available on this topic unfortunately, so before I get to invested in this…I&#39;m just wondering if developing a cross platform metronome app with Titanium is going to be feasibly possible. I know it <em>IS</em> possible if you write code for every device you want to create an app for…but I&#39;m not that knowledgeable of a programmer to be able to do that (I&#39;m a musician before a programmer lol). The appeal of Titanium for me is not having to learn the code and syntax for each device…but if that&#39;s not going to be possible, then I may have to give up on the idea of writing for multiple devices and just focus on an Android app.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Sean</p>

							<p>Hi Sean, Titanium is in general not the right choice for low latency apps. Because your titanium code is executed in realtime in a javascript virtual machine. For example: If you try something like this, there will be 2 source of timedrifting.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> player = Ti.Media.createSound({url:<span class="hljs-string">"sound.wav"</span>});
setInterval(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
    player.play();
), <span class="hljs-number">500</span>);
</code></pre><ol>
<li>setInterval will not fire reliably in 500ms, sometimes it lags several ms.           </li>
<li>also the sound player in titanium has a latency of several hundred ms, before the sound will be played.</li>
</ol>
<p>Indeed it is possible with titanium do a reliable metronome app, but you have write a native module for each platform. In my opinion for audio apps this is much more complicated and time consuming, then developing real native apps. If you do that, nearly 90% of your apps code will be in the module. Only 10% will bei Titanium UI related stuff. </p>
<p>to get started there are several native opensource projects on github, just google for &quot;android metronome github&quot; and &quot;ios metronome github&quot;.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Moritz, thanks for the response. That is kind of what I was expecting, but I was still hoping there was a simpler solution to the problem than massive amounts of coding for each device. In addition to to not having any experience with Objective C, I also don&#39;t have any ios mobile devices to test on so developing for them would be rather difficult for me.</p>
<p>It seems like it would be possible to develop a low level sound player that would be accessible from Titanium…for those who are knowledgeable of programming on the specific device of course.</p>
<p>Just kind of brainstorming and maybe I&#39;m way off base here…but instead of trying to play each sound from Titanium, a loop could be written for the device that would play elements of an array at specific time intervals (IF there is a sound file inside the element) and that loop could be started and stopped from Titanium. It wouldn&#39;t matter how long it takes to &#39;start&#39; the loop from Titanium, the only thing that really matters for a metronome is that the loop keeps in time with itself once it starts (and not drift from beat to beat). You could then modify the contents of the array from within Titanium while it&#39;s going without screwing up the timing since playing each element is controlled by the device and not by Titanium.</p>
<p>Does that seem like something that could work or am I way off base here? I&#39;ve never coded a low latency music player, so there maybe way more to it than that and ensuring accurate timing.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Sean</p>

										<p><p>Hey Sean, i don&#39;t want discourage you, but there is no really a easy way for low level audio for mobile operating systems today. On iOS there are four ways to access audio functionality of a device. All are based on Core Audio.</p>
<ol>
<li>AVFoundation: the slowest way and most high level obj-c api (is used by titanium), </li>
<li>OpenAL: feature reduced low latency audio but high level api, trys to mirror the portability of OpenGL, is mostly used for games, and is quite fast, and easy to use. (There&#39;s a titanium module in the market, which uses this API <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;891?restoreSearch=true#!overview">&quot;Zero Latency Sound&quot;</a></li>
<li>Audio Queues: faster also high level api, compressed formats can be used, but you have to use C not Obj-C. (you can mix C and Obj-C in a Obj-C++ File)</li>
<li>Audio Units: the fastest way, uncompressed format, you can do basically everything you like with audio. It is also a C based api. (There&#39;s a cool project, which implements an Object Oriented Syntax (Obj-C) around this hardcore C stuff <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;theamazingaudioengine.com&#x2F;">The Amazing Audio Engine</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Your idea, modifiying an array in titanium, and your native module does the rest, will not make it easier ;)</p>
<p>On Android: Android lacked a low level Audio Engine until 4.1, the overall latency was above 100ms, which is a shame. Since 4.1 you can achive 10ms, which is really good. I don&#39;t have any experience on Android with this topic, but i think you also have to use c&#x2F;c++(ndk) instead of high level java (sdk). </p>
<p>And if you want to code for iOS, you must have a real device to test on, because the iOS Simulator from Xcode, is not an Emulator, or virtual machine. The code you run on the simulator will be executed much faster then on a real device. If you only test your metronome app in the simulator, it will seem reliable, but on the device it probably will drift, because the cpu is much slower.</p>
<p>While writing this, i thought about a solution, if you really want to avoid writing your own modules, which might works, but i&#39;m not sure. It will also drift a little bit, but it is better than nothing. Try out the combination of two native modules, the &quot;Zero Latency Sound&quot; OpenAL module from the market, and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;benbahrenburg&#x2F;ti.mely">ti.mely</a> from ben bahrenburg, which is a more reliable timer, than the javascript one. If it works it would be a way to do everything in Titanium and don&#39;t get your hands dirty with the low level stuff ;)</p>
