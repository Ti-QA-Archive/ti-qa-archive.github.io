			<p>Hello I would like to work with Titanium Studio and I have already downloaded the platform.<br>As I saw Titanium Studio is free for both Android and iOS.</p>
<p>But I was wondering if Titanium has another version of it that<br>is more enriched and someone has to pay for it.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>Simple answer to your question is Yes. There is the Appcelerator Platform, which is very similar to the free version, but you get more items included.</p>
<p>However the Titanium SDK, which enables you to develop the code is the same for both.</p>
<p>For more info contact sales@appcelerator.com</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for replying, I would like to  render offline maps (with mbtiles) for both Android and iOS native apps, calculate distances and drawing on the screen and I was wondering if the free version supports that. Do you know if these features are included in the free version?</p>

										<p><p>The amount of calls you are allowed to make to the Appcelerator backend ACS system. Basically you get a really good amount of stuff, for API calls, and notifications etc, but the paid for version gives you a lot more.</p>
<p>Most applications will have plenty within the free version.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m sorry but I can&#39;t understand what you mean by saying &quot;The amount of calls you are allowed to make to the Appcelerator backend ACS system&quot;. What are those calls?</p>
<p>1) Contact the support team? or</p>
<p>2) call to the function in the API?</p>
<p>I&#39;m new here and I&#39;m not familiar with some terms, thanks again :)</p>
