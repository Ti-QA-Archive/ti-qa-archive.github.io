		<section>
			<p>I am located in Manhattan, KS and would like to start developing apps using Titanium.  I learn best by not just watching<br>video tutorials and reading manuals but by also talking and discussing with others in person.  Anyone out here in<br>the Q&amp;A boards live in Kansas and would like to get together?  I was told to try this from one of the sales reps at<br>Appcelerator instead of setting up one of the meeting places.  Thanks.  email me at kazar54@hotmail.com</p>

							<p>There used to be a Titanium meetup in Kansas City. Think its defunct now, and would have been too far to drive for you, even for a once a month meeting would wear on you.</p>
<p>Check the map at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;map.tidev.io&#x2F;">map.tidev.io&#x2F;</a> to see who is around you.  Now, its a cheap little util that simply scrapes the DevLink information, so the information includes anyone who signed up, filled out their profile.  Does not mean those folks are active, mind you.</p>

										<p><p>As an aside, I find the suggestion by the appc folks kind of strange. Granted, Meetup would charge you a yearly fee to setup a group, but Appc has backed (financially in the past) Meetup groups before, so, just really weird IMHO.</p>
