			<h1>Certificates Problem</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m trying to get my app testable on my iphone, I have my certificates, profiles, etc.</p>
<p>In Titanium, its telling me to &quot;Obtain the WWDR Intermediate Certificate&quot;, as well as the &quot;Obtain Development Certificate&quot;.</p>
<p>I have them both, but its not being registered or something with Titanium.  </p>
<p>How do I resolve this?  When I click the links, my default browser is firefox, is it trying to check and see if I download them through safari or something? </p>
<p>EDIT</p>
<p>Got them installed.  Now, though, my SDK is gone from the choices to build with.  WTH?</p>

							<p>Well, here&#39;s how I finally got it to build (even though its crashing on the phone now).</p>
<p>1 - Install your certificates<br>2 - In Xcode-&gt;Organizer, load your provisioning profile<br>3 - In Titanium, add that profile<br>4 - Also load the one generated when you load it into Organizer (somewhere in library&#x2F;mobileapplications&#x2F;provisioningprofiles<br>5 - The generated one is the one to use.  This creates the app and loads it into iTunes</p>

							<p>Never got that to work. Didn&#39;t put all that much of an effort in to it though as I thought it  was simpler to install my applications directly thru the XCode project.</p>
<p>Just follow the instructions from Apple under the developer resources. Open the XCode project created by Titanium (under build&#x2F;iphone), select &quot;Device&quot; (top - left dropdown) and &quot;Build and run&quot;.</p>
<p>For some reason I always need to set the drop down twice - first select Simluator and then select Device. Otherwise it always launches the Simulator instead of installing the app to my phone.</p>

										<p><p>That does seem easier.  However, mine doesnt detect my device with the Titanium projects.  The organizer sees it, I have my provisioning profile loaded, and it picks up my other ones, but when I check it in Xcode, there is &quot;check mark&quot; beside it.  If I create a new project, then the option stays, but I cant install then because of code-signing and whatnot.</p>

							<p>Hm, I cant get it to actually see my device.  The Organizer shows it with all of the info, but I can&#39;t select it when it comes time to build it.  A new project DOES, but I dont have any provisioning setup for those.</p>
<p>Does the build make an App file anywhere I could just drag and drop into itunes?  I&#39;ve used Appmakr before and they do a build and give you the actual App file that you add to itunes and then sync. </p>
