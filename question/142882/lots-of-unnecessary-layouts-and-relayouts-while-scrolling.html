			<h1>Lot&#39;s of unnecessary layouts and relayouts while scrolling</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve experienced some choppy tableview scrolling so I looked at the underling objective c code only to discover lot&#39;s of inefficient calls inside tiuiview doing unnecessary layouts and over complex things… does anyone working on optimizing and improving the code ??</p>
<p>I think that speed and performance should be a priority instead of features.</p>

							<div><p>It seems to be especially bad when using complex rows instead of the default leftImage, title, etc. properties. I&#39;m glad to help contribute to a test case – tableview performance essentially destroys the overal performance of my app despite every optimization I could come across. Might be good to start with tableviewlayout 2 in KitchenSink…</p>

							<p>I can actually vouch for the developers, that they have spent a <em>ton</em> of hours improving tableview scrolling.</p>
<p>If you see a way to improve it even more, then I suggest that either:</p>
<ol>
<li>You go ahead and do it, and submit a pull request. This <em>is</em> an open-source project, after all</li>
<li>At least open up a JIRA ticket outlining the exact changes you&#39;d make.</li>
</ol>

							<p>I have the highest respect for the effort of building titanium and love the project, this is the reason I started this conversation. todays apps are highly visual rows can be complex not just a title and image (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunes.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;hopflow&#x2F;id491044397?mt=8">see my app images</a>). making the perceived performance of titanium look bad. </p>
<p>I know it&#39;s an open source project, sadly I have only basic objective-c knowledge and the codebase is becoming complex.</p>
<p>I realized the code is not tuned to performance after I defined every rowview with exact pixel dimensions so not lot&#39;s of layout calculations need to be made by appcelerator. and then I did a simple logging of things happaning while I scroll, for example I saw lot&#39;s (thousands !!) while scrolling to the  relayout method of TiViewProxy.m even nothing changed on the view layout. also lot&#39;s of calls to TiLayoutQueue also most of the redundant. all those things are killing performance.</p>
<p>in order for appcelerator to strive it must have a performance edge on html5 and I think without focus on performance tuning (like 1.7 release focus on memory leaks) it won&#39;t get there. </p>
<p>I did a test on the same complex layout rendered as html and it achieved better scrolling results !!! then appcelerator.</p>

										<p><p>Perhaps you should share your code. I see plenty of apps out there with complex tableviewrows that scroll just fine, including mine.</p>

										<p><p>as &quot;Michael Belkin&quot; just commented above simple trace on &quot;tableviewlayout 2 in KitchenSink&quot; shows the same issues of relayouts and recalculations. </p>
<p>also happening on scrollview, im using 2.0.1 but I think the issue was not addressed on 2.1</p>

										<p><p>Q&amp;A is to help you with your problems. I don&#39;t have time to go and optimize the KS project, nor would it help solve your problem anyway.</p>
<p>This ticket could be interesting to you, though: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-5429">TIMOB-5429</a></p>
