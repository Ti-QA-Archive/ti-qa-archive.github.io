			<h1>Wordpress based app for IOS, Android, Windows Phone.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I have wordpress site. I decided to make app based on wordpress.<br>Site has responsible theme and has notification plugin (for IOS, Android and Windows Phone). So, I do not need to write special functions for app (wordpress do everything).</p>
<p>Is it possible to create simple app-browser (it will only open my website on a full screen)? Where I can get any samples? </p>
<p>And what about app publish? Will I have any problems? I have to buy Apple (100$), Android (25$) and Windows (?$) developer license. Thats all?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>It sounds like you wish to make an app that simply show a website?  If so then you have to be aware of a few things;</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS will very likely reject your app as it breaks at least one of the requirements to publish and app, including; must not simply display a web site and must provide native device functionality beyond simply showing something simple.</li>
<li>Android will let anything in</li>
<li>Windows phone - is not an available option just yet - but will be later this year</li>
<li>I am not sure you users will be that interested in a app that can easily be reproduced on the actual website</li>
<li>Your users will require a constant internet connection to use the app - one of the benefits of the app is to lessen that requirement and make the whole experience much snappier and friendly </li>
<li>You only have to pay the annual fees you stated to publish an app</li>
</ul>
<p>You can create a window that displays a full screen window and only includes a single webView linked to one URL.  That information can be found inside the documentation;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.UI.Window">Window</a></li>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.UI.WebView">webView</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As the code to achieve what you want is a handful of lines and is found on those pages I feel it would be a good idea to learn at least those few lines if your aim is to publish an app yourself.</p>
<p>However I would strongly advice you to think of something more challenging to yourself and better designed for your potential users - if of course the store allow the app in.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>We need this app because of the mobile notifications. We publish lots of information ons we want to notify our mobile users about it.</p>
<p>Ok. What we should do, to publish app to apple store? We have to make big app (lots of code lines), or what? E.g. if we some cache functions to make app(site) faster or make special menu it will be enough?</p>

										<p><p>Ideally you would create an API to list that information and display it in a tableView - update the list each time the app loads and then show a webView when any is selected to show that article.</p>
<p>You should include features such as notification (a good one), have windows spawn new windows (as mentioned above), ideally you should make use of some of the other features - not for the sake of it, but you should try to tick off a few;</p>
<ul>
<li>Camera</li>
<li>Compass</li>
<li>Network (geo)</li>
<li>Network (api)</li>
<li>Map</li>
<li>Push Notifications</li>
<li>Local Notifications</li>
<li>Multiple windows</li>
<li>Manage login details</li>
<li>Store configuration details</li>
</ul>
<p>Again - I am NOT suggesting adding any of these just to pad out the app, but you need to differentiate your app from a simple app that only shows a web page that could so easily have been accessed by a mobile browser.</p>
<p>For example when you are using push notifications you could store the users preferences to what sort of push notifications they wish to be informed of, this would make a great window with a few labels each one with a switch and those choices stored to update the push service.</p>
<p>If your app has some sort of premium access option then you could include an in app purchase option to gain that extra level - I do NOT mean to charge more for each new info, simply a way of saying this information is only available if you have paid the IaP of (example) £2 per app - otherwise you get the standard track of info.  Likely this is not suitable but you get the idea of how features can be used to both increase the app functionality and at the same time show that your app is not a simple web page in disguise.</p>

										<p><p>If you mean pay someone to do the app then good question, depending on the final features and need to learn third-party things (if there are any) could range from £500 (if you get a one man band trying to get into the game basically an amateur) to £20k or more.  Likely somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>But still it is not that big an app to do yourself.  If you have learnt c++ then structurally JavaScript is similar, the language you need to learn is identical to JavaScript (as it is JS) and has additional functions due to the Titanium API.</p>
<p>The best way to start is to pick one thing to learn, start with adding a label and changing properties, then add a button and make it react to your touch.  Add a tableView with some rows and then get each row click to open a window and pass data around from each row.  Keep doing this for a short while and you have the basic parts of any app .  From there it is working what you need to put together and when, fill in the extra things like switches and toolbars if and when you need them.</p>
<p>This is how I started and I now build apps for very large companies.  As with anything it will take some effort - but Titanium is very simple and rather forgiving - plus the feeling of success when your app does something you tell it to and you show a friend - so cool.  You are creating something from nothing.</p>

							<p>I understand. Thank you very much!!!</p>
<p>Bad new for me - I have really to learn titanium platform. Is it more difficult than c++?)<br>If I decided to order developing this app how much can it cost?</p>

										<p><p>Quick tip; next time - please do not create a new answer when your contribution is actually a comment - it confuses things in the future when trying to work out relevance, simply add a comment to the answer it is related to, or if the additional information is a follow up to the question or general information then add it as a comment to your own question at the top.  You are NOT being told off.</p>
