			<h1>How to hide Keyboard</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, I&#39;m new to Titanium and i&#39;m tryin to create a calculator app for my own use. The problem is, that none of the default apple keyboards have the buttons i need, so i&#39;m trying to make a custom keyboard layout with single buttons. My Question is now, how can i hide the keyboard though I focus a textfield (to have this blinking bar which indicates a selected textfield). Its not working with blur cause then the bar disappears&#x2F;field is not selected. How can i block the keyboard while still focusing the active textfield?</p>

							<p><code>TextField.blur();</code> will hide the keyboard.</p>
<p>Example below is an event listener for the DONE button. When the button is clicked, the keyboard disappears.</p>
<p>done.addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;,function(){<br>    nameTxt.blur();<br>});</p>

										<p><p>just because this is bound to trip someone up: in this case <code>TextField.blur();</code> (which works) is not equivalent to <code>TextField.fireEvent(&amp;#39;blur&amp;#39;);</code> (which doesn&#39;t work)</p>
<p>Mind you, it <strong>should</strong> be. It&#39;s <strong>supposed</strong> to be. But in one of those random bugs that you get used to after the first few hours with Titanium, it ain&#39;t.</p>

										<p><p>I just read this comment – it&#39;s old, but I wanted to correct it in case anybody else sees this. <code>TextField.fireEvent(&amp;#39;blur&amp;#39;)</code> is <em>not</em> supposed to be the same as <code>TextField.blur()</code>.</p>
<p>Firing the event will call all the registered event listeners for the blur event.  It doesn&#39;t actually change the focus of the field.</p>
<p>Just like calling <code>TextField.fireEvent(&amp;#39;change&amp;#39;)</code> is not the same as <code>TextField.setValue(&amp;#39;foo&amp;#39;)</code>;</p>

							<p>I need the same:   In particular I need to be able to allow the text in a TextField to be copyable so that it can be pasted elsewhere.   But the text is not to be editable, so the keyboard is not wanted&#x2F;needed.</p>
<p>I think by setting the TextField.editable to false and .enabled to true should tell the keyboard not to pop up and allow other text functions (like copy &#x2F; paste) to function.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Linus,</p>
<p>Your question is very common but no one has the answer. </p>
<p>Why can&#39;t I hide the Keyboard in the iPhone?<br>Your question is simple and easy. Your description of the problem is clear (I&#39;m a spaniard and my english is terrible and I understand it very well).</p>
<p>&quot;Why not have a look in the Kitchen sink for the answer?&quot; I think Cris NEVER executes the Kitchen Sink in iPhone. Why the people answer a question with another question? Because they are trolls.</p>
<p>Sorry, but I&#39;m very tired with the people witch only writes stupidities to a serious questions.</p>
<p>If you finally find the answer, please publish it. I&#39;m looking for it too and I&#39;m working on it.</p>

										<p><p>Man, some people try to help with no answer in mind. This is a question that I&#39;m looking for to, and if I find I will publish. A bit more about kitchen sink, it is full of crap and the documentation is incompleted.</p>

										<p><p>I constructed my app with wrappers for the components in Ti. In my textfield&#x2F;textarea wrapper, I make sure that whoever is using it passes the window instance, that way I can add a click event and blur all the fields that were added to this window. Of course just make sure you add the event once and only for IOS hope this helps</p>
