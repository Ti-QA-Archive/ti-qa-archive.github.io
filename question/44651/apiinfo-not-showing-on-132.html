							<p>Yeah, something&#39;s funky with the console logging in Titanium Developer when you mix in iOS4. It happened for me when I first installed iOS4 and XCode 3.2.3.  Then, unexpectedly, it started working again. Now that I&#39;ve installed the 4.0.1 my console messages (debug, info, etc.) are missing again.  I&#39;ve just been debugging with the console straight out of the xcode project that TD creates, but it&#39;s annoying the added step to first compile in Titanium Developer and then go to xcode and clean&#x2F;build just so I can see the console.</p>

							<p>Encountered the same problem with iOS SDK 4.0.2. It can be fixed by editing the logger.py fix and changing references to 4.0.1 to 4.0.2</p>

							<p>Are you using the latest SDK? I think I&#39;m having the same problem. I made the mistake of upgrading my iphone to 4.0.1 which required an SDK update. Since then, I&#39;m not getting any messages in the TI Developer. </p>
<p>I don&#39;t have a solution for you, but just looking to validate that is the problem and see if a TI update is required.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m kind of running a hybrid of 1.3.2 and 1.3.3. I pillaged the @2x and updated Slider from the 1.3.3 commit and rolled that into the 1.3.2 iPhone classes folder.  Everything else seems to be working.  I am running 4.0.1 and SDK 4. Good to know its not just me :)</p>

							<p>Curious if someone can chime in on this from the latest release, are you guys able to get output to the console using Ti.API.info(&#39;TEST&#39;).  Just created a brand new project and cannot get this to work.  Seems like to got broke when SDK 4 was released.</p>

							<p>Ti.API.info works fine for me in 1.3.0 and 1.3.3 checked out from our master repository.  It could be that you&#39;re getting a JavaScript exception or something along those lines.  Could you share the code you&#39;re using?</p>

							<p>Thanks Kevin, I literally create a new project, then at the last line of app.js add </p>
<p>Ti.API.info(&#39;TEST TEST TEST&#39;);</p>
<p>I am using the build from 1:54pm based on the repository. I am compiling to 4.0 and 3.2 and both do not trace the info command. </p>

							<p>I found out that doing a full rebuild will allow Ti.API.info to work again. The way I did it was to change the SDK from 4.0 to 3.2 wait til it said that it was executing full rebuild then I would quit Titanium and compile with 4.0 SDK,this would allow Ti.API.info to work again.</p>

							<p>I just got a new macbook and did a complete install of everything including ONLY the 4.0.1 SDK and tested with both the 1.3.0 mobile SDK and the github head and am unable to get any console output either. Tried with both a new project and with the imported kitchensink.</p>
<p>There appear to be several other posts in these Q&amp;A&#39;s about similar problems.</p>

							<p>Anyone found a fix for this? Since the only debugging tool you have it so include Ti.API.log&#x2F;debug messages, my development is dead. I&#39;d downgrade to 4.0 SDK, but I can&#39;t find a link. I guess it&#39;s so new, no one has had to downgrade. Can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t save the old SDK.</p>
<p>Appcelerator? Any word on if this is a bug for everyone?</p>

							<p>I just created a ticket for this on Lighthouse so hopefully it gets assigned and resolved ASAP.  Its really an annoyance.  3.2 properly shows the info though so I test on iPad then 4. Really looking forward to a fix though. Thought there would be one in the nightly&#39;s but nothing yet.</p>

							<p>I just upgraded to 4.0.1 and now I have this problem as well.  But I&#39;m using Titanium 1.4.0 SDK, and these earlier comments seem to suggest that the problem was already fixed.  I&#39;ve tried forcing an app rebuild with no luck.  Is anyone else still having this problem?</p>

							<p>It doesnt work again. I&#39;m not sure it its the same issue but i don&#39;t get any output on the latest (SDK 1.7.2 reinstalled today on Lion). I always get the same output which comes from a version from last week (i assume that this is the las logged output byt i don&#39;t know which file).<br>Two days ago it worked after about 10secs from starting the simulator but now it doesn&#39;t output anything.</p>
