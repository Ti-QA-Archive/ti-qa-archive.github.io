			<h1>Android Latest Nightly Builds</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am using the latest version of Ti Studio on Mac running Lion.</p>
<p>Firstly I will say that I have developed an app which runs on IOS 5 and successfully runs with the SDKS I am about to mention.</p>
<p>The issue is that I am now moving it over to Android and I have a few issues which I hope somebody else has come across or the guys at appcelerator can give me some guidance on. I am not going to post code unless requested.</p>
<p>Android SDK 1.8.01 and 1.7.6 latest nightly builds both using V8 and Rhino.</p>
<p>I am loading some files in the app.js file using Ti.Include defining functions within the application namespace, these load. I am then when required loading other other files. I use a global load routine and the commonJS require method. I load each file into its own sub namespace of the app namespace and export the functions, there are no globally accessible variable declared in these files.</p>
<p>In the above SDK&#39;s the required file functions cannot access the declared namespaces in the included files. In the 1.8.0 SDK everything runs as it should in either V8 or Rhino.</p>
<p>Next few issues…. This applies to 1.7.6 1.8.0 and 1.8.0.1<br>have not expected 1.7.5 to work but have the loading file issues so cannot check much after that.</p>
<p>Anywhere I do a show() or hide() on a component I have had to change it to visible = true or false. show() and hide() do not give an error they just do not work.</p>
<p>text areas. I have quite a few text areas declared throughout the code, on the input ones, they work as they should, but on the display only ones no (editable is false) actual text is displayed and although I have set the borderWidth to 0 they still have a border, also the backgroundcolor does not display correctly it is always yellow no matter what I set it to. Labels work as expected. Not setting the backgroundcolor makes it transparent.</p>
<p>I think this may have something to do with the text area focus but haven&#39;t tested that yet.</p>
<p>GPS Location.</p>
<p>Although I cannot fully confirm this yet as more testing and trials need to be done, it appears that the Geolocation services are not updating. I have had the same code without the file load issue running in 1.7.5 and geolocation works perfectly.</p>
<p>Animations.</p>
<p>It also appears that animations do not run. I have a couple of screens loading from the right and they do not appear. Again this maybe down to something else but no animations are working.. </p>
<p>Data httpRequests</p>
<p>On one of my API calls it always fails. I have common code for all data calls which works for everything else. It appears that for some reason it returns the data as responseData instead of responseText.</p>
<p>Well I think that is about it.. Sorry for the length of the post but wanted to put all issues in one place. I hope somebody else has a solution or now that appcelerator are aware they can look at the nightly SDKS, and tell me where I am going wrong.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>T.</p>

							<div><p>Trevor, I know you are really pushing the platform&#39;s capabilities, so your feedback is extremely valued. When the issues are complex like this, though, it&#39;s good to keep each Q&amp;A question focused on one single issue for which you expect one single definitive answer, even if that means opening more than one question at once.</p>
<p>As we have just agreed privately, we will await your test case before proceeding any further with this.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding. Keep up the great work! :)</p>

							<div><p>Trevor,  </p>
<p>When we started on the app currently in development, Android and iOS reported different progress values when playing multimedia.  We used to have to divide the Android response by 5000 to get the value we wanted while iOS was a straight toInt and off and running.  In 1.7.5 and 1.7.6, both platforms report the same value.  In 1.8.x both return a value about 3000x too high.  </p>
<p>I appreciate you listing the items that you are dealing with.  By giving us a heads up on what you are currently dealing with with the next SDK version, helps us to better determine production time going forward.</p>
