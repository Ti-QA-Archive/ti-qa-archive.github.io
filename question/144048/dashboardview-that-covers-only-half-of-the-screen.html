			<h1>DashboardView that covers only half of the screen</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I&#39;m quite a beginner. I have a question about the Ti.UI.DashboardView:<br>I created a DashboardView with 6 buttons (dashboarditems), when I put the DashboardView on a full screen window (iphone) eveything looks good. The buttons are being displayed in two rows of 3 buttons.</p>
<p>What I want is the following:<br>I want the dashboardview to cover only half of the screen. To achieve this I have created a new view (height: 180 pixels), I added this view to the window and on my dashboardview I set the top property to 180.<br>Now my screen is split up in two different areas: an empty view on top and the dashboardview at the bottom.</p>
<p>The problem is that the size of the dashboarditems is different now (height has been decreased) and they are &#39;sticked&#39; to the top of the dashboardview. There is space enough to display the items properly (like in the full screen).</p>
<p>My question: Is it possible to make the dashboardview smaller than full screen with keeping the original size for the items or is the dashboardview only meant for displaying full screen?<br>If it is possible does someone have a piece of example code?</p>
<p>If it&#39;s not possible then it&#39;s good to know because then I know I don&#39;t have to spent more time for looking for a solution.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help!</p>
<p>Kind regards,<br>Stefan</p>
