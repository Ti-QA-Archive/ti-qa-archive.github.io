			<p>In my Apple App Store screen the public sees, it says Japanese is one of the languages.  In iTunes Connect, the entry says English is the only activated language.  But, in the Binary Details, it says Localizations:( &quot;en&quot;, &quot;ja&quot; ).  Is this where Japanese is coming from and how do I remove it?  My app is in English only.</p>

							<p>Hi!<br>You just need to change the language in your Info.plist which is located in the build&#x2F;iphone directory. To keep the same language, just copy the Info.plist from build&#x2F;iphone to your project root. Please check your info.plist.</p>

										<p><p>The info.plist file only had English for localizations.  I did notice the I18n folder has &#39;ja&#39; in it.  Anything wrong with deleting it?</p>
