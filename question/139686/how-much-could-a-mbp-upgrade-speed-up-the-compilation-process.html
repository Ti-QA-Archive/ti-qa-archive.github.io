			<h1>How much could a MBP upgrade speed up the compilation process?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I&#39;m using a MBP 13&#39; 2010, 4GB Ram with Intel C2D 2,5 Ghz right now with a Crucial M4 SSD and my main problem is how long it takes to run my project in simulator.<br>(iOS iPad 5.1 SDK project)</p>
<p>Is there any way to speed things up? I mean, even for a little change like changing the &quot;left&quot; attribute of a label, I have to re-run the project.<br>Right now, every time I re-run the project in simulator, it takes up about 35 seconds.</p>
<p>Is there any &quot;fast boot mode&quot; or something like that for running your project in TI studio? And would an upgrade to a current MBP 13&#39; with dual core Intel Core i5 optimize the startup times? (with the same SSD that I have currently in my MBP)</p>
<p>Or is TI studio just generally that slow because of the python stuff that happens in background and it isn&#39;t even possible to run a complex project in under 10 seconds if you don&#39;t buy the most expensive MBP Retina…?</p>
<p>Thanks for any hints.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks! On my machine it also takes 38 seconds without clean…really bad performance for some reason. So running without clean is nearly the same as building the project completely new…</p>

										<p><p>If you have a few more minutes…could you test your disk speed performance as well? Just to make sure that it is the CPU &#x2F; Ram that makes the difference…not that I buy a new macbook and afterwards I find out my SSD was the problem…that would be great!</p>
<p>I use this free tool from Mac App Store:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunes.apple.com&#x2F;de&#x2F;app&#x2F;blackmagic-disk-speed-test&#x2F;id425264550?mt=12">Blackmagic Disk Test</a></p>
<p>My results are: <strong>Write 210 MB&#x2F;s, Read 270 MB&#x2F;s</strong></p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your post. To have an objective comparison we should have the same project, of course. Mine is relatively complex with 20+ js files with sourcecode that is many pages long. Do you have the current KitchenSink on your mac? Maybe you could run that in iPhone simulator and tell me how long it takes to completely compile that (clean build)?</p>
