			<h1>Application failed to resume in time</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>iOS, iPhone device. SDK 3.1.3.</p>
<p>Some of our users get apps that crash with the following crash log message &quot;my.app.com failed to resume in time&quot;.</p>
<p>I am afraid I cannot give any code example, since it is a very complex project, I am merely looking for generic suggestions&#x2F;advice here. </p>
<p>The app is not doing anything particular on app resume, at least nothing that might take a long time. Are there any known issues with for example setTimeout() [is it possible that leaving timeouts &quot;running&quot; when app goes to background might cause problems, or that setInterval() will make it fire many many times on resume to catch up] or many objects on the map that has to be redrawn by the OS, or similar, that might cause this kind of problems?</p>

							<div><p>are timeouts necessary during the pause?<br>I usually get the current time during the pause event, and then check the new time on the resume event. According to the time difference, I will do something (eg: it was longer than 2 minutes, then logout)</p>

							<div><p>Actually, the crash happens when resuming when background location stuff is running. And yes, the timeouts needs to be running in the background, because that&#39;s how we deal with background location events (it would take some time to explain, and I don&#39;t think it will help).</p>

							<div><p>why don&#39;t you use a background service? in my experience, but I could be wrong, all of the code that I put in my pause event was often fired after the resume. So it could be technically right that they&#39;re fired all at once after the resume.</p>

							<div><p>We <em>are</em> using a background service. The background service provides location data to the &quot;core&quot; of the app, which makes calculations etc on that location data. Those calculations use, among many other things, timers for various reasons.</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;m not sure I can help you any further, but my first try would be to remove all of the timers and see if that fixes it. If that&#39;s the problem, I&#39;d find a workaround to it. Sorry I can&#39;t help mate!</p>

							<div><p>I don&#39;t understand how the timers can be a problem. The code is running in the background because we are using a background location service, so there is not much to resume from. Anyone else who has some ideas on what could go wrong?</p>
