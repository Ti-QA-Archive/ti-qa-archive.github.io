			<h1>iOS 6.0 packaging issue</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p><strong>Titanium Mobile SDK:</strong> 2.1.3GA</p>
<p><strong>Platform &amp; Version:</strong> iOS 6.0</p>
<p><strong>Titanium Studio:</strong> 2.1.2.201208301612</p>
<p><strong>Host Operating System:</strong> OS X 10.7.4</p>
<p>We are having an issue while trying to distribute an app to the app store.  After packaging, when we try to validate, we get an error message that says</p>
<p>###&quot;This bundle is invalid. The application-identifier entitlement is not formatted correctly; it should contain your 10-character App ID Seed, followed by a dot…….&quot;</p>
<p>I see that there is an open ticket for the same: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-11177">Ticket Link</a></p>
<p>Is there any workaround for this until it gets fixed.  We have apps that need to be out at app store and any help in this regard is greatly appreciated.</p>

							<div><p>Yes. I am using wild card app id.  I know that creating a new app id without wild card would work; however, since we have multiple apps, this will not work for me.  We would end up having to create one app id for each of those apps.  Also, every time I want to publish an app, I have to change the app id for the distribution certificate.</p>

							<div><p>You&#39;re supposed to have a separate app id per app, I know things like Push certificates require these.</p>
<p>Also, you don&#39;t have to change the app id for  the distribution certificate.  You just make a new provisioning profile for each new app, choose your existing certificate, and the app id you created for that app.</p>

							<div><p>Josh, thank you for the reply.  Sorry I should have explained it better.  I do agree with you on not having to change the app id for distribution certificate; however, if there is an option to use a wild card character instead of maintaining several provisioning profiles, then I would certainly prefer that.  We already have several apps in app store using the wild card distribution provisioning profile.  It is only after updating to iOS 6 sdk that we are facing this issue.</p>
