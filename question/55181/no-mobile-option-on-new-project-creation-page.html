			<h1>No mobile option on new project creation page</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have problem with my user to create new mobile project.</p>
<p>My older user which is assigned to email musaulker {at} gmail {dot} com has not problems to create new mobile applications.</p>
<p>But my new user profile which is assigned to email info {at} mycloudy {dot} com has problems to create new mobile applications. On the new project creation screen its not possible to switch from Desktop to Mobile project.</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying it on same user on same computer on Mac OS x 10.6.4</p>
<p>How can I solve the problem?</p>
<p>Your regards,</p>
<p>P.S: I&#39;ve restarted Titanium couple of times and also I&#39;ve restarted my Macbook Pro couple of times but it didn&#39;t worked. I&#39;ve imported the KitchenSink app its working without any problem..</p>

							<div><p>This same thing is happening to me on Windows XP.  I have the Android SDK path setup in my profile, and I&#39;ve confirmed the Android SDK works and the path is set correctly (via the command line).  The only thing I did different than the getting started guide is I installed multiple platforms, does Titanium only work with Platform 1.6?</p>

							<div><p>Me too. I just got started on Mac OS X, and got Kitchen sink working on iPhone emulator. When I go to create a new project, it only has Desktop (and as a string, not a popup).</p>
