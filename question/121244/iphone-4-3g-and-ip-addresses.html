			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Just in case others have a similar issue to me …</p>
<p>I have recently been working with some RESTful web services that worked perfectly well with Wifi connections but but when switching to 3G on the iPhone.</p>
<p>I could not figure out why the same app would not work when using 3G.</p>
<p>It turned out that the iPhone resets its IP address for every request that is made. </p>
<p>Because the web services I was using used a hash of the IP address to create a session key that I then pass to all other requests everything stopped working because the IP address no longer matched.</p>
<p>You can go to any &quot;what&#39;s my IP&quot; site in Safari on the iPhone with 3G connection and refresh the window. The IP address will change.</p>
<p>Luckily the web services I am using are our own and so we could fix the issue which was added in an attempt to further protect sessions in the web browser.</p>
<p>Cheers<br>Mark</p>

							<p>Mark, I am not seeing the same thing, but if I were to take a shot at this I would say it is your cell carrier doing that, not the device itself.</p>

							<p>Matt,</p>
<p>Thanks for trying and suggestion. I think you are right. I am using the Orange network in UK. I just tried on the O2 network instead and that seems OK.</p>
<p>Good old Orange ;) </p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Mark</p>
