			<p>I am trying to load a background image (just 1) which is 1.3M, with the intention of slowly scrolling it in the background.</p>
<p>Platform is Android and i cannot seem to get the animation working nor even loading the image itself.</p>
<p>I have deleted my VMs and restarted the app but same error.</p>
<p>SO i reduced the image size and now its only 713KB</p>
<p>Is there a limit on image sizes? It seems to crash on device also.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jez</p>

							<p>The size of the image file does not really matter.<br>The decoding of the image works like this:<br>Each pixel will have 3 bytes for RGB and another one for Alpha if your image has the alpha channel</p>
<p>That means that an image 100x100px will have a memory footprint of<br>30k(40k with alpha)</p>
<p>If you have an 1024x1024px image you&#39;re kind of doomed as the footprint will be like 3M. Animating this will kill your device for sure.</p>

										<p><p>So there is no way (even without animating) that i can have an image that is 5831?×?600…<br>The idea was that this would scroll but i guess i will have to do it another way.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jez</p>

										<p><p>lol - I am loading many images and they apparently add up to more than many android devices can take.  Thank you for this explanation!  I didn&#39;t really understanding the decoding thing before. :)</p>
