			<h1>Event when application is removed from the device?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,<br>I&#39;m writing an app for both iPhone and Android. My app requires a users registration. I was wondering if there is a way that I can know when a user removes the application (both Android and iPhone) from the device so I can unregister them?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>There are no built in events to know when someone uninstalls your app. On a side note though, it seems like it would be better practice to simply mark an account as inactive after a certain amount of time of inactivity rather than unregistering them when they remove an app. Not everyone removes an app for permanent reasons. Maybe it was an accident, or maybe they are troubleshooting, in which case when they reinstall the app from iTunes, they will have to re-register again.</p>

										<p><p>yeah, that&#39;s what I thought… and that&#39;s what I was planning to do… could have been nice to be able to notify the server upon uninstall though…</p>
<p>Thanks :-)</p>
