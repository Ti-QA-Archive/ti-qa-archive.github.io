			<h1>Result of expression Ti.Filesystem.getFile is not a function</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Titanium 1.8, OS X 10.7, iPhone Simulator</p>
<p>Sigh.  It&#39;s partly my own fault.  I broke the cardinal rule of Titanium development: &quot;Don&#39;t <em>ever</em> touch a working program.&quot;  But I dared to try adding a feature, so here I am.</p>
<p>When I run my application, almost immediately I get a Titanium runtime warning:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Application Error
<span class="hljs-keyword">Result</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> expression
<span class="hljs-string">'Ti.Filesystem.getFile'</span> [...] <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">not</span> a <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>. <span class="hljs-title">at</span> <span class="hljs-title">file</span>.<span class="hljs-title">js</span> <span class="hljs-params">(line 9)</span></span>
</code></pre><p>My file.js is included, and the function at line 9 is called a few times during setup, although the call causing the error seems to be unpredictable.</p>
<p>The […] changes occasionally, and is a string from my program that <em>has not been encountered yet</em>.</p>
<p>And sometimes, of course, the program starts up properly.</p>
<p>So based on those forensics, my first guess is that there&#39;s some sort of memory corruption going on.  Based on the fact that nothing has changed with program startup, I&#39;m left to guess that the memory corruption might actually be caused during…compilation? …setup? …something else?</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#39;m at a lost as to where to even start looking for where things are going wrong.</p>
<p>Can someone give me a small hint as to what would cause that sort of thing?</p>

							<div><p>The problem has arose after I made changes to make the Android version compatible. Now, the Android version works alright without errors, while the iOS version says Ti.Filesystem.getFile is not a function after splash. Titanium 1.7.5 and OS X 10.6.8</p>

							<div><p>I just found the solution specific to my problem. Even though I didn&#39;t use any Titanium File I&#x2F;O directly, I&#39;ve been employing rjss feature of redux.js, which used Ti.Filesystem.getFile to parse the rjss data to process. My blunder was using the unsupported feature of rjss, specifically, commenting out a property of style element using the pair of &#x2F;<em> … </em>&#x2F; The comment-out worked alright for Android port, but iOS, for it generated the error and just stopped right away. I guess your app might read a resource file or something somewhere without your notice, which generates File I&#x2F;O error or something you might not be aware of due to permissions or etc.,</p>

										<p><p>Well the code that&#39;s malfunctioning is just this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">myfile</span><span class="hljs-params">(filename)</span>
</span>{
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Returns a File object for the given document filename</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> Ti.Filesystem.getFile(Ti.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory, filename);
}
</code></pre><p>But that&#39;s not terribly helpful.  If I can&#39;t get it figured or worked around (most likely the latter) I&#39;ll try to strip it down to a test case.</p>
<p>Mainly I was just wondering if anyone had seen&#x2F;worked around this before.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>Remember that your app is running in a multi-threaded environment.  One thread may run faster than another and encounter variables&#x2F;strings that have not been set by another area of your application on start-up.</p>

										<p><p>Sure, but that shouldn&#39;t be <em>my</em> problem, because the JS code is single-threaded.  I fully agree that behind the scenes <em>Titanium</em> is probably doing something out of sync, but I have no idea could cause Ti.Filesystem.getFile to not be recognized as a function.</p>
