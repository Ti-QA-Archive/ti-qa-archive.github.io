			<h1>Eventlistener for a imageview inside a scrollview</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>What I am trying to do is have a click event on a imageview inside a scrollview.  When the item is clicked I want to do something, but the click event is not being fired.  Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;ve been having the exact same problem!</p>
<p>What I&#39;m trying to do is basically add a small red delete image as a imageView &quot;button&quot; to the right of a view inside a scrollview. I&#39;ve tried zIndex, changing the imageView to a button, no luck in receiving any events!</p>

							<div><p>What I had to do is increase the image size.  It was too small of an area to be &quot;clicked&quot;.  It was very strange, but after increasing the size of the image it worked. I also took out the view.  I just added to the scrollview.</p>

							<p>I know its pretty late for this answer…but for anyone who is still looking for this…do the following:</p>
<p>1) Attach an eventListener to your window</p>
<p>2) Now indside the function you call to handle events for your window do something like this:</p>
<p>function windowEventListener(e){<br>    switch(e.source.imageName) {<br>        case &#39;myImageViewName&#39;:<br>            Ti.API.info(&#39;The Image view is clicked&#39;);<br>                break;<br>    }<br>}</p>
<p>where imageName is the custom property you add when creating the imageView. E.g.: imageName:&#39;myImageViewName&#39;</p>

<p>What is the height of the image?  If it&#39;s less than 520px, surely it&#39;s not even displayed on the screen (due to imageView&#39;s <code>top:-520</code> property)?</p>
<p>Is the click being acknowledged in the trace log?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Hmm, ok, maybe it is debug you need to use on iOS instead of trace.</p>
<p>Again, what is the height of the image?</p>

										<p><p>The height of the image is 20.  You were right.  Without the height, the image shows.  If you add the height to the imageview the image disappears.  So I adjusted the top for it to show and I still experience the same result, the click is still not firing.</p>

										<p><p>Doug&#39;s is a good idea.  Alternatively, I wonder whether the width of the image (only 20px) is so small that a click with a finger is not registering. It&#39;s frequently done, and hence recommended practice, to place a larger, transparent, view over small screen assets to make them easier for users to interact with.</p>
<p>Let us know the actual solution - I&#39;m intrigued! :)</p>

										<p><p>Yeah what I am doing is building a star rating system.  The starts are certain size.  I even increased the size of the star to 50x50 and it still doesn&#39;t fire.</p>

							<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>the image is being displayed properly.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t have a trace log as a Filter option.  I only have debug, warn, info and error.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>What happens if you add a1 to view instead of scrollView?  This may be a zorder issue with view receiving the click instead of a1, but with view being transparent you would not see the difference on the screen.</p>

										<p><p>Humor me and place a click event listener on view with a different alert so you can tell which fires.  Also, as Paul mentiond, 20px is fairly skinny to accurately hit with a finger.  What kind of image is 20px wide and 600px tall?  Is this some type of pseudo table index that is prebuilt as an image (ala the A-Z on the right of some tables).</p>
