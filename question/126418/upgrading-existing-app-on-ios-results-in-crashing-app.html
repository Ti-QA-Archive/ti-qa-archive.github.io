			<h1>Upgrading existing app on iOS results in crashing app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>We&#39;ve had an app out in the app store for ages.. I put out a patch release a few days ago that fixed a few bugs from a release 2-3 weeks ago, however one user has reported that after installing the update it would show the splash screen &amp; die with a black screen, before returning to the &#39;desktop&#39;.</p>
<p>It&#39;s difficult to know whether this is a widespread problem. There are no crash reports in the iTunes Connect portal thingy (unless they take some time to come through).</p>
<p>He&#39;s using an iPhone on 4.3.3, and I&#39;m using Titanium Mobile 1.7.1. The version of Titanium mobile didn&#39;t change between my 2 releases, nor did his iOS version, as far as he&#39;s said.</p>
<p>He ended up deleting the app &amp; reinstalling.. after that it worked fine. We therefore don&#39;t know whether a reboot of the phone would have sorted it. Either way it&#39;s a poor solution.. the user most like thinks we&#39;ve screwed up the app &amp; moves on, never to use it again :(</p>
<p>Has anyone experienced this kind of thing before? Is it something that sometimes happens with non-Titanium apps?</p>

							<div><p>This probably isn&#39;t something you&#39;ll receive alot or responses on. If it we&#39;re something that was inherently wrong with the update, then it would have never made it passed the Apple update process. Without crash logs from either your users or your test devices, then you&#39;re going to have a hard time troubleshooting this. There is no way that there is a universal answer for any crashing on updated app issues.</p>

							<p>That&#39;s fine. Thanks for your comment Anthony; I was after reassurance that it&#39;s most likely an isolated issue. You&#39;re very right; if it was a bad binary then Apple wouldn&#39;t have let it through.</p>
<p>I was also wondering whether other users have encountered this with other non-Titanium apps &amp; that it was something iPhone users would generally know how to deal with - I&#39;m an Android user and haven&#39;t encountered that kind of problem.</p>
