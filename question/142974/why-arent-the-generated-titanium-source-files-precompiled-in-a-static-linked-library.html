			<h1>Why aren&#39;t the generated Titanium source files precompiled in a static linked library?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Often times when I&#39;m working on an iOS project, I will open the &quot;build&quot; directory generated by Titanium Studio and open up the Xcode project to do some advanced debugging and profiling.</p>
<p>However, compile times are very very slow, even for small projects because Xcode has to compile many many source files on each build (all of the Ti* classes, as well as ASI, AudioStreamer, FBConnect, JSON, etc.)</p>
<p>This seems unnecessary. Why aren&#39;t these source files bundled into a static linked library, or at least included in a precompiled header? Is there a specific reason for this? It seems like this is a simple optimization that should have been done already, so I wanted to ask the community about this to see if I&#39;m missing something.</p>
<p>If there are no major roadblocks in doing so, I want to customize my installation of Titanium to do this so I am not so heavily taxed each time I want to compile.</p>
