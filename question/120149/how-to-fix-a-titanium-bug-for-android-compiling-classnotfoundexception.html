			<h1>How to fix a Titanium bug for Android compiling (ClassNotFoundException)</h1>
		</header>

			<p>Alright, here I posed a question:<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;120003&#x2F;android-app-wont-run-once-signed-really-desperate</p>
<p>Nobody answered and after 30 hours of debugging I found out that Titanium Studio&#x2F;Developer have a bug that can really prevent you from building your distribution on Android. Both programs have problems with the size of javascript files. In my case I found out that app.js wasn&#39;t compiled into a class because it&#39;s too big. Titanium Developer doesn&#39;t even catch the problem for the user: the .apk file is produced, alas it won&#39;t work. Titanium Studio will warn with a &quot;64k limit&quot; error that doesn&#39;t prevent the application from building the apk and for which I have found no information in the KB.</p>
<p>So, first of all, if running a packaged app (signed and zipaligned) you get an error like &quot;Couldn&#39;t find pre-compiled class for script: app.js&quot;, Titanium simply didn&#39;t compile the js file in a class. Go back to your .js file, split it including part of it in an external file (obviously I would suggest including a whole activity or part of the program in the external file, not just arbitrary code to cut it short) and use the Titanium.include() method to include it. That&#39;s gonna fix it.</p>
<p>One quick note. Before I said that the problem is with the size of the .js file. To be precise, it&#39;s with the size of uncommented code. Any commented code won&#39;t count toward some kind of limit.</p>
<p>Now, I would really find it useful if someone from the staff here at Appcelerator could evaluate this information because something in my opinion must be done. Either allowing bigger .js files, warning explicitely the user and not producing the .apk file (which is not gonna work anyway) or documenting the issue. But someone should really address this because I threw away a weekend on this and it&#39;s not good publicity for a very good application.</p>
<p>Hope this helps someone…</p>
