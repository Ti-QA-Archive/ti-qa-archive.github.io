							<p>I have no experience with it but doesnt Look like somewhat I want to try. The last (and First) changelog entry is nearly one year ago. Titanium is known for it major changes, so you will always be dependent on that Framework and have to wait for the adjustments. If they are Not making Money with it, they will give it up sooner or later..</p>

										<p><p>I was wondering the same thing, seemed like a lot of potential with the nice scaffolding and additional nice to haves, but I was dubious about the lack of recent updates</p>

							<p>Yes, I am looking for an easy MVC based framework too, the ones listed at the marketplace look rather difficult to conceptualise … kranium was one that i have also checked but the fact that it&#39;s not updated makes me stay away.</p>
