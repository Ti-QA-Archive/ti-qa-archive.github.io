			<h1>How to run my iPad app on my iPad device?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>On this doc:<br>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Deploying+to+iOS+devices</p>
<p>…it says &quot;Once you&#39;re done with the preceding steps, Titanium Studio makes it easy to build and install your app to a locally connected device. From the Run menu, choose iOS Device.&quot;</p>
<p>I went through all the steps, put my appid in the &quot;id&quot; property of the tiapp.xml file, and it should be ready to go. But I don&#39;t see &quot;iOS Device&quot; in my run menu. My iPad is connected by USB, and I can successfully run my app in the Simulator. Help.</p>

							<p>I finally got my app deployed to my actual iPad. I went through 6 hours of hell, experiments, trial and error, mistakes, and redoes. I honestly don&#39;t know what the silver bullet was because I tried (and retried) so many different things. But I am certain that what helped was creating a new folder, clean project, and moving my Resource files over to that and starting fresh.</p>
<p>Why does this process have to be so darn difficult? Mac is famous for being simple and user friendly. Why did they make app deployments intentionally difficult? I know it was on purpose because there are lots of obvious ways they could have simplified the whole process. End of vent.</p>
