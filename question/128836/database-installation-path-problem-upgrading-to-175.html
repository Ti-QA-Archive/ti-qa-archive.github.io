			<h1>Database installation path problem upgrading to 1.7.5</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I had a previously working mobile application that &quot;installed&quot; a sqlite database. The database in question was in the Resources directory. I just realized that there are path related changes in 1.7.*. This seems to have broken my app, at least on a clean install with no previous database. Previously I had:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> app.mainDB = Titanium.Database.install(<span class="hljs-string">'main.db'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'main'</span>);
</code></pre><p>This worked fine. It does not now. The examples in kitchensink seem to say this now should be:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> app.mainDB = Titanium.Database.install(<span class="hljs-string">'../main.db'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'main'</span>);
</code></pre><p>Is this correct? </p>
<p>Assuming so, there is another issue, as I can&#39;t use that database on my test device, even with that syntax (or any other syntax I&#39;ve tried). I get a runtime error when opening the first table. I&#39;ve been using the Android Applications manager to uninstall the app and remove stored data thinking that this is confusing the issue, and that a previously opened, but empty, database might be lurking. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve read the API docs (not particularly helpful), the wiki and the blog post about relative paths. Any other explanations or help would be wonderfully appreciated. I am stuck at this point. Thanks.</p>

							<p>I don&#39;t quite understand &quot;why&quot;, but the following code eventually resolved the broken DB situation: </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">app.mainDB = <span class="hljs-type">Titanium</span>.<span class="hljs-type">Database</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>(<span class="hljs-symbol">'main'</span>);
app.mainDB.remove<span class="hljs-literal">()</span>;

app.mainDB = <span class="hljs-type">Titanium</span>.<span class="hljs-type">Database</span>.install(<span class="hljs-symbol">'data</span>/main.db',<span class="hljs-symbol">'main'</span>);
</code></pre><p>The best I can tell is that on Android, when you go into Manage Applications, and &#39;Clear Data&#39; &#x2F; &#39;Uninstall&#39;, pieces of the application remain behind regardless. Apparently, an empty database had been created along the way, and this was still there, and picked up when the app was re-installed from scratch, causing much grief. remove()&#39;ing it, via Titanium seems to have righted the situation and from I can tell, the only way to solve it.</p>

										<p><p>Just an observation, but the path in your solution differs from the path you posted originally. data&#x2F;main.db suggests your db resides in the sub-directory &quot;data&quot; in the resources directory. Whereas your path in your original post doesn&#39;t include &quot;data&quot;. Unless your suggesting that creating a new path and then changing the path is what fixed it. In going forward, all of my references to a path are structured like your path in your solution.</p>
<p>&#39;main.db&#39; suggests a file called main.db located directly in the Resources folder. &#39;lib&#x2F;main.db&#39; suggests a file called main.db in the lib folder which is in turn located in the Resources folder.</p>

										<p><p>Darren, thanks. I will explain a bit … I did wind up changing the path of the db file from the original location. I am guessing that is indeed part of the &quot;fix&quot;.</p>
<p>I will backtrack … I am updating a small app originally done with 1.4. The database was referenced as specified in my first post. This has worked fine while upgrading the app and now on 1.7. I recently tried it on an Android tablet that had never been one of my test devices. To my surprise, I got fatal errors anytime I opened any table on the tablet. Testing on other devices (which were upgrades), there was no problem at all. So for grins I tried removing all the data and uninstalling one of my other test devices, and doing a &quot;clean&quot; install. Same problem! No errors opening the database, but errors accessing any table.</p>
<p>Then I did a little research and found a Ti blog post about path related changes in 1.7. Other postings I found said don&#39;t put the db in the Resources folder (where it had been for some time) because its not writable. All this led me to change my original location (purposefully).</p>
<p>My theory then was that the older installations were OK because the db pre-existed the new path specification logic. This led to a quite bit of change one line of code &#x2F; &#39;Clear data&#39; on device &#x2F; rebuild &#x2F; test, etc cycles, all of which failed, no matter where I put the db and how I specified it.<br>I then tried using Titanium to open the db, remove it, and re-install (a modified db). This worked. I am guessing that when an uninstall or &#39;clear data&#39; on Android, that it does not remove everything, but probably truncates the sqlite database file, leaving it there for some odd reason, and tripping me up. I can&#39;t think of another explanation. If there is one, I am all ears. </p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
