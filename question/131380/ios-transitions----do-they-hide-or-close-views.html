			<h1>iOS Transitions -- Do they hide or close views?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Been looking through the documentation and I can&#39;t find anything solid on what happens when you use iOS-only animation transitions.<br>I looked at the Kitchen Sink and three views are added to an object, and then each individual is transition-animated into view. Does transitioning in one view make all the other views invisible, or does it close them?</p>

							<p>60 views and no answer lol.</p>
<p>So, did some testing. Looks like when you say</p>
<p>something.animate({ view: some_view, transition: Ti.UI.iPhone.whatever })</p>
<p>it hides all of the other elements and only shows the view specified. because i re-showed one of the buttons that it hid, and the &quot;click&quot; listener was still hooked up, leading me to believe that it was not destroyed, merely hidden.</p>
<p>Would like it if an appcelerator dev could confirm or just add it to the docs.</p>

							<p>Very timely - I&#39;m currently working thru at a similar test program because I&#39;m having inconsistent behavior with animation transitions depending on what &quot;some_view&quot; is in your example.  When &quot;some_view&quot; is a simple view, things work.  When it is a composite view (say a view containing a searchBar + tableView) then the animation fails - if it is a page flip, the page flips to the edge and then as it is about to render the new view, it dies but without throwing an exception!  </p>
<p>I&#39;m going to post it as a separate issue but I think it is probably related to what you are seeing.  The scary thing is the inconsistency.</p>
