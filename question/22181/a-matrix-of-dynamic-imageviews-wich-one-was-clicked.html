			<h1>A matrix of dynamic imageViews, wich one was clicked?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>For an image gallery I am trying to build a matrix of images from an array of image names by stepping through the array and creating an image View (of the same name) on every iteration. That works so far.</p>
<p>I am too attaching an event listener on each iteration. Here is where the problem begins. Because all imageViews are named the same (bc created in a for-construct) the event listener gets confused on what actual image the user clicked.</p>
<p>I think of using dynamic variable names but I am not sure if that is the best way to go. Maybe one of the more experienced users know a better way to implement it.</p>
<p>I am glad for every hint - I do not necessarily need working code.</p>

							<p>I did something similar and found that with the 170 images I was using, it was just too slow.</p>
<p>I ended up creating a WebView with the images and each image had an <code>onclick</code> that fired off a <code>Ti.App.fireEvent()</code></p>
<p>So, I don&#39;t know if that would work for your use case, but it was much faster for me than creating 170 imageViews each with an eventListener.</p>
<p>However, to answer your specific question, when I did create separate imageViews, I did it by putting them in a list. Seemed like a cleaner variable namespace to me and it was then something I could iterate over if needed (like, creating event listeners after the imageViews display, etc).</p>

							<p>In the click or even the touch events there is a source property that has a reference to the object that was touched or clicked. </p>
<p>so like in a click event would be like this<br>function(e){<br>   Ti.API.log(e.source);<br>}</p>
