			<h1>Play sound while recording video</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, We are developing a Karaoke app, and we are having problems playing mp3 song whilst recording video.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have successfully recorded a video so we know that is working. (without mp3 file playing)</li>
<li>We have also played a mp3 (without videorecording), so we know that it works.</li>
</ul>
<p>The camera is fiering up, but as soon as the mp3 file starts playing the &quot;lens-shutter&quot; closes. If we start the mp3 file before the camera the camera is fiering up but stops the audio..</p>
<p>We really need to be able to play sound while recording vid… is there any work arounds?</p>
