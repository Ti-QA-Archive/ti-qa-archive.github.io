			<h1>Switching many images at one time</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Is there a way to be able to switch many images to a different state.</p>
<p>I can have a dynamic number of images on the screen at any given time. Based on a selection they can either be in their &#39;highlighted&#39; or &#39;unhighlighted&#39; state. Looping over the images and changing them individually can cause a stutter effect that locks up the ui while each image changes individually.</p>
<p>Is there a way to take all the images and change them all at the same time.</p>

							<p>Hi Paul</p>
<p>You are doing it the right way, however there is something we can do about the &#39;stutter&#39;, which <em>should</em> do what you want by batching all the updates into one process.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE; I have not tried this for image swaps.  But given the tiny change to your code a simple test that costs you nothing.</p>
<p>As you have seen, changing many properties (does not matter which), cause a redraw event on the item and anything near it.  Do lots of changes and lots of redraws occur.</p>
<p>There is a new pair of functions you can use that turn the process in to a kind of batch process.</p>
<p>This example explains it in the most basic form;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in">view</span>.startLayout();  <span class="hljs-comment">// you add this to the start of your changes</span>
<span class="hljs-built_in">view</span>.top = <span class="hljs-number">50</span>;
<span class="hljs-built_in">view</span>.left = <span class="hljs-number">50</span>;
<span class="hljs-built_in">view</span>.finishLayout(); <span class="hljs-comment">// and this to the end</span>
</code></pre><p>By adding the <code>startLayout</code> and <code>finishLayout</code> calls BEFORE and AFTER your process - it switches of redrawing and simply does everything behind the scenes relating to calculations.</p>
<p>You change <code>view</code> to whatever parent the images are in.</p>
<p>Again - I have not tried your exact case - as I do not have to hand lots of images to try it on.</p>
<p>Please report back either way.</p>
