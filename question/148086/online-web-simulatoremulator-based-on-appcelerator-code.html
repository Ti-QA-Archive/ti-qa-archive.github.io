			<h1>Online web simulator/emulator based on Appcelerator code</h1>
		</header>

			<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I know that this might be the wrong forum for this question and i am sorry if i offend someone but when i tried to ask it at Stackoverflow it would&#39;nt let me because it was&#39;nt good enough(!) Ha ha ha… </p>
<p>I wonder if someone have built an online emulator&#x2F;simulator for test purpose with code from Appcelerator?</p>
<p>You know when you go to these &quot;fancy&quot; sites that says: &quot;Build a mobile app in 5 min!&quot; the have like an Ajax (i presume..?) div based em&#x2F;sim mock up that displays how your app could look with the credentials that you fill in. Website, Youtube and background images etc etc…</p>
<p>Would it be possible to make one of those that uses the Appcelerators code? Something like:</p>
<p>Youtube ID:<br>Homepage:</p>
<p>etc and the just take the fields value as a  Ti.App.Properties.setString etc…  </p>
<p>And if not do someone know of some docs describing how one can acclompish that with Ajax, jQuery or what would be the appropriate way to do it? #googleaintmyfriendinthatsubject </p>
<p>So once again maybe wrong forum but i gave it a shoot.</p>
<p>Thanx.</p>

<p>I thought something like this.<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appsgeyser.com&#x2F;create&#x2F;url&#x2F;</p>
<p>And where the &quot;Website&quot;, &quot;Appname&quot;,&quot;Description&quot; is fields where the input value could be used like setString and the content in the Sim&#x2F;emulator would be driven with code from our Appcelerator project and responses there after when strings are inserted.</p>
<p>Lets say you have this to fetch a Youtube playlist for use in a table or such</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"> xhr.open(<span class="hljs-string">'GET'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/playlists/'</span> + Ti.App.<span class="hljs-keyword">Properties</span>.getString(<span class="hljs-string">"Youtube"</span>) +<span class="hljs-string">'?v=2&amp;alt=rss&amp;prettyprint=true'</span>);
</code></pre><p>And all of the table view etc ready in the background so when you put in your YT Playlist ID and refresh the table fills with you playlist.</p>
<p>I think that something like that would be  great feature for all developers so we can give a small preview to clients on how a mobile app could look with their content, background images etc.  When it comes to driving business to your development company (If you have one) i think such a preview could be a really good USP if only to demonstrate simple functions like www, Youtube and Facebook&amp;Twitter feed. </p>
<p>All the sites like the one in my link have just (mostly) simple webviews that they demo the content in.<br>With an Appcelerator Mobile mock up that you can tweak with your own code it would kick the living &amp;%#=&amp; out of those wannabe sites ;)</p>
