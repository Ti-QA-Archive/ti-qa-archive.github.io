			<h1>Having no global variables does hurt development!</h1>

			<p>Yep I am into commonjs and the require; </p>
<p>and my app is looking nice and separated and thats all cool;</p>
<p>However even nodejs has a notion of global that can be used if you really must; and sometimes you just must;</p>
<p>At the minute if I want to do an identity map for my models I simple cannot cos there is not 1 global variable that I can use; </p>
<p>I feel that if at least once global variable like global for node is not provided it will hender development more then it will help it;</p>

							<p>What you can do is have a &quot;common&quot; commonjs module that holds a variable that can hold that type of data</p>

										<p><p>Along these lines, I create a globalObjects.js and include that in every part of my code. Then I use exports.myGlobalVariable = &quot;&quot; in that .js file and reference it in my code where I need it as globalObjects.myGlobalVariable = new_value.</p>

							<p>Yeah, you can use common module in which you can store anything you would in global variable, but you need to re-include it in every module. That&#39;s against DRY principles. </p>
<p>Writing code is much easier when global variables are available. :)</p>
