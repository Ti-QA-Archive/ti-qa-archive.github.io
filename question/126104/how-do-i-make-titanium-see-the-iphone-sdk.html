			<h1>How do I make Titanium see the Iphone SDK?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>This is a noob question: I just installed Titanium 1.0.4.2 and Xcode 4.1. But Titanium insists the Iphone SDK can not be found, and so refuses to import the kitchensink app. What do I need to do to make Titanium see and use the Iphone SDK?</p>
<p>On a side note, the Android SDK was easy, I just installed it and pointed Titanium to the dir, and that works fine.</p>

							<p>OK firstly are you using a Mac, if not you can&#39;t.</p>
<p>If on a mac have you installed Xcode. If not you can either sign up as a apple developer developer.apple.com for about $99 or you can purchase it from the app store for about $5.</p>
<p>Then your away.</p>
<p>If you plan to develop for iPhone, mac or iPad then you will have to have a developer licence and use a mac.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>T.</p>

							<p>I do have a Mac (Snow Leopard), and I am a paying member of developer.apple.com, from where I downloaded Xcode (which contains the Iphone SDK according to Apple).</p>
<p>Then I installed it, which worked fine. But Titanium just isn&#39;t seeing the SDK :(  It feels like there is some small step or detail I am missing. Do I need to reboot the computer?  Is there a setting somewhere in Titanium I need to tweak?  Is there some app in Xcode that I need to start up, or configure?</p>
<p>Thanks for your answering!</p>

							<p>actually if everything is installed then go for closing all apps and reboot the machine. It does need a reboot after installing Xcode. If not post back.</p>

							<p>Tried rebooting twice and even re-installing Titanium now, but no luck. It just keeps saying &quot;Missing the iOS SDK required for this project.&quot; when I try to import the KitchenSink app.</p>
<p>There is nowhere to select a path for the IOS SDK like there is for Android. I&#39;m assuming this is because Titanium is simply supposed to &quot;know&quot; the Iphone SDK is installed if it is, is this true?</p>
<p>What else could possibly be wrong with this picture? :&#x2F;</p>

							<p>Actually I wonder if it is a red hearing. There is an issue with the path pouting to the Titanium SDK. Not always but I had it …</p>
<p>So it may be this path which is wrong.</p>
<p>In the preferences panel go to titanium Studio and then titanium.</p>
<p>This is where the paths are set.. The Android one and the top one which points to the titanium SDK it should be</p>
<p>&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium</p>
<p>Check this and change it if it points else where.</p>
<p>Hope this solves it</p>
<p>T.</p>

										<p><p>I tried playing around with that, but it didn&#39;t help, and it does have the correct path set after its freshly installed.</p>
<p>However, I started another thread on this problem where I accuse Titanium of not supporting the latest Xcode (4.1), and another person has said that is the case too. I&#39;m downloading Xcode 4.0.3 now, and am pretty hopeful it will do the trick.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
