			<h1>Can I use AngularJs for implementing Dependency Injection in my application?</h1>
		</header>

			<ol>
<li>Is this possible at all? Has this been tried before? Are there any other ways to implement DI in Titanium? </li>
<li>What is the application seem in a Titanium Application which is the most appropriate place to bootstrap IOC and how? (I&#39;m thinking the composition root should be in app.js)</li>
<li>What are the implications of having DI implemented in a Ti App considering dependency lifetime management? i.e. possible performance&#x2F;memory concerns, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>What I&#39;d really like to do is to register platform specific implementations of a dependency in the composition root rather than having &quot;if platform == android &#x2F; ios&quot; checks everywhere in code. This would ideally limit the platform checks to the composition root. Rather than DI, is there any other way to do it?</p>

							<div><p>You understand that Titanium creates native applications right?  Whilst AngularJS is a good web library it is not suited to native apps.  Unless of course you are trying to create a web based app.  If you are aiming for a web based non-native app - then why use the power of Titanium if you are aiming to cripple that power from the start?</p>

							<div><p>A simple no was not given as that was not a suitable answer - plus this is a comment and not an answer.</p>
<p>My actual premise which still stands is simply that AngularJS is the wrong thing to start with so attempting to determine how something should work (from my perspective at least) was a pointless exercise. </p>
<p>You are asking how to make a car work with handle bars because you prefer bikes but you are choosing to drive a car.  These things are not the same.</p>
<p>I did not down vote the question, that was someone else.  I added a comment, not an answer.  As a moderator I can do more than down vote - but there was no point from my perspective. I offered a comment suggesting that these two things should not mix.  So I am obviously not going to spend time trying to solve the issue for you - just the same as I would tell you to remove the handlebars from the car and use a steering wheel.</p>

							<div><p>Its sad you keep missing my original point. I&#39;m not interested in using AngularJS. What I&#39;m interested is in implementing IoC in Titanium. Is this possible? If AngularJS is not the way to go to achieve that specific task, I understand. But are there any other alternatives? Maybe a specific technical explanation of why you discourage DI in Titanium without providing analogies please?</p>

							<div><p>Last time I comment until you raise your game and drop the attitude and indignation.  </p>
<p>My name appears on the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;top-100-experts">experts list</a> take a look and see if you can find it.  I tell you this not to brag but to point out that I have and do help many people get out out of problems and to find new ways to do things.</p>
<p>Your original question fell flat on several points;</p>
<ul>
<li>You asked if you could use AngularJs to solve your problem</li>
<li>The remaining parts of the question all related to web based principles</li>
<li>You added as many phrases you could think in order to make it appear that you knew a great deal on this subject (you may very well do) but at the expense of gaining an answer.</li>
<li>You never actually asked a question that would give you the answer, you still have not.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your original point is right there in the title &quot;AngularsJS&quot; you followed that up with a question that is a natural follow on on how the use of such a solution could be performed with AngularJS.</p>
<p>I use analogies as it often makes it easier for people to understand, for example &quot;gift horse and mouth&quot; - one you are missing here.  But more importantly - you are not the only one who will review this question and it makes it easier for all people.</p>
<p>So try rewording your question into one that gain the actual answer you wish.  What are you trying to actually achieve - the end result - not the suggested path of your own.  What problem do you have or what simplification are you attempting to gain.  Do not link this with a suggestions of could I use this or that if they are not mobile based solutions and if they are only afterwards as an attempt to determine if an existing thought process you may have should be investigated further.</p>
<p>By starting off with AngularJS is where you are going with this and then the solution must fit that - does not help your cause - for the very same reasons I started with.</p>
<p>If your ACTUAL question boils down to not needing to place so many  &quot;if platform == android &#x2F; ios&quot; in your MOBILE code - then state that - but that turns it into a very different question.  As does the note about using app.js as that points the person giving an answer to the fact you are not using Alloy.</p>
<p>So drop the &quot;I can use big words without actually saying what I want to ACTUALLY achieve&quot;, stop offering up unrelated technology suggestions unless you give context.</p>
<p>You will gain an answer - you just have to ask the question that states the ACTUAL problem you wish to solve.</p>
