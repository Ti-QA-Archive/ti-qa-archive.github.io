			<h1>Appicon not showing up in Simulator no matter where you store it</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi guys!  I created a nice appicon.png and put it in the Resources&#x2F;iPhone location, but it&#39;s not showing up in the Simulator.</p>
<p>Similarly, I tried putting it in the build&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;Resources and that didn&#39;t work either.</p>
<p>I took another thread&#39;s advice and deleted the contents of the build&#x2F;iphone directory and let it build from scratch. It just populates the folder with the default titanium icon, and then doesn&#39;t use them when running.</p>
<p>There might be a bug.  If you clear out the build, and then go and change the info.plist, putting your appicon in there, it saves fine, but the next time Titanium Developer runs your app, it overwrites the info.plist with the template.  So, it seems, in essence you can&#39;t put your icon in the emulator. </p>
<p>This might work fine on the iPhone though.</p>
<p>This is a terribly frustrating bug.  I&#39;m about ready to package and I can&#39;t get the simple icon to display!</p>

							<p>When you create your project in titanium developer there&#39;s a field for the app icon.<br>By default it is set to: default_app_logo.png (which is a larger image)<br>I updated that image with my icon and it worked.. but I think there might be a bug, because I tried changing the path to another image, and it still uses that one.</p>
<p>Sometimes try emptying the build&#x2F;iphone folder and try again</p>

										<p><p>Daniel that was the trick!  THANK YOU!  There was so many bad answers out there that I was going in circles.  What worked was to put the icon in the project as you suggested, but then clear the whole project out (build&#x2F;iphone) and let it re-build. This solved the problem!</p>
