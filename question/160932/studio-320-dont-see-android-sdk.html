							<p>I had this problem and tried everything above.  nothing worked.  then got a clue from JIRA bug TIMOB-15504.  </p>
<p>It appears the installation either caused a bad AVD file (Android Virtual Device), or the new version simply can&#39;t handle a bad one.     Open the android Virtual Device Manager.  If there is a bad config there delete it (that&#39;s what worked for me).  </p>
<p>It appears from the defect that you may need at least one defined.   So try removing them all and recreating them.  You may want to make a backup first.  The AVD configuration files on LINUX are .&#x2F;android&#x2F;avd</p>

										<p><p>Yes you are missing something. API Level 5 does exist. Just check in the Android SDK Manager as I described it. After discovering this, I have installed Titanium Studio many many times with success. Just read my instructions carefully and it should be fine.</p>
<p>Just for your information, the latest Android API level is &quot;API Level 19 rev 2&quot;. So unless I don&#39;t know how to count, the number 5 comes long before number 19.</p>
<p>You have to just throw all of your assumptions out through the window and trust the word of those who did it. It&#39;s won&#39;t matter how often you uninstall and do a clean install. What matters is if the API Level 5 is installed of not. I have done this on MAC OS Mountain Lion, Maverick, Windows 8, etc. just name it.</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t believe that API Level 5 does exist, then <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;imagebin.org&#x2F;288878">look at this image and see for yourself</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond that and the explanation I have already given, if you still can&#39;t make it work, than your problem is due to something else, which I highly doubt because you are not even acknowledging the existence of something that does exist.</p>

										<p><p>seriously studio &gt; 3.2.0 make me cry<br>you were right, api 5 exist but doesn&#39;t matter if it installed or no…<br>studio say that android sdk is ok (green) if no devices connected and even give to start emulator, but it died before emulator start and next with already run emulator it say &quot;no emulators&quot;…</p>
<p>how that possible, on the same machine, studio 3.1.3 works well and 3.2.0 with all that….</p>

							<p>It&#39;s working for me now. This is what I found:</p>
<p>I had a &#x2F;opt folder with only Imagemagick installed in it but it was owned by root and had permissions: 700</p>
<p>When I did </p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-label">sudo</span> chmod -R <span class="hljs-number">755</span> /<span class="hljs-preprocessor">opt</span>
</code></pre><p>My SDK was detected (after restart Studio). And no, I didn&#39;t install the Android SDK in &#x2F;opt but for some reasons it searches there? I don&#39;t think I had it in my PATH.</p>
<p>BTW this is on osx Mavericks</p>
<p>I hope this helps some others</p>
