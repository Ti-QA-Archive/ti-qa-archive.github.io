		<section>
			<p>Hello, i am currently trying to include a file within an included file and am trying to access the variables, but I get an undefined exception.</p>
<p>Take the following example:</p>
<p>file 1:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> level1 = {};
Titanium.<span class="hljs-keyword">include</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"file2.js"</span>);
</code></pre><p>file 2:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-list">()</span><span class="hljs-collection">{
    level1.level2 = <span class="hljs-collection">{}</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

    Titanium.include<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-string">"file3.js"</span>)</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

    <span class="hljs-collection">[...]</span>
    tableView.addEventListener<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">'click'</span>, function<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">e</span>)</span> <span class="hljs-collection">{
        level1.level2.level3.getFunctionResult<span class="hljs-list">()</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    }</span>)</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
}</span>)</span><span class="hljs-list">()</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>file3:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-list">()</span><span class="hljs-collection">{
    level1.level2.level3 = <span class="hljs-collection">{}</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

    <span class="hljs-collection">[...]</span>
    level1.level2.level3.getFunctionResult = function<span class="hljs-list">()</span><span class="hljs-collection">{
        //View creation
    }</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
}</span>)</span><span class="hljs-list">()</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>On file2.js I get an error that level1.level2.level3 undefined is and can therefore not run my getFunctionResult Function…</p>
<p>Has anybody some insight on how I could solve my problem?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

							<p>Trevor, it&#39;s not true lazy loading since including happens inside self-invoking function - that means, it&#39;s executed immediately after creation, therefore file is included immediately (and not &quot;on demand&quot;). That&#39;s not so important here, but it&#39;s technically correct.</p>
<p>Anyway, if Alfredo is using Android, code shouldn&#39;t work since Android doesn&#39;t support including files in functions (yet). That said, solution is to move all &quot;Ti.include&quot;s outside self-invoking function since there is no difference anyway. Other workaround is to use CommonJS approach, since it works well in functions and it&#39;s relatively easily to transit from namespace-based pattern to CommonJS pattern (there are still some unresolved issues with global variables). If you need help with that, please let me know.</p>

										<p><p>I haven&#39;t tested CommonJS since I find it brings unwanted complexity to the program structure.<br>I will therefore move the &quot;Ti.includes&quot; outside the functions, which should solve my problem (which I still haven&#39;t tested)</p>
<p>I will mark your answer as the best one, since I wasn&#39;t aware (since it is not documented???) that one cannot include files within function whilst using Android.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

										<p><p>No, it&#39;s not documented (as far as I know), it works fine on iOS, so it&#39;s basically a bug that will be resolved in future SDK versions (there is opened ticket in JIRA that addresses that). Funny thing it that &quot;require&quot; works fine inside functions on Android.</p>
<p>In the case you are developing large application, maybe you should think about CommonJS approach because after some time application can load very slowly due to must-to-preload everything constraint on Android.</p>

										<p><p>I was going to ask about the &quot;require&quot;-function as well. Glad you cleared that up.<br>The thing is that if the &quot;includes&quot; are going to be fixed in near future releases, then the complexity I was talking about with CommonJS will be unnecessary… so I rather continue using the &quot;global&quot; includes (since my application is not that large)</p>
<p>Thank you for your input.</p>

							<p>Actually include will probably always cause the issues you are having. You have setup a namespace to include your functions in. This is good which should in theory enable you to access your functions from anywhere.</p>
<p>I am going to guess your using android.. as this lazy loads included files.</p>
<p>The solution for android is to include the files in your app.js file. but this does not really work if you have a lot of files. It should work ok on IOS</p>
<p>So if your intention is to have files contain functions which you want to load when needed then it is probably better to use the commonJS solution. This does enable you to load files on the fly on IOS and android.</p>
<p>The titanium coomonJS docs can be found.</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;CommonJS+in+Titanium</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>T.</p>

							<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I&#39;m not an expert to say this but.. i have no problems using the &quot;exports and require&quot; functions instead of &quot;Ti.include&quot;.. I am developing Android Application and using this always..<br>here is some post i answer regarding with this matter…</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;128659&#x2F;pass-by-reference-from-one-window-to-a-new-one-does-not-seem-to-work</p>
<p>I really dont know if im doing &quot;best practice&quot; that titanium docs want.. but as far as i code in titanium for 2 weeks.. i experienced memory leaks and this kind of approach save me… </p>
<p>I hope you get all my point.. since im just a newbie here and still learning…<br>CodeStrong folks… =)</p>
