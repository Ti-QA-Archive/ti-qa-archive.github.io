			<h1>Packaging distribution IPA using clients Certificate and Profile</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>We have been developing an iOS app for a client using our own apple certificate and profile. Our client has now supplied their own Certificate and Profile so we can build final distribution app. Titanium only seems to create a xarchive file and opens it in Xcode. The client needs an IPA, they don&#39;t have Xcode, they don&#39;t even have Macs. How can I create a distribution IPA using clients Certificate and Profile?</p>

							<p>Hello, do you want .ipa for distibution on app store :-</p>
<p>Than follow this steps:-</p>
<ul>
<li>For Submission you must use Distribution certificate.</li>
<li>When you build Using Distribute from Titanium it just opens Xcode.</li>
<li>Now navigate to Windows -&gt; Organizer.</li>
<li>Archives tab will show you the list of Archives that were generated during your previous builds, so choose the one with the latest Date&#x2F;time.</li>
<li>Selecting the Latest Archive will display 3 buttons at the top(don&#39;t worry if you Don&#39;t see your App icon).</li>
<li>First we must validate the App.</li>
<li>During validation it will ask you for your Apple Developer Credentials and the bundle identifier for the App.</li>
<li>It will verify this against the ones that you entered on the itunes connect portal.</li>
<li>After Successful validation you can Either Share for Ad-hoc Distribution or Submit the App.</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>Thanks for the quick response. Yes, we need ipa for distribution on Apple App Store.<br>The Distribution certificate belongs to the client, they won&#39;t want to give me their login details, they are a large company with many suppliers. So, I can&#39;t validate it in Xcode. My developer login won&#39;t work if the app is built using the clients certificate and profile. They will need to submit it themselves, so I need to supply IPA signed with their certificate.<br>Any more ideas?</p>

							<p>Thanks Moiz and Nikhil for your responses but I&#39;m still stuck.<br>Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve done so far.</p>
<ul>
<li>Installed clients Certificate in Keychain</li>
<li>Built app using the installed client certificate and supplied Profile, Publish &gt; Distribute - Apple App Store</li>
<li>This built without errors and opens in Xcode Organiser - but it&#39;s a xarchive file not an ipa.</li>
</ul>
<p>I need an ipa for the client to do the App Store submission. I can&#39;t do the validation or submission because it was built using client certificate, for which I don&#39;t have the password. The client can&#39;t validate and submit from Xcode as they don&#39;t have Xcode - they&#39;re not programmers.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t really want to go down the Xcode route as we will have quite a few of these apps to build and not all our developers are familiar with Xcode.</p>
<p>Sorry to be repetitive, I&#39;m just making sure I haven&#39;t missed anything.</p>
<p>Any more ideas?</p>

							<p>Install your client&#39;s Certificates and Profile on your mac. Then from titanium studio: in the sidebar, above your project browser, there should be a box like icon. Clicking on that shall reveal two options: Package for Ad-hoc and package for submitting to the App Store. Select the option that applies to you. This will create a .ipa file for you. </p>
<p>If that doesn&#39;t work out for you, Titanium creates a .xcode file under the build folder. Open the xcode project and then follow this: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;diaryofacodemonkey.ruprect.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;03&#x2F;18&#x2F;ad-hoc-app-distribution-with-xcode-4&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;diaryofacodemonkey.ruprect.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;03&#x2F;18&#x2F;ad-hoc-app-distribution-with-xcode-4&#x2F;</a></p>

							<p>To follow on from the diaryofacodemonkey suggestion, I have Xcode 4.3.x where there is no &#39;Share&#39; button - only Validate and Distribute.</p>
<p>If I click &#39;Distribute&#39;, then &#39;Save for Enterprise or Ad-Hoc Deployment&#39;, can the client use this saved ipa for App Store submission?</p>

										<p><p>Negative. That build is only for ad-hoc or enterprise distribution, as mentioned. </p>
<p>As the article mentions, you must archive your project. The project, post archiving, can be packaged into an .ipa<br>The share button will appear in Organizer, not the Xcode (developement) window. cmd + shift +2 to bring that window up.</p>

										<p><p>This is weird. Try validating it first. If that doesn&#39;t work, then sorry, but I can&#39;t help you further. This is beyond my scope. Maybe a titan could help you out from here.</p>

							<p>The workaround in this stackoverflow post seems to work:<br><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;9762068&#x2F;no-share-button-in-organizer">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;9762068&#x2F;no-share-button-in-organizer</a><br>I&#39;m on Xcode 4.3, so no more SHARE button. The above workaround let me choose the client&#39;s Distribution Certificate and Distribution Provisioning Profile to generate the .ipa from the archive. Hopefully, this won&#39;t cause any problems on the Application Loader &#x2F; iTunes Connect end of things.</p>
