			<h1>Files in resources directory deleted upon run</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>It doesn&#39;t seem to matter what type of file I add to my app&#39;s resources director, as soon as I choose Run to test the app in the simulator, all new files in the resources directory vanish. It&#39;s as if the Resources directory is being reverted back to its original form when I created the project, every time I run the app.</p>
<p>The files really do seem to vanish, too. I can&#39;t find them anywhere once they disappear from the directory.</p>
<p>Any idea how I can stop this from happening?</p>
<p>Mobile app - iOS 7.1<br>CLI version 3.2.1, Titanium SDK version 3.2.2.GA<br>Host system is OS X 10.9.2</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>If, this is an alloy project, you shouldn&#39;t be touching anything in the Resources directory. Resource directory in alloy contains generated files that are then built into the native binary.</p>
<p>If this is a classical project, well, your system is borked because this is abnormal behavior.</p>

										<p><p>Ah ha, thank you. It is an Alloy project. In case other people stumble upon this, I put my normal &quot;Resources&quot; files in app&#x2F;assets&#x2F;[device]&#x2F; and then access the file as if it&#39;s in &#x2F;Resources, with Ti.Filesystem.resourcesDirectory.</p>

										<p><p>Its a new way of thinking. If you came from a classic background, or are looking at older tutorials, easy enough to get confused.</p>
<p>Try porting an older project over!  We rename Resources to Resources.classic  I find myself every once in a while looking at the wrong file too.</p>
