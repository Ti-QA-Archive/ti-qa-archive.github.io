			<h1>Java Exception on imageAsThumbnail</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey,<br>I&#39;m having this wierd problem. I want my app to have the possibility to upload images. That is not too hard. I have a window with a little form in it that allows you to select an image from your phone (after you click on an &quot;add attachment&quot; button, the photogallery opens up). If you click the button again, you can select another file and so on. There is no limit to the amount of pictures you can select. After you have selected an image, the image is converted to a thumbnail, en the thumbnail is displayed on screen. Then I store the nativepath of the image (not the image itself). When the &quot;Send&quot; button is clicked, the images are sent (using the nativepath) to the server, wich handles the rest. That all works fine and there is no problem. When all the images are sent, everything gets nullified and the window closes. On top of that, I clear the cache of the app.</p>
<p>The problem is: when I open the same window again, the form displays and I can click the &quot;add attachment&quot; button. When I do, the photogallery opens up and I select an image. The photogallery closes, and there is no thumbnail being shown. It says &quot;Java Exception Occurred&quot;. </p>
<p>At first i thought it was a  memory problem, but the problem occurred again after clearing the cache etc. The strange thing is: this problem only occurs after you have sent some images once (and veryveryvery some times twice or three times). After that you can restart the app but the problem will occur again.</p>
<p>If I go to my phone&#39;s applicationmanagement after uploading total 5MB worth of images, it sais that the app uses 772KB data. the cache memory is 684KB. I can clear the cache, but the problem will still occur. I can clear the app data, and I can upload images again (once). I tried clearing the applicationdata in code, but that doesnt work. it only works if I do it in the settings on my phone…</p>

							<div><p>Found out that it happens only with HD pictures. Changed the camera resolution to something not-HD, but the users of the app wil not know that… So if they only have HD pictures on their phones they will only be able to upload pictures once. Thats not what i want.</p>
