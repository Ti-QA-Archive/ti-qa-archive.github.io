							<p>I understand your desire to have people help you out with your coding issue.</p>
<p>However you question, as so many recently is more about people providing you with the solution.</p>
<p>The people who are here to help spend their time and energy freely and openly. Quite often going out of their way to resolve really awkward programming issues.</p>
<p>In this case I do not feel that you are asking for help, if you have tried to resolve this and have a code base for us to look at, we would more than happily look and try and resolve a specific issue with your code.</p>
<p>This and the other question which just ask for a solution really should not appear here, but be put onto a freelancers website where you may employ the services of a titanium programmer to help you develop your application.</p>
<p>The titanium community is awesome with a lot of really nice and helpful people, but please consider that we also work for a living.</p>
<p>I hope that this response does not offend you and you see the issue with just asking for us to code your application.</p>
<p>T…</p>
