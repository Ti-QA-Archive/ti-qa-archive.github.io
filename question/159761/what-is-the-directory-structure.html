			<h1>What is the directory structure?</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Specifically, where does the lib directory go?</p>
<p>If we look at the readme file in the &#x2F;views folder we get this text:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Here's how your Alloy directory <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> laid out.

models              your model files go here
controllers         your controllers files go here
views               yep, <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> views go here. you're getting <span class="hljs-keyword">it</span>
styles              your style (.tss) files <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> your views go here
assets              All files here will be deployed <span class="hljs-keyword">into</span> Resources

Folders <span class="hljs-keyword">not</span> generated <span class="hljs-keyword">by</span> Alloy automatically, <span class="hljs-keyword">but</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> developer can create <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> use.

lib                 <span class="hljs-keyword">put</span> your own libraries here <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> use require('<span class="hljs-property">name</span>') <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> load <span class="hljs-keyword">it</span>
migrations            generated model migrations go here
widgets                pre-built, reusable components <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> your Ally apps.
</code></pre><p>What the readme DOESNT say is where these three folders go… inference would dictate they would go under the &#x2F;app folder along with models, controllers, views etc.</p>
<p>As a side note, I&#39;m finding the documentation for this platform to be sorely lacking… so much so as to be completely valueless.</p>

							<p>All your development files (with a couple of configuration-related folders) go in the app directory. Thus, lib goes inside app. However, you reference files as if they were in the root of your project.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-regexp">//</span> file <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> actually <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> /app/lib/mylibrary.js
var mylib = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'mylibrary'</span>);
</code></pre><p>This is documented at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Alloy_Concepts-section-34636240_AlloyConcepts-ConventionoverConfiguration">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Alloy_Concepts-section-34636240_AlloyConcepts-ConventionoverConfiguration</a> </p>
<p>As a side note, the docs are great. You should have seen them 3 years ago when I started with Titanium.</p>

										<p><p>I agree with @Tims note, the docs are now great.  The properties methods and events are all documented - there are hundreds of videos, the Q&amp;A here has a rich supply of answers to questions including example code in many cases.</p>
<p>If you are hoping to learn everything in 30 seconds then that is not possible and nor should it be.  Mobile apps are complex undertakings of new technology.  They involve using distinct user interface guidelines for each platform and within each platform most have at least two distinct styles that require knowledge of how to work well with them.</p>
<p>There are no short cuts to be had, but if you take the time your experiences and expertise will jump through using Titanium and at a massive speed.</p>
<p>You have come from PhoneGap which whilst a good platform does not have half the abilities as Titanium does - much of what you will come to use is built by others as third-party modules for which there is a rich availability for - most of which are free.</p>
<p>Keep going - you will not regret it.</p>

										<p><p>@Tim, I tried hitting that link but there was no response from the server… thought it might have been a bad link.</p>
<p>@Malcomb, I&#39;m not looking for 30 seconds. I&#39;m spending a lot of time reading, watching videos and trying to wrap my head around Titanium before writing the 1st line of usable code.  I&#39;m playing with small concepts like sqlite and ajax… trying to get those components working and then I can move on actual &quot;work&quot; - LOL</p>

							<p>Hi Phil…. All the directories listed above and the &quot;lib&quot; directory go in the &quot;app&quot; directory. When you run your app it will create the &quot;Resources&quot; directory and build your app in there.</p>

										<p><p>There are a few <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;search?q=appcelerator+alloy">videos here</a> that got me going. Also creating a DEFAULT alloy project sets up this structure for you.</p>
