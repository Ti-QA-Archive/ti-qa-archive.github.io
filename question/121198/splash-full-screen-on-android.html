			<p>Hi, folks. I saw that many people wish full splash screen in your app. Aparently the only way to do this is change theme.xml in build\android folder. However, any change in this file is lost when Titanium rebuild app. I figured out one way to resolve this problem.<br>1) Create folders &lt;your project&gt;\platform\android\res\values (see KitchenSink folder structure)<br>2) Put in folder &quot;values&quot; the file theme.xml modifyed (i.e. )</p>
<p>Done! When Titanium rebuild the app it will put your costumized theme.xml in the build folder. This is working fine with me. I use mobile SDK 1.7.0 and Android SDK 2.2 and 2.3.3.</p>

							<p>Thanks for the tip Jose, but man, why did no one at Appecelerator take the time to document this?</p>
<p>This is becoming an issue, same goes for JSS. And don&#39;t even get me started on API properties or methods that have no doc whatsoever. And they don&#39;t let anyone but the Appcelerator team edit those docs. I understand <em>why</em> they enforce this, but from the outside, it looks like there is too much work to do on the documentation side of things for their team to catch up.</p>
<p>Sorry for the rant, but I needed to get this off my chest. don&#39;t want to sound like an ingrate jerk or anything. And I really appreciate all the hard work Appecelerator has done.</p>

										<p><p>It looks like this was a bug that had previously been fixed.  Is it bugged again, or was this an intentional change (mine was full screen until I moved from 1.6 to 1.7).  Anyone know?</p>
