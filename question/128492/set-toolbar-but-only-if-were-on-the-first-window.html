			<h1>Set toolbar but only if we&#39;re on the first window</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>
<h2 id="here-39-s-the-situation-using-1-8-api-only-targetting-ios-">Here&#39;s the situation (using 1.8 API only targetting iOS):</h2>
<ol>
<li>I have a toolbar on the main screen (created in app.js). This toolbar has a refresh button which the user can click.</li>
<li>I listen for the &quot;resume&quot; event on Ti.App, and when this is fired I put an activity indicator on the toolbar, call my web service, and hide the activity indicator when I get a response.</li>
</ol>
<p>This means that when the user launches the app it checks for updates from my web service. This is similar to the Mail app on iPhone.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-">The problem:</h2>
<p>If the user resumes the app and they were not on the main screen then <strong>a blank toolbar appears at the bottom of their current window</strong>. </p>
<p>The reason seems to be that the function I am calling from my &quot;resume&quot; event handler is setting the toolbar on the main screen window, but because the user is not on that window the toolbar pops up on their current window. </p>
<p><strong>There are no errors displayed in the console.</strong></p>
<h2 id="i-have-tried-">I have tried:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Checking Ti.UI.currentWindow (but this is null in the resume event and app.js).</li>
<li>Checking if the window or various elements are on screen, but can&#39;t figure out how.</li>
<li>Adding &quot;open&quot; and &quot;close&quot; event handlers to the window (but these aren&#39;t fired when the app is resumed).</li>
</ul>
<p>The crux of the matter is that the <code>win</code> variable gets properly captured into the scope of the event handler, but using win.setToolbar actually displays the toolbar on whatever window the user is currently on.</p>
<p>Any ideas? Is this a bug?</p>

							<p>you could have each window respond to a custom event you fire on resume to update your data, if that window is the front window, the window with focus, then have it draw the toolbar with the activity indicator</p>

										<p><p>Hi Aaron, thanks for answering. When you say &quot;if the window is the front window&quot;, do you mean there is a way to check if a window is frontmost? I just haven&#39;t seen anything for that in the documentation.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that I only want to put the activity indicator on the root window. The reason for this is that the sub windows don&#39;t have toolbars to save space while displaying the content. So, I would need to know when my update function finishes that we&#39;re on the root screen with the toolbar. I&#39;m thinking that I may need to add some custom code to keep track of the window stack, though I had hoped to avoid that and this will not account for all cases such as a modal displayed over the root window.</p>
<p>Is keeping a custom window stack the best way to know we&#39;re on the root window?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the follow-up Aaron. When the app resumes from the background no window receives a focus event, so I guess I&#39;ll listen to the focus event for each window and keep track of which is in front.</p>

										<p><p>As a follow up, what I did was:</p>
<p>&#x2F;&#x2F;When the app loads<br>win.isInFocus = true;</p>
<ul>
<li><code>win.addEventListener(&amp;#39;open&amp;#39;, function(){win.isInFocus = true;})</code></li>
<li><code>win.addEventListener(&amp;#39;close&amp;#39;, function(){win.isInFocus = false;})</code></li>
<li><code>tableView.addEventListener(&amp;#39;click&amp;#39;, function(){win.isInFocus = false; ...open sub window...})</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially I&#39;m manually keeping track of whether the window is in focus, but because there aren&#39;t that many ways to leave the main window (close the app, click a table row, open modal settings window) it isn&#39;t too much work.</p>
