			<h1>Database is empty after install()</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am porting a small mobile app to iPhone that is working fine on Android, using 1.8.1 and current iOS sdk. The sqlite database does not seem to install correctly on the iPhone simulator. Accessing any table generates sql errors. And looking in the Apple local filesystem, I find a file of the proper name, with &#39;sql&#39; appended to it, but it is always 0 bytes length.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> maindb = Titanium.Database.install(<span class="hljs-string">'/database/data.db'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'main'</span>);
myapp.db = Titanium.Database.open(<span class="hljs-string">'main'</span>);
</code></pre><p>The path is verified, and valid (works on Android). This results in a local file called called &#39;main.sql&#39; but it is empty. The database folder in my source is a subfolder of Resources. </p>
<p>I have &#39;clean&#39; the project a number of times, manually removed the empty file, and reset the iPhone simulator. Is there anything else? What silly thing am I missing?</p>

							<div><p>The build log has no errors (that I can find). I do notice something very interesting though … when the build creates the database for the simulator it is putting it somewhere very different from what I found in a wiki or blog post on the subject. I followed that, which was a symlink to the correct file in Resources&#x2F;database. That all looks perfectly fine. I wonder if the simulator is botching things up?</p>

							<p>For the record, I eventually was able to create the default database structure manually, and populate it with some default values. My initial attempt at this failed because of the way I was handling the COMMIT, which generated an error. I still don&#39;t know why I never could get a default database installed with the install() method.</p>

							<p>If Ti.Database.install finds a database already installed as &#39;main&#39;, it will act like Ti.Database.open and open it, and not rewrite.  Cleaning your build won&#39;t remove it.</p>
<p>If you want to get rid of that database, you could either reference a new name, like main2, or just delete the app on the simulator the same as with a device by doing a long press on the icon and then clicking the x.  This will remove all the local data.  The next time you run Ti.Database.install it will install whatever is located at the path provided.</p>

										<p><p>Hmmm…I had been deleting the file created in the local filesystem for the db, thinking that would do flush all the caching. I did occasionally clear and reset the simulator via the menu options. But I&#39;ll bet its caching that in memory too. I&#39;ll have to wait until tomorrow to try that out. Thanks for the heads up!</p>

										<p><p>I have deleted the app from the simulator, and did everything I could to start with a clean build. I&#39;ve tried a number of variations, including crossing my fingers. I get the same results no matter what changes I make (I did not try the rename thing since there are references scattered all over the place). </p>
<p>I cannot access any tables in the database. See my answer to Minh about where the actual database is that the simulator is using. Maybe that is a clue. All the build stuff looks perfectly fine to me. Yet the simulator is having problems. I am totally stumped and eating up the clock on this.</p>

										<p><p>I am either missing something really basic, or going mad. I tried renaming the database. No go with that idea. Same results.</p>
<p>So I thought its not that much, I&#39;ll create it with sql statements and get on with my life. But that is not working EITHER! </p>
<p>Will some kind soul PLEASE tell me what is wrong with this attempt to create a database and add one table to it! The alert at the end always show zero. Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>I have checked. In fact, the sqlite statements I am using were generated from a dump of the original Resources&#x2F;database&#x2F;data.db file using sqliteman on Linux. The contents of the orginal data file are fine.  And they have worked fine on Android for well over a year. I have also tested individual sql statements from the dump that create these tables using sqlite3 (also on Linux), and they do indeed create tables … at least with the native sqlite3 command line utility.</p>
<p>The only Ti error I got with the original dump had to do with the COMMIT statement. The google answer was to close the database before doing the COMMIT. That quieted the error, but now sounds counter intuitive, and probably needs a second look (but I am away from my only iOS system until Monday). I am not really up to speed on the differences of sqlite vs mysql.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>Good catch … but the actual db creation stuff is much longer and in a separate file. I just pasted a snippet. myapp.db and db should point to the same object. Just to be sure I tried changing all those references to just db. </p>
<p>The close() thing seemed to be required by COMMIT. That&#39;s <em>why</em> that&#39;s there. I added an open() statement after that just now. But, sadly, I get the same results. Still suffering …</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">db = Titanium.Database.open('main'); 
db.execute("<span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">count</span>(*) <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> sqlite_master <span class="hljs-keyword">WHERE</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">type</span> = <span class="hljs-string">'table'</span><span class="hljs-string">");
alert( 'New Data: ' + db.rowsAffected)</span></span>
</code></pre><p>Thanks a lot for the interest and help!</p>
