			<h1>Using Basic Authentication in WebView will never load the page</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to show a web page which requires basic authentication. For some reason using:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var webView = Ti.UI.createWebView()<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
webView.setBasicAuthentication(username,password)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
webView.url = 'http://myurl'<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>never shows the final page. the web view simply shows an empty page with the loading indicator spinning forever.</p>
<p>However using:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> webView</span> = Ti.UI.createWebView();
webView.url = 'http:<span class="hljs-comment">//username:password@myurl';</span>
</code></pre><p>seems to work just fine. I would prefer authenticating the user using the request header as shown in the first code snippet. Any idea what the problem could be?</p>

							<div><p>I have the same issue on iOS: using <code>setBasicAuthentication</code> just causes the WebView to spin its wheels forever when loading the page. Using the https:&#x2F;&#x2F;user:pass@site&#x2F; syntax works, just as @Falko Schulz reported.</p>
<p>This is pretty lame - it&#39;s generally considered a fairly serious security issue to pass credentials in the URL, because anyone snooping the connection can see them and they are also recorded on the server side in log files, if logging is enabled. This is not an issue with credentials in the request header as long as TLS&#x2F;SSL is being used.</p>
<p>This basically means that WebView can&#39;t be securely used with a HTTPS site that requires Basic Authentication. Is it possible to manually set request headers on a WebView request before it&#39;s sent? Alternatively, does anyone have a different workaround for this issue?</p>

							<div><p>I wrote a small app to dig into what&#39;s going on here. I tested both on the simulator and on an iPhone, with the same results.</p>
<p>It appears as though when a request is made with basic authentication over HTTPS, the <code>load</code> event on the WebView is never fired, nor is the <code>error</code> event (I see the <code>beforeload</code> event though). </p>
<p>It thus appears to be a crap shoot as to whether the content gets rendered. If I examine the <code>html</code> property of the WebView some time after setting the <code>url</code> of the page, I can see that the HTML is present and correct, it&#39;s just that it&#39;s not rendering it for some reason (perhaps connected to the <code>load</code> event not getting fired).</p>
<p>Setting the <code>html</code> property of the WebView to itself starts rendering the content - the problems then are that I have no way of knowing when the HTML from the server is actually finished downloading to the client, and also that relative URIs within the document fail to load (it thinks they should be in the app directory, of course).</p>
<p>My next attempt will be to use <code>HTTPClient</code> to retrieve the initial page, then do a <code>setBasicAuthentication</code> on the WebView and set its <code>html</code> property to be the downloaded content from <code>HTTPClient</code>. I imagine this will cause some issues with relative URIs embedded in the HTML, though.</p>

							<p>I finally had a chance to dig into this properly today.</p>
<p>At least part of the issue here is that <code>setBasicAuthentication</code> simply saves the credentials you supply for the WebView, and includes them in the the request header for any subsequent requests you make with the WebView. This works as long as the page is a simple page, but if it contains any other resources (e.g. CSS or JS files, or images) which are also protected, then the underlying <code>UIWebView</code> will request those resources without credentials (simply because Titanium isn&#39;t in the loop at that point and so the credentials aren&#39;t injected into the header), which will fail. </p>
<p>Similarly, AJAX requests to protected resources from within the original page will fail, because the AJAX request will be made without credentials.</p>
<p>The answer is to use <code>NSURLCredential</code> and <code>NSURLProtectionSpace</code> to handle credentials correctly for the underlying <code>UIWebView</code> object. Any example for this is given at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;3919181&#x2F;533676">this StackOverflow answer</a>, which in turn links to an <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;ios&#x2F;#documentation&#x2F;MediaPlayer&#x2F;Reference&#x2F;MPMoviePlayerController_Class&#x2F;MPMoviePlayerController&#x2F;MPMoviePlayerController.html">Apple-supplied example</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s how I implemented this: I modified <code>TiUIWebView.m</code> and <code>TiUIWebViewProxy.m</code> to include an additional method called <code>addCredentials()</code> which takes 6 arguments (!), the username, password, hostname (or IP address), port number, protocol (i.e. &quot;http&quot; or &quot;https&quot;) and the authentication realm (when a server responds with a 401 status requiring authentication from the user, it usually includes a &quot;realm&quot; which is essentially some context for the user - it&#39;s frequently simply the hostname of the server, and you&#39;ll see it in authentication dialogs in web browsers). The only other argument which I could add would be the authentication method, but for now I simply require Basic authentication (over HTTPS) so I left that as hardcoded.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the method I added to <code>TiUIWebView.m</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">-(<span class="hljs-keyword">void</span>)addCredentials:(<span class="hljs-built_in">NSArray</span>*)args
{
    E<span class="hljs-built_in">NSURE_ARG_COUNT</span>(args,<span class="hljs-number">6</span>);
    <span class="hljs-built_in">NSString</span> *username = [args objectAtIndex:<span class="hljs-number">0</span>];
    <span class="hljs-built_in">NSString</span> *password = [args objectAtIndex:<span class="hljs-number">1</span>];
    <span class="hljs-built_in">NSString</span> *host = [args objectAtIndex:<span class="hljs-number">2</span>];
    <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span>      port = [[args objectAtIndex:<span class="hljs-number">3</span>] integerValue];
    <span class="hljs-built_in">NSString</span> *protocol = [args objectAtIndex:<span class="hljs-number">4</span>];
    <span class="hljs-built_in">NSString</span> *realm = [args objectAtIndex:<span class="hljs-number">5</span>];

    <span class="hljs-built_in">NSURLCredential</span> *credential = [[<span class="hljs-built_in">NSURLCredential</span> alloc]
                            initWithUser: username
                                password: password
                             persistence: <span class="hljs-built_in">NSURLCredentialPersistenceForSession</span>];

    <span class="hljs-built_in">NSURLProtectionSpace</span> *protectionSpace = [[<span class="hljs-built_in">NSURLProtectionSpace</span> alloc]
                                initWithHost: host
                                        port: port
                                    protocol: protocol
                                       realm: realm
                        authenticationMethod: <span class="hljs-built_in">NSURLAuthenticationMethodHTTPBasic</span>];

    [[<span class="hljs-built_in">NSURLCredentialStorage</span> sharedCredentialStorage]
                        setDefaultCredential: credential
                          forProtectionSpace: protectionSpace];

    [credential release];
    [protectionSpace release];    
}
</code></pre><p>Here&#39;s the proxy method I added to <code>TiUIWebViewProxy.m</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">-(<span class="hljs-typename">void</span>)<span class="hljs-string">addCredentials:</span>(NSArray*)args
{
    [self <span class="hljs-string">makeViewPerformSelector:</span><span class="hljs-annotation">@selector</span>(<span class="hljs-string">addCredentials:</span>) <span class="hljs-string">withObject:</span>args <span class="hljs-string">createIfNeeded:</span>YES <span class="hljs-string">waitUntilDone:</span>NO];
}
</code></pre><p>Both of these files can be found in your Titanium SDK (on my machine, it&#39;s in <code>~&amp;#x2F;Library&amp;#x2F;Application Support&amp;#x2F;Titanium&amp;#x2F;mobilesdk&amp;#x2F;osx&amp;#x2F;3.1.0.GA&amp;#x2F;iphone&amp;#x2F;Classes</code>).</p>
<p>After you make those changes, you should &quot;clean&quot; your build in the Titanium IDE so that your modified classes will be built from scratch.</p>
<p>Finally, here&#39;s an example of how to use it from Javascript:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    webview.addCredentials(<span class="hljs-string">"username"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"password"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"192.168.1.10"</span>, <span class="hljs-number">443</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"https"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"192.168.1.1"</span>);
    webview.url = <span class="hljs-string">"https://192.168.1.10/MySite/MyPage.html"</span>;
</code></pre><p>This completely solved the issue for me, because in my use case I know my credentials upfront. If you need instead to be notified when an authentication challenge is required, you will need to hook into <code>didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge</code> in the <code>UIWebView</code> and propagate an event up to the Titanium proxy.</p>
<p>I will look into whether this solution can be incorporated into the Titanium trunk.</p>

										<p><p>The code above is Objective C - I modified the Titanium SDK classes to handle authentication of the underlying UIWebView. I can&#39;t think of a way to do this purely in Javascript - the issue is with Titanium&#39;s implementation of TiUIWebView, and there&#39;s no way to easily extend its behavior in Javascript because the correct way to handle credentials is with the <code>NSURLCredential</code> Objective C classes as in my example above.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if this is an issue in the Android implementation of WebView - it may work fine there, because the Android implementation will be different.</p>
