			<h1>AAC streams</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m trying to create an iPhone player for a radio station (reinventing the wheel but it&#39;s a good learning curve). Ideally it should play the station&#39;s 96k aac stream but it doesn&#39;t seem the Titanium.Media.AudioPlayer can deal with the format which is a real pity. It bombs out with a &#39;fmt&#39; error.</p>
<p>Are there any plans to be able to play an aac stream in the near future?</p>

							<p>I would also like to be able to play an AAC stream, again, is this being worked on? AAC is used so often with Apple products it would make sense in my opinion if it could be included at some point?</p>

										<p><p>At the moment I am treading water. Nobody from Appcelerator seems to be a hurry to answer my initial question as to if aac will ever be supported. AAC is much better sounding than mp3 at lower bandwidths and would be a real pity to let it wither on the vine.</p>

										<p><p>Real bummer.  Wonder if they are answering questions to their members $2k&#x2F;year customers.  I&#39;d like to be a part of that club, but I would want to know that I would get some answers.  All of my clients are AAC stream only and this is a major hurdle for me.</p>

							<p>I have put an app together with Titanium that streams an AAC shoutcast using the following:</p>
<h2 id="for-ios">for iOS</h2>
<p>Use a videoPlayer and not audioPlayer:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var streamer = Ti.Media.createVideoPlayer({
                url : 'http://<span class="hljs-number">198.144.148.12</span>:8000/'
            })<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
            streamer.play()<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><h2 id="for-android">for Android</h2>
<p>audioPlayer or videoPlayer do not support AAC at all so I developed the following module:</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;5728</p>

										<p><p>The module is still available https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;5762.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can search on the Marketplace for &quot;Android Audio Streamer&quot;.</p>
