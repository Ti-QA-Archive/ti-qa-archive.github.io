			<h1>Github Module - Verification issue, unlicensed module(s)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hiya</p>
<p>I had found a module in the marketplace to allow for the rotate gesture called gesture recogniser but unfortunately it&#39;s now been removed when i went to purchase but it looks like the developer has also released the module as a &#39;skeleton&#39; version on github here:</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;atsusy&#x2F;Gesture-Recognizer</p>
<p>Now i followed the instructions on the readme file and built the project which created the module for me, when putting this into an app though i get the following error message and red screen:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Verification issue
Unlicensed module(s) detected.
You must be <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> subscriber <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> use <span class="hljs-constant">one</span> <span class="hljs-operator">or</span> more <span class="hljs-operator">of</span> <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> modules included <span class="hljs-operator">with</span> this project
</code></pre><p>Is there something i have missed to get this and how to i go about resolving the issue? Sorry i have no clue when it comes to github and modules so apologies if i am trying to use this in my app when i shouldn&#39;t but if anyone can help explain how and if i am allowed to get this working?</p>
<p>Thanks, </p>
<p>Lauren :)</p>
<p>p.s the original link for the marketplace link that is now not found is:<br>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;http-status&#x2F;?1894758329</p>

							<p>When building the project from source, change the project GUID. If the author&#39;s source code uses the same a was in the Marketplace, this explains the unlicensed problem you are experiencing.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Stephen, thank you for your response. Luckily the module on github has now been placed back onto marketplace where i downloaded from there and it now all works. Did however also try your solution on the github version and that works now, thank you :)</p>

<p>I changed the GUID to what was in my tiapp.xml file and it worked. Hopefully this helps someone as it took some time for me to figure out the unlicensed issue.</p>
