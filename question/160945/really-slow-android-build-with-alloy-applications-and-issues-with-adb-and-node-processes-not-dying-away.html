			<h1>Really slow Android build with Alloy applications and issues with adb and node processes not dying away</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>For some reason building my Alloy application for Android is ridiculously slow, first it freezes almost a the very beginning for ~110 seconds, and after it finally decides to continue it takes 2+min to build the project every time. The project is fairly small (2 controllers, a handful of small libraries). The speed seems to be about the same if I run it from the studio, or from CLI.</p>
<p>Alloy build itself takes only ~6 seconds, but after that it does a lot of other things (packaging, building java source files, running dexer, …) that seem to take quite a while. The copying and removing files to the android emulator seems to be fairly fast.</p>
<p>Where it freezes is right after the &quot;Found Titanium plugin&quot; -line in this:</p>

</code></pre><p>.. so it seems like for some reason searching for titanium&#39;s own components takes almost 2 minutes each time?</p>
<p>My computer should be more than capable of doing this in a reasonable time, it&#39;s a core i7 920 (overclocked) with 12GB of RAM and a PCI-Express SSD.</p>
<p>If I just create a new empty project and click on the &quot;Run&quot; button (real Android device selected as the target) there&#39;s no freeze at the beginning, the whole build from a completely fresh project takes ~30s. Here what&#39;s also worrying is that while I change absolutely no files and just click on &quot;Run&quot; again, it still takes the same time to re-run it, as if there was no caching of any build steps ever.</p>
<p>Also Titanium Studio seems to be leaving a lot of adb and node processes lying around, about once every 5-10 runs I kill one or two of the adb processes and then they all die away, the node processes slowly following them and dying away.</p>
<p>Every time I click on &quot;Run&quot;, it spawns a new adb and node process, if I click on the big red &quot;Stop&quot; -button in the console, nothing happens to the processes. Even if I close Titanium Studio they still keep running.</p>

							<div><p>Hi Janne - I also end up with lots of node and a adb processes running. As the node ones are sometimes over 100MB this soon eats all my memory. I also try to click the red &#39;stop&#39; button on Studio rather than just re-launch my app, but sometimes forget. I am running under Mac OS X Mountain Lion with 4 Gigs of RAM. Maybe I now need much more!</p>

							<p>There was a bug in Windows version of Titanium Studio where every time you built an Android app, the previous build&#39;s &quot;adb logcat&quot; process was not terminated, hence you would have several adb instances running. The good news is this bug has been fixed in Titanium Studio 3.2.1.</p>
<p>When I originally found this bug, I only tested up to a few adb instances. I suppose if you had many, it could seriously affect the build speed.</p>

							<p>First thing I would do is create a new default project, then build and run it. That will tell you right away one of two things. If the app fires right up, then there&#39;s a problem with your app. Or, if the behavior remains the same as listed, then you&#39;ve got a problem with the Android install.</p>
<p>See if that process provides any insight for you.</p>

										<p><p>As I said above, I have done that already. The initial freeze in the build doesn&#39;t concern new projects, but it is still slow (~30s) and the processes don&#39;t die away.</p>
