			<h1>How to detect high density (HD) android display</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>During the development process of my cross-platform app, I&#39;ve noticed a few annoyances when it comes to Android devices. The most recent being that icons created for standard resolution iPhones appear too small on tabs when viewed on my android device. With TI, it&#39;s easy to fix this when dealing with retina displays by adding &quot;@2x&quot; versions of my images. Unfortunately, for my higher resolution HD android device, those larger version images are not automatically used.</p>
<p>Now, I&#39;ve looked throughout this forum for direction on this, and this link is what I&#39;ve found to be most helpful:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2010&#x2F;08&#x2F;dealing-with-multiple-screens-and-multiple-languages.html">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2010&#x2F;08&#x2F;dealing-with-multiple-screens-and-multiple-languages.html</a></p>
<p>I think that I should be able to style my elements with a jss file, and reference the appropriate jss file when an HD android device is detected. Perhaps this could work with my tabs?</p>
<p>The problem is, I don&#39;t know if an automated way to detect high density devices. I suppose I could evaluate the device screen&#39;s height and width, and based on some assumptions, determine whether it is using a high density screen.</p>
<p>Does anyone know a better way to determine this?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance - Joel</p>

							<p>Inside your resources folder you want an android folder and inside that an images folder and inside that have a &#39;low&#39;, &#39;medium&#39; and &#39;high&#39; folder.  Just name the files the same and place your appropriate images in the respective folders and the OS will grab the correct ones.  </p>
<p>To verify this I created 3 separate background images for my views, at 3 separate resolutions and just photoshopped text to the bottom of each image saying if they were low, med or high. Try each resolution in the emulator and you should see the different bg&#39;s.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the quick response! I knew it had to be something simple, but I couldn&#39;t find the information in the documentation, just iPhone-related information (retina displays).</p>
<p>That said, is there any guidance on basic sizing for &#39;low&#39;, &#39;medium&#39;, and &#39;high&#39;? I know for iPhone, the &#39;@2x&#39; images are just that, twice as large. What about for android? Are the images in the &#39;medium&#39; folder expected to be approximately 50% larger?</p>

										<p><p>I had a chance to test the high, medium, and low folders, but I still get the same issue.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve created the folders you mentioned here:</p>
<p>Resources\Android\images\</p>
<p>Also under the Resources\Android folder, I have the following folders for my varying splash images:</p>
<p>res-long-land-hdpi<br>res-long-land-ldpi<br>res-long-port-hdpi<br>res-long-port-ldpi<br>res-notlong-land-hdpi<br>res-notlong-land-ldpi<br>res-notlong-land-mdpi<br>res-notlong-port-hdpi<br>res-notlong-port-ldpi<br>res-notlong-port-mdpi</p>
<p>I even tried removing all of the above folders so I just have my high, medium, and low folders. The tab icons are still tiny on android.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s an example of the code I use to create a tab:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> watchTab = Titanium.UI.createTab({
    icon:<span class="hljs-string">'images/70-tv.png'</span>,
    title:<span class="hljs-string">'Watch'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-built_in">window</span>:watchWindow
})
</code></pre><p>Now, I also have these images in my Resources\images folder.</p>
<p>I assumed, based on your answer, that I would just copy over those images to the Resources\Android\Images\high (medium, and low) folders for it to work. In my medium and high folders, I renamed all the @2x images to remove the @2x from the names.</p>
<p>I must be missing something simple here.</p>

										<p><p>Remove the copies of those images that are in your Resources\images\ folder.  (You really shouldn&#39;t even have that folder at all.)  This way, the files in your Resources\android\images\high (medium, and low) folders will be used (the filename, for example, &quot;70-tv.png&quot; is the same in each subdirectory, even though they contain different size images, right?).  Also, make sure that the &quot;android&quot; and &quot;images&quot; subdirectory names are lowercase.  Make sure the case of your filenames matches the string in your code exactly.  Delete your &quot;build&quot; directory and Clean your project, then run it again.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, Shawn. I&#39;ll give that a shot. I assume I need to create an images folder under Resources\iphone as well, correct?</p>

										<p><p>When I change my Android folder under Resources to lower case, I get build errors in the R.js file. The errors pertain to invalid IDs in the file. Now, I did notice something interesting. When my Android folder is in upper case (which is the default when creating new projects), the R.js file only contains 2 files listed under &quot;drawables&quot;, my app icon and background image. When the folder is in lower case (which is when I get my compile errors), then I see all the files in my Resources\android\images\high (medium, low) folders listed as drawables. These files are the ones that I get the invalid (or undeclared?) ID errors in the R.js file during compile. Is this a known bug?</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;d do a project-&gt;clean and then rebuild.  My setup is like yours &quot;Resources\android\images\high (medium, low)&quot; and i get no errors and i get all my different density files working correctly.</p>

										<p><p>John, I figured it out! The problem was, my images all started with a number. This is what was causing the build errors. Thanks again for all your help!</p>
