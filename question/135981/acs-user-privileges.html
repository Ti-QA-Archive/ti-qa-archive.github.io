			<h1>ACS User Privileges</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m just starting to use the User objects of ACS, and it seems like there is no built in way to handle priviledges. For example, any user can register and then search the entire set of users with arbitrary data, exposing all of the other users data. I can understand that an admin type role could possibly have this type of access, but this pretty much makes storing user information in the User object equivalent to making it public and therefore useless if it needs to be controlled (as most users would expect). Unfortunately we HAVE to use the Users objects to get basic things like Push Notifications working with ACS, so this is kind of a blocker right now. Any known workarounds?</p>

							<p>Also, for user information such as email and external account token, it is not visible by anyone but current user. If you wish to store private user data, you can use key value storage with access_private set as true.</p>

										<p><p>thanks! this is pretty helpful but i might have to hold off on fully buying into the ACS product until the ACL features are implemented. so many other services hinge on the use of Users (Social Integration, Photos, etc) that I think until that is up to par the entire value is diminished significantly. I&#39;m excited about it and will for sure keep reading all the updates!</p>
