			<h1>window close event doesn&#39;t fire in SDK 1.7.0 RC1</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, </p>
<p>In my App I have a window (win1) in which I create and open another window (win2) using a button. In 1.6.2 I could catch the close event of win2 in win1. When I compile with sdk 1.7.0.rc1 the close event is not fired. </p>
<p>I open the window as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">but.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span></span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> win2 = Titanium.UI.createWindow({  
        url:<span class="hljs-string">'../screens/win2.js'</span>
    });

    win2.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'close'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span></span>{
        Ti.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">'win2 closed'</span>);
        RunCode();
    })

    win2.open({modal:<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>});
});
</code></pre><p>Closing win2 is done via a click of a button as well. </p>
<p>I have tried creating  the window outside the button click event. This doesn&#39;t make a difference. Also opening win2 with &#39;modal: false&#39; doesn&#39;t do the trick. </p>
<p>Is it a bug or is it me? Help is really appreciated because I really would like to use the fastdev advantages of 1.7.0!</p>
<p>Thanks<br>Gino </p>

										<p><p>I found out that if the window is closed by the navigation button the event is raised. If the window is closed by code through <em>.close()</em> then event is not raised.</p>

										<p><p>thanks for posting your finding. Unfortunately this will not suffice for me as I need to close with a &#39;Save&#39; button. After close I want to refresh a tableView in the close event.</p>

										<p><p>@Gino: So why don&#39;t you register your own event and fire it after saving?</p>

										<p><p>@sven Tried that. I fire the event is just before closing win2. Win1 catches the event but has no handle to the requesting object (=win2) and the App crashes! </p>
<p>And as a matter of principle, it works in SDK 1.6.2, so it should work in 1.7.0 aswell ;)</p>

							<p>This seems to be a problem in SDK 1.7.2 also (close event is not fired when .close() is called…works fine with the Android&#39;s back button).  Matt, are you watching this?  Is it a documented bug?</p>
