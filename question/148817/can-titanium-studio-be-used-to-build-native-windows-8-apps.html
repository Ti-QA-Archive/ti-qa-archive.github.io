										<p><p>Interesting. So what does this mean for deploying to iOS and Windows 8? The Windows 8 Emulator runs only on Windows 8 just like the iOS Emulator runs only on OSX. How would I be able to use an IDE running on just one OS to build to both iOS and Windows 8? Without some kind of bridging script or other solution, it seems like this would be impossible.</p>

							<p>The short answer is:</p>
<p>##No, you cannot to this day.</p>
<p>While this is planned in the future, there is nothing available for developing for Windows 8 using Titanium at the time.</p>

										<p><p>@Rainer, you are right about the session. But I had a better opinion on JS for Windows 8 since I had the chance to see another presentation in a previous event. (And this talk was a lot more developer oriented)</p>
<p>My advice to you is to have a second look at it. There is some pretty neat stuff in there, but the presentation didn&#39;t cover it unfortunately for us.</p>
