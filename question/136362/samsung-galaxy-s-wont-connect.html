			<h1>Samsung Galaxy S won&#39;t connect</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am at the final end user testing stage of my project and my app works fine in iOS and it seems on most Android devices.  It is working ok on at least 6 different devices including a Samsung Galaxy S2 and a Samsung Galaxy Nexus.  However, one of my testers (who is located remotely) has reported that my app has problems on the Samsung Galaxy S.  It sounds like the application is failing to connect to some back-end web services.  The first thing my app does is connect to some back end JSON web sevices.</p>
<p>Anyone who why this device might be acting in this way especially when two similar devices work ok?  Any known issues with the time-out setting or anything like that?</p>

							<div><p>The Android version on my app (which streams radio stations) has had no end of trouble from users with various Galaxy models. Nobody knows why and I&#39;ve been tearing my hair out over it (luckily I have plenty left). My only thought has been if the particular user has not set up their device&#39;s APN (access point names) settings, which few people seem to have heard of.</p>
