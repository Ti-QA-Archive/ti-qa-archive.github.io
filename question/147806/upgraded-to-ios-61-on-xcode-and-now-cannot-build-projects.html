			<h1>Upgraded to iOS 6.1 on xcode and now cannot build projects</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I get this error when building projects through Titanium now which I know is because of my recent upgrade to iOS6.1 on xcode. Can anyone tell me how to get round this? I also have all of the iOS versions installed down to 5.</p>
<p>[ERROR] Invalid –ios-version value &#39;6.0&#39;<br>Accepted values:<br>   6.1</p>

							<p>If you run <code>titanium info -t ios</code> from the command line, you can see what Xcode installs Titanium finds as well as each iOS SDK. If you do not see iOS SDK 6.0 in any of the iOS SDK lists, then you won&#39;t be able to build for iOS 6.0.</p>
<p>Titanium tries to find Xcode in the &#x2F;Applications directory. It will match &#x2F;Applications&#x2F;Xcode*.app. If you have iOS SDK installed for an older version of Xcode, you should rename it and move it to the &#x2F;Applications folder.</p>

							<p>Have you tried changing the config when you build? By default it goes blank and you have to change it to 6.1</p>
<p>I&#39;ve managed to build and submit apps to iTunes Connect this past week with no issues.</p>
<p>Under &#39;Run As&#39; you have &#39;Run Configurations&#39;, you should be able to select the correct iOS SDK, give that a try</p>

							<p>Also, I had not shut down studio since the upgrade and had the same problem. All I had to do was exit and restart studio.</p>

							<p>Guys thanks for all your quick answers. I fixed the problem by simply quitting and restarting the titanium suite. It then picked up the new iOS6.1 SDK.</p>
