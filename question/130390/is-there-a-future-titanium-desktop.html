			<h1>Is there a future Titanium Desktop?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>It&#39;s been a few weeks that my company is testing Titanium Desktop to create new products, we have quite liked the result, but something is bothering our team.</p>
<p>The question is simple, there is continuity for the future of Titanium Desktop?</p>
<p>This question came into being after problems for the generation of the final package installation, using it to try to marshal the cloud of Appcelerador we are getting too many errors, of which we have quoted here by many people.</p>
<p>We have followed the beta releases of version 1.2, but the errors continue, we have tested the  mac os snow leopard, windows, mac os lion, and even on Linux, we are failing to generate packages for any operating system from the Titanium Studio.</p>
<p>We also noticed some problems in the SDK as the Notification no longer work at the Lion, but work properly in Snow Leopard, among other relatively questions.</p>
<p>There&#39;s one that can not fail to mention is that the absurdity of the final generated locally with tibuild.py. A project with little code is always above 80MB.</p>
<p>So the question is whether we can continue with Titanium Desktop, because we want to get the services of Appcelerador, sign support, etc etc.. These problems make it impossible to hire us because we fear of Appcelerator be investing much more mobile in their products than on their products to generate applications for Desktop.</p>
<p>We want to use Titanium and Mobile Desktop for our new products, we have tested and are sure that the Titanium meets in Mobile, the problem now is the Titanium Desktop.</p>
<p>Have any of you could give us a North Titanium on the future of Desktop?</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;m really looking forward for the answer for that too. I know for fact that the Ti Desktop have only one developer that happens to be a very nice Allan too. ;)</p>
<p>But looks like the Appcelerator don&#39;t care that much for the desktop version of their product. </p>
<p>Lets see if they can at least give some kind of perspective for all of us willing to develop and use their products.</p>

							<p>I think Ti for Desktop is dead for sure. They are focusing on mobile only. I decided on Ti Desktop after AIR but now I am back to AIR. There are no support packages for desktop and even their desktop page shows Ti Developer which they abandoned after coming out with Ti Studio. I had contacted one of their prominent users and they have opened a MAC and Windows developer position in their company and they are abandoning Ti Desktop even though one of their products is on Ti Desktop.</p>

							<p>I also think that Appcelerator should at least take the two minutes to give us a Yes or a No to this question.</p>
<p>With the recent nice changes of Adobe to Flex &#x2F; Air I see a much brighter future for desktop developers using Flash Builder … let alone the fact that Air lets us develop for every relevant mobile platform since its latest update. Essentially giving developers the much needed possibility to use one code-base for all platforms.</p>
<p>So please Appcelerator - throw us a bone and at least shed some light on your intentions concerning desktop development.</p>

							<h1 id="i-think-appcellerator-has-abandoned-titanium-desktop">I think appcellerator has abandoned titanium desktop</h1>
<p>All of their marketing has abandoned the desktop completely in favor of their mobile api. They have no tutorials for the desktop, and have yet as to respond to this thread. They also have forwarded many of the help links and examples fr om the desktop api to the mobile api. This all seems evedince that appcellerator has no intentions of continueing or supporting their desktop api.</p>
<p>This is quite a shame as I had high hopes for this in enterprise use.</p>

										<p><p>Sorry for the delay - we&#39;re aware that we need to get the roadmap out there ASAP.  I had hoped to marshall all the needed input and opinions by now, but the process has been slow.  It could still be this week (today or tomorrow), but regardless an update will be pushed to the dev blog very soon.</p>

							<p>Amazing, a company the size of Appcelerator, receiving many investments, and not even give us a position on the future of Titanium Desktop.</p>
<p>I think it&#39;s a lack of attention to companies like mine that is ready to invest in Titanium Desktop.</p>
<p>Hey Appcelerator team can and please give us a feedback?</p>
<p>I wait.</p>
