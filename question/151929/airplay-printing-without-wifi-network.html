			<h1>Airplay printing without wifi network</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,<br>I have an iPad app that can print invoices using the AirPrint module.<br>The problem is that it works only when there is a wifi network (and when you have the wifi password).<br>The user of the app need at same time intent (via 3G) to synchronise database, and wifi for AirPrint.<br>Do you know a portable printer that has its own wifi network ? so no need to have a wifi network.<br>Do you think that a 3G&#x2F;Wifi portable router will suit the need (having internet with 3G and have airplay) ?<br>Thanks for your advice.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Whilst many printers now come with the ability to connect to WiFi, the printers themselves do not act as WiFi router.  There are some very specialised printers that can do this but the cost is prohibitively pointless for this discussion.</p>
<p>You mention <strong>HP printers</strong> but I think you are probably confusing the <strong>AirPrint</strong> support they have built in that means that configuration for others devices to connect to them is reduced - this does not mean those printers can actually form their own connection to the internet and then share that connection to other local devices.</p>
<p>There are a couple of solutions to this, assuming the iPad does not have its own network access;</p>
<ul>
<li>If there is an Android device or iPhone in the mix, use it as a hot spot - make sure you have sufficient data allowances though.  This will form a local WiFi network using the 3G data of the mobile device and sharing it using WiFI from the same device.  <strong>This is my personal favourite</strong></li>
<li>As Mauro Parra suggests you can get a MiFi (portable WiFi hotspot), but keep in mind you will need an additional data contract to use this device.</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>Yes with internet tethering it gives you a local wifi network, so your local network connects to devices.  You will need to initially tell the printer it can use that network - but only the first time.</p>
<p>You should double check with your provider that you are allowed to tether on the contract you have or end up on.</p>

							<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Get a MiFi and you will solve both problems: have the ipad connecting to the internet and the printer to the local wifi. </p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro</p>
