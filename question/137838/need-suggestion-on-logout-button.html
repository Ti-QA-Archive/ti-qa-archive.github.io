							<div><p>Harshad,</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll agree, that your question doesn&#39;t gives us much to work with. I strongly suggest you have a look at the guidelines to follow when asking a question.</p>
<p>Also, please include some code detailing what you are trying to achieve. This will give everyone a better understanding of the problem you are facing.</p>
<p>Simply asking for an entire solution without having experienced it yourself seems counter-productive.</p>

							<div><p>Sorry for disastrous question. But i never meant to ask for entire solution for my problem. May be i framed my question wrongly.</p>
<p>To be more descriptive i can tell you that, I am working on an app where multiple users can log in with username and password. I am already done with the Log in window. But I am confused about the later part where user will be able to log out from the other windows which will follow.</p>
<p>The confusing part is that where should i put the log out button. Should i use toolbar which is available??? </p>
<p>I hope this is the right question to ask. I never meant to ask entire code for my problem. just a suggestion.</p>

							<p>I would implement a small pin somewhere which slides out a menu including the Logout Button.<br>All &#39;secret&#39; windows&#x2F;containers should belong to a navGroup&#x2F;tabGroup. If this is Not possible for you then put them in an Array <code>secretViews</code> and on Logout you Loop that and close each view, when finished open your Login  win again.</p>

							<p>simply put, remove all the views except the login screens. Dont forget the window.close() doesnt releases the memory automatically, It is recommended to do the foll: window=null This will release the memory for sure.</p>
<p>For more info on memory leaks try profiler in xcode</p>
