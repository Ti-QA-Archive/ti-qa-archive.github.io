			<h1>Opinions Wanted - HTML5 Canvas or Titanium APIs for Drawing</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve been looking at drawing tutorials for HTML5, and I am familiar how to move views around with the Titanium APIs.  I want to make a physics app that shows how gravity works so I&#39;ll be drawing simple objects interacting with each other.</p>
<p>Should I move them around using javascript and the Titanium UI views, or should I draw them with HTML 5?</p>
<p>It seems like Titanium would be easier, but I suspect people have written libraries for automatically creating and moving objects in HTML 5 that might work in a web view.</p>
<p>I&#39;d be interested in anyone&#39;s opinion or experience with this type of thing.  Thank you.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m currently trying to make functions that let me drag, drop and transform, and also Draw lines.</p>
<p>Neither of them I&#39;m getting to work, I had drawing natively in Titanium, but it was a major memory hogger, and really slow on the device itself.</p>
<p>Opted to go for a webview, using html&#x2F;javascript and titanium, but it works on simulator but not on the device itself cause it never loads my init functions.</p>
<p>I feel very restrictive at the moment using titanium in trying to use 2 of the core multitouch capabilities in my opinion.</p>
<p>the ipod&#x2F; and expecially ipad give themselves away to these kind of apps, drawing and or physics, but Titanium can&#39;t really do both as of yet natively, it still involes you trying to make a module using objective-c.</p>
<p>So i&#39;m eagerly awaiting the module marketplace which will come after 1.50 appearantly.<br>this will lift titanium up to one of the best dev apps.</p>
<p>but for now…it wil be rather &quot;challenging&quot; </p>

							<p>With regard to what does&#x2F;does not work in a web view, you should be able to do anything you can do in mobile webkit.  If your initialization scripts are not being run on the device, I would be curious as to why that is the case - are you able to run any scripts at all?  Is it just document ready that&#39;s not being called?  Could there be a timing issue at play?  Answering all those questions would probably lead to answers to the greater issues Patrick is having.</p>
<p>That said, whether you use HTML 5 techniques or Titanium animation APIs backed by the native animation capabilities of the device, you should be able to achieve some pretty sophisticated animation.  I would lean toward using native Titanium views&#x2F;animations, but if you&#39;d rather do your entire UI in HTML&#x2F;CSS then HTML 5&#x2F;CSS 3 animations will work also.  Only caveat there is that on some Android releases, some CSS 3 animation features are not hardware-accelerated.</p>

							<p>Currently the init() function gets loaded, atleast the alert I put into my init function gets loaded.<br>but it never starts the touch events…<br>It runs on simulator and android but not on iOS devices, the touch event doesnt get registered or atleast something is blocking the code to start.</p>
