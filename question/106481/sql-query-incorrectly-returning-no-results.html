			<h1>SQL query incorrectly returning no results</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I have an app that is trying to pull data from a local database. I&#39;ve connected to the database and can pull data when the SQL query is based on the primary key but I&#39;ve been trying to run the same query on a different integer column and it incorrectly returns 0 rows. I&#39;ve tested the SQL statement elsewhere and it returns the data fine, just not inside the app. Also I&#39;ve tried querying the database on another column that is based on a string and that works too.</p>
<p>Example of code that doesn&#39;t work:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var rows = db.execute('<span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> * <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">Event</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">WHERE</span> track_id=<span class="hljs-string">"1"</span><span class="hljs-string">');</span></span>
</code></pre><p>But this code does work:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var rows = db.execute('<span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> * <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">Event</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">WHERE</span> event_id=<span class="hljs-string">"1"</span><span class="hljs-string">');</span></span>
</code></pre><p>I&#39;ve checked the spellings of the column names and everything but it still doesn&#39;t work. Anyone else encountered the same problem?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>Andy,<br>Here&#39;s a few crazy things to remember when using SQLite in Titanium. You might already know them but can&#39;t hurt to mention them anyway.</p>
<p>Firstly, when working on the device or in the simulator, you have to reset it to see any changes in the database. In the simulator goto File &gt; Reset Contents and Settings and reload your app. It may help.</p>
<p>Secondly, simplify your tests, use this code just to see if you get a result</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in">var</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">rows</span> = db<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>execute(<span class="hljs-string">'SELECT * FROM Event'</span>);
</code></pre><p>I like to test for everything just to se if there is a result. Then you know you are at least returning something from the database.</p>
<p>These two handy hints always help me when I&#39;m getting frustrated.<br>Hope they help you.<br>Wayne</p>

										<p><p>THANK YOU so much! Can&#39;t believe it but the reset contents and settings solved it all. Kicking myself for not seeing that sooner, seeing as it&#39;s such a simple thing to check. Definitely a tip to remember.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve spent all day and a lot of time this week trying to solve it and I was starting to give up so thanks so much for the tip!</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t work because you are not using execute() correctly. You should be using string substitution. See <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.appcelerator.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;local_data.html#storing_data">Storing data</a> for examples.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>sorry, should have said I had already tried that. Just did it again to double check and still getting the same problem.</p>

							<p>I have never had trouble with any selects.  You mentioned the the column which is failing is an integer column, so try this instead:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var rows = db.execute('<span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> * <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">Event</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">WHERE</span> event_id=<span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-string">');</span></span>

										<p><p>yeah tried that as well and it works either way on the column that works, but neither works on the one I&#39;m having trouble with</p>

										<p><p>Then are you 100% positive the field event_id actually contains the value you expect?  It sounds to me like it does not.  Try logging the event_id field value after you have read a record using track_id in the where clause.</p>

										<p><p>yeah, I have 8 rows in the database and they each have a value of 1-8 for the field I&#39;m trying to find.<br>But I took your advice and tried to return that field from a successful query and it strangely returned null. I&#39;ve checked all nine fields and the only ones that are not returned null are the first two, despite each column having data. The only difference I could see between these 2 and the other 7 was that the 2 that were returned were set to &quot;NOT NULL&quot;. I changed the rest of the table so all columns don&#39;t accept null values, but that hasn&#39;t fixed it.</p>
