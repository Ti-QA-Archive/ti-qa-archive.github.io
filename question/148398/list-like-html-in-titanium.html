							<p>I&#39;d done this.it was done by adding two labels in one row of tableview.The label the left side having a dot only and by applying some styling to it i&#39;d made a bullet like default bullet in html lists.The label at the right side was containing the text.<br>simple :)</p>

										<p><p>Mir mirza simply write how to put the data in tableview which wasn&#39;t my question at all.I already know that this could be achieved through tableview that&#39;s why i taged tableview in my question and i also know that this could be achieved by adding two labels with dot and text but i didn&#39;t know what kind of style the dot would be having . your answer was highly irrelevant,you should be graceful to me that i didn&#39;t minus that.</p>

							<p>&lt;ul&gt; and &lt;li&gt; are semantic parts of an unordered list.  In web world you can style with CSS. The default state are bullets.</p>
<p>In native world you can use i.e table view.</p>
