							<p>You need to create them via the Android SDK tools.<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Installing_the_Android_SDK</p>

							<p>Hi Marc,<br>Take a look at the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Installing_the_Android_SDK">Installing Android SDK</a> section from the Titanium guides and get the emulator up and running. There are separate guidelines for separate host system(windows&#x2F;osx etc). Titanium emulators are typically slow. You can use <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2014&#x2F;07&#x2F;new-in-titanium-studio-3-3-0-run-in-genymotion&#x2F;">Genymotion</a> for a faster experience.</p>

							<p>Thank you both Clayton and Papia for your help. Sorry for the slow response but I have not had much success.  I have tried following the installation instructions and I am more confused.  I thought that the SDKs were installed automatically when I installed Studio.  There was a section in the Quick Start that was titled &quot;Installing the platform SDKs&quot; that I thought I had completed successfully.  Under Platform Configuration, Studio indicates that I have Android version 5.0.1.  Is this different than what you are indicating that I should install?  I have something that is labeled titanium_1_wvga800, I am wondering what that is?</p>
<p>The instructions seem to assume that I am already familiar with some concepts that I know nothing about.  Is there a good book that you can recommend for someone who is totally new to this environment, or maybe an order that I should follow in going through the documentation? I purchased &quot;Appcelerator Titanium Application Development by Example Beginner&#39;s Guide&quot; but did not find it very useful.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Marc</p>

							<p>Marc, things can definitely be hard when first setting up your environment for Titanium. On top of that, I&#39;ve found the Android platform to assume a lot about its users competency with installing SDKs, using the command line, using eclipse, etc. So you&#39;re doing just fine for a new user. </p>
<p>titanium_1_wvga800 is most likely your android emulator. That was the name of my first one. I can&#39;t remember when I first started using Titanium Studio whether android was installed already or I had to download it separately. Either way, it sounds like you have it going… </p>
<p>You should be able to create a new project in Titanium Studio. After that, you should see Run in the top left corner which has that green button with a white play button inside it. Right next to that, there should be another dropdown, it may say &quot;Android Device&quot; right now but if you select that you should see a dropdown with options. Go to Android Emulators and select titanium_1_wvga800. Click run to ensure the command gets sent and you should be good to go. I&#39;m no support guy so I don&#39;t know if that will work but that&#39;s the basic workflow of compiling your app to run. What operating system are you on, by the way?</p>

							<p>Thanks Clayton, your encouragement helped me to keep trying to find a solution.  I am use to working with .net in Visual Studio and this environment is very different.  I have a new question.  I have been able to start the emulator and to get my test application running in it, but every time that I click the play button, a new emulator starts and this takes a long time.  Is there a way to just start the app in the same emulator that I already have running?</p>
<p>Thanks Again,<br>Marc</p>

										<p><p>Hey Marc,</p>
<p>Actually I mentioned this in my first answer, but it may have been overlooked since these links apply to after you get the emulator working. You&#39;re not the only one who thinks the Android Emulator is slow. There are a couple options to help you with that. </p>
<p>Anyway, there are a lot of different options for this. Above I posted these two links:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jolicode.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;speed-up-your-android-emulator">Speed up for android emulators</a></p>
<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=QtOjYoiK0cY">Video on how to create a faster emulator</a> (I like this one!)</p>
<p>Another option would be Genymotion. I don&#39;t know a lot about it just yet, but I think its a different codebase for android emulators. Basically they&#39;re &quot;the faster android emulator&quot;. I think they&#39;re seperate from the ones you create with the android SDK. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.genymotion.com&#x2F;">Check it out</a></p>
<p>A lot harder option, which I&#39;ve used but haven&#39;t really perfected yet, is TiShadow. Its an app you install on your Emulator, and then instead of building your app to the emulator, you build the app to theTiShadow app inside the emulator that&#39;s already running and it automatically refreshes. No closing and starting a new emulator which takes all that time. I&#39;ve found some weird kinks with it, but people seem to love it. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tishadow.yydigital.com&#x2F;">Check it out</a></p>

							<p>Well Marc,</p>
<p>Good to know you have the emulator running. I too once faced the same you do now. I refered to <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gamefromscratch.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;2012&#x2F;03&#x2F;21&#x2F;further-adventures-in-appcelerator-getting-it-to-run-in-an-existing-emulator.aspx">this</a>. Again that is long time back, would you please try this fix once?</p>

							<p>Hello Clayton and Papia,</p>
<p>Thank you both for your suggestions.  I tried the tip that Clayton sent having to do with making a faster emulator but I was unsuccessful because I get the following message:</p>
<p>ERROR: x86 emulation currently requires hardware acceleration! </p>
<p>I will give the video a try.</p>
<p>Papia, the link that you sent looks promising I will try that too and let you both know the results.</p>
<p>Thanks again to both of your for your help and encouragement.</p>
<p>Marc</p>

										<p><p>Yes, you need to download the HAXM Manager and specifically run it yourself. Android AVD (that SDK Manager you launch from the command line) won&#39;t actually install the HAXM manager that article tells you to download – you need to install it yourself. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;26355645&#x2F;error-in-launching-avd">This stackoverflow link</a> will help you.</p>

							<p>Thanks Clayton,</p>
<p>I did run into the issue that you are referring to about running the HAXM Manager executable while I was working on this solution.  Another thing that I discovered it that Titanium had already installed Android SDK tools for me in the initial setup but in order to get the executable to run, I had to copy AVD Manager and STK Manager to the root andriod-stk-win directory.  </p>
<p>I believe that I am getting the hardware acceleration error because I am running on a VM.  I do it this way so that I can take the VM with me and use it on several different computers.</p>
<p>I really appreciate your help, is there a way that I can contact you outside of the forum?</p>
<p>Marc</p>

										<p><p>Ah I see, that might make a difference, but I don&#39;t see why you wouldn&#39;t be able to install the HAXM software inside the VM. I&#39;d google it.</p>
<p>I&#39;d prefer to keep any questions you have around this stuff here to help the Titanium community. Chances are there are others with the same problem. Besides, maybe for more in-depth stuff, you should be contacting support. Thank you though!</p>

<p>I am sorry, I did not give a clear response. I was able to install HAXM in the VM but after it was installed, I got the error message.  I may be incorrect, but I think that the issue has something to do with my VM not supporting hardware acceleration.  </p>
