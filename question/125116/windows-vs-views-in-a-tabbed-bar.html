			<h1>Windows vs. Views in a Tabbed Bar</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to build my first iPhone app with appcelerator titanium. One of the problems I&#39;m having is understanding windows vs. views. For instance, my current problem is, I have a window with a tabbed bar across the bottom. This tabbed bar has three buttons. </p>
<p>When someone clicks a tab, I want to show some different content. In my opinion, it seems like I would want to use three views (one view for each tab). But when I look in the kitchen sink, I notice they are using windows. To further complicate my challenge, each of my screens requires a scrollView.  Because of the scrollView, I&#39;m really lost in regards to what I should do. </p>
<p>Can someone explain to me how to address this problem? It seems like it should be fairly straightforward. Thank you very much!</p>

							<p>You can think of window as UI unit that can stand as one independent unit and can have many other UI units. Windows can be modal, fullscreen, can create new contexts, etc. </p>
<p>On the other hand, view is UI unit that can&#39;t exist outside window. So, you create views, but you must add them to the window to make them meaningful. Views are block UI elements and they are similar to windows because of that and because they have layout mechanism similar to window and can contain other UI elements.</p>
<p>So … you create windows as standalone units and you add other UI units to the window like views to make layout more complex.</p>
