			<h1>Consistent Cross Platform UI</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I know this has been answered somewhere but in two days of searching off and on and rewatching the training videos I still cannot figure it out.  Basically I want my application to look basically the same on iOS and Android at all resolutions.  By the same I mean that my custom View based toolbar on the bottom in portrait mode shows six icons that are evenly spaced regardless of the resolution and platform.  Thus, imagine the layout on a iPhone non-retina display the 6 evenly spaced 32x32 icons in a view that is 40dp heigh.  Rotating landscape uses the same size icons but the spacing is greater of course.  Now, how to translate this to the iPad or and Android tablet?  Currently my design presents a tiny toolbar on the bottom of the iPad view (retina and not).  I want proportionally the screen to be nearly identical on all devices.  Secondly, I have tried to alter my layout in the postlayout event, however, it does not fire when the device rotates at least in the iOS simulator.  Is there another event for this?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Take a look at this answer I gave to someone else earlier this week.  It contains lots of information, solutions and some suggestions to help you solve your problem.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;148337&#x2F;how-to-achieve-same-layout-for-android-and-iphone-using-titanium.html#answer-256884">How to achieve same layout for Android and iPhone using Titanium</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It goes much further than simply trying to get the same layout across one or the other, the information includes trying to marshal all layouts together.  Whilst you cannot solve all problems - you can solve most.</p>
<p>Take a look and tell me if that helps.</p>

							<p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>This is an idea that comes to mind:</p>
<p>If you put each icon themselves inside a view, you could specify the &quot;fixed&quot; icon width and height, but set the container view to have a percentage-based width.  For example:</p>
<p>Main View containing all buttons is set to width=Ti.UI.FILL and Layout horizontal.<br>Then, if you have 6 buttons, each button (the View) has a width of 16% ( 100&#x2F;6 )</p>
<p>In theory, each icon will be centralized withing its parent view.  Each view will be automatically resized, and place neatly one next to the other because of the horizontal layout.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>
<p>R</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the suggestion, I will try that.  However, I am finding that I want different percentages in portrait vs landscape.  What makes a perfect height for my needs in portrait mode is different from the percentage for the same in landscape.  Seems that the styles in the TSS file have conditionals for platform and form factor but not orientation?  Also, I cannot locate an event that will fire during rotation (in the iOS simulator) to even manually change the percentages.  Does any know what event is suposed to fire?  (Documentation says postlayout which does not actually fire for me when I rotate the simulator and I currently do not have hardware available to test with).</p>

										<p><p>The event I use for trapping orientation change is:</p>
<p>Ti.Gesture.addEventListener(&#39;orientationchange&#39;, function(e) {</p>
<p>});</p>
<p>I have an example <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ricardoalcocer&#x2F;AppC-Meetup-12-11-12">here</a> that simulates the Facebook UI.  It looks the same on iOS and Android, and as I remember, the toolbars had the behavior you are describing.</p>
