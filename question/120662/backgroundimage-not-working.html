			<h1>backgroundImage not working!</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello all</p>
<p>It seems that in my case, the property &quot;backgroundImage&quot; is not working properly:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> mainWindow</span> = Ti.UI.createWindow({
    backgroundImage: <span class="hljs-string">"images/background.png"</span>
});
</code></pre><p>The issue seems to be with the compilation, because when I am running the app in the simulator, in the <code>build&amp;#x2F;iphone&amp;#x2F;Resources</code> folder I can&#39;t find all the images I have under the <code>Resources</code> folder in the project.<br>My project structure is this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">+- Resources
|<span class="hljs-string">  </span>|
|<span class="hljs-string">  + android
</span>|<span class="hljs-string">  </span>|<span class="hljs-string">  </span>|
|<span class="hljs-string">  </span>|<span class="hljs-string">  + images
</span>|<span class="hljs-string">  </span>|<span class="hljs-string">  </span>|<span class="hljs-string">  </span>|
|<span class="hljs-string">  </span>|<span class="hljs-string">  </span>|<span class="hljs-string">  (files for different resolutions)

</span>|<span class="hljs-string">  </span>|<span class="hljs-string">  - appicon.png
</span>|<span class="hljs-string">  </span>|<span class="hljs-string">  - Default.png
</span>|<span class="hljs-string">  </span>|<span class="hljs-string">  - Default@2x.png
</span>|<span class="hljs-string">  </span>|
|<span class="hljs-string">  - app.js
</span>|<span class="hljs-string">  - (other needed files)
</span>|
- (needed files)
</code></pre><p>When I build for iPhone, in the folder <code>build&amp;#x2F;iPhone&amp;#x2F;Resources</code> I can find only the original files that were in the <code>Resources</code> folder, but not the ones that I added afterwards (nor the <code>images</code> folder either!).</p>
<p>So, of course, it can&#39;t work since there are no images in the build folder.</p>
<p>Any ideas why this is happening?</p>
<p>(I&#39;m using the new Titanium Studio, but I also tried to compile with Titanium Developer. I tried with the 1.7 RC version of the SDK as well as 1.6.2 version)</p>

							<p>In your file listing you dont show where you have background.png… where is that located? it should be in &lt;project dir&gt;&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;images&#x2F;background.png based on your code example, and the code you posted is in &lt;project dir&gt;&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;&lt;file name&gt;.js is that correct? </p>
<p>If so, delete the entire contents of &lt;project dir&gt;&#x2F;build&#x2F;iphone and see if that fixes it</p>

										<p><p>Yes, that is correct, the image &quot;background.png&quot; is in <code>Resources&amp;#x2F;images&amp;#x2F;</code><br>Also, the code I posted is in <code>Resources\mainWindow.js</code> which is included from <code>app.js</code>. I also tried directly from <code>app.js</code>, with the same result.<br>I also deleted the entire <code>build</code> folder, and it still doesn&#39;t work.<br>It also fails on Android, just as on iPhone - the images are not copied.</p>
<p>Maybe I should create a new project from scratch and see what happens.</p>

										<p><p>Nope… the same - I created a new project, created a new folder in <code>Resources\iphone</code> called <code>images</code>, put (with the Titanium Studio - drag and drop) the files in the <code>images</code> folder, checked with Finder if the files are there (and they are, including background.png), used the same code and compiled for iPhone with the same result - the folder <code>images</code> isn&#39;t copied in <code>build\iphone\Resources\</code> folder. I verified if the image (background.png) is ok by renaming it to Default.png, and it works fine.<br>Also, in the code, if I replace <code>images\background.png</code> with <code>Default.png</code>, the image appears on the background.<br>What am I doing wrong? I thought that it&#39;s a problem with the new Titanium Studio (I&#39;m using the nightly builds), but I tried to compile with Titanim Developer and it didn&#39;t work either!</p>
<p>Do resources need to be somehow linked with the app to be included in the build, or just copying them in the Resources folder should do?</p>

										<p><p>Ok, maybe I misunderstood your comment - the image &quot;background.png&quot; is in &#x2F;Resources&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;images&#x2F;, not &#x2F;Resources&#x2F;images&#x2F;! The folder &#x2F;Resources&#x2F;images&#x2F; doesn&#39;t exist at all.<br>I want to use different images for iPhone and for Android. Isn&#39;t this ok? Should I reference them differently?</p>

										<p><p>Thank you, Matt, for looking into this so promptly.<br>The image is just fine, because I replaced the &quot;Default.png&quot; image with it and it showed.<br>To be clear, the image &quot;background.png&quot; is in the folder &quot;&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;images&#x2F;&quot;, not &quot;&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;images&#x2F;&quot;, because I want different images for iPhone and Android. Could this be the issue?<br>It seems to be working if I&#39;m copying the images in the &quot;Resources&quot; folder directly.<br>How can I use different images for different devices?

							<p>That should be fine, I just try placing them in images&#x2F;&lt;image file&gt; and test that… whenever you have an issue it is always best to stip it down to basics to see where the issue is. if it works outside of the device directories, then e have a diff issue, if it does not, then it is most likely an issue with the image itself</p>

										<p><p>Sorry, you are answering faster than me commenting :)<br>So how can I use different images for iPhone&#x2F;Android? Placing them in &quot;Resources&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;images&quot; and &quot;Resources&#x2F;android&#x2F;images&quot; doesn&#39;t work (and that caused me these headaches).</p>

										<p><p>So I shouldn&#39;t place the images in &quot;&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;iphone&quot; and &quot;Resources&#x2F;android&quot; sub-folders? Then how can I use different backgrounds for different resolutions? (iphone 3g, 4g, android mdpi, hdpi)</p>
