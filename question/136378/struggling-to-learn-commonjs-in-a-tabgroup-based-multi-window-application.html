			<h1>Struggling to learn CommonJS in a tabgroup based multi-window application</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am really foundering here trying to learn the best way to set up an app within Titanium Studio.  </p>
<p>I have a simple three tab app all written using the kitchen sink model: Separate .js files for each tab.  Now I learn that I should be using a single JavaScript context.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeopro.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;forging-titanium&#x2F;video&#x2F;29059611">Forging Titanium Episode 6: A Single Context Tab Group Template</a> is a good primer, but it falls short of helping me understand how to actually do anything beyond simply setting up tabs.  Specifically, How do I add multiple views to the windows that are created, and then add UI elements (such as tableviews) to the views? </p>
<p>I grabbed the examples given in the repository for <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator-developer-relations&#x2F;Forging-Titanium">this episode</a> and modified ever so slightly.  Here&#39;s the app.js file:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'/lib/require_patch'</span>).monkeypatch(<span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>);

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> globals = {};

(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> AppTabGroup = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'ui/AppTabGroup'</span>),
        AppWindow = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'ui/AppWindow'</span>);

    <span class="hljs-comment">//create our global tab group    </span>
    globals.tabs = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> AppTabGroup(
        {
            title: <span class="hljs-string">'Tab1'</span>,
            icon: <span class="hljs-string">'/images/icn1.png'</span>,
            <span class="hljs-built_in">window</span>: <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> AppWindow({title:<span class="hljs-string">'WinTab1'</span>,backgroundColor:<span class="hljs-string">'white'</span>,barColor: <span class="hljs-string">'orange'</span>})
        },
        {
            title: <span class="hljs-string">'Tab2'</span>,
            icon: <span class="hljs-string">'/images/icn2.png'</span>,
            <span class="hljs-built_in">window</span>: <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> AppWindow({title:<span class="hljs-string">'WinTab2'</span>,backgroundColor:<span class="hljs-string">'white'</span>,barColor: <span class="hljs-string">'orange'</span>})
        },
        {
            title: <span class="hljs-string">'Tab3'</span>,
            icon: <span class="hljs-string">'/images/icn3.png'</span>,
            <span class="hljs-built_in">window</span>: <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> AppWindow({title:<span class="hljs-string">'WinTab3'</span>,backgroundColor:<span class="hljs-string">'white'</span>,barColor: <span class="hljs-string">'orange'</span>})
        }
    );

    globals.tabs.open();
})();
</code></pre><p>The AppTabGroup.js remains unchanged from the delivered example.  In AppWindow.js I just commented out the part that adds the button and the listener for the button.</p>
<p>Ok, so now I have three tabs.  But, where do I go from here???  Let&#39;s say that in WinTab1 I want to add two views.  Would I do this in app.js?  If so, how?  Or would I do it in AppWindow.js?  In the example, he adds a button in the AppWiondow,js file, but doesn&#39;t that defeat the purpose of a single JavaScript context?  Are we not doing most of the heavy listing in app.js?</p>
<p>Or should I be using a commonjs file?</p>
<p>What is my next step here?</p>

							<div><p>The full response to this could be rather long. A quick guide is to not use global vvariables. and set this in its own commoJS module and not in app.js, using events to control the flow. A single JavaScript instance is maintained by NOT using the url property on a window.</p>
<p>I am running a workshop on commonJS if your uk based.</p>

							<div><p>Thanks Trevor.  I would love to come to your workshop but I live in the Caribbean.  Are there no examples sitting in github of a simple tabbed app using commonJS and a single JavaScript instance?  Or, anywhere?  I feel like I&#39;m wandering around blind in the dark.</p>

							<div><p>there are the templates in studio 2… but they are a little wrong in their format, but a good starting point. I am working on an open sourced full example of tabbed and custom templates, but its going to be a few weeks away, due to actual work… </p>
<p>Now maybe I can come to the Caribbean to run the workshop …(Wishful thinking ).</p>

<p>Ok… what&#39;s studio 2?  I would LOVE to see your full example of a tabbed app!!!  But I also understand actual work and trying to fit stuff around it.  In the mean time, how do I learn?!?!?</p>

							<p>Take a look at the Tabbed Project Template available in the project creation wizard for Ti Studio, as it is using the CommonJS structure.  Also available <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator-developer-relations&#x2F;Template.Tabbed">here</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, check out the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator-titans&#x2F;App">Titan Community App</a>.  This app is a work in progress, but will give you another view on how to put together a tabbed app using commonjs and Ti best practices.</p>

										<p><p>Adam, the first example is very similar to the one I posted above.   it&#39;s a good start, but it still does not show how to add the final user-interaction elements such as buttons, tableviews, etc, or any of the logic  All this example does is set up the initial tabs and windows, but leaves me with no understanding of how to use a commonjs file to handle all the UI logic and business logic.</p>
<p>The second example… I&#39;m still looking at it, but it seems to be a hodgepodge of stuff that doesn&#39;t rally make an actual app? </p>
<p>Heres the thing:  I do not at all have an indea in my head of what a commonjs architecture is supposed to look like.  So far the only real example &#x2F; tutorial I&#39;ve really found is this:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeopro.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;forging-titanium&#x2F;video&#x2F;27447911</p>
<p>And that&#39;s so simplistic is totally useless.</p>
<p>I really need to be TAUGHT how to build a tabbed app using commonjs.  Is there really no place on the web to find this out?  Even if I have to pay for it?</p>
<p>Please… someone… help me out here!!!!!  I am down on my knees begging.  How did  you seasoned experts figure this out?  How did you learn?  Tell me, and I&#39;ll do the same thing.</p>
<p>Please, someone.</p>

										<p><p>Not sure what you are seeing on the Community app that makes you consider it &#39;hodgepodge&#39;, but like I mentioned, it is a work in progress.  What you should be looking at is how the app is structured, and how each platform type loads the proper navigation controller, and then loads tabs&#x2F;windows&#x2F;views.</p>
<p>Taking iPhone as an example, app.js calls &#x2F;ui&#x2F;bootstrap.js, which loads AppTabGroup.js.  The tab group then uses a generic LogoWindow.js and loads a tab specific view to it, and places it in the tab.  So, under this configuration, to add UI to one of the tabs, you would modify the View that is being loaded into that tab&#39;s window.  So, if you are wanting to add stuff to the Events tab, you would modify the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator-titans&#x2F;App&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;Community&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;ui&#x2F;EventsView.js">EventsView.js file</a>.  </p>
<p>This project makes use of platform specific sub directories to automatically handle the use of the appropriate code for each platform.  There are also UI files, like the views, that lay outside of the platform directories.  Why?  Because the views are to be independent of the platform, so each platform&#39;s controller will handle displaying the view as appropriate.  The other template I linked to does this as well, but in a different way, handling things on a window level as opposed to a view level.</p>
<p>The choice is yours on how you choose to implement your app&#39;s structure.  Obviously, there are several ways to do it.  Get more info on best practices <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.0&#x2F;index.html#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Best_Practices_and_Recommendations">here</a>.</p>

										<p><p>Ok, thank you Adam.  I appreciate the help and the time you are putting into these replies.  After reading your last comment I went back to the community example and took a second look. It makes more sense, but it&#39;s far beyond the scope of what I&#39;m trying to do.  At this point I&#39;m not trying to be platform independent, and my app is way simpler than what&#39;s going on here. Trying to scale this example down and make sense of it all is daunting.  I keep getting lost in the file structure and the requires.</p>
<p>Rather than try and tackle this learning process all in one question here in the Q&amp;A forum, I&#39;ll post smaller questions with more specific scope instead.  But hopefully this thread will help someone else in the future with all the links you have provided.</p>
<p>In the mean time, I hold out hope that someone like Trevor (above) will someday share a simple-to-understand-and-digest example of the best way to build a small tabbed app.</p>

							<p>Ok guys, how about just a little bump in the right direction.  Using the original example up above, how would I add different buttons to each window?  The supplied example adds the same button to every page.</p>
<p>I think if I can just understand that, I can start to go from there.</p>
