			<p>If so, how did you set it up. I&#39;ve already asked more detailed questions, but after hours of research, I have yet to find one solution, so I&#39;m now wondering if Titanium has caught up to 10.9 with Android (or the other way around - has Android caught up with 10.9). Oh, I have Titanium Studio Version: 3.1.4.201310171935<br>I can run iOS without any problems. I can run nothing for Android. My Titanium, and Android sdk should be the most recent as I just downloaded them the last couple of days and I just bought my Mac a month or so ago (right after the &quot;new&quot; Macbook Pro Retina came out mid-October.)</p>
<p>I am using java 6 and the minimum Android is installed (2.3.3). My Tiapp.xml is fine. I can build an Android emulator. But, it won&#39;t even run &quot;Hello World&quot;.</p>
<p>I either get this error:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[<span class="hljs-keyword">ERROR</span>] <span class="hljs-keyword">Error</span> generating R.java <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> manifest
[<span class="hljs-keyword">ERROR</span>] :  Build process exited <span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> code <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
[<span class="hljs-keyword">ERROR</span>] :  Project failed <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> build after <span class="hljs-number">20</span>s <span class="hljs-number">748</span>ms
[<span class="hljs-keyword">ERROR</span>] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process <span class="hljs-keyword">exit</span> value was <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
</code></pre><p>or it just freezes at:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[INFO] [<span class="hljs-number">2013</span>-<span class="hljs-number">12</span>-<span class="hljs-number">04</span> <span class="hljs-number">08</span>:<span class="hljs-number">27</span>:<span class="hljs-number">25</span>,<span class="hljs-number">963</span>] Serving up files <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> com.reachableprogrammer.trythis at <span class="hljs-number">0.0</span><span class="hljs-number">.0</span><span class="hljs-number">.0</span>:<span class="hljs-number">59350</span> from /Users/tracyritter/Documents/Titanium_Studio_Workspace/trythis

</code></pre><p>I was using a Windows 8  machine, but the 8.1 update broke Titanium, so I am restoring that machine to 8 and reinstalling Titanium. After a lot of headaches, I was able to set Titanium up there the first time (before the Win8.1 crash) and it ran great, but I am baffled with getting it going on my Mac.</p>
<p>And the thing is, I am developing a B2B app for a private customer which needs to run on both iOS and Android, so I&#39;d really rather not develop it in two different boxes.</p>
<p>So, please, if anyone is having any success with Mavericks and Android, let me know. Just let me know it&#39;s possible and, maybe if you have a moment how you did it - ask me anything you want about my set up and what I&#39;ve tried. Just please…I&#39;m desperate and running out of time.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.<br>tr</p>

							<p>Hi Tracy</p>
<p>The quick answer to your question, is YES lots of people are developing Android apps on Mavericks.</p>
<p>In fact doing it now. However we don&#39;t use the inbuilt android emulator instead use genymotion. Also this does sound like a config issue on your machine.</p>
<p>Happy to help you sort it out outside of the Q &amp; A if you need.</p>
<p>T.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m using it. Open the Studio dashboard (red house icon). Under Get Started tab, at bottom is &quot;Configure Native SDK&#39;s&quot;. Is there a checkmark next to Android SDK or a red X? If red X, you need to fix your Android SDK installation. Follow the steps provided and be sure to install api level 10. You may not use it for your apps, but it has to be installed anyway. I found that out the hard way.</p>

							<p>Thank you all. I have it running now, it was a java path problem like I thought. For anyone else with similar problems, my error occurred when I tried to move java because it appeared that my location did not match Ti&#39;s documentation. I juggled it around and got it all put back just like it installed to begin with and all is well.<br>And, BTW, I&#39;m using the java download from the Apple website (which the documentation points to (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Installing_Oracle_JDK).<br>Briefly, if I had left it alone (java) I never would have had any problems.</p>
