			<h1>Image stretching not desired in slider leftTrackImage</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;m new writing on this forum although I have been reading topics on it for a long time and it was very useful for me.</p>
<p>I had a question about the slider images. I have a slider with an image loaded as leftTrackImage and when the value of the slider changes it shows the corresponding part of the image on the left side. It was working successfully until I updated to 3 SDK and iOS to 6 version. Now it shows the whole image stretched in the left part of the slider.</p>
<p>Someone know the way to avoid this problem?</p>
<p>I would be very grateful if someone could help me,</p>
<p>thanks,<br>best regards</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I have tried this in the following combinations;</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS 5.0 SDK 2.1.4</li>
<li>iOS 5.0 SDK 3.0.0</li>
<li>iOS 6.0 SDK 2.1.4</li>
<li>iOS 6.0 SDK 3.0.0</li>
</ul>
<p>When using 2.1.4 the bar does not track well and only appears to display when the thumb is around 50%.  When using 3.0.0 the bar stretches as you reported.</p>
<p>When you had it working, what was the set-up it ran on?</p>

										<p><p>I had it working with iOS 5.1 and Ti SDKs 2.1.4 and 3.0.0, but I think that it only works in the device (iPhone 4), not working well in the simulator. Yesterday I installed iOS 6 and the problem appeared.</p>
<p>I was investigating and I found new slider properties on SDK 3: rightTrackLeftCap, rightTrackTopCap, leftTrackLeftCap and leftTrackTopCap. I have tried different values of leftTrackLeftCap, from the default value 1 up to the width of the image. What I could see is that with small values of that property  the first part of the image didn&#39;t change (working well), but the rest was stretched. The more value, the less stretched, but with high values the image didn&#39;t show at first values of the slider.</p>
<p>I couldn&#39;t find more information of these properties, and the API is very poor in this case. </p>
<p>If someone know how works these properties I would be very pleased if he&#x2F;she could help me.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Best regards</p>
<p>p.s: and lot of thanks to Malcolm for your fast reply!</p>

										<p><p>The caps are unlikely to help your needs as the are designed to define a region of stretch for the image, where as you need it to be fixed and reveal.</p>
<p>I will take another look in the morning.</p>
