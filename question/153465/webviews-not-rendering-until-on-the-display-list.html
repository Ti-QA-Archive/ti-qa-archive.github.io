			<h1>WebViews not rendering until on the display list</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have created an application for Android only that swipes views in and out, with each new view dependent on the selection of the previous. </p>
<p>The problem is, if I create a new webview just before animating it in, it flashes as soon as it is visible, I presume this is because it is only rendered once in the main view rectangle area.</p>
<p>Is there a way around this?</p>
<p>I have created a workaround by loading in the all my next possible webviews and adding them to the display list of a temporary view with the lowest possible z-index, so they are not visible under my current views, then once they are loaded I remove them from this view ready to be used and already pre-rendered. </p>
<p>Another problem now arises, when preloading the next views, the functionality of the app freezes a few milliseconds while the app calculates all the next possible view selections and adds them to the temp view to render.</p>
<p>I have tried to create an external window to try to simulate multithreading in another context, but this still doesnt work?</p>
<p>The ideal solution would be a way to force a webview to render even though it is added to a view which is currently off screen. This even happens if the webview is in an invisible container. It seems there is no way to force it to render.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>

<p>I mean, you can set the webview as hide and open it. </p>

<p>The problem is if I load them off the screen in a container ready to tween them in, they dont render until they are in view.</p>
<p>So what I need is a way to force them to render when they are off screen, not to hide them.</p>
