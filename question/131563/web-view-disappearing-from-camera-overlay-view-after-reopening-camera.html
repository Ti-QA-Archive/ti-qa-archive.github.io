			<h1>Web view disappearing from camera overlay view after reopening camera</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have MyView which contains in it WebView and Label.</p>
<p>I use MyView as camera overlay. </p>
<p>I create only one MyView on application start.</p>
<p>When I open camera first, it shows it good. When I hide camera and open again, only that Label is on it and WebView not.</p>
<p>If I am in simulator I just create new window and add MyView to it and open it.<br>When I again want to show it I create new window and add MyView to it and open window but the problem is the same as on the device, WebView is not shown, only label.</p>
<p>I figured on simulator that if I call <code>SimulatorWindow.remove(MyView)</code> before closing, everything is OK.</p>
<p>But there is no way to tell something like this <code>camera.remove(MyView);</code></p>
<p>So the problem is in the WebView itself. Why is it disappearing all the time? This looks like a major bug because you are expected from WebView to behave as any other View but it is not.</p>

							<p>when you remove the camera by doing a hide, it also destroys the overlay. So you need to completely recreate it…</p>
<p>It actually sound alike you may have a architecture issue. So if above doesn&#39;t work please post some code…</p>

										<p><p>Hey, tnx for answering. Of course it works if I recreate overlay but as I said, when I reopen camera with that same overlay it shows me my overlay but without that WebView. All other elements&#x2F;views of that overlay view are shown.</p>
<p>If I do <code>JSON.stringify(MY_OVERLAY)</code> I get something like this:</p>
<p><code>[{}, {label&amp;#39;s parameter etc}, {another subview&amp;#39;s parameters}]</code></p>
<p>You see that empty object at the beginning, that was WebView.</p>
<p>But first time <code>JSON.stringify(MY_OVERLAY)</code> gives me the data of WebView also.</p>
<p>It just disappears and same is if it is inside a window.</p>
<p>I think I am going to report this as a bug.</p>
