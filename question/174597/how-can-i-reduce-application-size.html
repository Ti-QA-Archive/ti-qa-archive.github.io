							<p>Hi</p>
<p>There are many answers in the Q&amp;A on this subject, here is one of mine;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;149618&#x2F;apk-file-is-too-large-size-93mb">apk file is too large size 9.3MB</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you understand the payload point from the answer I gave, you now need to start working out how much your code and assets add to the size.  Count all the images you have in every dependant folder - including splash screens.  Add the total size required for all other files, then add the amount id code you have.</p>
<p>One if the more obvious things to do is make sure you only add as many images as you actually need, optimise the images, compress if possible and use one of the many optimisation tools you can google for - these can shave 5-60+% from the original size.  Include only what required. If you are not supporting tablets - remove this splash screens, no provision for ldpi devices - get rid of this as well, no landscape - delete.</p>

<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinypng.com&#x2F;">this</a> is one</p>
<p>There are different tools for desktop too, you just need to search.</p>
<p>Another thing to add is: try to provide the images at the exact size you are using it, so don&#39;t use an image of 200x200px when u&#39;ll display it only with a size of 100x100.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the link assist Dan, I should have added one.</p>
<p>The optimisation image tools take your images and process the many times over to see what tweaks can be made.  Often this can be very subtle colour changes so that it is ready for the compression stage.</p>
<p>The compression routines designed to make the files smaller either using;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Lossy compression for jpegs</p>
<p>Image quality is reduced in exchange for lower file size</p>
</li>
<li><p>Lossless compression for pngs</p>
<p>No image is lost during compression in order to make the file sizes smaller.</p>
</li>
</ul>
