			<h1>Titanium Studio Will Not Distribute My iOS App</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Using Xcode 4.3, and the latest Titanium Studio, I keep receiving this error.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[<span class="hljs-type">ERROR</span>] <span class="hljs-type">Code</span> <span class="hljs-type">Sign</span> error: <span class="hljs-type">The</span> identity <span class="hljs-symbol">'iPhone</span> <span class="hljs-type">Distribution</span>: <span class="hljs-type">Photonics</span> <span class="hljs-type">Graphics</span> <span class="hljs-type">Inc</span>.' doesn<span class="hljs-symbol">'t</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">match</span> any valid, non-expired certificate/<span class="hljs-keyword">private</span> key pair in the <span class="hljs-keyword">default</span> keychain
</code></pre><p>All certificates&#x2F;provisioning profiles are valid according to the Apple web-site, and keychain.  They are all in the login keychain along with the public and private keys. It just doesn&#39;t want to compile.  I&#39;ve tried deleting my certificates on the web page, and re-making them, I&#39;ve quadruple checked everything. The app runs fine in the emulator. I&#39;ve tried both distributing options (Ad Hoc, and App Store), both give the error. For now all I really need is Ad Hoc for testing purposes.</p>
<p>Am I missing something? By the way, I am the certificate authority if this helps me correct the problem easily. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<li>How do they appear in xCode?</li>
<li>Certificates aren&#39;t required in the simulator (and it is a simulator)</li>
<li>&#39;latest version of Titanium Studio&#39; is subjective, version numbers are better</li>
<li>This is a distribution certificate not a development certificate you are trying to sign with, right?</li>
<li>Version of the TiMobile SDK you are building against?</li>
<li>Did you import the certificate into just xCode, or just into TiStudio, or into both?</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>well, #1 seems to be you problem.</p>
<p>The fact that xCode doesnt like it will only flow into Titanium, as xCode is the end tool in the packaging process.</p>
<p>Delete the certificate, redownload it from the dev portal. and install in xCode again (normally just double clicking it)</p>

										<p><p>Answer:  The Development and Distribution certificates have to have been created by a request from the computer you&#39;re building on OR if you&#39;re switching development computers, or just have several, the keys must match.  From what I&#39;ve read, you can do this easily by exporting all the necessary stuff from the original certificate requesting computer, then importing on others.</p>

							<p><strong>1.)</strong> The Development profile is valid, but it&#39;s saying the Distribution profile does not have a valid signing identity, not sure why. <strong>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i45.tinypic.com&#x2F;15gc6sn.png</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.)</strong> I know, I was just trying to type that out quickly as I am at work :-&#x2F;</p>
<p><strong>3.)</strong> <strong>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i48.tinypic.com&#x2F;1jtehk.png</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.)</strong> Not really sure, I couldn&#39;t find that information, but I downloaded Titanium Studio and Xcode the other day, that&#39;s all I remember. The image above shows the version of Titanium Studio.</p>
<p><strong>5.)</strong> The certificates went into Keychain, not Xcode.  The provisioning profiles went into the Xcode Organizer.  I didn&#39;t know you <em>could</em> import certificates into Titanium Studio. I just clicked the Distribute icon above the project explorer and followed the instructions.  <strong>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i50.tinypic.com&#x2F;91jxhl.png</strong>  I tried using both the Development and Distribution profiles for this, just for the hell of it, neither worked.</p>
<p>Also here&#39;s a picture of &#39;login&#39; on Keychain.  <strong>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i48.tinypic.com&#x2F;6sfdx2.png</strong></p>
<p>Sorry if i&#39;m missing any information.</p>

							<p>Hi John, try deleting the certificate and profile from keychain and clean titanium studio including its hidden files in your Home directory, reinstall the your certificate and profile. then do a fresh install of titanium it will ask you for keyChain access. provide that and then check and let us know. it that worked.<br><strong>worked for me for developer profile, not sure for distribution.</strong></p>

										<p><p>Thank you for your response.  I finally got it to work by deleting the Distribution certificate on the Apple iOS Provisioning Portal, and requesting a new one from this computer.  I guess it didn&#39;t like the fact that the private keys didn&#39;t match, because the old Distribution certificate was made from another computer.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for all your help Stephen, I realize the formatting of this Q&amp;A is atrocious. I was afraid to delete the old distribution certificate in fear that it would somehow effect the app we have on the app store.  I just requested a new one from this computer though, and added back the provisioning profiles and all was dandy. I&#39;ve learned a lot though, that&#39;s for sure. Next time I&#39;ll give more information, and maybe not add an answer to my own question -_-</p>

										<p><p>John,</p>
<p>I was referencing Ashish&#39;s &#39;answer&#39;, I appologize if you mistook it for a comment directed at you.<br>In the last few weeks, he has entered discussions late and parroted already posted answers.</p>
<p>Apple&#39;s signing process is complicated and messy at best. We have to export signing keys and move them around to multiple machines here in the office.  Its a cluster to be sure.</p>
