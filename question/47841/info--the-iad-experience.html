			<h1>info : the iAd experience</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>My app with iAd capability has been up in the store for more than a week, since July the 20th night. Thanks to the early reports issue with hiding adview object when not available, Ti patched it and it should be a ok with Ti SDK 1.3.3 Build forward. On first run, it crashed couple times while viewing the ad content, but have zero issues since then.</p>
<p>So here&#39;s my experience and the ad statistic after 40,500 requests, about 30k are from USA.</p>
<p>1) Ad only appears (aka impression) on US requests, it will not show up on other countries. [updated: Ad reported showing up on UK requests]</p>
<p>2) Filling rate could be better. Apple simply do not have enough clients in their<br>network to fill the requests. I’ve only seen two different ads so far, the Dove and Nissan. I get about 8-10 views per days per device, the rest are in hiding mode. If i were to click though it, it would be hidden immediately after 3 attempts. The cycle is repeated around 11PM ET. However, late yesterday I’ve seen 3 new ads appeared, they are all app advertising from Apple store. If you view it, you can install the advertised app without having to leave the running app. Pretty cool!</p>
<p>So about 40K requests, I get 9130 impressions, 22.53% Fill Rate, 0.90% CTR, $16.11 eCPM, a total revenue of $147.13, and the numbers are declining. Nothing like the $146.55 eCPM, $1,372.20 a day earning you read when it first launched. :)</p>
<p>My app is a technology newsreader. To make room for the ad, the tabbed bar is hidden on article display. The entire article is a remote webview with abilities to trigger twitter Xauth, email share, front size, image gallery and video functions from app.js eventlisteners. </p>
<p>You can see how the ad run here, it&#39;s free, hence the ad. ?<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunes.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;slashgear&#x2F;id367747163?mt=8</p>
<p>PS. If you have app with iAd, please post your stats here. </p>

							<p>A few updates on iAd codes. I got a few complaints on app crashed, and went though few more rounds of checking, here&#39;s couple notes to deal with adview. </p>
<p>1) Important!! The adview only worked for &gt;= IOS 3.2, you would want to add the exception, and the subsequent codes for compatible devices only </p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (parseFloat(Titanium.Platform.version) &gt;= <span class="hljs-number">3.2</span>){
  var iad = Ti.UI.iOS.createAdView({<span class="hljs-string">width:</span> <span class="hljs-string">'auto'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">height:</span> <span class="hljs-string">'auto'</span>});
  -------
  ------
}
</code></pre><p>2)watch out for the adview load event, bad timing may cause tableview to crash if the user close the childview before adview animate the load event function.</p>
<p>I have a webview with load event, which animates the adview to bottom:0, but the adview object and adview load event was defined beforehand. That caused tableview to crash if user closed the tableview child view too quicky before webview loaded. </p>
<p>In that case, you would want to define adview and load event inside the webview load event listener.</p>
