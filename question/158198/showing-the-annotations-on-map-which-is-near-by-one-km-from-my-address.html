			<h1>Showing the annotations on map which is near by one km from my address.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I am not much expert in Titanium. If anyone having the solution please share with me. I need to create a application which will show the annotation on google map who are near by my place surrounding one kilometer. The address are stored in database or in remote. Now the scenario is like that, all the address are showing on table view now from table view row if I tap any one cell&#x2F;row then in detail page I need to display the annotation who are near by my place. Here my place means the cell I have pressed having address.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
