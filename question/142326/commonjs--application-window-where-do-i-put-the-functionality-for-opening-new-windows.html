			<p>In the blank template: </p>
<p><code>&amp;#x2F;ui&amp;#x2F;common&amp;#x2F;FirstView.js</code></p>
<p>contains the views; and I would assume any other additional views.. </p>
<p>in <code>ui&amp;#x2F;handheld&amp;#x2F;ApplicationWindow.js</code> first view is included and opened.  </p>
<p>My general question is, when adding additional views, where does the code to open something like &quot;SecondView.js&quot; live?  Should it be in ApplicationWindow? FirstView? Should I create another &quot;ApplicationWindow.js&quot; for each view in my mobile App?   I am hoping for some general examples here to get a better understanding of the commonJS pattern as exemplified here and to use it appropriately.      Thanks!</p>

							<p>I think the issue here is that you are thinking in terms of some sort of order, but its not necessarily how you should be thinking about it. You create a commonjs module for any window or major component in your app. That commonjs module is specific to that window or component. How you get to that window is completely up to you and your app. The modules are completely independent of each other, thats the power of structuring your code in this way. You could open FirstView.js from inside ApplicationWindow.js or if you needed the same view from inside some other window you&#39;ve created, you could do that as well. You require and use the module whenever and wherever you need it.</p>
<p>Sometimes its hard to get a feeling for commonjs from the default templates. Take a look at the KitchenSink code and see a more complete example of how we use commonjs in a pretty complex app.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Anthony.  I guess I am missing how at each level do you include a module?  I find myself running into scope issues when adding functionality to a button in a second view, or third view.. I&#39;m not even sure how they&#39;re all supposed to work together or where to find on the internet where that&#39;s explained.</p>

										<p><p>Like I said, a module is exclusive to the stuff you put in it. If you put a button in Window1, then you should not be trying to add functionality to that button from another window. Everything is separate.</p>
<p>Check out this quick example I put together. There are 3 windows. Main, Foo, and Bar. From Main you can open either Foo or Bar. From Foo you can open Bar, and from Bar you can open Foo. Click on any window label to close the window. All Windows are in separate modules, but easily required and called from any of the other windows.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Anthony.  I was actually going about it this way, but did not understand how you might close bar window within itself (like having an exit button) or how they passed data back and forth through one another, but I&#39;m guessing I would just instantiate a variable in application window and set its value in the module?  Either way, I appreciate the insights you provide here.</p>

										<p><p>The exit button should just close the window object that you are returning from the module. As for passing data, you can do that in the object create call. ie:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> barWin = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> BarWindow({biz:<span class="hljs-string">'baz'</span>});
</code></pre><p>then in the BarWindow module, you&#39;d just read them in.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">BarWindow</span>(<span class="hljs-params">_args</span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> biz = _args.biz;
};
<span class="hljs-built_in">module</span>.exports = BarWindow;
</code></pre><p>If you need to talk across windows, then you can use application level events to fire off data to another module.</p>

										<p><p>This is great.  I guess another distinction I realized is that all additional modules should be created with self being a window, and not a view as you can&#39;t really close views (you can hide them or remove them)</p>

										<p><p>I wouldn&#39;t consider that a hard rule. There are often times when I know Im going to have a complex component that I want to modularize so I&#39;ll drop it in its own commonjs module. Also, if I have a component that is going to be needed in a number of different places I&#39;ll modularize it. A TableView that is either going to have some complex rows or is going to be reused a number of times is a good example. Just remember that you&#39;re returning the actual component itself from the commonjs module, so you interact with it in the same way. You can remove, add, and change things the same way you would had your written all the code right into the current window.</p>

										<p><p>All this si good stuff… I would still recommend that you try and wrap you head around the concepts around MVC. You dont have to adopt it completely but you should understand it since Alloy in coming and most major development frameworks are constructed using some sort of separation of concerns and separation of business logic from presentation layer</p>
