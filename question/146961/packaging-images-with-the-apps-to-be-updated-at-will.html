			<h1>Packaging images with the apps to be updated at will...</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Another question regarding images sent out with the app when downloaded from itunes or the google market place…</p>
<p>I want to be able to package the app with images however i will want to update some of these images after the app has been downloaded…</p>
<p>As the resource directory is readonly I am thinking that the images i will want to update will have to be packaged in the applications data directory… so now the obvious question is, can you do that? Can I create an app and place on itunes with the application directory pre-populated with data?</p>

							<p>Hi Joe,<br>the resource folder is read only and the application folder  is on start empty. You can copy your assets from resources folder to app folder – but why?? You can delivere assets from resources and from app folder …</p>

										<p><p>Thanks.. this does answer my predicament..</p>
<p>Say I have a page displaying data and a few images from a hotel: the hotel may wish to change the image on my app.. to do this I would need the user to download a new image.. ideally it would better to write this new image over the old image…</p>
<p>however as the old image is the image packaged with the app, it will be in the resource folder, ie readonly…</p>

							<p>Is the best way to handle this to:</p>
<p>1 - Send out the app with a default set of images in the resource folder</p>
<p>2 - When the user views a page, the said page checks for a newer image on my server, if newer images exists download to the application directory and display said image</p>
<p>3 - Now when the page in Q is loaded again,  the app checks for a file in the application directory, if one exists use that, if one does not exist fallback to the image in the resource directory.</p>
<p>This system will allow me to update key images in my app but still enable me to package my app out to the users with some images preloaded, ie they wont have to download a bunch of images to just start using the image.</p>

										<p><p>Because as far as i can see, the application directory is built on the phione after the app is installed, ie you can never send out an app with the application directory preloaded with data…</p>
