							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Have you had this problem before or has it just started?</p>
<p>Have you tried logging in to Titanium Studio app (bottom right of the window) does your name appear there?  If not you should be able to click this and login with your details.</p>

										<p><p>OK - weird.</p>
<p>If things work with SDKs other than 3.0.0 then it most likely points to the specific SDK that is causing an erroneous error.</p>
<p>Things to check; (some you most likely have already tried.</p>
<ul>
<li>Menu; <strong>Help</strong> &gt; <strong>Titanium Studio</strong> &gt; <strong>Run Diagnostic Test…</strong> does everything listed look ok?  Does the 3.0.0 SDK reside in the location it suggests on your computer?</li>
<li>Menu; Check for all updates (both entries)</li>
<li>Menu; <strong>Help</strong> &gt; <strong>Install Specific Titanium SDK…</strong>, Choose &quot;Install from Update Stream&quot;, is 3.0.0 already installed?  If not install it.</li>
<li>Remove the 3.0.0 SDK and re-install it again.</li>
</ul>

							<p>Any solution for this problem? Having this issue with Titanium Studio, build: 3.1.0.201304151600 either by creating a new project with SDK 3.1.0 or by upgrading project from SDK 2.1.3. Using Windows 7 Pro 64bit</p>
<p>I have also created a new titanium workspace but it doesn&#39;t help.</p>

										<p><p>Looks like this is a known issue, to be fixed in Titanium Studio 3.2.0: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TISTUD-3642?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel</p>
<p>The workaround is to change password not to contain any special characters and them I was able to build SDK 3.1.0 projects.</p>

										<p><p>@Umair, voting everyone else&#39;s answers down so yours can go to the top is rude and unhelpful.  This is a 6 month old question you have come to and your attempts to make your answer look better is both shameful and disrespectful.</p>
<p>I suggest you up vote the answers back to were they were before you got here as this behaviour will not be tolerated.</p>

							<p>Hey All,</p>
<p>I am facing a similar issue. I&#39;ve just installed Titanium Studio for the first time on my Windows 7 Enterprise (64bit) and all went well, except that I cannot create new projects using 3.0.0.GA SDK. Getting same error as Somaraj mentioned &quot;Login failed:….&quot;. I can create new projects without any issues when I use 2.1.4.GA SDK.</p>
<p>As suggested by Malcolm, I removed the 3.0.0.GA SDK. Restarted Titanium Studio and it showed that an update is available. I installed fresh update and still the same error. I then removed the 3.0.0.GA SDK again and installed it manually via &quot;Install Specific Titanium SDK&quot; but still getting the same error.</p>
<p>Please advice what else can be tried to fix this issue with 3.0.0.GA SDK.</p>
<p>Appreciate your help. Thanks!</p>
