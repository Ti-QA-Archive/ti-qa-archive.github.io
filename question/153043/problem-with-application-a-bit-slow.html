		<section>
			<p>Hi, I&#39;ve got a little problem with my application with some slow transitions between screen for tabgroup especially. I think I know where it commes from so I checked this video.<br><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeopro.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;advanced-titanium-mobile-development">Performance optimization</a><br>And I saw that &quot;<strong>Don&#39;t parse JSON packaged with your application. Put it inline in Javascript</strong>&quot;. I don&#39;t really understand what he wanna mean.</p>
<p>Actually, I&#39;ve got a webservice who send me a JSON object, after receive it in the App, I defenetly have to parse it. So I don&#39;t understand, maybe because english is not my first language. If someone could help me and explain me about it, I will really appreciate it.</p>

							<p>As Manuel says, the recommendation about JSON probably doesn&#39;t apply in your situation. Then again, are you re-fetching and parsing that JSON data each time the screen loads? If so, that would certainly cause a big slow-down. Cache the data locally (in a file or database, or just in memory).</p>
<p>Screen transition slowness is likely due to other factors, notably complexity of your UI. You didn&#39;t mention whether you&#39;re developing for iOS, Android, or both. Optimization will vary a bit, with Android being more sensitive to UI complexity. The optimization steps you could take really depend on what you&#39;re doing in your app. Without knowing more, I can&#39;t offer too much more than broad generalizations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limit the number and size of images</li>
<li>Avoid transparency (set solid background colors instead)</li>
<li>Avoid rounded borders, especially on Android</li>
<li>Avoid gradients, especially on Android</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m not saying never use these things. They&#39;re all valid app components. But the more complex your UI, the more work the device must do to render your UI. You have very tight memory constraints with mobile. And mobile devices generally lack dedicated GPUs. </p>
<p>Finally, what the JSON recommendation is saying is that given a choice between hard-coding variable values in one of your JavaScript files versus shipping a JSON configuration file that gets parsed at runtime, choose the JavaScript file approach.</p>

										<p><p>Yeah you &#39;re right. Thanks Tim to reply to me.<br>My application is cross platform, and yes I am parsing my json object everyTime, I am launching the app. Because I need to have some data up to date all the time. But when I don&#39;t have any connexion I am using the cache. But the important thing is that this app need a connexion to work at the final step.<br>So I am sorting my JSON object before opening my first window and after that it&#39;s done.</p>
<p>So I am not using that much image for that it&#39;s ok.<br>For transparency, I am using it a bit, I am using rounded borders and gradients (gradients just for Android to simulate a NavBar and put the logo of the app).</p>
<p>But I just figured out that my app doesn&#39;t close some windows, so I think that&#39;s not helping either. I am gonna stay dry first. And let&#39;s after if it&#39;s still slow. But thanks anyway for your advices.</p>

							<p>It means, that you should not store JSON data as a file into your resources. It&#39;s better to read JSON straight from the code.</p>
<p>This is not relevant for your use case since you parse remote JSON data.</p>
<p>From here it&#39;s really hard to say what can cause your transitions issue. Maybe you want to share some code.</p>

							<p>I&#39;d also add to that - if you&#39;re fetching JSON data from a remote server for a Window (within a tab) then ensure you&#39;re making that remote server call AFTER the tabbed Window has loaded. You can either use the &#39;focus&#39; event or if you must, a setTimeout(). This ensures that any remote data fetching won&#39;t be blocking your UI.</p>
