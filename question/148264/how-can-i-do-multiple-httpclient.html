							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Multiple simultaneous asynchronous httpClient calls are never a good idea. It is not even easy to say.</p>
<p>The problems;</p>
<ul>
<li>Managing the returned data is difficult to do well</li>
<li>Database access is synchronous so locks occur, if you are calling it from all sides this can and will block things</li>
<li>There is no guarantee that any of the events will be completed to move the app on after successful data downloads</li>
</ul>
<p>The possible solutions;</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a single api and return all the data in one go - <strong>best solution</strong></li>
<li>Return the data but hold in objects and when all downloaded then add to the database</li>
<li>Make the httpClient calls synchronous by chaining, not efficient but more reliable</li>
</ul>
<p>This is certainly the best plan if you can do it <em>&quot;Create a single api and return all the data in one go&quot;</em>.</p>

										<p><p>Quick question first.  Are the existing feeds inside your control?  By this I mean are you responsible for their generation from a script language and possible data coming from a database you access directly?</p>

							<p>HI Nazir, creating multiple HTTP client can lead to many problem as these calls are async and there would be problem in managing response from multiple objects.</p>
<p>whats the problem with single object and can you explain use case for multiple objects?</p>
<p>what have you tried so far and where did you face problem?</p>
