			<h1>Just launched Titanium Studio - Dashboard is completely empty/blank</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi. I&#39;m eager to get started with Titanium. Installed everything, launched titanium, and tried following along with the &quot;Quick Start: Configuring&quot; instructions. I can see in the sample image there&#39;s all kinds of fun things to click on and play with in the Dashboard. But not fer me. :(</p>
<p>I get the dashboard, but it&#39;s just a lovely, ever-so-slightly-diamond-patterned gray wall. I&#39;m feeling a bit crazy about this. I uninstalled and reinstalled. I did a search or two. I tried sacrificing a goat. Nothing. What gives? This is not the most thrilling introduction to a new development platform. I&#39;m on Win 7, Titanium v3.0.1.201212181159, using the latest Java JDK 6u38. Help.</p>

<p>Do you use a firewall, which is blocking <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;studio.appcelerator.com">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;studio.appcelerator.com</a> ?</p>
<p>Try to open http:&#x2F;&#x2F;studio.appcelerator.com in IE.</p>

										<p><p>Hey- I appreciate the help. I tried to open  http:&#x2F;&#x2F;studio.appcelerator.com in IE, but it is also just blank. I&#39;m using windows firewall, but it shows that it is allowing titaniumstudio.exe. I don&#39;t see &quot; http:&#x2F;&#x2F;studio.appcelerator.com&quot; listed anywhere in firewall settings.</p>

							<p>I have the same issue.  I am using Windows 8 Pro that has IE10 installed.  studio.appcelerator.com doesn&#39;t come up in IE10.  Need some way to tell Titanium to use a different installed browser because it seems to try to use IE which is broken OR Appcelerator could update their website to work properly in ALL the major browsers.</p>

							<p>ATTENTION - SOLUTION TO THIS ANNOYING PROBLEM</p>
<p>After hours of mucking around I managed to fix this issue and it is a quick fix. Go into IE and go into your compatibility view settings. Uncheck the setting that makes all websites viewed in compatibility mode. It wont display correctly in compatibility mode. Hope this saves many hours of confusion.</p>
