			<h1>Minification / Combining Javascript files (Juicerize) performance</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I recently ran a few tests on the speed differences between the Ti.include vs combining all the JS files into one and thought people might be interested.</p>
<p>This was just for a basic shell framework (5 tabs a bit of code setting up windows&#x2F;tabs etc).</p>
<p>Running this on the simulator the quickest boot time was 60ms.</p>
<p>If I combined the 12 JS files into one using the Juicerize tool and that combo file is app.js the quickest boot time went to about 56ms.</p>
<p>So it gave about a 6% improvement in the startup sequence.</p>
<p>Nothing amazing, but the 12 files were not particularly heavy lifters so YMMV.</p>
<p>Thought it&#39;d be an interesting test.</p>
<p>Now I&#39;m not sure on the full release build if any form of minification is included on the files before they&#39;re packaged&#x2F;sucked into Titanium proper. I&#39;d assume so, at least things like stripping all whitespaces, comments etc.</p>
<p>Anyway, perhaps the gurus at Appcelerator can shed a bit of light.</p>
<p>Rgds</p>

							<p>What I miss is some kind of lazy loading. Right now, &quot;include&quot; has to be on top of JS file and can&#39;t be used in function (or at least isn&#39;t working as expected when it is used in function). I haven&#39;t yet tried to use CommonJS and &quot;require&quot; … did anyone used it and how are your experiences?</p>

										<p><p>Yeah you can&#39;t use it within a functional scope as all included variables are added to the global namespace (if you search on this I had the same problem and someone explained same to me :-) </p>
<p>Lazy loading would be by opening a window using the &quot;url&quot; parameter. UNFORTUNATELY this creates a new execution context.. (causes its own grief for sync&#x2F;sharing data… you can of course fire events between contexts or attach data to the creation event..)</p>
<p>I&#39;ve not used the require, I tend to use Ti.include to pull in all my individual MVC type (I have a js file for the layout and a js file for the views controller doing all the event handlers&#x2F;actions).</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m doing the same thing (MVC, with OOP JS), but app loads slow when there are a lot of file (and I have them a lot :) ).</p>
