			<p>Hello!<br>I get this error when im trying to upload my app update to ITC.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">This bundle <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> invalid. The key CFBundleShortVersionString <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> Info.plist <span class="hljs-type">file</span> must <span class="hljs-keyword">contain</span> a higher <span class="hljs-property">version</span> than <span class="hljs-keyword">that</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> previously uploaded <span class="hljs-property">version</span>.
</code></pre><p>The CFBundleShortVersionString for the previous version is, according to ITC, 1.0. The bundle version i 1.0.1. </p>
<p>Now, if i look at CFBundleShortVersionString in the archive for the new app version, it is 1.0.2, just like the new version i prepped in ITC. I have been struggling with this for days now, and can&#39;t seem to figure it out. What is causing this? I have tried to add BundleVersion to info.plist with a higher number than the previous version without any luck…<br>Titanium SDK 1.8.3 V8. XCode 4.2</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

							<p>Anton,  </p>
<p>There was a problem with the CFBundleShortVersionString not being increased and always being 1.0 <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-7674">TIMOB-7674</a></p>
<p>This was resolved, then it was discovered that for older products that never had a CFBundleShortVersionString added when the project was created, the value was 1.0.</p>
<p>Both issues have been resolved in 2.0.x.  I would suggest you download the update if you can (from 1.8.x to 2.0.1 should require minimal refactoring and modifications)</p>

										<p><p>If too many issues arise with a move to 2.0.1 at this time, you can take a look at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_mobile&#x2F;pull&#x2F;1516">Pull-1516</a> and maybe modify your SDK to implement the fixes.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you for your response. Will try to fix it according to Pull-1516.<br>Thing is, i look at info.plist, but the CFBundleShortVersionString value is indeed higher than the previous version…</p>

<li>Have you updated your application loader available from itunesconnect to 2.5.1?</li>
<li>Can you open the xarchive for the last submitted version and look at the version numbers in that info.plist? If by chance the previous version 1.01 that would be the same as 1.1 in the eyes of apple.  If this is the case, an arbitrary bump to 1.2 would resolve this.</li>

										<p><p>You know, there are two info.plist files in each xarchive bundle.<br>The one at the root of the xarchive only ever has the cfbundleshortversionstring while the one inside the .app itself should have both version strings in it.  </p>
<p>Be sure you are looking at the info.plist in the .app for the xarchive you are trying to submit and for the one you already submitted in the past. So looking for 4 data points:</p>
<h4 id="published-xarchive">Published xarchive</h4>
<ul>
<li>CFBundleShortVersionString</li>
<li>CFBundleVersion</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="new-xarchive">New xarchive</h4>
<ul>
<li>CFBundleShortVersionString</li>
<li>CFBundleVersion</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>The inside info.plist must have both values to now be submitted to iTunesConnect.  If it is missing, then need to update the TiMobile SDK to a version that includes the patches mentioned above, or patch your 1.8.3 to include the fixes.  Honestly, the fixes are not that serious, just remember its python, and python gets mean with whitespace issues.</p>

							<p>Keepit simple!  In tiapp.xml you changed from 1.0. to 1.1., recompile and in ITC you make a new version 1.1 and then you can upload to new one. Thats all.</p>
