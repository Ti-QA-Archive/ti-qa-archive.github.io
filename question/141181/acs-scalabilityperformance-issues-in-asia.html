			<h1>ACS Scalability/Performance Issues in Asia</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, </p>
<p>Our iOS app developed by Titanium Mobile SDK with the backend engine using Appcelerator Cloud Service is now launched in App Store, Thailand. Our app recently was featured in a national tv show, which leaded to many app downloads and traffic to the ACS that I used as a backend. I notice that the app starts to run very slow and has issues with network when there are more than 500 concurrently users :(. </p>
<p>I am wondering if anyone has this scaling problem with ACS before and how can I move forward in term of addressing this issue. I found out that the servers that run ACS is located in the US (possibly Amazon) and this might be one of the reasons for the long wait-time. Will it be possible to set our clouds so that we can get the ACS servers somewhere in Asia like Japan or Singapore? I would love to start and continue paying for ACS if this issue can be ironed out. If not, it would be a lot time-consuming for us to create our backend from scratch :(</p>
<p>Thank you very much for any advices or suggestions!<br>Kavin</p>

							<p>Hi </p>
<p>Where are you located ? Are you still experiencing any performance issues? ACS autoscales when there are a lot of load. Can you please email me with your app info ?Wkong@appcelerator.com?</p>

										<p><p>Thank you very much Wei Kong. We just sent you an email. We are based in Bangkok, Thailand and our users will be requesting ACS mainly from Thailand, South East Asia region. We will be really greatly appreciated if you can guide us on anything. The next show that will cover our app will come really soon. Really afraid and hope that the system can hold it together…</p>
