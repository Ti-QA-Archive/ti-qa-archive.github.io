			<h1>Make things work for Xcode 6 and latest IOS SDK</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, I just recently updated my Xcode to 6.0.1 and installed the latest version for SDK and simulator.</p>
<p>However, I cannot build and run ios application directly in Studio since then. It will always tell me the following error:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-string">[INFO]</span> :   Focusing the iOS Simulator
<span class="hljs-string">[ERROR]</span> :  Project failed to build after 22s 765ms
</code></pre><p>I found the following article provided a clever walk around for this problem:<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tidev.io&#x2F;2014&#x2F;06&#x2F;03&#x2F;using-xcode-6-for-titanium&#x2F;</p>
<p>which simply build the ios application in studio and run it using &#39;build&#x2F;ios&#x2F;XXX.xproject&#39; file in Xcode because the reason leading to this question is the studio is not compatible with the latest simulator.</p>
<p>However, my question is:<br>Is that the only way solving the problem? I haven&#39;t yet find and question related to Xcode 6 in the community and any issue trackers related to this problem. Hope it can be solve soon. Thanks!</p>

							<p>We have seen occasional reports of this problem. However, prior to the release we were unable to reliably reproduce the issue and determine an exact cause. I believe that <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-17601">TIMOB-17601</a> is the related ticket. Our workaround will be to extend the time we wait for the simulator to launch, as the issue seems most common on slower computers.</p>
<p>BTW, we&#39;ve had reports that Objective-C &#x2F; Xcode projects (no Titanium involved) also occasionally experience this same issue. The iOS8 simulators take a long time to load and sometimes simply fail to load.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Tim.</p>
<p>My case is that the simulator isn&#39;t even running, no matter how many time I runs the application. My developing environment is the latest iMac so it won&#39;t be a very slow machine. I had no problem running the same application on Xcode 5 and older version of simulator before.</p>
<p>But any way, hope it can be fixed soon:) Thanks for your all good work on the fantastic project!</p>
