			<h1>Upload Photos to my webserver for existing site!</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,<br>I have a mobile optimized dating website. The only problem i got is that i cannot upload photos from my iphone.The photo upload button is disabled.</p>
<p>So can i use titanium framework (by using xhr photo upload in kitchhen sink sample) to do the job? Now i use safari to access the site. The titanium will generate the installable app.(im aware of this and its ok)</p>
<p>I dont want to rebuild my whole site natively for iTunes store.Suppose i use this only with my friends with Ad-hock distribution. So can i link my web version with the web view and then use titanium<br>to upload the images?</p>
<p>The only problem i found is, how do i reference the image name to member photo name which is automatically generated by my sites php script?.</p>
<p>If im correct, i need to grab my dating sites, member  usernames from the web view, and then use it in my iphone and pass it back to my photo upload script?</p>
<p>Dont laugh at me, i really need this.</p>
<p>Thank you all</p>

							<p>Yes, your existing website would have to pass the data (usernames, IDs, etc.) through a HTTPClient into your app, then your app would use that and the uploaded picture (Through Titanium&#39;s Ti.Media modules) and send it back to the PHP Script, which would upload it to your server.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure how much of a change that would be on your current code, but I imagine not too much as all you need is to set up the listeners and catchers for when the data and image is sent&#x2F;caught.</p>
