			<h1>Android app runs in emulator but packaging fails</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am working on my second Android app.  The first one works in the emulator and correctly generates the .apk file to be installed on my device.  In general, I like Titanium and believe it will enable me to be very productive building cross-platform apps.<br>My second app is no more complex than the first, and runs correctly in the emulator, however, when I try to create the android package it fails.  There is no indication of failure - the Ti Dev window says &#39;Creating android distribution&#39;, and after a few seconds that message disappears.  No .apk file has been generated, however.  I see no logging information or other indication of failure.<br>Can someone just point me in the correct direction to figure out what is going on?  The lack of useful feedback from Ti Dev is very frustrating.</p>
<p>Platform is Win7 64-bit, up-to-date Android SDK, using API 2.2, and Ti Dev 1.2.2.  Tried with several API versions and emulator settings, all run on the emulator, but no .apk.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Herb</p>

<p>Remember to set appropriate question tags; your question will reach more people. :)</p>
<p>Try running TiDev using the debug switch, and also select <code>trace</code> on the run emulator screen.</p>
<p>See <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;troubleshooting_your_installation.html#titanium_developer_debug_tools">Titanium Developer Debug Tools</a></p>

										<p><p>I figured out the solution. I deleted the keystores file and regenerated all of my android package keys, and then the packaging worked. I can only assume that I mistyped the alias during the original key creation. I could find no evidence in the trace or any log file that there was no matching entry in the keystores file. It was very frustrating to spend time on such a trivial mistake.</p>
