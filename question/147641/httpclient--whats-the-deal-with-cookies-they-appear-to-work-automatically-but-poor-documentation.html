			<h1>HTTPClient &gt; What&#39;s the deal with Cookies? They appear to work automatically, but poor documentation.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>This is the first &quot;painful&quot; problem I&#39;ve had with Titanium in almost 6 weeks of intensive use. I would be seriously grateful for any help here as I&#39;m having one (actually 2) of those never-ending days of stress.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve spent the past 2 days building a &quot;cookie jar&quot; so that I could maintain a &quot;session&quot; with my server, although this should be about 2 hours of work I&#39;ve kept running into problems. I&#39;ve just now noticed that cookies appear to function automatically within Titanium and my work has been colliding with it.</p>
<p>I now feel a bit stuck on how to proceed as the documentation isn&#39;t giving me much, so my questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How can I access the saved cookies?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How can I make the cookies persistent?</strong> (in the same way that Ti.App.Properties is persistent)</li>
</ul>
<p>The only documentation that hints that cookies are automatically handled is just this one method:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Network.HTTPClient-method-clearCookies</p>

							<p>You could always manipulate the HTTP request and response headers directly.</p>
<p>Get your cookies after a response is received from the server:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> rawcookie = myHttpClient.getResponseHeader(<span class="hljs-string">'Set-Cookie'</span>);
</code></pre><p>Then store the cookie value in Ti.App.Properties (or in a file if you prefer).  You will need to parse out the domain, path, and expiration information.  You will probably want to honor those attributes in your code, although if you control the back-end service, you can decide for yourself how to handle them.</p>
<p>When it&#39;s time to make a request using the cookie, just do this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">myHttpClient.setRequestHeader (<span class="hljs-string">'Cookie'</span>, cookiestr);
</code></pre><p>(assuming cookiestr holds the cookie as stored in Ti.App.Properties)</p>
<p>I found an <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;9106102&#x2F;how-to-access-all-http-response-headers">example</a> of the retrieval of the headers.  If the information in this thread still holds, you may have to use getAllResponseHeaders() under android and getResponseHeader() on iOS.</p>

										<p><p>The problem is that I call <code>myHttpClient.setRequestHeader (&amp;#39;Cookie&amp;#39;, cookiestr);</code> it ADDS it to the cookie that Titanium automatically sets, thus I get the same cookie twice with potentially 2 values!</p>

							<p>I&#39;m in the same issue. Building an app (iOS, Android) which have to connect to a server (username&#x2F;pass validation) and get the contents.</p>
<p>In my case, servers response as cookie value includes: idSession value, path and HttpOnly. There is no information about expires, domain, etc. I put on three different calls to setRequestHeader those fields (session, path and HttpOnly) but I keep getting an 401 unauthorized again. </p>
<p>One point is if I add to the request username and password values (on every request) it works, but I consider this is not a good practice. Another point is building the request in a web browser it works as expected.</p>
<p>Any idea about dealing with the server from Titanium? </p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

										<p><p>Please start a new question rather than hijacking this one.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;re dealing with path and HttpOnly at the client level.  Those properties of the cookie are sent by the server to the client to tell the client how to use the cookie.  The client doesn&#39;t send them back.</p>
<p>You might want to post a sample request&#x2F;response, along with a very small snippet of your code that uses the cookie.</p>
