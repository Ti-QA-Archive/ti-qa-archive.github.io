			<h1>Best Practice: Do closed windows reside in memory?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>While I&#39;m not new to JS programming, I certainly am to the idea of Windows and Views. The app I&#39;m working on will have a number of windows that may or may not be needed (such as logging in or choosing a profile), but will be needed more often than not in a browsing session.</p>
<p>Can I create all of my windows, input fields, table views (with no data), etc and then keep them closed? What type of impact does that have on the app performance?</p>
<p>I&#39;m using events to determine when to show and hide windows, but the only other option I can see is to create a function that builds the window – after first checking to see if it exists – and that seems like a headache of maintaining global variables.</p>
<p>Appreciate any advice on the issue…</p>
<p>Thanks!<br>nate</p>

							<p>I rad somewhere that javascript handles all the garbage collection for you so you need not worry about such things.</p>
<p>When I am not using the resources, I can set it to NULL. For example, win = NULL; </p>

							<p>I was doing (creating the resources at the start of the app and add them only when needed  ) but on my 2nd gen ipod this lead to slowness and sometimes to crash -  the crash reporter logged low memory when the mail background program kicked in. </p>
<p>So I started to create the resources when I needed them, and things improved.</p>
<p>Also for all the sounds I use, I make a release when not needed, and when I use images I try to use the exact image size I need and optimize them before with ImageOptim.</p>
