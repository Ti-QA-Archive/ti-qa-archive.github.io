		<section>
			<p>Hi guys</p>
<p>Been struggling for a few days with this now.</p>
<p>Im trying to configure Titanium to run an Android app on Device and Emulator.<br>Its been quite a while since i made an Android app so all of my SDK were out of date.</p>
<p>I have downloaded everything in the Android SDK Manager (all 15 Gig of it)</p>
<p>My issue is a bit strange once i install&#x2F;configure the sdk via the Titanium Dashboard all seems fine i get  the green tick which says &#39;Latest Installed Version: 4.4.2&#39; But if i try to run an android app in an emulator i have no success then after a few attempts i receive the error that no SDK are not installed.</p>
<p>If i then go back to the dashboard the Android icon is red.<br>If i click &#39;install or update Android SDK&#39; i then see all of the sdk checkboxes are unchecked apart from 4.1.2. .<br>If i click configure it then appears to install it all again. But once i try to run an app it will give me the same error stating that i do not have the sdk installed.</p>
<p>Im going in circles.</p>
<p>i have tried opening Terminal and typing ti setup and then checking my Titanium Environment i have no red crosses on anything in the list.</p>
<p>Im also unable to get an android device recognised by titanium, (i have enabled usb debugging etc)</p>
<p>has anyone experienced this before i tried searching around but couldn&#39;t find a resolution to this issue.</p>
<p>any help would be great</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Gary</p>
