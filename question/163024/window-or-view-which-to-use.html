			<p>I am creating an application in Titanium Studio and at first I&#39;m using a window for each different screen.<br>Where can I find <em>articles that talk about semantics</em> in Titanium Studio (I&#39;m developing for android)?</p>
<p>If anyone has certain knowledge and experience with android and Titanium, <em>would like to know opinions</em> on my question: Window or View, which to use?</p>

							<div><p>You can add multiple view in single window to minimize number of windows. Sometimes you only add  UI object on windows and there is no need for using views. Views are easy to handle layouts and customization .</p>

							<p>Its necessary to have an idea what  are views and windows  before Implementing them . I hope it will clear your confusions </p>
<p>###Views -<br>Views are containers that host visual elements such as controls or other views. Views can have their properties customized, such as their border color and radius, can fire events such as swipe events or touches, and can optionally contain a hierarchy or other views as children. In Titanium, most views are specialized to perform both a visual function and set of interaction behaviors such as Table View or Coverflow View. Views are always named with the suffix View.</p>
<p>###Windows -<br>Windows are typically top-level visual constructs that are the main part of your interface. An application will always have at least one window and windows can take different shapes and sizes, can have display and interaction properties such as fullscreen or modal and can be customized, such as changing their opacity or background color. Windows themselves are views and also inherit a views properties, functions and events. There are a few specialization of Windows such as a Tab Group which offer additional behavior beyond the basic Window.</p>
