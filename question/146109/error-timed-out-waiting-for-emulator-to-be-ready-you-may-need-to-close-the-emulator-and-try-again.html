<li>Open a terminal (osx) or a command prompt (windows).</li>
<li>With an emulator open and any android devices disconnected, type <code>adb devices</code>. It should report the emulators it can see.</li>

										<p><p>the other commands <code>adb kill-server</code> and <code>adb start-server</code> often helps to reset the adb daemon, which needs to be done more often than one would expect.</p>

							<p>Try opening up your AVD Manager and removing&#x2F;deleting all existing AVD. Then go back to studio and launch your project again. A new AVD should be created for your project and will hopefully run without issues.</p>

										<p><p>I did this before but it doesnt work i have found alternative to this if i just get the apk file than i can test the same Directly on the cell rather than depending on Emulator any idea about location of apk file its somewhere at </p>
<p>build&#x2F;android&#x2F;bin </p>
<p>but i m not getting the apk file at this  place can we get apk file without running the project ??&#x2F;</p>
