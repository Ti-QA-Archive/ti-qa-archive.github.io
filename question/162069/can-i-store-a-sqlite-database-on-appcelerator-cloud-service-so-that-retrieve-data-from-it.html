			<h1>Can I store a sqlite database on Appcelerator Cloud Service so that retrieve data from it?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi there, I&#39;m new to titanium. I am working on developing an android app which retrieves data from a local sqlite database (containing  10 tables). The app is working fine and I&#39;m in the process of tweaking it. </p>
<p>I was wondering if I could use the Appcelerator Cloud Service to store the sqlite database and the app could query the database and retrieve the data from there. Is this possible? </p>
<p>I would prefer not to use json as i&#39;m not yet comfortable with it and I&#39;ve already invested a lot of time creating the database in sqlite. Would be grateful if somebody helped me out here.</p>

							<p>Straight answer: no</p>
<p>ACS Cloud Services is NOT a provider of remotely hosted sqlite databases.</p>

<p>You will have one heck of a crappy experience around here then.  Working with data, in javascript, pretty much means you need to.</p>
<p><code>as i&amp;#39;m not yet comfortable</code></p>
<p>Get comfortable with it if you want to continue down this career path.</p>
<p><code>invested a lot of time creating the database in sqlite.</code></p>
<p>sqlite is for LOCAL storage of data. Local being on the device, or local on a server (although, I&#39;m not inclined to run sqlite on a server).  What ever the case, a remotely hosted server needs middleware, either in the form of a driver, or in the form of an API that allows the client to access&#x2F;query the data.</p>

										<p><p>It depends: very big data (I think about more the 1M) you can store in JSON, but you has alternatives with sqlite. Maybe it is possible to store binary assets in cloud (dropbox?) Rainer</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Stephen and Rainer. I was afraid I would get that response :p. I suppose I would have to shift to json eventually. By the way could you tell me if there is any way I could secure or encrypt my local sqlite or for that matter json data&#x2F;files.</p>
