			<p>Hey everybody!</p>
<p>I&#39;d love to build more complex and interesting projects in Titanium. However, my JS skills are very limited. What do I need to know in order to build more exciting stuff on Titanium? I&#39;d love some direct tips as well (i.e. &quot;learn all about stacks&quot; or &quot;you absolutely need to know everything about the bubble-sort algorithm, because…&quot;), but general book&#x2F;tutorial recommendations that can help me use my knowledge directly in Titanium would be more appreciated! Thanks! :)</p>

							<p>learn javascript basics, and pay most attention to objects in javascript .. that should help you understand and follow titanium code easily and get you started quickly as well .. as far as complex app go, it&#39;s all about an idea; if your idea is clear, your app code would seem easy to you and knowing the basics of javascript you&#39;d know how to go about programming it .. then to take it further, you of course have all these design paradigms and patterns which help you solve a known problem in a robust way ..</p>

							<p>I can wholeheartedly recommend the book &quot;JavaScript: The Definitive Guide&quot; by David Flanagan. Ensure to get the sixth edition, which covers the upcoming ECMAscript 5 standard.</p>
<p>Currenly I read &quot;JavaScript Patterns&quot; by Stoyan Stefanov which discusses various programming patterns that are typical for JavaScript and that are often unfamiliar for developers with classic OO background. Very insightful.</p>
<p>There is also another book, &quot;JavaScript - The Good Parts&quot; which discusses various pitfalls of the language. I haven&#39;t read this book but it might be the next one I buy. After all, knowing why things like &#39;parseInt(&quot;09&quot;)&#39; don&#39;t deliver the result you&#39;d expect is worth a lot, especially if you learn it from a book rather than through hours of debugging.</p>
<p>(Disclaimer: It is purely coincidental that all these books are published by O&#39;Reilly - I have no personal or business relationships with this company nor with the authors.)</p>

										<p><p>When googling the different books I&#39;ve also come across this link: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.yahoo.com&#x2F;yui&#x2F;theater&#x2F; where Douglas Crockford has multiple videos on JavaScript, I guess that&#39;s good, too :) Thanks for the tips though.</p>

							<p>I am working through this book which I have so far found to be quite good:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;amzn.to&#x2F;foWAik</p>
<p>A lot of JS books seem to take a cut and paste approach aimed at web developers looking for rapid UI enhancements, this one takes a bit more time to focus on JavaScript as a language.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for this recommendation! I just ordered this book. There much to few books around the language itself. The most books are about web-programming, which is boring IMHO.</p>
