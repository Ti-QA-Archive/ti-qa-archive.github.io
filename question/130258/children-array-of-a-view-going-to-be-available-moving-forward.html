			<h1>.children array of a view going to be available moving forward?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>It seems pretty well documented that the .children array is gone in 1.8.X on tableViews and tableRowViews. This has caused a large delay in time and cost a good deal of money for my companies project. As a workaround we are no longer using tableViews or tableViewRow and have moved forward building our own solution with by adding multiple views to a scrollView. On the dynamically added views we add the necessary UI elements such as imageViews and labels. The solution seems to be working but it depends on myView.children[x].text being able to be manipulated where children[x] is a label.</p>
<p>I have seen many examples and tutorials where people are telling users to use something like below to get a particular child of row in a tableView.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">tableView</span><span class="hljs-class">.data</span><span class="hljs-attr_selector">[x]</span><span class="hljs-class">.rows</span><span class="hljs-attr_selector">[y]</span><span class="hljs-class">.children</span><span class="hljs-attr_selector">[z]</span><span class="hljs-class">.text</span>
</code></pre><p>I don&#39;t see children listed as the property of a view, nor do I see getChild or getChildren or the like as methods.</p>
<p>Will view.chidren[] be supported moving forward?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Kevin Whinnery says:<br>December 28, 2011 at 9:01 am<br>yes, this particular tutorial used an API that was undocumented (.children)- this was removed in Android in 1.8.x and should not be used on that and future versions until .children becomes a supported interface.</p>

							<p>I missed that in the tutorial that Aaron was using an undocumented API - I edited that tutorial so I should have caught it.  Rather than using .children, I would suggest looking at the Kitchen Sink example where various source elements of the table view row are being clicked, and a table view row is swapped out for a new one.</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;KitchenSink&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;examples&#x2F;table_view_layout_2.js#L172</p>
<p>If that doesn&#39;t satisfy your use case, we can explore other techniques.  But given that it&#39;s an undocumented API, I think that&#39;s why it hasn&#39;t been uniformly implemented.  It looks like there&#39;s also an open ticket on this issue:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-6710</p>

										<p><p>Based on conversations I am having right now it looks like we will be putting children back in and documenting the interface.  So it will be in moving forward, but at this point I don&#39;t have an ETA.</p>

										<p><p>Kevin, appreciate all the help. I can look at that tomorrow, but it is getting late here and I am about 3&#x2F;4 of the way through a work around that fits my need. My whole point of this post was to try and find out if .children will stay put for VIEWS. That is great if they come back for tableViewRow, but I have deadlines. Trying to run a business here and I have managers screaming at me right now…literally screaming at me.</p>
<p>So any plans to remove .children from views?</p>

										<p><p>Awesome, thanks! Just to be clear .children is <strong>not</strong> working on tableViewRows but it <strong>is</strong> working on views in 1.8.x. </p>
<p>I could expect some time in the future that it should come back to tableViewRows (totally understand not sure when, I know you are busy) but I can be confident it won&#39;t be removed from views in a future SDK. Is that correct?</p>

										<p><p>Correct - I&#39;ve literally been going back and forth from this to the platform guys, and that is what I&#39;m hearing.  They are saying it should have been there and documented for all views already, but needs to be added in for TableViewRow and documented.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks again. Is there a better way for me to get in touch with appcelerator people when I have a genuine problem? I hate to have this back and forth in a public forum and my paid for support tickets are fine most of the time with about a 24 hour turn around…but some times there are real problems where a private email or phone call would be great.</p>
<p>This is all still relatively new for our team so if there is a better way please let me know.</p>

							<p>Seems strange…based on what this has cost my company in lost hours and delay to the project I say more than strange. How about irresponsible or negligent? Sorry for the rant, just causing me to work tons of hours for free. We are seriously considering scrapping Appcelerator&#x2F;Titanium in total and looking for a different develop environment. I am not just a community member we pay thousands of dollars a year for annual licenses and support. I just seem to get faster input from the community (thanks a lot!) at times over the support I pay for.</p>
<p>I&#39;d be very curious to know if anyone else has a need for table-like rows to be deleted if a user selects the left image or perform some different logic, say navigate or provide multi-select values or enter text data and save those values when they select the rest of the row. Hard to explain, but rows of editable data. Those rows contain multiple controls that do the work.</p>
<p>My current solution is to create views on the fly and add those views to a scrollView, but running into some problems navigating the various controls on the views and keeping track of each.</p>

							<p>Upgrading to 1.8.0.1 also broke my app because of this. I use .children a few times to get elements inside a tableviewrow.  I didn&#39;t realize this until i did extensive work trying to add the new &#39;longpress&#39; event into my app.  Now I&#39;m stuck with removing that new code and going back to a pre 1.8 sdk so I don&#39;t have to redo my entire app. What a waste of time!!!!</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m sorry that this change got missed in 1.8 - you shouldn&#39;t have to redo your entire app, though - in the locations where you used .children, you should be able to replace the contents of the entire specific row rather than operating on the children individually.  An example of this is found in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;KitchenSink&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;examples&#x2F;table_view_layout_2.js#L172">the Kitchen Sink</a>.</p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t want to replace the entire contents. One instance i use .children is I add a hidden &#39;delete&#39; image to the row on creation.  When i click a button an event fires that loops through the rows and shows the delete button.  I am basically mimicking the ios built-in ios &#39;edit&#39; feature on android.</p>

										<p><p>You can make a custom property, for example called HiddenDeleteImage, of the TableViewRow as you&#39;re creating it.  Then instead of iterating over &quot;children&quot;, just address the property directly.</p>
