			<p>Hi There,</p>
<p>This looks like a great product in theory - but I can&#39;t try it because it will not get past the initial login screen on XP.</p>
<p>I am using a static ip address to a router with a DHCP allocated IP (v4) on XP SP3.</p>
<p>I am not behind a proxy server as far as I know.</p>
<p>I hope there&#39;s something simple I can do to get this up and running or I&#39;ll have to have another look at Rhodes which seemed to install fairly easily, but needs Ruby&#x2F;Rails like knowledge to make it fly…</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Jason</p>

										<p><p>Good find, Jason, well done! In order to make it easier for others to find this solution, would you mind posting it as a comment reply to another user&#39;s answer (in other words, you shouldn&#39;t answer your own questions)? This is explained in the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Contributing+to+Titanium#ContributingtoTitanium-ParticipatingintheQ%26A">Participating in the Q&amp;A</a>.

<p>Try temporarily disabling your local firewall and antivirus, to determine whether either of these are causing a problem.</p>
<p>Please report back with how you got on.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>Hi There,</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion.</p>
<p>Tried that. Disabled Sygate Firewall, Clamwin and windows defender. No dice.</p>
<p>Are there any logs I can inspect to try and diagnose?</p>

<p>So check if you can ping google.com and yahoo.com - if you can&#39;t solve that and Titanium will then be happy.</p>

							<p>I had a similar problem but my network does not allow ICMP, so changing the rules to allow outbound pings was not an option. Here is a method to bypass the pings to yahoo.com:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Browse to the hosts file, on windows it is located at:<br>C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts</p>
</li>
<li><p>Double click the file (or right click and click open)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Choose a text editor such as Notepad or Wordpad</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add the following line to the hosts file:<br>127.0.0.1 yahoo.com</p>
<p>Note: This line must appear AFTER the line:<br>127.0.0.1  localhost</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This will redirect pings to yahoo.com to your localhost. Unfortunately, this means that you cannot access yahoo.com (although www.yahoo.com will still work). If you need to access yahoo.com, you will have to remove this line again.</p>

							<p>I had a vexing time with this problem working behind a firewall.</p>
<p>The app is spamming ICMP messages that are blocked by firewall and cause the firewall to block all my outbound traffic.</p>
<p>If you are on Windows platform, this is a good guide to installing a IP Filter policy to drop all outgoing ICMP messages from your machine. </p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.petri.co.il&#x2F;block_ping_traffic_with_ipsec.htm">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.petri.co.il&#x2F;block_ping_traffic_with_ipsec.htm</a></p>
<p>You can turn on and off the filter when you need to do any network troubleshooting.</p>
