			<h1>Rotate on touchmove</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am trying to make it so that when a user &quot;touchmove&quot; across the x axis it rotates the image similar to the IOS app &quot;stackd&quot;. I have it worked where it rotates but I want it so that it begins moving on an angle as it the object is moved to the left and then as you &quot;touchmove&quot; back to the right it angles until it reaches its original position.</p>
<p>The way I have it now it doesnt move back to its original position when moving back towards the center.</p>
<p>It&#39;s very hard to provide code in this situation because I have so many other things tied in. I was hoping someone has already comeup with a solution for this and can lend a hand.</p>
<p>So just to clarify. As &quot;touchmove&quot; goes left across the x axis the object begins to rotate  on a negative angle. Then if its moved back right its moved to a positive angle gradually until it is dragged back to its original position. Upon entering original position the object should be in its original position.</p>
