							<p>I must disagree: the error message complains that there is no SDK, and this is not true.</p>
<p>The message is wrong, I thus consider this a bug. The cause could be the same across different OSs, as the IDE is Java…</p>

										<p><p>I agree with this. I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s some other misconfiguration that I don&#39;t get (I double checked everything a good number of times), but I definetely have all sort of SDKs installed.</p>

							<p>It&#39;s already a know issue in the titanium studio <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TISTUD-6007">TISTUD-6007</a></p>
<p>To work around it, open the terminal and execute this command : </p>
<p>&quot;ti config android.sdkPath &#x2F;path&#x2F;to&#x2F;your&#x2F;android&#x2F;sdk&quot; </p>
<p>then configure the same path in Studio preferences.</p>
<p>P.S. you may need root access.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks to your answer I could notice that in Windows environment, Titanium stores the configuration for <em>android.sdkPath</em> with 2 slashes… I mean: &quot;C:\android-sdk-path&quot; (if your sdks are in the root). So, I wrote in the cli:<br><strong>ti config android.sdkPath &quot;C:\android-sdk-path&quot;</strong> (note the one slash)<br>And it worked.<br>Hope this helps!</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m sorry =(, I just figure out why Titanium stores the path with two slashes: because it&#39;s a JSON… Besides, I&#39;m still with the problem. If I discover something new, I&#39;ll post it =)</p>

							<p>After all the good and bad tries, I uninstalled node.js and reopened titanium studio hopelessly, and found a node.js installation pop up window. After some mouse clicks for installation, I went to Titanium Studio &gt; Preferences &gt; Studio &gt; NodeJS on my mac, and set its path to &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local&#x2F;bin&#x2F;node, then magic happened.</p>

										<p><p>There is actually no bug to resolve wich means there is no associated ticket for this.<br>And you will get support <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;support-services&#x2F;">here</a>.

<p>Yes, I should have added a comment instead of an answer, sorry about that. But I see no point in creating a new question when the problem is the same as reported here, and there is no reference to a solution.</p>

										<p><p>I mean, there is probably no bug with Titanium Studio. It&#39;s a configuration issue. The question opener was running Win7 while you are running Ubuntu - it is not the same problem even if you get a similar error.</p>

										<p><p>I still get the same error, so let&#39;s not blame people without knowing facts. I will open another ticket on JIRA if necessary. I have everything up to date, and still it doesn&#39;t recognize the Android SDK. I re-downloaded the SDK dozens of times. I tried all sort of nightly&#x2F;beta builds. The problem is still there today.</p>

										<p><p>Alberto, you know I&#39;m not trying to blame anybody nor I want to quarrel. I was just trying to help by informing how to select the SDK path in Studio and refered to a similar question. I was commenting on this &quot;answer&quot; with the intention of clarifying that the Ti Studio developer won&#39;t fix a bug that is not filed in JIRA and that, in fact, there <strong>is</strong> support available as this was a question in this &quot;answer&quot;. Further on there were no information that could help to solve Josés issue. But I&#39;m now unsubscribing to this as people start to get pissy with someone trying to help, upvoting their wailing answers and downvote actual answers.</p>

							<p>I had this problem sort of solved (still not thoroughly tested) by upgrading nodejs manually to version 0.10.</p>
<p>This was done through trial-and-error: there was no error message suggesting this upgrade, nor any other sort of hint.</p>
<p>I&#39;m running v 3.2.1 on a Ubuntu 12.04 system.</p>

							<p>Hi I had the same problem, what i did was removing the nodejs and reinstalling it, updating the latest java runtime, as an extra i download this appcelerator update http:&#x2F;&#x2F;builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;index.html#3.2.3 and i manually install it, than i restart my windows 7 laptop and i start the Titanium IDE and it ask for update and I left it do it, i enter to see if it was detecting the android SDK and it was detecting it properly. for me i think it a problem with the nodejs.</p>

							<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I solved this problem for Ubuntu 14.04 </p>
<p>The real problem was nodejs installation, and not as the message says &quot;android sdk location&quot;.<br>The solution is to install the legacy version of nodejs, for Ubuntu try this:</p>
<p>sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy</p>
