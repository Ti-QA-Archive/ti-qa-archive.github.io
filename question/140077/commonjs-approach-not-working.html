		<section>
			<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I am making custom able view rows based on the JSON returned . In the rows i need to show the distance between the user and the restaurants which we get in the json. I am using commonjs approach as the Ti.geolocation is asynchronous .But my code doesn&#39;t seem to work.</p>
<p>Here is my complete <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;3162465">CODE</a></p>
<p>In neaby_table.js i m making the table view and in file current_location.js i am trying to return the distance using commonsjs approach. But it doesn&#39;t seem to work.</p>
<p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

							<p>You can&#39;t just wrap an asynchronous process into a module and expect it to become synchronous.  When <code>distance_away()</code> returns, <code>address</code> is undefined.  That&#39;s because it returns immediately, before any results from <code>reverseGeocoder()</code> are available.</p>
<p>You need to provide a callback function to <code>distance_away()</code> so that it can call that function when results are available.  Yes, that does mean some serious code restructuring.  Once you get the hang of this stuff, you&#39;ll find it&#39;s not too hard, but it takes some getting used to.</p>
<p>For a similar example, see <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;140068&#x2F;need-help-with-callback">this question</a> that I answered last night.  HTTPClient requests work very similarly to Geolocation functions.</p>

										<p><p>Not able to get the exact meaning of it . How can i use callback in my code.. Is the commonjs method is suitable for callback ??</p>

										<p><p>Putting your code into CommonJS modules is definitely compatible with using callback methods.</p>
<p>To use a callback, you would change your function definition to look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">exports</span>.distance_away = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">(venue,distance_callback)</span></span>
</code></pre><p>Once your code has successfully obtained the distance, it would call the callback like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">distance_callback <span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">address</span>)</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>(you probably should have a different variable name, since it&#39;s not really an address anymore.</p>
<p>Your caller would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> distance =get_distance.distance_away(venue, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">(distance)</span> </span>{
        <span class="hljs-comment">// Basically i want to show the distance between the restaurants </span>
        <span class="hljs-comment">// and the current location of the user.</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> supplimentryText1 = Ti.UI.createLabel({
            text : distance,
            ...
        });
        view.add(supplimentryText1);
});
</code></pre><p>All that said, the more I look at your code, the more mistakes I find.  You&#39;re using 3 asynchronous calls:</p>
<ul>
<li>Titanium.Geolocation.getCurrentPosition()</li>
<li>Titanium.Geolocation.reverseGeocoder()</li>
<li>HTTPClient.send()</li>
</ul>
<p>You have to chain each of these so that you don&#39;t run the next step until the results from the previous step are back.  You&#39;ve done it correctly with <code>getCurrentPosition()</code> (see how you passed a callback function to it?).  You have a callback function for <code>reverseGeocoder()</code>, but for some reason, you didn&#39;t put the HTTPClient code inside that callback, so it runs before the reverse geocoding results are back.</p>
<p>In your case, you would call the <code>distance_callback</code> inside of <code>xhr2.onload</code>.</p>
<p>CommonJS has nothing to do with your problems, and you should continue to use it.  But you need to study the fundamentals of asynchronous operations in Javascript.</p>

										<p><p>Your code indenting is very erratic, making it difficult to see which code block is inside of what.  You should use consistent indenting as a courtesy to folks here who are trying to understand your code.  Try using http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jsbeautifier.org&#x2F; if you can&#39;t fix the code in your editor.</p>
<p>You&#39;re <em>still</em> not calling the HTTPClient code from within the <code>reverseGeocoder()</code> callback function.  So it&#39;s not going to work this way.</p>
<p>Try putting a couple of breakpoints in your code and run it through the debugger so you can see what happens in what order.  Try lines 29 and 45 – you&#39;ll see that line 45 runs <em>before</em> line 29, and maybe then you&#39;ll understand why things are failing.</p>

										<p><p>OK, so your callback doesn&#39;t get fired.  So start setting breakpoints in your current_location.js file so you can find where it&#39;s breaking down.  Does the getCurrentPosition() call its callback?  Does the reverseGeocoder() call its callback?  Does the HTTPClient call its onload function?</p>
<p>I can&#39;t keep going back and forth with you if you&#39;re not going to apply some critical analysis.  Don&#39;t come back with &quot;tried it, doesn&#39;t work&quot;.  Come back with details that show that you&#39;ve broken the problem down and isolated specific issues.</p>

										<p><p>ok after calling that function after line no.89 just log the distance value. are you getting the distance as per your requirement.<br>if yes then, this code <code>view.add(supplimentryText1);</code> at line no. 108 should be after line no. 106.</p>
<p>as supplimentryText1 is defined inside the scope of that function so outside, that won&#39;t work.</p>
