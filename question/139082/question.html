							<p>Yes, as long as you have access to their API&#39;s. An API is an Application Programming Interface. It&#39;s the interface that Facebook, Instagram, etc. provides to developers that gives access to their data.</p>
<p>For Facebook:</p>
<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.facebook.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;reference&#x2F;api&#x2F;">Facebook API docs</a></p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.1&#x2F;index.html#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Facebook">Appcelerator Facebook Docs</a></p>
<p>For Instagram:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;instagram.com&#x2F;developer&#x2F;">Instagram API Docs</a></p>
<p>You can google search &quot;API&quot;, &quot;weather API&quot;, &quot;Instagram API&quot;, or &quot;TheProgramYouLike API&quot; to find out if the program, app, or service that you like has an API.</p>

										<p><p>In most cases you&#39;ll use the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.1&#x2F;index.html#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Network.HTTPClient">HTTPClient Object</a> in Titanium.</p>
<p>That being said, I can already see your next question being, &quot;How do I do that?&quot;…..</p>
<p>Based on that and seeing your past questions here in Q&amp;A, you really need to start watching the getting started videos. If you keep asking basic questions that are answered in the docs and the videos, you will start wearing people thin. The users that get the most help here in Q&amp;A are users that are attempting something with their own code and need help.</p>

										<p><p>You&#39;re not going to be able to find a video for every single thing that you want to accomplish. What you have to learn is, is how to apply what is in the video and your knowledge (or lack thereof) of javascript to attack the exact thing you want to accomplish. Another thing I did was to just go through the Q&amp;A and see what others are doing. Start with small code samples, then build on them. I was very weak with javascript when I started learning Titanium Mobile. So, I had to learn two things at once, both javascript and the API for Titanium Mobile. It&#39;s been a year now, and although it didn&#39;t happen as fast as I would have liked, my understanding is very strong now.</p>
<p>As soon as you realize that you won&#39;t be able to write the app that you want to write in just a few hours or days, the better off you will be. One last thing…..you may want to look in to a book recently written by a community member. It&#39;s more of a cookbook style of book while you learn.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Appcelerator-Titanium-Smartphone-Development-Cookbook&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1849513961&#x2F;ref=tmm_pap_title_0&#x2F;176-7582308-7623218">Appcelerator Titanium Smartphone App Development Cookbook</a></p>
<p>The only issue with that book is it may not use some of the newer principles introduced in the last few months, commonJS being one of them.</p>
