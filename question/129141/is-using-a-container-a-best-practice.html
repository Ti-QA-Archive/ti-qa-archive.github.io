			<h1>Is Using a Container a &#34;Best Practice&#34;</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I know it&#39;s situational, but I&#39;m looking for generalization in this case. For a while, I had one in my app, but then it seemed like it wasn&#39;t doing anything except adding complexity. Now I&#39;m starting to wonder whether that was a bad idea.</p>
<p>Within this app, most of my windows are a stacked (vertical) layout and after removing the container (which was a ScrollView), the windows which extend out of the viewport no longer scroll. I guess I just assumed that the window would do what it needs to do to access its content.</p>
<p>What are experienced Titanium folks doing with respect to containers and, perhaps most importantly…why? I&#39;m looking for something that I can adopt as my default approach, but I&#39;d like to understand why one way is better than another.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;d like to piggyback on this question with a related question that&#39;s similar to one I think I&#39;ve asked before somewhere. I have a window (vertical layout) with a couple of elements added to it. Beneath those, I have a container that I&#39;d like to take up the rest of the viewport. </p>
<p>As far as I can tell, I&#39;m required to set the <code>height</code> property on the container in order for it to display at all (even if the value is simply &quot;auto&quot;), but the height is completely based on what it contains. Setting top and bottom to 0 does nothing at all and setting a height of &quot;auto&quot; extends it to the height of the content itself so there&#39;s no scrolling.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been dealing with this on and off for the longest time now and I can&#39;t seem to find any answer that really helps me understand how best to implant something like this.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>IMHO you are doing the right thing <em>if</em> you want the content to scroll beyond the screen size. So use a scrollview container in that instance. Else, you need to ensure that you content fits inside the viewport. Regards the second comment, I would use a container for both views and then I can control how much vertical space each uses by setting the heights of the inner views using percentages.</p>

										<p><p>Following up on the second part (which I had to read twice to catch), how would you do this when developing for different platform sizes? For example, my header contains an <code>ImageView</code> whose height (because of the image size itself) is likely to vary which means that the top container size can&#39;t be absolute which means that I still end up letting it grow and then having to tell the bottom container how tall it can be.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>

										<p><p>Okay, so it sounds like every &quot;typical&quot; window should start with a scrollview container that holds the window&#39;s content. Thanks for the advice, guys.</p>
