			<h1>Adding (web)views multiple times</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello everyone, </p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to build an tabview-based app (mobile). Some of these tabs are supposed to contain a webview element wherein web based content is displayed. (basically this is going to be an app version of the website). the user has to be able to login from this application. this is managed in another tab (with no webview element). the problem for me is now getting the webviews to be authenticated, too.<br>i could imagine sending a post request with the credentials to the webserver directly via Titanium (XHR), but then the webview elements would not be authenticated with the site, because (if I understood correctly) every webview has its own context. now if I would send the auth request from a specific webview, then all the other webviews are still embedded in another context, meaning there is no means of getting them in an authenticated state (with context and state I am of course referring to login cookies).<br>i thought about the possibility of using the tabs to control only one webview by setting an url each time. however this does not work, as I would have to add the webview multiple times to each tabview, which doesn&#39;t seem to work.</p>
<p>phew, quite a lot of text for a simple problem.. I hope I put myself clearly enough. I can&#39;t really show you the code (yet), as it is still quite a mess..</p>
<p>greetings</p>

							<div><p>Just an opinion, but it sounds a bit like you are trying to stick a square peg in a round hole. Rather than recreate browser navigation with native UI components, why not let a single webview do its job and handle your authentication in that one webview?</p>
<p>That said, you can probably use the <code>Ti.App.Properties</code> API to share the authentication username and password among your webviews. Still, though, I would consider the single webview design.</p>

							<p>As Tony said, it´s better use only one web view and his idea sounds better, remember that webview uses alot of resources and you can crash the app or you can get an app with a big size. If you want to pass parameters between the webviews and the other components you should use Firevent and Eventlistener, they have allways worked for me but im not really sure what you want to do.</p>
