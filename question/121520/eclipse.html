			<p>I have several completed projects with Eclipse for the android.  This is probably a silly question but is there a way that I can import these already completed projects into titanium so I can use with other platforms.  Thank you for your patience, I am a new to Titanium, but the feel of this IDE is very similar to Eclipse.</p>

							<p>Curtis,</p>
<p>You should be able to import the project into Titanium Studio. Go to <code>File &amp;gt; import ...</code> and choose the project and type that you want to import. Of course I would suggest backing up your project before attempting this, however, I believe the import will work.</p>

										<p><p>I guess I am not sure how to do this.  When I created a Titanium mobile project, I did a file import and selected General-File system.  All went well, then I tried to run in the android emulator.  Which went OK, no errors.  But I am not seeing my app, I am seeing the &quot;I am window 1 App&quot;. </p>
<p>When I create a new General-Project, I import with General-File system.  This time it will not allow me to run and the IDE will not let me create a Run setting for the android emulator.  What do I need to do or I am just missing a step. </p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>That is because you actually created a new project and then ran it. If you did import your project, then you need to look at the &quot;App Explorer&quot; window on the left hand side and from the drop down there, you need to choose the project that you imported, not the project that you created new. Once you choose your imported project, then you can try and run again.</p>

										<p><p>Oops, didn&#39;t see that.  I imported as a project but when I run I get the following error:  </p>
<p>fastdev.py: error: Directory is not a Titanium Project: C:\Documents and Settings\me\Desktop\android</p>
<p>Thanks, once again</p>

										<p><p>If the import directory isn&#39;t laid out as expected then you may have to do a little re-arranging for your project. I would suggest checking out the project layout and structure, and see if you can put something together to get your project working correctly. Here would be the place to start:  http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;The+Application+Project+Structure</p>
