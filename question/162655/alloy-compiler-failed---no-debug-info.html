			<h1>Alloy Compiler Failed - no debug info</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>I&#39;m getting the following error in Titanium Studio. It&#39;s an alloy project.</p>
<p>[ERROR] :  Alloy compiler failed<br>[ERROR] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 1</p>
<p>It&#39;s extremely difficult to find the error because it&#39;s not giving me any information about the location of the issue.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a screenshot of my console, I have set the debug level to &quot;Debug&quot; but still no luck.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;1drv.ms&#x2F;1bAMyfc">Titanium Alloy Compiler Error</a></p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated as this error started out of nowhere and I cannot, for the life of me, figure out where the error is.</p>
<p>Thanks.<br>Devon.</p>

							<p>Based on this output, I&#39;m assuming this is the second time you&#39;ve asked this question? Pretty sure I alreayd asked for details in another one. There&#39;s a number important things here:</p>
<ol>
<li>What version of Alloy are you using?</li>
<li>Turn your log level up to trace for more information. That said, there should be more information there already so there might be an issue with TiStudio&#39;s reporting.</li>
<li>There&#39;s a warning right there in that little bit of Alloy output that indicates you have poorly formatted XML. It appears, as the warning states, that you don&#39;t have the necessary space in between one of your XML attributes. Since you didn&#39;t show code, I can only guess, but I&#39;m assuming you have XML that looks kind of like this somewhere (notice the lack of space in between the attributes):<pre><code class="hljs">&lt;View <span class="hljs-attribute">left</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"123"</span><span class="hljs-attribute">right</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"123"</span>/&gt;
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<p>That should get you fixed, but again, you should be seeing much more information than that in a typical Alloy run, even with the log level set to the default &quot;info&quot;. </p>
<p>What happens if you run the same app from the command line? I wonder if running it straight from the CLI would give more data.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">ti build <span class="hljs-comment">--platform android</span>
</code></pre><p>or better yet, if that doesn&#39;t help, run alloy itself directly to get the details of the error:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">alloy compile <span class="hljs-comment">--platform android</span>
</code></pre><p>If running from the &quot;ti&quot; or &quot;alloy&quot; from the CLI show you more info, but TiStudio does not, there&#39;s a bug with Studio&#39;s reporting. Please let me know what you find and I&#39;ll get it sorted one way or the other.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll mark this as answered but keep you updated if it comes up again!!</p>

							<h1 id="installation-details">Installation details</h1>
<p>Titanium Studio, build: 3.2.1.201402041146<br>Titanium CLI 3.2.1<br>Titanium SDK 3.2.1 G.A<br>Alloy 1.3.1</p>
<h1 id="experienced-similar-issue">Experienced similar issue</h1>
<ul>
<li>I upgraded a few days ago to the described installation.</li>
<li>And I started having a similar issue where the Ti.API.trace messages not coming up, but I don’t think the main issue is about the Ti.API and Studio’s reporting.</li>
<li>I think the problem was that TiStudio was not recompiling on android after changes to code.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="description-of-simple-tests">Description of simple tests</h1>
<ul>
<li>After making a little code change “e.g. a line comment and Ti.API.debug change to common.js”, I reran the TiStudio recompile “Run Android device”, I checked to see whether the “Resources&#x2F;android&#x2F;common.js” were changing and the changes weren’t there.</li>
<li>After reading Tony Lukasavage’s note, I ran “alloy compile —platform android” through the terminal, the changes are now appearing in “Resources&#x2F;android&#x2F;common.js”.</li>
<li>Now each time I make a trace code change and recompile on TiStudio, TiStudio is now recompiling the new code and the new trace messages are appearing on the console and in the Resource&#x2F;android&#x2F;common.js file. </li>
<li>Now that TiStudio is working again, I can’t replicate the issue of “TiStudio not recompiling on Android”. </li>
<li>I’m not sure what changed to TiStudio after I ran “alloy compile —platform android” on terminal that makes it work now. However, things started working after that.</li>
<li>I hope this might be able to provide a little more detail to help those debugging the issue.</li>
<li>All the best.</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>You&#39;re right. It&#39;d be better having this thread as a different question.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help. I was stumped for hours last friday trying to chase down why the debug and then TiStudio compile wasn&#39;t working. Your answer to this question helped my question.</p>
