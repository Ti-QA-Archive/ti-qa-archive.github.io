			<h1>Use iOS simulator multiple times without restarting it</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I read someone saying that it&#39;s possible to test an application multiple times without having to restart the whole simulator.</p>
<p>If it&#39;s possible then could someone tell me how?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot and have a nice day!</p>

							<p>hi,</p>
<p>you are right , you can <strong>re-run the application having remodified the source instead of restarting the simulator</strong> but when you run the project from titanium studio with <strong>Run As</strong> option then iphone simulator restarts but if you want to see changes in simulator then just change some code then save and in simulator close that window and open . you will see change what you have done in your .js file</p>

										<p><p>Mitul that only works if you are still using the <strong>url</strong> property of a window, a technique which has fallen out of favour due to the multiple JavaScript contexts that are created one for each window.  CommonJS and more recently Alloy are the preferred solutions.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ve never used the <code>url</code> property of the window but always worked with iOS simulator like as Mitul said and it always worked. I was not running project again and again just make light code changes (e.g. setting height , width, text etc of a component). Close the app in simulator and re run from there and I was able to see the updated output without running the project from Ti Studio.</p>
<p>But I think this has changed in the latest 3.2 environment. I can not see the updated output on iphone simulator until I run from Studio.</p>
<p>@Mitul do you also experience this? I really liked the old way to see output without running project.</p>

										<p><p>yes, I also experienced this type of behavior because now we are using commonJS or alloy framework and these structure use require method that&#39;s why but in old behavior it creates a new object everytime that&#39;s why but i would recommend to use latest structure of titanium.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The short answer is no UNLESS you are using the property window property <code>url</code>, which as you will not from my comment on Mituls answer Titanium is moving away from that quickly towards CommonJS and also Alloy.</p>
<p>Given the short amount of time to run the simulator, about 10 - 15 seconds in my experience is it really a big problem?  </p>
<p>I am so old (40) I used to write code on paper - debug it and then type it into computers, we have lost that art these days, most likely as the code is MUCH larger.  But the need to run and re-run the simulator is reduced by breaking functionality onto simple small CommonJS - test them and move on, then stitch everything together.  Makes things much more reliable and faster - both to develop and for the end app.</p>

										<p><p>It takes more than 1 minute on my Macbook Pro.  So it&#39;s a little problem because during development I&#39;d need to start it many times.</p>
<p>I also use CommonJS massively since I come from Node.js, so I already separate everything in tiny mobules :P</p>
<p>But thanks for your answer anyway :-)</p>

										<p><p>What about a brand new blank project?  Does this also take more than a minute?  What spec mac are you using?  Mine = Mac Mini, 2.5Ghz, i5, 4Gb, files stored on a network drive.</p>

										<p><p>It&#39;s already a brand new project, I tried yesterday to create some more and it was the same. I&#39;m running on OS X 10.8.2, 2.4Gz, 8GB ram, on a 512gb SSD. I even tried to unmount my bootcamp partition because I read here that it made it faster but it doesn&#39;t for me. Thanks!</p>

										<p><p>So certainly not your computer spec then.  I will check some other machines and report back.  BTW I have just compiled for device and that took 1:35, from a cleaned project folder and a medium sized iPad app.</p>

										<p><p>Ok so it&#39;s about the same as me. From a cleaned small project, it took 1:05 from build to simulator started. Thanks for the help by the way, it&#39;s very appreciated :-)</p>
