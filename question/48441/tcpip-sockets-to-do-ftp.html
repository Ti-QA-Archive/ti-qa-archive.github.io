			<h1>TCPIP Sockets to do FTP</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have seen some questions along this path but was hoping to get a concrete answer. I am trying to do FTP communication using the TCPSocket. So what I am doing:</p>
<hr>
<p>var controlSocket = Ti.Network.createTCPSocket({<br>        hostName:&#39;example.com&#39;,<br>        port:21,<br>        mode:Titanium.Network.READ_WRITE_MODE<br>});  </p>
<p>controlSocket.addEventListener(&#39;read&#39;, function(e) {<br>        Titanium.API.info(&quot;Control Read &quot; + e.data + &quot;From &quot; +e.from + &quot; Source &quot; +e.source);  </p>
<p>controlSocket.connect();  </p>
<hr>
<p>Alright, so from my output from e.data I can see that I connect okay, I get back the message </p>
<p>&quot;Control Read 220 Microsoft FTP Service From 8 Source [object TiNetworkTCPSocket]&quot;</p>
<p>So it seems like it connects. However I don&#39;t get any other information after that. I expect to get something like &quot;Username Required:&quot; or anything, and if I do any controlSocket.write(&quot;TEST&quot;) commands I don&#39;t get a response at all.</p>
<p>When I do this FTP from my terminal it works as expected and prompts for username.</p>
<p>Has anyone successfully got a socket FTP connection working through Titanium? What am I doing wrong?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>Michael,</p>
<p>You will have FTP login issues with the current 1.4.0 release, because the TCPSocket also sends a terminating null character when sending strings. </p>
<p>This has already been resolved in one of the recent commits, so you could try installing one of the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;index.html">continuous builds</a> from GitHub before testing your FTP code. The TCPSocket now has a <strong>stripTerminator</strong> property which you&#39;ll need to set to <strong>true</strong> before you connect to your FTP server.</p>
<p>I created a quick &amp; dirty example which successfully connects and logs in to my FTP server: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pastie.org&#x2F;1069423">app.js</a>.</p>

										<p><p>There&#39;s also a shorter answer to what you were doing wrong: you forgot to add the CR+LF after sending a command to the FTP server :)</p>

										<p><p>Hi Goran, I know it&#39;s been 3 years now, but can you provide some code sample where one is able to send an image to FTP folder?  I am able to login into the FTP folder using TCPSocket and all, but for the past 5 days, for the life of me, I can&#39;t send images.  Any help would be highly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
