			<p>I&#39;m using local data storage in the mobile app. There is an issue when user needs to upgrade the app to the next version. App update may wipe out the local data. What&#39;s the best practice for keeping the local data while upgrading the app?<br>thanks.<br>-aj</p>

							<p>Simply allow the update to install WITHOUT deleting &#x2F; uninstalling the existing app first.  When you delete an app, all its associated storage is cleared as well.  When you install a new version, existing data is preserved.  This goes for SQLite databases, any properties you may have set using Ti.App.Properties methods, as well as files you have stored in places like the applicationDataDirectory.</p>
<p>In fact, you must remember that existing databases are NOT replaced if you include a new database layout or contents in your Resources folder and have the application issue Ti.Database.install(…).</p>
<p>New users (those without a prior existing database) will get the new layout installed.  Existing users will NOT have the database replaced by the install() method.  Generally that is a good thing, so as to not lose existing data.  But you must be aware of it, especially if you have changed your database schema.  </p>
<p>I like to keep a table in the database with a field containing a &quot;layout version&quot; number.  After opening a database I check that value.  If it is not my current &quot;layout version&quot; then I run a set of SQL statements to do a series of ALTER TABLE or similar commands, then update the &quot;layout version&quot;.  That way I can both keep existing user data and know that I am dealing with a consistent schema in the rest of my application.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m just going tag along as Doug has you pointed in the right direction with managing your data schema versions.  </p>
<ul>
<li>There is your data and there is user data.</li>
<li>Some apps only have one or the other with some having both.</li>
<li>Some updates are simply data, others are schema changes.</li>
<li>Schema changes are serious and should be approached with caution.  Schema changes that don&#39;t bring added benefit to the user, kind of make me wonder who was driving the ship when the project started.</li>
</ul>
<p>Options to get you thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can nuke the entire installed database and install a new one.</li>
<li>You could have two databases, one with your data, one with user data, and just nuke yours and install a new one.</li>
<li>You could have one database with your data tables and user data tables, nuke out just your tables, and re-populate them.</li>
<li>Install new database with new schema and new name and populate with data from the old database.</li>
</ul>

<p>Granted, schema changes should be approached with caution.  And as you note, there are various ways it can be handled.  And I don&#39;t endorse changes &quot;that don&#39;t bring added benefit to the user&quot;.  But my background is commercial business applications, and over time requirements change as the business climate or even legal requirements change.</p>
<p>I have systems running where I designed the core database files over 30 years ago.  (These were not running on an iPhone at the time. &lt;g&gt;)  The schema has grown considerably during that time, and I don&#39;t have a crystal ball to tell me what else will be needed down the road.</p>
<p>But I can say that with proper planning, schema changes can be completely transparent to the user (other than the ability to add features you otherwise could not) and you never have to suffer data loss.</p>
