							<p>I have the same problem since the 5th of July. After running into the same problem on 5 diffrent machines in the office and trying around for 35+hours (best weekend ever!) I found a temporary solution that worked for a couple of hours. That solution was to completlely reinstall my osx, install newest xcode, install titanium 3.0.2 and the beta 3.1.2 sdk. but now it&#39;s down again…</p>
<p>Here some additional info to the above problem.</p>
<p>Titanium Studio :3.1.1 (june 11 master branch)</p>
<p>Ti. SDK: 3.1.1 GA</p>
<p>Xcode 4.6.3 ios 6.1</p>
<p>osx 10.8.2</p>
<p>node -v<br>v0.8.22</p>
<p> npm -v<br>1.2.14</p>
<p>titanium -v<br>3.1.1</p>
<p>alloy -v<br>1.1.3</p>
<p>.log error when create a new project<br>NLS missing message: BasicProjectCreationPage_crossPlatformWarningIOS in: com.appcelerator.titanium.ui.wizard.messages</p>
<p>also the update call fails regulary [ERROR] com.appcelerator.titanium.update&#x2F;debug&#x2F;sdk_update Error getting release lists from url &#39;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.appcelerator.net&#x2F;p&#x2F;v2&#x2F;release-list?name=mobilesdk&#39;</p>
<p>and i get the analyitics connection error, sometimes.</p>

										<p><p>One final remark, since all computers in the office had the same problem at the same time i am expecting that it may have something to do with the sync to the appcelerator servers or something. i am currently in India (goa) but i am coordination with my main office in germany and see how that goes. hope that was my last comment :)</p>

										<p><p>Yes we are also have the same issue in our office that is in India. Titanium studio installed on all office systems are not working. all systems have the same issue as Marek Spak told. we have one alternate solution to this problem that disconnect your system from internet and then run titanium studio then it works otherwise it has the above issue.</p>

							<p>I think this is the issue of Titanium API sync with Appcelerator server. Whenever we do anything on titanium it goes to sync with Appcelerator sever API. API of Appcelerator is not working continuously.<br>Raj you are right, This is only alternate solution to build projects disconnect the internet.</p>
