			<h1>iOS Background file upload</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I&#39;m wondering if its possible to do a background service (iOS) for uploading files to a server in Titanium.</p>
<p>At the moment I have an app that records video&#x2F;photos&#x2F;locations etc and the user presses a button to send, these go into a queue which is serviced ad HTTPClient uploads to send them away to the server. </p>
<p>This all works fine while in foreground, but I need to support that mode of iOS where you &quot;just need a bit of extra time to complete a task&quot; when you go into background mode.. that would be continuation of the upload service.</p>
<p>Looking at iOS and Titanium there is of course this</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">service</span> = <span class="hljs-title">Ti</span>.App.iOS.registerBackgroundService(</span>{url:'bg.js'});
</code></pre><p>But I&#39;m trying to figure out how it would work with my existing code that is servicing the upload queue, and the underlying HTTPClient object that I&#39;ve created…</p>
<p>ie: </p>
<ol>
<li>I have code&#x2F;functions that are running already</li>
<li>I want them to not terminate when going to background</li>
<li>They can cleanly send the last few files and close connections nicely.</li>
</ol>
<p>In Obj-C you can mark a function as something that will run on a little longer (something like that, its been a little while)..</p>
<p>How will HttpClient perform when I try to use it from a background task? </p>
<p>In short, has anyone managed to write a background &quot;files will continue uploading once I&#39;ve switched to background for a little while longer&quot;.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Chris</p>

							<p>I think that as long as the upload is started before the user puts the app in to the background, you can then use a custom event in the onload of that request to tell the background service when it is complete. </p>
<p>Not too sure about starting a new upload in a queue after that. </p>
<p>I did some testing which a put in a Gist here : https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;867404</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Kosso,</p>
<p>Thanks, I&#39;ll give that a try, from my quick test before I had to deal with something else the upload tended to fail…..</p>
<p>In a way I need to be able to define almost all that code as backgroundable so the entire sequence&#x2F;queue processing would be valid.. but looks like I&#39;ll have to do a bit of experimentation to understand how Ti and Appcelerator interact on this….</p>
<p>I&#39;ll post my final conclusions but will def take a peek at your code.</p>
