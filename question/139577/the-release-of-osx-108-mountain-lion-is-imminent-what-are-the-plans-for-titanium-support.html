										<p><p>seems i missed the part where you tell me if it&#39;s possible to use mountain lion and xcode 4.4 with titanium NOW. please stop using this obvious legal stuff to stay in company save-haven and give me an answer not sounding like being sent from your marketing departement, but instead an answer sounding like coming from someone who is keen on trying apples latest bigcat for him&#x2F;herself with your companies product</p>

<p>All I am asking is when will it be possible to run Titanium with Xcode 4.4 under Mountain Lion?</p>

										<p><p>Actually, Christian, that article is NOT iOS specific. It refers to Operating Systems in general, and iOS 6 as part of that.  If you are going to be argumentative, at least try to be accurate next time.</p>

							<p>That article addresses the target platform OS, not the development platform OS.</p>

										<p><p>I consider the reasoning behind the iOS article to pertain to both areas. I am not entirely sure why Christian is so angry and hostile.  I&#39;m just a dev not an Appcelerator employee.</p>

										<p><p>ah sorry, i thought you are an appcelerator employee</p>
<p>the reason i sounded pissed here, is this general approach appcelerator is giving those &quot;hackers&quot; out there now. it&#39;s more like &quot;look at knowledge base article xx&quot; and less &quot;you may try to copy this code snippet into xx.py at line xx, give it a try. we also submitted a patch into git last night, that fixes problems with xcode 4.4&quot;. every tweet i get from them now somehow deals with &quot;how to make more money with your app&quot;.</p>
<p>also this eclipse approach as an ide with arm-android emulator is so slow as an ide-environment (and crashed my mac 5 minutes before i wrote the post above - which might explains things ;-) when compared to let&#39;s say coda2. i really would like to see a plugin to coda2 to get my apps running on simulators, or compiled to devices as this covers 90% of everydays development work</p>
<p>and sorry again, didn&#39;t know your are only a dev like me</p>
