							<p>Javier,</p>
<p>Short answer is that the images are probably showing but they&#39;re very very small.  </p>
<p>Long answer is that your device probably has a very high resolution and the images contained in the template you selected are not optimized for your device.</p>
<p>Even longer answer, read <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;149743&#x2F;images-in-android">this answer</a> for more information of how Android handles images for different resolutions and densities.</p>

										<p><p>Hola Javier.  I&#39;m replying here so we can keep the thread organized.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re now getting the images right on the device and huge on the emulator, it is because you need to create individual images for different resolutions, and then let Android choose the best one for the device it&#39;s running on.  It&#39;s not really that hard and <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;149743&#x2F;images-in-android">this answer</a> explains it very well.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a summary of what you need to know.</p>
<p>If working with Alloy (you should) go to your &#x2F;app&#x2F;assets&#x2F;android&#x2F;images folder.  If working with Classic, go to &#x2F;Resources&#x2F;android&#x2F;images</p>
<p>Inside that folder create the following folders:</p>
<ul>
<li>res-mdpi</li>
<li>res-hdpi</li>
<li>res-xhdpi</li>
<li>res-xxhdpi</li>
</ul>
<p>MDPI is considered &quot;normal&quot; and that tab icon should be 32x32, also known as 100% of the size.  The size for the rest of the images is calculated starting from this size, multiplied by the local density factor, which is</p>
<ul>
<li>res-mdpi = 1</li>
<li>res-hdpi = 1.5</li>
<li>res-xhdpi = 2</li>
<li>res-xxhdpi = 3</li>
</ul>
<p>Doing that math gives you this:</p>
<ul>
<li>res-mdpi = 32x32</li>
<li>res-hdpi = 48x48</li>
<li>res-xhdpi = 64x64</li>
<li>res-xxhdpi = 96x96</li>
</ul>
<p>Create those file versions, store them in the appropriate directory and you should be set.  BTW, this is not a Titanium-specific behavior, but the way Android works.  Also, there are other possible folders like ldpi for lo-res, and xxxhdpi for super hi-res.  It depends on what you&#39;re targeting.</p>
<p>You don&#39;t really have to do anything to your code, Android will take care of picking the right one.  You can however at any point get the current LocalDensityFactor from this <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Platform.DisplayCaps-property-logicalDensityFactor">API Call</a>.</p>
<p>Hope this makes sense.  If anyone finds any error or omission, please jump in!</p>
<p>R</p>

										<p><p>Hola Roberto</p>
<p>You are right again.</p>
<p>Thanks, thanks, thanks. Finally it works.</p>
<p>I had included in the path android&#x2F;images&#x2F;res-long-port-hdpi&#x2F;image.png, and this is wrong according with the link you gave me. it is enough images&#x2F;image.png.<br>Furthermore is very missunderstanding all the staff about long, not long, land, port….</p>
<p>Anayway thanks again R<br>See you</p>

										<p><p>the hdpi etc. is for different resolutions.  The long-port, etc is for even more granularity like portrait or landspape, etc.  Putting the images in images&#x2F;image.png will make it available for all resolutions, but then you&#39;ll run into the problem of it being small on some and huge on others.  Create the folders as before, drop your images in the specific folders and you should be fine.</p>
<p>If you feel this answers your question, mark it as such for the benefit of anyone else who arrives here.</p>

							<p>Hola Roberto<br>Thanks alot for your answer. You are right. The images are really tiny. I have change the size of them in gimp and after that they are shown really well. But the problem is if i see them through the titanium emulator. They are much bigger.<br>I have read the article you gave me but i dont know what to do. I put the file( with the default size and the one with the size increased) inside of the child folders under the android&#x2F;images folder, in order to try with the diferent resolutions but nothing has resolved the problem.<br>What do i have to do?</p>
<p>Gracias Ricardo( Thanks)</p>
