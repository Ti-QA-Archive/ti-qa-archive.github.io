			<p>Hi, I&#39;m fairly new to Appcelerator. At this very moment I like the way Appcelerator is working for me. So far, so good… </p>
<p>I&#39;m creating a little app for the Android, which at some point will be ported to the iPhone as well. I&#39;ve been debugging with the Emulator. </p>
<p>However, I find it quite troublesome to debug my applications in Titanium. Every time I want to debug, I compile the whole project and then do my tests. This compiling takes about 2-3 minutes. My application is not that big.. yet… </p>
<p>So the thing I&#39;m wondering is, am I doing something wrong? Or is my Laptop to slow? Or is this just something I have to bare with…? </p>
<p>If there are some workarounds I&#39;d be very grateful! </p>

							<div><p>For now I am using Eclipse with Aptana plugin, using JSLint for validation. This helps a bit, but doesn&#39;t really solve my problem. </p>
<p>Compiling won&#39;t get any faster till I get a stronger processor. </p>
<p>So for now, I just have to work more efficient. I set Ti.API.info lines between the places I want to debug and check which lines do not get printed to know where it goes wrong. </p>
<p>Will have to test Aptana standalone on a later stadium. Thnx so far for the input</p>

							<p>Welcome, Andy.</p>
<p>JS validation is highly recommended when working with Titanium, and as an android developer it will provide your biggest time-saver. To enable Javascript validation for eclipse, you need to install the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eclipse.org&#x2F;webtools&#x2F;">wtp plugin</a> (Web Tools Platform).</p>
<p>The time it takes to boot an Android emulator or launch an app to an emulator is almost entirely dependent on Google&#39;s SDK. However, with this in mind and to give you an example for comparison, on my Ubuntu (i7 processor, 6GB memory) machine it takes 40 seconds to launch an application to an already-booted emulator, as <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.dropbox.com&#x2F;u&#x2F;14392713&#x2F;titanium-boot.ogv">this video</a> video demonstrates.</p>
<p>See the rest of <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;104391&#x2F;speeding-up-development-process">this thread</a> for lots of good advice from other users about improving your development process.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you for your very fast response, Paul!</p>
<p>Currently I was using Aptana for some JS validation, but it didn&#39;t really did enough validation for me. I will try your solution tomorrow! </p>
<p>Thank you for putting effort to make a video and for some extra advice. (will post feedback)</p>

<p>Are you aware that Appcelerator acquired Aptana recently?  See <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;appcelerator-acquires-aptana&#x2F;">this page</a>.</p>
<p>The Aptana IDE should definitely be more than adequate to validate your JS, so you shouldn&#39;t need to move to eclipse. I imagine that Appcelerator will start promoting Aptana as the preferred tool soon.</p>

										<p><p>Paul,</p>
<p>I have the Aptana plugin in my Eclipse envoirement. It validates some of my JS, but a lot doesn&#39;t get validated. As in reference errors, or mismatching methods (to many params passed through for example)</p>
<p>Does the Aptana IDE standalone have a more sophisticated validation? Or can I expect the same as the plugin? </p>
<p>To be honest, the only thing I really miss in appcelerator is a nice debugging feature, allowing you to trace variables, set breakpoints, etc.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>I&#39;m in charge of the IDE tooling at Appcelerator, so hopefully I can answer a few of your questions:</p>
<p>1) Currently for validation in Aptana Studio we use a combination of JSLint (style errors) + the Mozilla Rhino engine (parse errors). We&#39;ve read that some people consider the validation in WTP so strict as to make it useless, so we want to make sure the errors are relevant. We&#39;ll investigate to see if we can add the kinds of validation you&#39;re asking about to the current engine.</p>
<p>2) With regards to debugging, we will be adding that very soon. It&#39;s one of the top features we have on our list, and the goal is to let you debug exactly as you expect, setting breakpoints, watching variables, etc. Our current plans are to get a preview of that out in Q1 of this year.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>Ingo</p>

							<p>I&#39;m using the Aptana Eclipse Plugin.  </p>
<p>My compile time seems to run fast, but my apps are only 2-3 windows. How does one verify JS validation in Aptana?  </p>
<p>###Paul Thank you for your post!  Very helpful</p>

<p>I thought js validation and syntax formatting was enabled by default for js files in Aptana. See what you have set in <code>Preferences &amp;#x2F; Editors &amp;#x2F; JavaScript &amp;#x2F; Validation &amp;#x2F; JSLint JavaScript Validator</code>. Use the search field at the top of preferences to search for the words &quot;javascript&quot; and &quot;validat&quot;, to see what comes up.</p>
<p>You should also be able to disable js syntax formatting per code block, as <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aptanastudio.tenderapp.com&#x2F;kb&#x2F;aptana-studio-preferences&#x2F;java-formatting">these</a> instructions demonstrate.</p>
<p>For Aptana advice, it&#39;s probably best to post a question to its community, at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aptanastudio.tenderapp.com&#x2F;">aptanastudio.tenderapp.com</a></p>

										<p><p>Most definitely!  I love Eclipse and could not live without Aptana.  I&#39;m very happy the Titanium and Aptana teams joined forces</p>
