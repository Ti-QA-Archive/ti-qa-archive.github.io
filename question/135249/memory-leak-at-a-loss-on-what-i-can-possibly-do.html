			<p>I am having a serious memory leak problem with my app. The problem is that the leak is out of my control and it&#39;s caused when I implement PegeFlip.</p>
<p>I corresponded with Yury, the developer, and he concluded that there was nothing he could do because in his opinion the problem was being cause by Titanium &amp; iOS.</p>
<p>I even tried a ridiculisly simplified implementation of PageFlip, this is the entire app.&#39;s:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> sh</span> = require('com.infinery.pageflip');
<span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> win</span> = Titanium.UI.createWindow({ fullscreen: <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>, backgroundColor: 'black' });
<span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> v1</span> = Ti.UI.createView({backgroundColor:<span class="hljs-string">"#00FFFF"</span>});
<span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> v2</span> = Ti.UI.createView({backgroundColor:<span class="hljs-string">"#FF0000"</span>});
<span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> v3</span> = Ti.UI.createView({backgroundColor:<span class="hljs-string">"#0000FF"</span>});
<span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> v4</span> = Ti.UI.createView({backgroundColor:<span class="hljs-string">"#00FFFF"</span>});
<span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> v5</span> = Ti.UI.createView({backgroundColor:<span class="hljs-string">"#FF00FF"</span>});
<span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> v6</span> = Ti.UI.createView({backgroundColor:<span class="hljs-string">"#00FF00"</span>});
<span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> v7</span> = Ti.UI.createView({backgroundColor:<span class="hljs-string">"#0033FF"</span>});
win.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>();
sh.PageView(win, [v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6, v7]);
</code></pre><p>and still the app crashes after about 135 page flips on the iPad 3 and after about 235 flips on the iPad 2.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Is Titanium really that leaky?</p>

							<p>Since this module is outside our core SDK, there&#39;s not a lot of insight we can offer.  If you or Yury can provide documentation&#x2F;evidence there is a platform issue at play we will move to fix it in platform right away.  Mail community@appcelerator.com with any such detail you can provide.</p>

										<p><p>The developer is of the idea that &quot;sdk is full of bugs&quot; (direct quote) so this has turned into a finger pointing contest with me in the middle.</p>
<p>I am going to have to come up with my own module-free solution.</p>
<p>However, I am very new to Titanium and I have to say that this is very concerning and is making me reconsider having chosen this platform for development.</p>
<p>Is it true that Titanium SDK is &quot;full of bugs&quot;? Should I not trust any module on the marketplace because it may harbor some sort of untraceable bug that will lead me into a wild goose chase with no good solution?</p>
<p>While I understand both of your points, please also understand that I sold this platform to my client as a sound, solid platform and promised a solid, reliable product. I need to know if there is reason for concern if I chose Titanium over other SDKs.</p>
<p>While researching this matter I came across this article:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;usingimho.wordpress.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;06&#x2F;14&#x2F;why-you-should-stay-away-from-appcelerators-titanium&#x2F;</p>
<p>Is there validity to this?</p>

										<p><p>There is a degree of risk you take on when you use a module from the marketplace.  You have to trust in the module developers to support their work.  I understand how this could make someone nervous, and similarly understand the desire to control your own destiny with your own code.</p>
<p>Titanium has it&#39;s problems - mostly around API parity (an API behaves one way on one platform, and differently on another) and feature coverage (we don&#39;t support everything the native platforms do out of the box).  We also have specific UI components we know need to perform better (like custom table views with large data sets).  We know about these issues and have prioritized them in our dev process.  </p>
<p>However, that blog posting references memory leaks that can happen in any JavaScript application, in the browser or otherwise.  Over 33,000 apps have been published with Titanium, by companies large and small.  By following general JavaScript development best practices, memory problems can be avoided.  We put together a guide about memory use in Titanium - I would recommend <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Managing+Memory+and+Finding+Leaks">consulting this page in the wiki</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, we will plug any memory leak found in the platform.  People have found them in the past, and they are resolved immediately as priority one issues.  If you believe you have found such an issue, please <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;How+to+Submit+a+Bug+Report">report it in our JIRA system</a> and alert community@appcelerator.com - we will move to resolve it immediately.</p>

							<p>simply set the view to &#39;null&#39; when a flip is done may solve your problem. so i think it is better to write your own flip code with animation than use some custom module.and it is not that difficult.</p>

										<p><p>So if I null out the view and redefine it when the user re-enters the page that should eliminate the leak?</p>
<p>Is there a built if page-curl effect in Titanium or would it have to be implement using on of those Javascript&#x2F;CSS3 ones in the wild that would basically run on top of a webview?</p>
