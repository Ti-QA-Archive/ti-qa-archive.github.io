							<p>Because the SDK is Apache 2 licensed. It is free to use for both personal ans commercial use.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Tony. Well not so open as led to believe anyway. Was looking to install Ti Studio today and found this.</p>
<p>Accordingly, except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, Customer agrees not to and shall not allow any third party to: (g) modify any open source version of Appcelerator’s software source code (“Original Code”) to develop a separately maintained source code program …</p>
<p>Going to pass on it I guess and stick with Developer for a bit until I decide what to do. This seems to be reflecting a different attitude than in the past.</p>

										<p><p>Where did you find that? Titanium Studio is not open source, but the SDKs that it uses, the ones your potential apps would rely on, are. Even if you are using Titanium Studio, you are free to distribute any apps made with it, regardless of the licensing that might apply to the Titanium Studio code itself.</p>

										<p><p>This is verbatim from Ti Studio. The language here effectively states that if you proceed with Ti Studio install, you are no longer working on an open source basis with ANY Appcelerator code (whether it is open source or not). This is clearly meant to extend to the SDKs as well. This nullifies any benefit of the Apache license. Not sure why the use of an IDE should in any way imply change to the existing relationship with Licence Agreements for SDKs. All I can say is that you must have your lawyers working overtime to crank this sort of thing out. I am not sure how many folks even read the Agreement but this is over the top from my point of view.</p>
<p>In essence, wording prevents you from doing anything but selling your apps in marketplaces prescribed by Appcelerator and requires that any local changes you might make to ANY open source code (including SDKS) must be contributed back and incorporated in sources, otherwise you are not permitted to use the changes. This basically takes the SDK&#39;s under Apache 2 Licensing and turns relationship into LGPL by design. I say by design because support for Developer is gone and developers have few options but be coerced into this since many have been building code on the platform for some time.<br>This feels underhanded.</p>
<p>I would be happy if the wording pertained specifically to TiStudio intellectual property but it goes well beyond. I think an appropriate solution and right thing here is for Appcelerator to change the language and be clear that use of Ti Studio does not change relationship with Apache 2 licensed SDK&#39;s.</p>

										<p><p>I just came across TiDev Community edition project. Given the circumstances with Ti Studio, seems this is best option and a worthy initiative without getting into all the legal mumbo jumbo attached to using the new IDE. I would be interested in giving Ti Studio a whirl once this has been sorted properly.</p>

							<p>Yes, this is what I would assume when you see Apache License at root of SDK. I guess the point is that any headers like this in the sources need to be removed if this is so. Perhaps they were supposed to be but was missed. That is why I am raising so it can be given some attention or an explanation for why it has not been changed to date. This goes back to 2009</p>
