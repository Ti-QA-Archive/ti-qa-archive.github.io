			<h1>Geolocation Notification</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>So, local notification is awesome in Appcelerator. But I need to figure out a way to fire a local or push notification based on the user location.<br>I know that its not really a great functionality for the battery life of the device. </p>
<p>How would I be able to schedule such a notification in the backgrundservice based on location?</p>

							<p>In the getCurrentPosition callback or location event, you could call scheduleLocalNotification (assuming iOS) with a date of 1 millisecond, which would basically schedule the notification to immediately display.</p>
<p>Below is an example, note that notification is saved to array because of <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;119302&#x2F;local-notification-crashes">this</a>, and in my case, I am checking to see if the app is in background by setting inBackground flag in pause and resume events.  Also, this does not need to be placed in bg.js or the file you may be using for registerBackgroundService.  Though, you may need to call registerBackgroundService to get the notification to work, I&#39;m not sure about that, but if so, using an empty js file would do the trick.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">//use different variables to prevent crash on resume from background</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> n = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> notify = [];
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">sendLocalNotification</span><span class="hljs-params">(message)</span></span>{
         <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (inBackground) {
             notify[n] = Ti.App.iOS.scheduleLocalNotification({
                 alertBody: message,
                 alertAction: <span class="hljs-string">'OK'</span>,
                 date: <span class="hljs-number">1</span> <span class="hljs-comment">// 1 millisecond of wait -- required property</span>
         });
         n++;
     }
}

										<p><p>Very interesting method. Thanks Adam.<br>How often would you then use geolocation getCurrentPosition? Im affraid that I use way too much battery power on updates e.g. every 5 min?</p>
<p>Another challenge, what if the user closes the app from the multitask bar, then no notifications are going to be fired, right? </p>
<p>Any perferred methods here?</p>

										<p><p>I can&#39;t say, as it depends on your application.  But, instead of getting the location in a time interval, you might also consider updating based on location changed by setting Ti.Geolocation.distanceFilter to a distance in meters, and then listen for the location event.  Then the app will only update location&#x2F;send local notification after a certain distance has been traveled.  But, not sure if that applies to your app.</p>
<p>If the app is closed from multitask bar, then no geolocation updates are done and no no notifications are send as the app is gone.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for making that clear.</p>
<p>I guess the distanceFilter could work. Im working on a function that fire a notification if the user is within 500 meters distance from a brandstore&#39;s lat&#x2F;lng coordinates. </p>
<p>So im trying to figure out the best way to update location. have you ever done that?</p>

									<li class="comment">
										<p><p>In that case, distanceFilter is probably your better bet, because you don&#39;t really want to be checking for location every X minutes if the user hasn&#39;t moved.  So, after deciding upon the distance, you&#39;ll want to check to see if the user is within range after receiving the update location and before sending the local notification. Checking to see if coordinates are within a certain area is called a point in polygon problem.  <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pietschsoft.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;2008&#x2F;07&#x2F;Virtual-Earth-Polygon-Search-Is-Point-Within-Polygon.aspx">Here</a> is a handy js example for checking.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for all your help! I like the polygon function but it seems a bit big&#x2F;slow?<br>The other day I found this: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pietschsoft.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;2008&#x2F;02&#x2F;01&#x2F;Calculate-Distance-Between-Geocodes-in-C-and-JavaScript.aspx">LINK</a>. </p>
<p>I guess calc the direct distance between two geocoordinates would be best.</p>
