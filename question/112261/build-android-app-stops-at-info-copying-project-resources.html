			<p>Hi all,<br>I have the same Issue descripted in (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;83061&#x2F;build-android-app-stops-at-info-copying-project-resources)</p>
<p>I work on platform:<br>OS Windows XP SP2<br>Titanium Developer 1.2.2<br>Titanium SDK 1.5.1<br>Android SDK APIs 2.2</p>
<p>I have already try to:</p>
<ol>
<li>erase .deltafy, .titanium and .android directories</li>
<li>re-install TiDev (before I have removed manually all folders)</li>
<li>Update Android SDK to SDK Tools rev. 9</li>
</ol>
<p>Could you suggest some other Actions?</p>

<p>Try <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.appcelerator.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;continuous_builds.html">Continuous Build</a> 1.4.3 instead of 1.5.1, just to see if it works. Let me know, and I will advise further.</p>

<p><em>same behaviour also with latest 1.7.0</em></p>
<p>Note that there is no Titanium 1.6 yet. Did you mean 1.6?</p>
<p>Ensure you select &quot;APIs 2.2&quot; on the run emulator screen.</p>
<p>Try clearing your build files and force a full rebuild. Caution, though; currently the process for Android and iOS is different. This is due to ticket <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32238-titanium-mobile&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;2852">#2852</a>. Hence:</p>
<p>For iOS&#x2F;iphone, delete the contents of the project&#39;s <code>build&amp;#x2F;iphone</code> directory, select <em>Edit Project</em> in Titanium Developer and click the <em>Save Changes</em> button to force a full rebuild. Then launch the app.</p>
<p>For android, only delete <strong>the contents of the immediate subdirectories</strong> of <code>&amp;#x2F;build&amp;#x2F;android</code>, otherwise you may encounter problems. Then click the <em>Save Changes</em> button to force a full rebuild and launch the app, as above.</p>
<p>If you have recently added or removed android packages, close your emulator, delete any existing AVDs, and launch your app again.</p>
<p>Again, please provide the output from the link I pasted in my previous message.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>There is no need to delete the <code>.deltafy</code>, <code>.titanium</code> or <code>.android</code> directories at this point. You are just confusing the issue.</p>
<p>Please refer to my previous post about &quot;Install Diagnostics for Windows&quot;. If you don&#39;t post these results, I cannot help you further.</p>

										<p><p>You seem to have two versions of java installed. I would remove java altogether, and reinstall <code>jdk</code> (which will also install the correct version of java).</p>
<p>You have duplications in your path, and the order is not optimal. You are missing a semi-colon after <code>C:\Programmi\TortoiseHg\</code> which may prevent it from working properly. Lastly, <code>D:\Downloads\DevelopMobile\android-sdk\platforms\android-8\tools;</code> is not required. Hence, change it to the following:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">C:<span class="hljs-command">\WINDOWS</span><span class="hljs-command">\system</span>32;
C:<span class="hljs-command">\WINDOWS</span>;
C:<span class="hljs-command">\WINDOWS</span><span class="hljs-command">\System</span>32<span class="hljs-command">\Wbem</span>;
C:<span class="hljs-command">\Programmi</span><span class="hljs-command">\Java</span><span class="hljs-command">\jdk</span>1.6.0_21<span class="hljs-command">\bin</span>;
D:<span class="hljs-command">\Downloads</span><span class="hljs-command">\DevelopMobile</span><span class="hljs-command">\android</span>-sdk<span class="hljs-command">\tools</span>;
D:<span class="hljs-command">\Downloads</span><span class="hljs-command">\DevelopMobile</span><span class="hljs-command">\android</span>-sdk<span class="hljs-command">\platform</span>-tools;
C:<span class="hljs-command">\Programmi</span><span class="hljs-command">\TortoiseHg</span>\
</code></pre><p>Note: make sure the jdk path is correct (with the right version number) in the above path.</p>
<p>Please configure your <code>ANDROID_SDK</code> variable, so that android will run when you next run the diagnostics.</p>
<p>Note that python, git and scons are only required when you need to compile the source code. However, I would recommend you install git, so that you can easily keep your copy of the KitchenSink up to date.</p>

</code></pre><p>It looks like you have uninstalled some of your android packages. While we troubleshoot this, it&#39;s important that you don&#39;t make any changes other than those I&#39;ve recommended, otherwise we will another problem may be inadvertently introduced.</p>
