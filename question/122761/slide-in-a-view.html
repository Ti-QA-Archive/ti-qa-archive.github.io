			<h1>Slide in a View</h1>

			<p>I have a window that has a banner up top and a tableview below. When a user clicks on a table row, I want to slide in the detail view leaving the banner view in place up top. I dont want to recreate the banner on the detail page, because the animation slides it over the top of the existing one. I want just the tableview to animate to the detail view. Does anyone know how this can be achieved. </p>
<p>Also, do I need to worry about memory management since I will not be opening and closing a new window for the detail view. Any help would be gretly appreciated. Thanks!</p>

							<p>This is going to require some customization of the native functionality. When a row is clicked in your tableview you can either create a window that is sized appropriately and animate it in, or you can create a view that does the same thing. You may want to create windows as it may help with the memory management issue that you already mentioned.</p>
<p>The customization part is going to be when creating your windows&#x2F;views, that the details page usually has a back button in the top nav bar. You&#39;re going to have to manage your stack of windows and handle backing up and&#x2F;or closing your details views on your own.</p>

							<p>I have no problem doing this with another window. Is there a way to make it so the window just covers part of the screen (not the banner) and slides in from the right. Could you provide me an example or is there something like that in the Kitchen Sink. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!!</p>

							<p>I was able to accomplish this by animating a window in and out. I set the top value lower so that it not cover the banner. Thank you for leading me in the right direction.</p>
