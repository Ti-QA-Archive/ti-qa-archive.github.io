			<p>What is going to happen to Titanium Developer 1.3 ? I don&#39;t want to use the bloated thing Titanium Studio is. I just want to code my stuff in my favorite text editor of choice, textmate, and hit build once in a while in Ti Developer.<br>Is Appcelerator phasing Titanium Developer out in favor of Studio? I&#39;d like to know!</p>

							<p>Titanium Developer, as of June when Titanium Studio is released as 1.0 final, support for Developer will end.<br>That being said you can still use the scripts Jeffrey talked about in his answer, also Titanium Developer is open source and available on our GitHub page for anyone to download, modify, or enhance.</p>

										<p><p>Just voicing my opinion, that I too am disappointed that Studio is really the main choice going forward.  I will be using the scripts, so I hope at least those can be well maintained, well documented, etc.  I have a variety of reasons to not use Studio, but the two key ones are: 1) like many others, I have other editor(s) I&#39;d much prefer to use; 2) we use CoffeeScript, so the usefulness of Studio is vastly diminished.</p>

										<p><p>I should have added above - the other downside is that as far as I can tell, with the scripts all I can do is compile and run in the Simulator, so I&#39;m not able to do the run on device and Distribute steps.  Thus, I would put a very strong vote&#x2F;request in to have a way to do these steps outside of Studio.</p>

										<p><p>Christopher, I have since this post only used the command line for building and have not looked back. I, too, only use Coffeescript. Not sure if you&#39;re talking iOS or Android or both, but for archiving and distribution I open up the project in Xcode and build from there. However, I don&#39;t know how to do this for Android.</p>

										<p><p>I had the same reservations, but now that I&#39;ve transitioned to Studio I&#39;m quite liking it. I still edit all my code in Notepad++ and just use Studio to fire off the emulator and do builds. All works pretty well.</p>

							<p>I remember seeing a comment somewhere about this from Appcelerator.  Something to the effect of it being frozen.  It&#39;s not <em>going</em> anywhere, but it&#39;s also not going <em>anywhere</em> :)</p>
<p>Currently I am doing most of my mobile development (testing &#x2F; playing around with the platform) through the console, without the use of Studio or Developer.   This is a personal preference because I use custom scripts to automate and install custom SDK builds from the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_mobile">latest source branch</a>.  I will plug Studio as a huge leap forward in Titanium development.  The debugging is a welcomed breath of fresh air.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s what I do on OSX.  Add a couple things to your enviornment (.bash_profile, or whatever):</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in">alias</span> titanium=<span class="hljs-string">"/Library/Application\ Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/1.8.0/titanium.py"</span>
<span class="hljs-built_in">export</span> ANDROID_SDK=<span class="hljs-string">"/Developer/android-sdk-mac_86"</span>
</code></pre><p>Obviously replacing the paths above with those for your installation.  Now you are free to do most things from the command line:</p>
<p><strong>Create New App</strong></p>
<pre><code class="hljs">titanium create --platform=<span class="hljs-string">"iphone,android"</span> --name=testapp --id=com<span class="hljs-class">.zaplabs</span><span class="hljs-class">.testapp</span>
</code></pre><p><strong>Build and Run Project</strong> <em>(from root of project directory)</em>  </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">titanium <span class="hljs-command">run</span> <span class="hljs-comment">--platform=iphone</span>
titanium <span class="hljs-command">run</span> <span class="hljs-comment">--platform=android</span>
</code></pre><p>Keep in mind, I don&#39;t think any of this is officially supported or documented as it&#39;s intended to be used internally by Titanium Studio&#x2F;Developer.  Everything may change at any time, and the command arguments and flags are not documented in many cases.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for this, using this now. But now I&#39;ve installed iOS SDK 5.0 it defaults to that simulator when using</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">titanium <span class="hljs-command">run</span> <span class="hljs-comment">--platform=iphone</span>
</code></pre><p>and since it&#39;s still a bit buggy i&#39;d like it to force 4.2; however the &#39;run&#39; command doesn&#39;t take any more arguments than &quot;platform&quot; judging from titanium.py; any ideas?</p>
