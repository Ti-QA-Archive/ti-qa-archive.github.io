			<h1>TideSDK - New Site Launched as TideSDK Continues to Move Towards Release</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>The TideSDK Team has been working hard towards a release of TideSDK 1.3.0-beta. The 1.3.0 release will come with major library upgrades to support OSX Lion, Mountain Lion, Ubuntu 12.04, Windows 7 and 8, updated notifications support for growl in OSX, and bug fixes for improved stability. Updates to WebKit will ensure the latest HTML5 support available.</p>
<p>For current application development, please continue to use Titanium Desktop 1.2.0.RC4 in the interim. We will make an announcement about the availability of the beta. A new Nightly Build site will be launched for downloads so that you can begin to experiment with the beta. Please follow us on Twitter <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;TideSDK">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;TideSDK</a> to keep updated on what is happening with TideSDK and the upcoming release.</p>
<p>The TideSDK Team is currently developing a TideSDK Builder app. It will provide a GUI for creating, running and packaging TideSDK apps. To get developers started faster, TideSDK Builder introduces a new feature - Scaffolds. Scaffolds generate all the boiler plate to instantiate projects using specific patterns of development (such as Backbone MVC). Developers will be able to create, import and share Scaffolds.</p>
<p>The roadmap for TideSDK includes the implementation of CommonJS for 1.4 which aims to provide developers with a more modular development experience using JavaScript.</p>
<p>We have previously reported about our rebranding and documentation efforts. We are pleased to announce the launch of our new site <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tidesdk.og">TideSDK.org</a> as we continue to prepare for the upcoming release. Please check it out and let us know what you think.</p>

							<div><p>one quick question: could you remind me how to &#39;package&#39; an app?<br>My Titanium Desktop is still attempting to use the old remote packager running at Appcelerator. </p>
<p>I&#39;m sure I remember reading somewhere what the local command line was. But can&#39;t find it. </p>
<p>thanks.</p>

							<div><p>You can package locally on the command line using tibuid.py by passing it a few parameters. We have some better ideas about what we want to provide for network builds and packaging that would be superior to the way it was done by appc.</p>
<p>Also the new TideSDK Builder will be quite nice and lightweight as a simple means of creating, running and packaging projects locally once it is ready.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, we have got some excellent talent on our team of 15 and are continuing to recruit additional C++ programmers to the project since we have ambitious plans. </p>
<p>We&#39;d like to see Titanium User groups and Titans becoming more involved in increasing awareness within the community as a whole for the upcoming TideSDK release. This is after all and effort of the community and we have some very good folks dedicating time on the project. There are now more than 350,000 developers using Titanium as a solution and we know that many of these developers aneed a solution to reach the desktop (and can do so using familiar API&#39;s). </p>
<p>t would be great if you could join us on #tidesdk on freenode or join us on our mailing list to talk about how we can make this happen.</p>
