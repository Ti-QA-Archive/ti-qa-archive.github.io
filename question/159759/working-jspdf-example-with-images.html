			<h1>Working jsPDF Example with Images</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a jsPDF example working in Titanium Mobile, but it has a problem.  Though I can open it on the device and see the image, it doesn&#39;t transfer the image for some reason when I email it.  So on the device it looks good and then when I send it through email as an attachment, everything except the image is there.</p>
<p>I put this through the simulator.  I pulled the generated file from the simulator location and move it to another directory skipping the emailing portion.  If I bring it up in Adobe Reader it is missing the image.  I believe the image is linked, rather than embedded in the PDF.</p>
<p>Does anyone have a working example of the jsPDF library in Titanium Mobile that is generating PDFs with PNG or JPEG images that you are able to email?</p>
<p>Yes, I have seen the thread and I did attempt to request the code.  Does anyone have this code that I could try?<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;142403&#x2F;need-help-in-adding-image-file-to-pdf-which-i-created</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Martin</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I guess this is aimed at me, I was the author of the plug-in for jsPDF which gives image support.</p>
<p>Your request must have slipped through the cracks - I have just checked and you appear to have DevLinked me almost 6 months ago - should have pocked the bear again.</p>
<p>I will email you the code I created previously.  Keep in mind I have not done anything with this in the past year but it all worked before - no reason to suspect anything wrong now.</p>

							<p>Image blob needs to be base64 encoded as a dataurl and that passed to jsPDF in every other jsPDF implementation.  Since you didn&#39;t post any details about what you have done, we dont know if you actually did that.</p>
