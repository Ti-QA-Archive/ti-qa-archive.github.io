			<p>I was hoping you might be able to give me some advice on Mobile Application development. I have inherited a legacy system that comprises a mobile application running on Windows Mobile 6.5 devices that synchronizes with a windows desktop applicationvia a physical connection using a USB cable, the architecture is below..</p>
<p>Application Architecture<br>1)On the mobile device, a  .exe program written in Visual Basic that executes against a Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Mobile Edition using .Net Framework<br>2)To synchronized data, a physical connection using a USB cable and Active Sync to push and pull data from the Desktop Application.<br>3)The Desktop Application is an extended version of the mobile running SQL Server Express, VB Application and .Net Framework.</p>
<p>As Windows Mobile 6.5 is now no longer available the legacy system can no longer be used commercially. Therefore there is a need to recreate the application that will run on Android devices (and possibly iPhone? or is Windows 7)</p>
<p>Can I use Titanium to build both the desktop and mobile application, what databases are used on the mobile and desktop to sync. How is the sync managed offline, and when online? I could really do with a getting stated for both mobile and desktop solution. Any help would be most appreciated.</p>

							<div><p>Thanks, I can start from scratch that is not a problem. It is only the business rules I will be taking from the original application, none of the functionality. If I build a webapp with all processing online how does a native app fit in with that? Sorry to be dense. If I have mobile workers in the field who are collecting data the likelihood is the online access will fluctuate and they need to record data live as it happens, to then shared that data with a the mobile team and office based staff. It is a strategy I need to start with before I go off down the wrong route. Thanks in advance…</p>

							<div><p>I would make a server based app - the base backend that will REST serve the data in a JSON format. From here the Ti Desktop apps for the &#39;fixed&#39; clients will behave just like a webpage and for the mobile you will have to store the data and sync it by request or when they have an internet connection.</p>

<p>I guess wonderlist is the best example about sync the data on desktop and mobile. But i am not sure its Open source or not.</p>

<p>sounds like <em>online</em> is a more convenient step. with that, what&#39;s the expected uptime? the interweb do fails, and it happens at the most inconvenient time. the mobile worker stepped out of carrier friendly range, server went down, hosting company doing maintenance, etc.</p>
<p>now, I assume it&#39;s a corporate app. the employees will <strong>have to</strong> use it, everyone will have to live by using the app via mobile browser. that depends on the time requires to run the queries, I&#39;ve heard from friends who work with .net stuff, they have queries that need to ran overnight. most browsers will timed out in 30-60 seconds range.</p>
<p>having both web &amp; native generally works for end user facing products (4square, twitter, tumblr, facebook, etc), so the product will have a permanent real-estate on as many screens as possible.</p>
<p>if you really need offline syncing, and willing to step away from your comfort zone, that is Microsoft, checkout <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;couchdb.apache.org&#x2F;">couchdb</a>. afaik, couch has master-master sync out of the box with just minor setups. and it also has a <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;951">module for Ti</a>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, imho, avoid syncing… just stop the app from working without internet connection.</p>

							<p>Few ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forget about Windows mobile. Titanium does not have support for it (donno if will ever have)</li>
<li><p>I&#39;m not sure this is possible, at least not o iOs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you use Titanium Desktop you will basically create a &quot;self contained&quot; webpage, with more capabilities (filesystem access, network access, zip, start a builtin webserver, etc).<br>You can also use a &quot;backend&quot; in PHP,Ruby or Python that will do the hard job :)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The db system used by Titanium is SQLLite, on both desktop and mobile, so a sync between this would make sense to make use of, but you will have to build the actual sync algorithm.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can even integrate nodejs in the desktop app if js and node are something u are confortable with.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What you want to do is not easy, but is doable :)</p>
<p>The best resources to read are:<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Home</p>
<p>And  then on the github the kitchensink -  actually here is where you really learn</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_mobile&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;demos</p>
<p>There are other resources, blogs, github repos and gists that will help you, but you need to dig a little :)</p>
<p>Hope this helps you a little.</p>

							<p>the word <em>sync</em> gives me the chill. I assume your old system everything is handled by ActiveSync? tbh, syncing is a bitch. I&#39;m still working on a decent algo with a simple conflict resolution to work with <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;737">Dropbox</a>.</p>
<p>imho, depending on the budget, if you can afford to start from scratch, then go for it. or just make everything into webapp, force everything to be online, forget offline syncing altogether.</p>
<p>you still can have native apps if you wish. Ti can help with desktops (Mac &#x2F; PC), iOS, android, and soon, blackberry. it sounds a lot of work but trust me, it&#39;s mostly grunt work, which most likely you&#39;ll need to do anyway.</p>
<p>good luck.</p>
