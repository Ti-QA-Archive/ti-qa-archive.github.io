			<h1>App Store Submission Reject - Not Enough Native Capabilities</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>We just had our iOS app rejected from the App Store for not having enough native capabilities built-in. (In fairness, it&#39;s currently just a window that loads an HTML5 app.)</p>
<p>The app in question is a web booking app for a taxi company. It allows users to quickly and easily book a cab to come pick them up.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s my question: Does anyone have any thoughts on what we could do to get the app accepted? Has anyone else run into this issue before?</p>
<p>Some thoughts we have include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tapping into the user&#39;s data on the phone to grab their name and number.</li>
<li>Use native geolocation to suggest a pickup address.</li>
<li>Save previous entries for quick-entry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any suggestions would be most welcome!</p>

							<p>If everything you do is online there is no reason for the app to exists.<br>Try to convert the UI into native code or at least to be local, so the app to work somehow offline and to ask for internet only when is about to call the taxi, or get the address, etc.</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve had this issue also before, add a few other pages like: </p>
<ul>
<li>Map to find the location</li>
<li>click to call us page</li>
<li>about us</li>
<li>more page with their Facebook or twitter. </li>
</ul>
<p>you can find all these codes on the Kitchen Sink from appcelerator</p>
<p>but just having it open a web view app, that will never get through apple these days</p>

							<p>A really simple trick:</p>
<p>If your page uses a fake navigation bar, hide it and make a native one. You can also change few elements to native ones, like a menu to a tab bar, etc.</p>
<p>The map is also a good idea. Maybe if you post some screen we will be able to help you more!</p>
