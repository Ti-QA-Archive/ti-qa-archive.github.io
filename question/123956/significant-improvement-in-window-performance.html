			<h1>Significant Improvement in Window Performance</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, this isn&#39;t a question, it&#39;s a lesson learned from the trenches.</p>
<p>I&#39;m new to titanium. Been coding for 3 weeks. I&#39;ve built a mega sized social networking app that was working ok in the simulator with a few crashes here and there, but was responding really slowly on my iphone 4.</p>
<p>The app I&#39;m building was a next gen version of a preview built by someone else that we used earlier in the year to win clients. I adopted his styling and assets (graphics). I remember our preview app being jerky too - so I assumed that titanium was to blame. This morning I began rebuild my whole app from scratch based on the tweetanium app architecture because I assumed the jerkiness had to do with multiple contexts and lots of includes on each new window. After building 2 screen, I was still experiencing slow performance and was banging my head against the wall. Then I started wondering if the devices was sucking memory from drawing the background because I noticed before it crashing it would often only draw half of the background. I took backgroundImage property off the window (every window being opened) and just set it to a color.</p>
<p>BOOOM!</p>
<p>Instant responses to button clicking and new window opening. Turns out that the guy I&#39;d inherited the app from had made the background image 1500x3000px - a .png of 66kb on disk. I was also using a separate image for the title bar that was 12kb. I combined the two into 1 image totally 10kb, 320x480. Now my app looks the same but is responding really well.</p>
<p>There are still memory leaks and my app is crashing - so more diagnosing and trial and error for me - but at least the performance has improved! Hope this helps someone else, I&#39;ve been trialing and erroring on this for about 5 days. Coming from a .net background one of the things that is really hard with titanium is not being able to see and know what&#39;s going on.</p>

							<div><p>more tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>use a className for table rows with the same layout - this is a MUST :)</li>
<li>don&#39;t use opacity or transparent background where possible ( set background color of elements even if it&#39;s the same with the parent )</li>
<li>avoid rounded corners (where possible)</li>
<li>set dimensions where possible ( auto requires cpu to make calculations)</li>
<li>try not to scale images -  give the app the image at the size it needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>hope it helps:)</p>

							<div><p>My app is running on Ti 1.7.1&#x2F;2 (tried both). It&#39;s building for iOS4.3 and was deployed to my iphone4.</p>
<p>The places where crashing are still occurring most are tables with approximates 100-200 rows each containing their own thumbmail (but the crash is not consistent) and tab views (again not consistent).</p>
<p>I think I&#39;m going to build my own tab view using pure views similar to tweetanium.</p>
<p>Dan few questions about your points:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I didn&#39;t know about the background color trick… interesting! So if I have a table row that has a white background, and I stick a view in it to get vertical scaffolding (layout:&#39;vertical&#39;) I should set the background to white?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Would it be better or worse for performance to use a .png background with rounded corners than asking the cpu to round a view?</p>
</li>
<li><p>If I have a height:&#39;auto&#39; set for EVERY label in my app would this be sucking lots of memory? Should I be setting width on Labels too?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Trying not to scale images is impossible in my app, it has to be done, often 200 at a time when displaying table data. The images are being scales from 75x75 down to 20… Not sure what to do.</p>
</li>

							<div><p>for the images that you are scaling down, have a thumbnail version on the server that is used for the table, and the larger 75 x 75 for when needed.</p>
