							<p>Hi Ronny,</p>
<p>I am also fairly new to Titanium, but have learned a lot since I started. A lot of what I have learned is due to the amazing Appcelerator community. What are you having problems with?</p>

							<p>Missing from your question are a number of important pieces of information. I suggest you take a look at the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Using+Questions+and+Answers">Using Questions and Answers</a> article, specifically the Q&amp;A Question Checklist.  The missing information is critical to reproducing problems in a test environment and often indicates other factors that cause the undesirable outcome you are experiencing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Missing an actual, specific question (specific questions get answered faster)</li>
<li>Missing any details about your environment (specifics help in answering your questions)</li>
<li>There is a difference between replying to a comment and adding a new reply, please learn the difference.  It keeps the Q&amp;A cleaner</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org">Wiki</a> and the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com">Docs</a> are a great place to fall back on for self help.</p>
<p>For those just starting out, go through the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;training.appcelerator.com&#x2F;zero-to-app">Zero-to-App video series</a> </p>
<p>Martin&#39;s offer is very generous.  Understand (and this was mentioned in your other thread) that those helping in here for FREE often bill out hourly at $150-$200 an hour, so please, be polite and appreciate the time they are sharing with you. Nothing aggravates a professional volunteer more than an ungrateful recipient of pro services for free (not saying that you personally have done this)</p>
