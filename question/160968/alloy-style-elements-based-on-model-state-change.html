			<h1>Alloy: Style Elements Based On Model State Change</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I need to make UI changes based on the state of the model and collections which create the UI elements. For example, I have a list of clients that need to be picked-up. This list is a set of TableViewRows created from a collection, and who&#39;s model attribute is set to a model instance from the collection. When a client is picked up, the driver clicks a &quot;picked-up&quot; button on that client instance. This event changes the state of the model so that its &#39;is_picked_up&#39; field is set from false to true. </p>
<p>I would like to update the state of the UI to reflect the updated state of the model, for example grey out the appearance of elements who&#39;s underlying model&#39;s &#39;is_picked_up&#39; field is set to &#39;true&#39;. Additionally, as the TableView is built from the associated collection, I would also like to style each row based on the same condition, so that when the window first loads all rows who&#39;s associated model&#39;s &#39;is_picked_up&#39; field is set to &#39;true&#39; is also appropriately styled.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
