			<h1>Application has exited from simulator ios</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>Okay I can&#39;t get ANYTHING to run on the ios simulator.</p>
<p>I first set up this mac about a year ago and everything ran fine. I had a very simple app to test it and the iOS simulator ran it perfectly with no issues.</p>
<p>I have now come back to this set up to finally look at the iOS version of my &#39;real&#39; app and obviously, as much time has passed, Ti upgraded to 3.1.3GA which I assumed would be a safe, wise, sensible move.</p>
<p>Now NOTHING will run I get the &quot;Application has exited from simulator&quot; error. </p>
<p>I am now just using a new, default mobile application as a test.</p>
<p>If I start the iOS simulator first it will close when it reaches this point.</p>
<p>I have completely uninstalled and reinstalled XCode and Ti studio (I remembered to delete the Node folder before reinstalling)</p>
<p>I have tried the Adobe apple script thing where there was a 32bit vs 64 bit issue - no change.</p>
<p>I have tried executing the xcodeproject directly and XCode compiles and runs it and does fire up the simulator which then gives me a large red screen simply saying there&#39;s an error. I think it was the Could Not Find app.js (remember this is a new, default mobile app with no js errors or dependent files etc)</p>
<p>My last resort now is to completely reinstall the machine all the way back to and including OSX.</p>
<p>I know Ti is not &#39;supported&#39; below certain OSX versions… does this mean that it actually <em>does not work</em>? (for example, Ti is not &#39;supported&#39; in vista yet I had been using it readily with few, if any, windows related issues)</p>
<p>Incidentally - if I try running using SDK 3.0.0.GA, I get a red error saying there is no &#39;build&#39; command!</p>
<p>Titanium Studio, build: 3.1.3.201309132423<br>(c) Copyright 2012-2013 by Appcelerator, Inc.  All rights reserved.</p>
<p>Build: jenkins-titanium-rcp-master-21 (origin&#x2F;master)<br>Date: 13 September 2013, 00:23:57</p>
<p>….however if I type &quot;titanium -v&quot; it tells me 3.1.2 - I&#39;m guessing perhaps one is the studio the other is the SDK or something? …If I check with terminal it tells me there are two versions of Titanium (in the correct directories) 3.0.0.GA and 3.1.3.GA (set as default)</p>
<p>Mac OSX 10.7.5 Build 11G63 2Gb 2.1GHz Intel Core 2 Duo</p>
<p>XCode 4.6</p>

							<div><p>I should also add that I tried deleting the iphone &#x2F; build folder and I always &#39;clean&#39; the project every time before a build anyway.</p>
<p>I also did the &#39;reset device and contents&#39; thing on the iOS Simulator (When I opened it &#x2F; ran it myself - or on the times I compiled in XCode)</p>

							<p>There&#39;s no need to reinstall OS X, though you will need to upgrade. You need to upgrade to Xcode 5, as 4.6 is not supported. You&#39;ll need to get it from the Apple Developer web site, as the AppStore version will be 5.1 (or at least something newer than 5.0). I&#39;m pretty sure Xcode 5.0 requires Mavericks. But that&#39;s a free download from the AppStore.</p>
<p>In my testing, Xcode 5.1 will work but you won&#39;t see logging output on the console. There might be some other quirks as well. Those compatibility problems should be addressed in our next release.</p>
<p>We&#39;re at Apple&#39;s mercy with OS and Xcode minimums. They have specified that all apps must be iOS 7 compatible. For that, you have to be using Xcode 5. Apple sets all those minimum requirements and we just have to play their game.</p>

										<p><p>Have you checked the AppStore to see if Mavericks will run on your computer? Supposedly it&#39;s more broadly compatible. It might be a bit slow, but if it works that would carry you over till you can buy a new machine.</p>
