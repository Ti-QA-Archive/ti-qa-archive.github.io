			<h1>iPad Wallpaper App</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am looking to develop a iPad wallpaper app using some photos of mine.  I am not much of a developer, but was wondering what a good approach would be to do this?</p>
<p>I plan on having a site which will have static URL&#39;s for the galleries and wallpapers.  I was just not sure how I should go about doing this in Titanium.  </p>
<p>Any ideas are appreciated.</p>

							<p>Maybe set up an RSS feed on your site that has all of your wallpapers and information about the wallpapers, then use the RSS feed example in the KitchenSink to bring it all together. With the RSS feed your users can be updated when you post new stuff.</p>

										<p><p>Hey thanks.. thats not a bad idea.  I wonder if I could setup categories though by doing that.  I plan on having quite a few wallpapers 500+.  </p>
<p>Also, I wonder if Apple would approve such a shell type of style app into the AppStore.</p>

										<p><p>I know they will not approve aggregators, but you can use your RSS as a source for the info, in the background, and then wrap an app around it. Would be pretty simple to do categories, look at different RSS feeds and how they are organized.</p>

										<p><p>Ok great.  So when you say &quot;wrap an app around it&quot; would this be like adding a UI bar at the bottom with some buttons on it? :)</p>
<p>Ill take a look at the different types of image CMS&#39;s and see what kind of rss options they have.</p>

							<p>Well, kind of. You will need to add some features because if it is just pulling in data from the site and showing it in an app, apple will say no. What I recommend is parsing the data and making it look good in an app. Categories, saving wallpapers, previewing them, etc.</p>

										<p><p>Also, if I take the rss.js example from Kitchen Sink and rename it to app.js and drop it into my new project, it does not seem to work. :)</p>
<p>Getting funky errors like this:</p>
<p><code>[ERROR] Script Error = Result of expression &amp;#39;Ti.UI.currentWindow&amp;#39; [null] is not an object. at app.js (line 23).</code></p>
<p><code>[ERROR] Script Error = Result of expression &amp;#39;Ti.UI.currentWindow&amp;#39; [null] is not an object. at app.js (line 37).</code></p>
<p>Do I need to copy more of the example?</p>

										<p><p>well, that doesn&#39;t exactly work like that, you should have a better read at the KS example.</p>
