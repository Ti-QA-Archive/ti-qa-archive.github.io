			<h1>Subscription and debugger, working or not?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Ok! I guess Titanium got us in a hostage situation, can&#39;t stop using it, too many hours spent learning and building the apps but no more nice debugger for the free Studio version.  I spent nearly 10 hours trying to get the Beta version&#39;s debugger to work after the last update.</p>
<p>Now, Titanium (a little bit like an angry god), decided that we have to pay to have access to the debugger. Pay a subscription, with a price unilaterally defined by the good will of the company.</p>
<p>The question is:  Will buying a subscription fix the debugger?  </p>
<p>Seemingly not, referring to the Q&amp;A titled &quot;Titanium Studio Debugger issue&quot; by Vincenzo Cocciolo, it doesn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>What to do?</p>
<p>Trash the code, therefore lose all these hours of work?<br>Do without a debugger?<br>Pay for the subscription but never own the tool?</p>
<p>Will, next month, next year, Titanium perform a new &quot;change of politic&quot; and drastically increase the prices of its subscriptions?</p>

							<p>I&#39;m an independent user too, not connected with Appcelerator, so take this as just another user&#39;s perspective.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been using Titanium now part time for the last few months, and until recently we never had a debugger as an option at all.  So historically, almost all Titanium apps out there now have been developed without the aid of the debugger.  Therefore it is definitely possible to do it.</p>
<p>The debugger was never promised to be free long term.  The Studio preview was just that – a preview.  Since they announced the new plans a couple weeks ago we have known that the debugger will only be available in paid subscriptions starting July 1.</p>
<p>It seems that from one of Paul&#39;s answers in another thread, the most recent builds of Studio have included that distinction so they could test the licensing works properly.  However, you can continue to run an older build of Studio preview with full debugging up until June 30.</p>
<p>After that, you will need Indie or higher to get debugger support.  Is that worth the cost (in combination with the other Indie features)?  Only you can make that call.</p>
<p>But I urge you to not think of this as taking away something from the free community edition – it never really had this to begin with.  All you were getting recently was access to a beta preview of what would be officially released later in June.</p>
<p>We can all moan that we&#39;d like the debugger included in the free edition too.  But as I see it that is their perogative even if I don&#39;t like it.</p>
<p>In terms of spending hours trying to get the debugger to work, that can at least partly be attributed to the fact this is beta level code.  Will buying a subscription magically change it from beta quality to fully tested production quality?  I can&#39;t think of a reason to assume that.</p>
<p>I for one have never yet even loaded the preview of Studio.  I&#39;d worked without a debugger all along so far, and I could see from the Q&amp;A that it was not all smooth sailing for everyone.  So I opted to just wait it out and work in Aptana&#x2F;Ti Developer like I always had.</p>
<p>Do I personally think Indie is worth $49&#x2F;month?  Actually, no, I don&#39;t.  But overnight I did decide to lock in the $399&#x2F;year offer before it expired.  But I did it not so much because I think it is a deal (I think it is still overpriced) but to hedge my bets.  No way I&#39;d do that with $1910, and it took me until now to convince myself to make the plunge at $399, but I&#39;m really hoping Appcelerator thrives long term and I&#39;m not naive enough to think they can do that if they include everything in the free edition.</p>
<p>I still haven&#39;t loaded Studio and quite honestly, I may give it a few more weeks until I do.  I&#39;m not currently spending enough of my day in mobile development to warrant jeopardizing my working environment until the &quot;bleeding edge&quot; is has resolved some of the beta issues.</p>
<p>Just my .02</p>

							<p>As the one cited in the Luc post I can say there is worst around!</p>
<p>The Objective-C is a nightmare, not made for humans (programmers) I have 30 years experience in programming and except for the MASM (Macro Assembler) and some PDP11 assemblative code I never found a so complex syntax and unreadable language</p>
<p>Monotouch (C# for IOS) was my second choice and after paid 300 bucks last month Novell has been acquired by Attachmate and Monotouch product dropped. 300 bucks lost!!!</p>
<p>Tried with Corona SDK but the word &quot;Debugger&quot; never exists.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile? Lot of fun with Titanium…</p>
<p>This is a very young market, no one can say who will be the winner, we will see in the future more merges, acquisitions and &quot;out-of-business&quot;</p>

							<p>Well, I&#39;m Java programmer and I&#39;m about learning Android. I&#39;m also about learning Objective-C, which I find a beautiful language. XCode and Eclipse are both mature IDEs and it&#39;s a joy to work with them.</p>
<p>I feel the same pain as many collegues here about Titanium, speak, buggy IDE, often changing political orientations at Appcelerator, no answers as a community member…</p>
<p>But: I went for the Indie annual subscription. Why? While I&#39;m learning the native frameworks, I am able to code working apps easily with Ti. Appcelerator builds tools for the hottest market since quite a long time, and since they need to make their living, someone needs to pay. I think it&#39;s fair to pay them, if I get paid for the work that I do with their tools.</p>
<p>Back to your question: Will buying a subscription fix the debugger?<br>I think it will. Maybe not today or tomorrow, but they&#39;ll get it going. </p>
