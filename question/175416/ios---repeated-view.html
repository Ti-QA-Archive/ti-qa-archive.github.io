			<p>I have a tabgroup. Each tab&#39;s right nav button will bring up a pop over containing a audio player (view) that controls the current audio.</p>
<p>My question is, each tab has the same audio player. Should I create multiple of them? Or should I just create one and every time the tab changes, it&#39;s removed from the previous tab and add to the new tab?</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think I can add one view to multiple parents, can I?</p>
<p>What is the best approach?</p>

							<p>Hi Shawn</p>
<p>Are you trying to solve any of these problems before you ask a question?  Your recent (last few weeks) quick fire question asking makes me think that you have not actually tried to try to solve any of these problems yourself.</p>
<p>There are IMMENSE benefits to trying to solve the problems before asking questions, including;</p>
<ul>
<li>Not having to ask a question</li>
<li>Providing code to show what you have tried so far</li>
<li>Understanding the problem at hand more clearly than you did before you started</li>
<li>Failure is good - gets yu one step closer to success</li>
</ul>
<p>Back to the problem;</p>
<p>You have not said if this is;</p>
<ul>
<li>Android or iOS</li>
<li>Handheld or Tablet</li>
<li>Non-Alloy or Alloy</li>
<li>Ti SDK version</li>
</ul>
<p>I will make guesses based on your earlier questions.  This is an iPad app using Alloy and Ti SDK 3.2.3 ALWAYS supply these in the future, helps us make decisions and provides you with a faster normally.</p>
<p>I will not ask why you are creating different tabs that display the same view for each tab - I am sure you have your reasons.</p>
<p>You create a controller, including; js, xml and tss files inside the xml define a <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.UI.iPad.Popover">PopOver</a> and on each button press you create the controller instance to show the popover.  You can pass extra parameters to allow the presentation to be different for each tab instance or simply to pass a different url;</p>
<p>Very basic example;</p>
<p><strong>example.xml</strong></p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">Alloy</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">Popover</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">title</span>=<span class="hljs-value">'Hello'</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">height</span>=<span class="hljs-value">'100'</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">width</span>=<span class="hljs-value">'250'</span>&gt;</span>
            <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">Label</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">id</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"lbl"</span>&gt;</span>Not set<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">Label</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">Popover</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">Alloy</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p><strong>example.js</strong></p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> args = <span class="hljs-built_in">arguments</span>[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>] || {};
$.lbl.setText(args.title || <span class="hljs-string">'Not Passed'</span>);
</code></pre><p><strong>Usage</strong> (each button)</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// assumes id of btn</span>
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">btn</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> popover = Alloy.createController(<span class="hljs-string">'example'</span>, {
        title: <span class="hljs-string">'Hello World'</span>
    }).getView().show({
        view: $.btn
    });
};
</code></pre>

										<p><p>Having many questions doesn&#39;t mean that I don&#39;t try to solve them before asking. I look through docs and search over the internet. If I can find the answer I wouldn&#39;t ask here.</p>
<p>Also, sometimes I have my solutions in my mind, but I want to know other people&#39;s suggestions. My solution might not be the best. Even if it is I need confirmation. Asking questions is powerful; you can&#39;t rely on just yourself, no matter how smart you are. By doing so you also benefit the others. This is the essential function of this forum. I think so I can ask more questions, not that I don&#39;t have to ask questions.</p>
<p>Didn&#39;t I provide my solutions in this question? Creating multiple views is what I chose to do, same as your answer. I&#39;m wondering if I can just re-use one view so memory is conserved.</p>
<p>By the way, &quot;iOS&quot; in the title.</p>

										<p><p>I have no problems with you or anyone else asking questions, after all that is the point of this Q&amp;A.  My concern is that the sheer number of recent questions, coupled with limited details and rarely any information to show any of the insight you just said you had before asking the question mad it look like you are lazy.  I accept that is not the case, but please accept my comments as well.  If you ask questions - provide all the information you have to hand, otherwise it looks like you are not even trying.</p>
<p>When you said you provided your solutions, you had only provided basic outlines, not anything that could be reviewed and suggestions given.  It also makes it really hard to answer back at your level of knowledge.  If it is clear you understand the underlying problem and maybe more - we do not need to explain things as if you are coding for the first time.  We all win.</p>
<p>Back to the problem, it is not a case of creating many at the expense of memory.  As a popover is used - only one will be available at anyone time, so you are only ever creating one instance in memory.  If you touch any area away from the popover, it is dismissed, so as long as your code cleans itself you will not suffer any memory issues, plus the maintain-ability is greatly increased.</p>
