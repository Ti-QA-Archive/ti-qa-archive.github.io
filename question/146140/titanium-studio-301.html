							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Where are you seeing these as being removed?</p>
<p>We&#39;re you previously selecting these somewhere - this question could have a multitude of variations, so please provide more information.</p>
<p>Did you update XCODE recently?</p>
<p>In order to target the latest IOS the latest Xcode automatically uses 4.3 as the entry point but runs up to 6.0 automatically, you would have to set a minimum IOS level in the <strong>Tiapp.xml</strong> file.</p>
<p>If you mean the simulators are gone for earlier versions then you can add older ones back using the Xcode - see <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;apple.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;47323&#x2F;installing-xcode-with-ios-4-3-device-simulator">this link for details</a>.</p>

<p>Its <strong>Christmas Day</strong>, the man volunteers here, take a fracking chill pill and have some patience!!</p>
<p>By my count, Malcolm has written about half your app for you in the last 2 months.  Your clients should be paying Malcolm instead of you to have their apps written.</p>

										<p><p>Hi</p>
<p>I have done some digging and found some evidence to back up my belief that the iOS SDK is the upper limit and not the lower limit - meaning you can compile using iOS 6.0 and you can still use that to install to a device as low as 4.3, it says this in the console when you build the app.</p>
<ul>
<li>[INFO] :  Building using iOS SDK: 6.0</li>
<li>[INFO] :  Building for iOS iPhone Simulator: 6.0</li>
<li>[INFO] :  Building for device family: iphone</li>
<li>[INFO] :  Building for iOS 6.0; using 4.3 as minimum iOS version</li>
</ul>
<p>A <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;145777&#x2F;issues-after-titanium-30-installation">comment</a> by Chris Barber @ Appcelerator</p>
<p><em>&quot;Also, there was a bug in older versions of Titanium Studio where the iOS SDK dropdown would incorrectly list all the iOS Simulators, not the actual installed iOS SDKs. That means if you have iOS 6 SDK installed with iOS 5.1 and 6.0 Simulators installed, it would allow you to pick 5.1 or 6.0. Picking 5.1 would then tell the build scripts to use 5.1, but the build script wouldn&#39;t find 5.1 and would actually just use 6.0 anyways. Crazy, I know.&quot;</em>  <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;devlink&#x2F;profile&#x2F;570711&#x2F;chris-barber">Chris Barber</a></p>
<p>Just make sure to not include any 6.0 specific features of course.</p>
