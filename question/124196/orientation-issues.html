			<h1>Orientation Issues</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have my application and it opens up a new window that I want in Landscape mode. However, with the latest version of Titanium it seems that there are issues of which I&#39;m not exactly sure how to describe them. First of all, here is my code that I put in the window that I am loading that I want in landscape mode:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">
<span class="hljs-component">win.addEventListener('focus',function(){
    Titanium<span class="hljs-string">.UI.orientation</span> = Titanium<span class="hljs-string">.UI.LANDSCAPE_RIGHT</span>;
    win<span class="hljs-string">.orientationModes</span> = [Titanium<span class="hljs-string">.UI.LANDSCAPE_RIGHT]</span>;
}</span>);
</code></pre><p>It looks like it is placing a new version of the window below the old version of the window, but the old window is purely visual and cannot be interacted with. However, it seems to be &#39;in the way&#39; of the active layer beneath it so the new active layer does not respond to my touches. I can tell this because the old layer seems to be shrunk so that the edges do not reach the edge of the screen and I can see just a bit of the active layer and those areas do respond to my touch. </p>
<p>Also, if I go back to the previous window, my tableview seems to have a black margin beneath and above it. Is this a known issue, or am I doing something wrong?</p>
<p>Thanks so much!</p>

							<div><p>A couple of things here. First, always try to post the versions of the platform, mobile sdk, and studio that you are using. Second, can you create a small use case that can easily be copied and pasted into a new project? This will get you much quick and more useful answers from the community. </p>
<p>Without knowing much else though, you should set the orientationModes on a window when you create it, then set the ui orientation immediately after. That will usually take care of the window for the duration of its existence.</p>

										<p><p>I am using the latest version of both titanium and Xcode (1.7.2 and 4.2 Preview) and am testing on iOS. </p>
<p>I can try to create a usecase, although the app is rather large so it might take a while. Basically, what I am doing is creating this window, and then opening the window when a listview item is clicked. Is there a standard way I could share the project with you (or the usecase)?</p>
