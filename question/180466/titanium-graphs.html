		<section>
			<p>I want to use create a line graph in Titanium using native code (no webview). Is it currently not possible to do it without using a third-party module from other developers or in the marketplace? </p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve never run into a charting library for Titanium that uses native views.  That doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t one.</p>
<p>But I have one question:  why are you opposed to a webview?  </p>
<p>There are so many HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS frameworks for charting that produce very good looking charts.  It would be hard to imagine a Titanium module generating charts as nice as jqPlot or Highcharts.  </p>
<p>You could try to roll your own, but you&#39;d probably spend 3-4 weeks working on a general purpose library for charting, and then you probably would only have 5% of what these other libraries can bring you.  And I think you&#39;d either need SVG rendering or some other 2D graphics library, which kind of brings you back around to the WebView, which already has SVG support.</p>
<p>There&#39;s no shame in using WebView.  It&#39;s 5 million lines of code for a reason!  :-)</p>

										<p><p>Yes also agree with  Jason Priebe. if you can go for native it will take time. if you use webview then you can achieve it easily with good animation also…</p>

										<p><p>I am not very familiar with webview. Essentially, I am creating an application can run completely offline and I am not sure if that is feasible without adding too much HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS code to the project. Also, since the webview component will not be converted to native code, I am not sure how that will affect the overall performance of the app.</p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t think you will run into performance issues unless your charts are very complex.</p>
<p>Try opening a jqPlot demo page in your mobile device&#39;s browser.  Example: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jqplot.com&#x2F;deploy&#x2F;dist&#x2F;examples&#x2F;resizablePlot.html">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jqplot.com&#x2F;deploy&#x2F;dist&#x2F;examples&#x2F;resizablePlot.html</a>.</p>
<p>If it performs well in the browser, it will perform well in your titanium app (and probably even better, since you can take network latency out of the equation if you&#39;re using local files).</p>
