			<h1>You uploaded an APK that is signed with a different certificate to your previous APKs.</h1>

			<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I uploaded a previous version of my app directly from the android bin folder with the project without signing it properly when i was learning.</p>
<p>But i have added pushed to my app and they only work with my development push keys i need to have a proper signed version that work with production keys.</p>
<p>But after signing my app properly and then trying to upload to Google play i get the error.</p>
<p>You uploaded an APK that is signed with a different certificate to your previous APKs. You must use the same certificate. Your existing APKs are signed with the certificate(s) with fingerprint(s).</p>
<p>I would be happy to delete the app old and then re upload the production signed version but Google play does not allow you to delete the app.</p>
<p>say com.myapp which is annoying but i built this app cross platform so i dont really want to change the app id.</p>
<p>Can anyone suggest a way around this or a possible solution?</p>
<p>I really need my app to work for push notifications in production not development.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>You are out of luck, my friend. You cannot change your keystore after you upload to Google Play… that&#39;s the entire point of signing an app.</p>
<p>The only course of action you have is to upload a new version of your app with a different appID. You can be smart about it, though, and perhaps upload an update to your &quot;old&quot; app that directs users to go download the new version.</p>
