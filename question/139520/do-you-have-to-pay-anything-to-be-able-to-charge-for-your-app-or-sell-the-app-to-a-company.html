			<h1>Do you have to pay anything to be able to charge for your app or sell the app to a company</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I couple of weeks back I got a call from from someone at appcelerator to see how I was getting on with it. Also during the conservation they said for me to be able to sell any app in the appstore (it&#39;s fine if it&#39;s free) or to sell and apps I create to another company I would have to become a certified partner at a cost of £5000 a year.</p>
<p>I struggling to find on the website where it says this. Does anyone have any idea if this is true or not?</p>

							<p>This is completely bogus. </p>
<p>You can sell applications on the app store without having to pay a single cent to Appcelerator. (you already pay a fee to apple or Google to sell your apps on their store, so that would amount to double-dipping).</p>
<p>I remember seeing a post a few weeks back with someone having the exact same experience you had. And the outcome of that was that this was more a case of <em>shady</em> selling practices from the person on the phone than anything else.</p>
