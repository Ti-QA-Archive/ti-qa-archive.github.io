							<p>Unfortunately in 1.8.x it appears JSS is broken.</p>
<p>I checked and it is not working in the 1.9.x CI builds either.  I&#39;ll log a ticket and update with the Jira # once received.</p>

							<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Please note this issue has now been fixed in the 1.9.x CI builds available here http:&#x2F;&#x2F;builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;index.html</p>
<p>Make sure when downloading you select the master branch.</p>
<p>Other things to keep in mind.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If you where using app.jss as a bootstrap you will now need to use global.jss instead. Just copy the contents from app.jss into a file call global.jss</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you have file paths in your JSS such as imagines or other assets. You will need to test them as their relative path has changed.  I just avoided this issue all together an use app:&#x2F;&#x2F;your&#x2F;file&#x2F;path&#x2F;goes&#x2F;here</p>
</li>
</ol>

										<p><p>&quot;Use 1.9&quot; doesn&#39;t really seem like a terrific solution for &quot;1.8 broke our app&quot;, though. Why is the change to global.jss necessary? What else is going to be added&#x2F;changed in 1.9?</p>

										<p><p>Hi Sixten, I&#39;m not sure the reasons for the above. I do believe that the global.jss is the correct way to do this as outlined in the wiki.</p>
<p>Due to my deadlines I&#39;ve been using the CI build has it has the fixes I need.</p>

										<p><p>Just looked at the wiki again and it goes into detail, on the device specific layouts but not global.jss. There is a presentation here http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.slideshare.net&#x2F;vlucas&#x2F;crossplatform-mobile-development-with-titanium that has some information on it.</p>
<p>There are also a few QA posts that outline how to use the different jss functionality.</p>
