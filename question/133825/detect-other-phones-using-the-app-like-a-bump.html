			<h1>Detect other phones using the app, like a bump?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m looking at building an app that will need to detect others phones around it that are using the same app. Does Titanium support this for iPhone and or Android? And please point me in the right direction as I have no idea what to call it or what it is.</p>
<p>An example of this would be an ability to detect other phones in a range, feet or inches, so one could text chat with that device.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

							<p>Some thoughts.  Devices would have to be in an open&#x2F;receiving mode (potential security issues) for a connection if we use bluetooth or wifi to determine fellow users.  It could be possible to spam local wifi with a tcp packet with data from the app looking for users.</p>
<p>Other options is for each device would have to report its location to a central service. and the service do the math on distance and then msg each user with a proximity alert.</p>

										<p><p>hmm… I have given the thought of a remote server, but not for the location based data. That&#39;s an idea. Pass your location up and then show you who or what is in your area to join. That secures your session per say and allows you to move away or whatever till you tell your app or trigger an event to leave that group season. - Thanks!</p>

										<p><p>See in KitchenSink the bonjour sample.<br>All iOS devices will find each other. And can send data.<br>You can combine SHAKE event of two devices to send info to others, and detect in 2 or 3 seconds this devices, and then open connection with this two devices.<br>Is really simple!!!</p>
