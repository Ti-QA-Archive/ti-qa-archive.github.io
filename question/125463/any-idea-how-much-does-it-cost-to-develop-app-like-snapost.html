			<h1>Any idea how much does it cost to develop app like Snapost?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m trying to hire a developer to build a similar app like Snapost, using the open script on https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kwhinnery&#x2F;snapost. (Just a little bit modification on the script)</p>
<p>However I&#39;m a bit confuse on how much do I have to pay for this kind of project. Any advice&#x2F;recommendation is highly appreciated before I approach any of the Appcelerator developer as I&#39;m trying to avoid making too low&#x2F;high offer for this task.</p>

							<p>Everything depends on how much charges the programmer you choose.<br>I don&#39;t think somebody will give you here a response. You might want to go to the devlink and write to individual programmers</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Dan for the prompt reply. Yes, I&#39;ve been to that link and the list is quite long. That is why I came here first so that I can include my offer price to them. Anyway, thanks for the time &amp; tips. Really appreciate it. :)</p>

							<p>Also remember that project is released under the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apache.org&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;LICENSE-2.0">Apache License, Version 2</a> which means you must comply by those terms.  You may want to review those before you solicit bids and make plans based on the &quot;open script&quot;.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Doug and thanks for stopping by.</p>
<p>From what I understand, anyone is allowed to use this script as a base to create their own app. Or is it illegal to do so? Sorry, newbie here. Hope I&#39;m on the right track here as I dont wish to violate any rules or privacy.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, it is still legal to do so.  But you still need to review the license (it is in the project and also linked above) and make sure you comply with the redistribution clause terms.  As well as the other terms of course.</p>

							<p>It probably a good idea to read this article <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.impigermobile.com&#x2F;how-much-to-pay-for-my-iphone-app-development">&quot;How much to pay for my iPhone app development?&quot;</a> as it might give you a better idea of the average high and low prices on the market (always avoid low-cost).<br>Another interesting thing to read is the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;209170&#x2F;how-much-does-it-cost-to-develop-an-iphone-application&#x2F;3926493#3926493">answer given by one of the Twitterrific developers</a>.</p>
<p>Hope that&#39;s useful.<br>Cheers</p>
