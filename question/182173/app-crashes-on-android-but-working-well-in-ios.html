							<p>I&#39;m a little surprised that this is <em>all</em> you are seeing in the logs.  I would expect to at least see the titanium runtime spinning up.</p>
<p>At any rate, you should probably try cutting down your app to something simpler so you can isolate the problem.  For instance, if you have a complex main window with tabs, menus, buttons, controls, etc., try replacing the call to create that main window with a call to create a simple window with maybe a single label on it.  Don&#39;t even load the code that builds your normal main window.</p>
<p>If you have code that does other interesting things like network requests, location updates, third party modules, etc., try to eliminate them.  Eventually, you will figure out which part of your code is to blame for the crash, and you can focus on fixing that.</p>
<p>BTW – I always recommend that developers who want to build cross-platform Titanium apps should build them cross-platform from the very beginning.  Run on both platforms every single day during development.  If you let weeks of development pass by while you are only running on the ios simulator, you will experience a substantial amount of heartburn when you try to get your code running on android.</p>

										<p><p>I got the issue. </p>
<p>My application name was &quot;NameA&quot;. I chenaged it into NameB in app.xml file. So , its creating 2 icons but its crashing. </p>
<p>I changed it in Tiapp.xml. and its crashing. But when I revert back the name to previous name in TIapp.xml file its working fine.</p>
<p>Can you tell me now, why its doing so. How to rectify the name and changed it to a new one.</p>

										<p><p>Can you post your tiapp.xml (if you do, please be sure to use Markdown syntax so we can read it – preview before posting, and also remove any sensitive information you might have in your tiapp.xml).</p>
<p>If you have an &lt;android&gt; section with a named &lt;activity&gt;, there could be a mismatch between the activity name and the name of your app.</p>
