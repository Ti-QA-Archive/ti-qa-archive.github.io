			<p>I&#39;ve never used Mac&#39;s and I understand that I need one to get started with Apple iOS development. At this point, I really only want to get my feet, and I&#39;m looking for the most inexpensive route. If it is bearable, I would consider getting an older MacBook Pro with a Core 2 duo processor (2.4GHz&#39;ish). I&quot;m hoping some of you would share your experience using older Apple hardware and the performance of the different Titanium software packages. (e.g. Studio, Developer, etc.)</p>
<p>My concern is getting older hardware in the $600-$800 range and having time to go make a sandwich while I wait for the emulator or any compiling I need to complete, or just doubling the price point (or more) and getting an i5 machine and save the frustration….</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>PS. I realize that I could get my feet wet with desktop and android apps in a Win7 or linux environment, but I kinda want to jump in and get both feet wet at the same time.</p>

							<p>Hey Darren and welcome :)</p>
<p>I would advise you to buy a mac that will be capable of runing Lion (At least a Core 2 Duo with 2-4 gigs of ram). So dont go for a very old mac.</p>
<p>Here at the office I have a 2008 IMAC that runs great for everysingle thing I need to develop. One option could be to buy the $699.00 MacMini. You wont have any problems working with it.</p>
<p>Titanium per se is not that heavy. You wont have a problem with that.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Daniel</p>

							<p>I run on one of those small mac&#39;s, with a dual core and 1GB of ram. Although I wouldn&#39;t advise getting a similar spec&#39;d machine, it still performs admirably… despite the frustration of waiting sometimes.</p>
