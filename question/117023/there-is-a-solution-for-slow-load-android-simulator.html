							<p>Unlike the iOS simulator, you do NOT have to shut down the simulator to try a new compile build.  The slowest part is the initial android simulator load.  Once loaded, leave it there instead of hitting Stop.</p>
<p>Just make your code changes and hit Launch, and it will replace the existing version with the new build and start it.  Still slower than for iOS, but MUCH more tolerable the a full restart of the simulator each time.</p>

							<p>I think the only way can solve this issue so far is to make your developer environment hardware better… In my past experience, I found Android emulator on Mac is much faster than emulator on Windows PC. This is my little experience… hope you can develop Apps better… </p>

							<p>I feel your pain. The Android simulator takes FOREVER to load up. Especially the first time. There&#39;s nothing Titanium can do about this, as far as I know. It&#39;s a problem from Android&#x2F;Google</p>
<p>I really hated developing an Android app recently because of this. </p>
<p>:(</p>

							<p>There is no way you can speed up Android emulator. You can try YouWave (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youwave.com&#x2F;) - I think it&#39;s simulator, and not emulator, but the best option you have is to buy real Android device.</p>

							<p>Running the emulator on my Mac has resulted in much faster performance than running the same on my Win 7 machine, and both machines are newer and comparably equipped.</p>

<p>JS validation is highly recommended when working with Titanium, and as an android developer it will provide your biggest time-saver. To enable Javascript validation for eclipse, you need to install the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eclipse.org&#x2F;webtools&#x2F;">wtp plugin</a> (Web Tools Platform), or use Aptana that has it built-in.</p>
<p>The time it takes to boot an Android emulator or launch an app to an emulator is almost entirely dependent on Google&#39;s SDK. However, with this in mind and to give you an example for comparison, on my Ubuntu (i7 processor, 6GB memory) machine it takes 40 seconds to launch an application to an already-booted emulator, as <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.dropbox.com&#x2F;u&#x2F;14392713&#x2F;titanium-boot.ogv">this video</a> video demonstrates.</p>
<p>See the rest of <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;104391&#x2F;speeding-up-development-process">this thread</a> for lots of good advice from other users about improving your development process.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>on my i7 16gb imac it takes 58 seconds for the default fresh project two tab app on a second run. the first fresh built takes insane 84 seconds. this is just crazy. its actually faster pushing it to the device… i know thats not a titanium issue but its still hard to believe. </p>
<p>(iphone, firat build: 34 seconds, second build 2 seconds)</p>

							<p>I believe the difference is that on the iOS platform you have a simulator (not emulator) which is native speed (or better).</p>
<p>On the Android side we only have an emulator (not simulator) which is always going to be slower.</p>
<p>However, speaking to the Appcelerator devs at SXSW, it sounds like a better solution for Android deployment may be coming so keep the faith!</p>
