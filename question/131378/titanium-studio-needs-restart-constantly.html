			<h1>Titanium Studio needs restart constantly</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m getting pretty tired already, Titanium Studio needs restarting every 15 minutes. I&#39;m working on iOS development with it and need to launch the simulator frequently. It reaches a point where the simulator doesn&#39;t start anymore, or it takes ages. Restarting the IDE seems to fix the problem, but then it takes some time to build the workspace. Quite annoying.</p>
<p>Specially thinking that I don&#39;t want the Aptana IDE. The previous tool, what was it called Titanium Developer or something? It was more limited but very robust, is there a way to get it back somehow?</p>
<p>I can only imagine how pitiful must be using the IDE + Android SDKs.</p>

							<p>Yeah it shouldn&#39;t behave this way. I have the latest: Titanium Studio, build: 1.0.7.201112281340</p>
<p>As I mentioned I&#39;m using it for iOS, when I do a change to the code (not very big project btw) the simulator is usually open and I just press the run button to launch the simulator again to see the changes. I have noticed with the system monitor that there are several processes named ios-sim, they seem to be the simulators left there taking memory (?). There should be only one I imagine…</p>

										<p><p>That is not the latest Studio build; I am running build 1.0.9.201201262154.  Try using menu Help &gt; Check for Updates.</p>
<p>Secondly, which SDK level are you trying to use?  I think you need to be at Xcode 4.x once you hit a certain SDK level.</p>
<p>As others have said, your experience is not normal.  I really only restart Studio when it is installing upgrades and prompts a restart.  Otherwise it would go for days &#x2F; weeks.  Hardware wise, your system should not be the source of the trouble.</p>
