			<h1>New Macbook Air 13inch vs Macbook Pro Retina 13inch</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am thinking of replacing with my Mac and wondering if I should go for the new Macbook Air 13inch or Macbook Pro Retina 13inch. </p>
<p>When you build a program on Titanium Mobile, do you think there is some difference in performance that I would be able to feel? Of the difference would be marginal? </p>
<hr>
<p>Macbook Air has better battery life and lighter, and Macbook Pro Retina has better display. </p>
<p>Then my question is about the performance comparing these two. Of course, the spec is better with Pro, but some people say Macbook pro Retina runs slowly in order to take care of large display (resolution). Also when I tried them both at Apple Store, I could not feel much difference in using normal programs like Safari, Finder, iPhoto etc. So I wondered what would happen if I use Titanium Mobile, but I hesitated to install it there…</p>
<p>Below two are the two models I am looking at. Would appreciate your advice :)</p>
<p><em>Macbook Air 13inch: 1.3Ghz  iCore5 (Turbo Boost 2.6Ghz) , memory upgraded to 8GB
</em>Macbook Pro 13inch: 2.6Ghz iCore5 (Turbo Boost 3.2Ghz), memory 8GB</p>

							<p>I have just bought a MBA 11&quot; but I went for the i7 processor over the i5 8gb ram and a 256SSD drive. I have to say it leaves my work MBP 13&quot; for dead.</p>
<p>Saying that if the MBP had an SSD I think they would be comparable.</p>
<p>The simple answer here is what is best for you a 13&quot; MBA (I would get the i7 processor though) is an ideal machine for developing on. Its dead light better battery life and being honest a lot of fun.</p>
<p>However the 13&quot; MBP is a robust workhorse which won&#39;t let you down.</p>
<p>My only opinion is that if you are lugging around a lot go for the MBA.. Lighter and reliable and better battery life.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks a lot for your comment. It was very informative.<br>I decided to go for the same choice with you. MBA 11&quot; with i7 &#x2F; 8GB memory &#x2F; 256GB SSD.</p>
<p>With i7, you do not see problems with the heat dissipation or the battery performance?</p>
