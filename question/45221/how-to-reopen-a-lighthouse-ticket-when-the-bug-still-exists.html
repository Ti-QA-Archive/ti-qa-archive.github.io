			<h1>How to reopen a Lighthouse ticket when the bug still exists</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all<br>Could you tell me how a user can reopen a ticket? Currently, if I add a comment to a ticket marked as &quot;resolved&quot;, it does not reopen it.  I am concerned that, if the post does not get noticed, the ticket will remain closed and it will be assumed wrongly that the bug is fixed.</p>
<p>Please see ticket <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32238&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;1304-android-strange-wrapping-in-tableview-on-higher-res-screens">#1304</a></p>

										<p><p>@Don - If the comment gets overlooked, the bug can exist without anyone realising that action needs to be taken on it.<br>But the main problem is that, without the ability to reopen the ticket, the status of the bug is ambiguous, possibly for the core dev team, but certainly for the community.<br>I&#39;d really welcome appcelerator placing more trust in the community to act responsibly. In some circumstances, admittedly, you run the risk of having tickets reopened when they should not - but for the small amount of time it takes to rectify this (ie close the ticket again, and possibly post an explanation), this concern is trivial.<br>In the long run, placing more onus on the community to govern itself will pay dividends for appcelerator in the long run.</p>

							<p>I think they fix it on the repository. So you should wait for the next release or you can build your own titanium API version from github.</p>
