			<h1>Tricks to using the Android Emulator?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Trying to test on the Android emulator with Titanium Studio is making me want to jump out the window.  Does anybody have any tricks to making it actually work?</p>
<p>I find myself constantly having to reboot titanium, shut down the emulator, remove the app from the emulator, do a full clean and everything else.  I never quite know for sure if I&#39;m looking at current code or not, I get tricked into seeing old code sometimes as if the previous build is stuck on the emulator?</p>
<p>The iPhone emulator is so smooth, even does live refreshing as code changes are made.  The Android experience is horrid.  I&#39;ve literally wasted 4 hours today just trying to make a few tiny updates on an app.  So frustrating!  There has to be some trick to it, please help!?</p>

							<p>The trick to the emulator is to not use the emulator.</p>
<p>If you can, build to a device.  Compile time is the same, push to the device is the same as to the emulator, and it just plain works.</p>
<p>If thats not possible, use snapshots.  Should save you a few restarts.</p>

<p>The Android emulator is a virtual machine, like vmware or parallels</p>

										<p><p>I know, on device debugging is in process.  I don&#39;t have JIRA ticket handy, but you should be able to find it, watch it.</p>
<p>It is the instability that drives me nuts. Actually, in 2 years, the android emulator is the only app to crash my MAC and it has done so repeatedly.</p>
