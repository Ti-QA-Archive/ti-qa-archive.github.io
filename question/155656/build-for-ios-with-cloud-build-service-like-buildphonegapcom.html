		<section>
			<p>Is it possible to make a project and build it for ios with free build service like what phonegap offer for free?<br>Asking because i have windows on my dell system.  And because i think that pure javascript framework should require native sdk only when it is time to build the project and not during development.<br>Is there any solution to the build for ios?<br>Does titanium allow development for ios on windows? How to develop project for ios on windows platform?</p>

<p>You NEED to have access to the APPLE DEVELOPER tools to build for APPLE hardware because thats the way APPLE says to do it.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sorry you are stuck on Windows.  I enjoy developing for FOUR different mobile targets from OSX using titanium. Sure, IF we ever see Windows 8 support, I might have a problem…oh, wait, nope, have that virtual machine that can run windows development environments.</p>

</code></pre><p>You understood wrong. Ti is NOT pure JS. It just &quot;happens&quot; to allow the programmer to write the code in JS but the final app is native. You come from the phonegap world, where everything runs in a webview - a browser - while Titanium is truly native.</p>
<p>Makes more sense?</p>
<p>Now, with a little struggle and research, you could transform your amazing Dell in a hackintosh. It won&#39;t be fun, it won&#39;t run as smooth as it should, but you will be able to develop on it for iOS.<br>I&#39;ve been there so I know it&#39;s possible ;)</p>

<p>I am using the html&#x2F;js (whatever) framework that i did not write and because i did not write the framework that is why i have to look for better options. Found Ti and thought it was better. The framework name is sencha touch. No need to have any ios&#x2F;android sdk installed. I write code and then use phonegap cloud sevice to build native app(not browser based). The sencha cmd was supposed to build without ios&#x2F;sdk installed on windows but they are always fixing bugs instead of adding features to the cmd (sorry sencha). Phonegap one click build the native app from uploaded sencha code in zip format. Then one tap is enough to start installation on device. All on windows without any ios&#x2F;android sdk. That makes life a lot easier of a developer like me who build for ios without mac. </p>

<p>Yes i think i understood wrong. Ti is NOT pure js. Really i think the native sdk should be needed only for build but not for writing code. A step ahead sencha require no native sdk to build native app on windows. I am not big fan of windows but mac is too expensive here in market. </p>
<p>Thank you for the FOUR points and hackintosh. Hope for a real free solution to the build for ios and other platforms.</p>
