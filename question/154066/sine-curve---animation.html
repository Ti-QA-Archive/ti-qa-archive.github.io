			<h1>Sine Curve - Animation</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m experimenting with animations and Titanium and have been trying to get an image to follow a sine curve.  </p>
<p>Has anyone had any experience with this? Or could provide some pointers.</p>
<p>At the moment on animation complete I do another animation to move the image a bit further along.</p>
<p>Currently this is not following the sine curve at all and appears quite random.</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;m going to assume you are referring to iOS since you haven&#39;t mentioned a platform. The latest Ti build utilizes UIViewAnimationCurve props for animation curves. The ones Ti exposes are the ones available on iOS. For using a sine curve,  as a bezier curve, it needs to utilize CALayer animations. Therefore, doing this might be unpractical without a custom implementation.</p>

							<div><p>I assume you are talking about http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.UI-property-ANIMATION_CURVE_EASE_IN</p>
<p>That is only for easing the speed of the animation.</p>
<p>I have the animations working now and following the sine curve, I was just hoping for an easier solution.  If you looked carefully at the animation you would see it&#39;s a combination of lots of straight line movements joined together.</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;m going to guess you broke down your animation into smaller animations to transition the view on a sine curve, right? </p>
<p>I&#39;m working (rather extending) in a CommonJS library which will allow to utilize various pre-defined timing functions and support for supplying custom ones. I&#39;ll post here when it&#39;s ready.</p>
