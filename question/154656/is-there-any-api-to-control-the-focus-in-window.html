							<div><p>I&#39;m sure the question is about the focus order in android. As you know, views can become <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.UI.View-property-focusable">focusable</a> for input methods other than touchscreen, e.g. with a trackball, dpad, keyboard or remote control. This is important for accessibilty, especially for Google TV Apps. When defining layouts in native Android, you can specify which view should receive focus. See <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;training&#x2F;keyboard-input&#x2F;navigation.html">this Android guide</a> for more info.</p>
<p>Unfortunatly I don&#39;t know of a solution to do that in Titanium since there is no API like this. I&#39;m looking forward to future releases of Alloy to support this. Maybe you can log a feature request in the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC">Titanium Community Jira Project</a>.</p>
<p>+1 for this question!</p>

							<div><p>Sorry?this is my first time ask question and my English is poor?but I will try  my best<br>to description clear.</p>
<p>Application: mobile;<br>Titanium SDK:  3.1.1GA;<br>Platform &amp; version: Android 4.0;<br>Device: physical device model (TV box)</p>
<p>as Manuel Lehner say, I was develop TV Apps with remote control, should control focus moving when pressed left or right key. In android requestFocus() API and in layout xml can use<br>&quot;android:nextFocusUp &amp;  android:nextFocusDown &amp; android:nextFocusLeft &amp; android:nextFocusRight&quot; to control.</p>
<p>is there any other way to do this?</p>
