			<h1>Same app version crash on startup and runs on different pcs</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>This seems a very specific situation.<br>I&#39;m working with a colleague and we are using Svn.<br>Our app is for both iOS and Android, but the following situation was triggered while working for Android.<br>We are using 3.2.2GA<br>There are no problems on compilation.</p>
<p>We both have the same version on our machine, I&#39;ve confirmed that we both updated the project root, and not the app folder. Svn confirms it with a visual &quot;no arrow &gt;&quot; feedback.</p>
<p>When I try to run or debug the app in my pc the app crashes.<br>ON MY PC, I&#39;ve tried to:</p>
<ul>
<li>uninstall the app from the android</li>
<li>clean project</li>
<li>delete project resources folder</li>
<li>restart titanium studio</li>
<li>force update to latest svn version</li>
<li>restart cellphone</li>
</ul>
<p>and I did it all at once.</p>
<p>the app crashes on splash screen.</p>
<p>however, i gave the cellphone to my colleague and ask him to run the app once from his pc.<br>It has the same version and it seemed to work fine.</p>
<p>After this initial deployment, on his pc, I can come back to my pc and run&#x2F;debug my application again without any problems.</p>
<p>I believe that if I clean the project with the steps I&#39;ve described i will follow into the same problem again.</p>
<p>Since the app crashes on splash screen i have no error feedback.</p>
<p>Its like something is missing on the first deployment. I&#39;m afraid to do the same steps on my colleague pc and we both lose a working version of the app. For the moment I must have a functional working environment running.</p>
<p>Any ideas what might cause similar behaviors? This is the second time it happens.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support once again</p>

							<p>Try using the Monitor tool (included with the Android development tools) to monitor the device&#x2F;emulator logs. It typically shows more details than the abbreviated logs you see in Studio and may show problems that aren&#39;t causing displayable runtime errors. If the error messages are unclear, post them here and someone might be able to help you interpret them.</p>
