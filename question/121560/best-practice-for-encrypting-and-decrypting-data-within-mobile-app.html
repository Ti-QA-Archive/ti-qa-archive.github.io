		<section>
			<p>Is there a resource that outlines best practices for safely encrypting data that is being passed back and forth via a web service over https in titanium?</p>
<p>I notice in </p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;latest&#x2F;Titanium.Utils-module</p>
<p>there is base 64 and MD5 encryption supported in the platform, but is this typically considered secure enough? Should I be using an outside library, such as http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.movable-type.co.uk&#x2F;scripts&#x2F;aes.html? If I do, are the keys considered safe?</p>

							<p>Neither base64 nor MD5 count as encryption.  In the case of MD5, it is just a hash total of the original value.  It <strong>cannot</strong> be used to decrypt back to the original.  Its sole purposes is to compare the MD5 of two things.  When they match you have a near guarantee the original was not modified in any way.</p>
<p>Base64 can be used to &quot;decrypt&quot; back to the original, but it is not designed as an encryption at all and does not use ANY encryption key.  Its sole purpose is to convert binary or other non-ASCII text values into text characters which can be safely sent and received using text protocols such as SMTP, POP, and some HTML.</p>
<p>That said, if you are using HTTPS, then <strong>it</strong> provides the encryption although you should avoid putting sensitive information in the URL query string itself.  Put all sensitive data in the payload, such as POST values.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know what you are referring to regarding Apple encryption requirements for the App Store.  By itself, a program need not use any encryption unless it is desirable or necessary for its own needs such as PCI compliance or HIPAA rules.</p>

							<p>This is really a matter of personal preference. The built in Base64 and MD5 support should suffice for many encryption needs, however, if you feel more comfortable, or your server&#x2F;project requires something like AES, then you can include the encryption you need and your incidentals should be just as secure.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Anthony. Do you have any experience with Apple in regards to how they view encryption? I understand they are very stringent in regards to what is required to be accepted in to the store. I can&#39;t seem to find a good resource outlining what is commonly acceptable, especially with the use of your framework. Any light you could shed on this would be greatly appreciated!</p>

										<p><p>I do not personally have any exp with Apple in regards to the encryption of data. However I do know that while they are a bit stringent in regards to what they accept into the store, it is usually not the encryption (or lack thereof) that will get you rejected, it is the actual data that your app transmits and how you plan on using that data.</p>
<p>As far as our framework, there are a number of apps in the app store built using both Titanium and the built in encryption. I have not heard of any outstanding issues where these apps were completely unable to get into the app store due to using this functionality.</p>

										<p><p>This answer is misleading. Neither MD5 and Base64 are encryption methods. </p>
<p>MD5 is a one way hash function. It should not be used in new applications if you follow best practices. Base64 is an encoding standard. Neither of these can be used for encryption.</p>
<p>If you are building high secure apps you need to secure the whole data chain. The data at rest in your application and server and data in transit. The first is hard (build your own) the latter is easy (built in using https).</p>
