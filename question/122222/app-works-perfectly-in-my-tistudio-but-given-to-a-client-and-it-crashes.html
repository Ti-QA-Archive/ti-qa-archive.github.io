			<h1>App works perfectly in my TiStudio, but given to a client and it crashes.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>So I was asked to build an iPad app for a client using Titanium, which I did. When it was time for the client to test the app, whenever they ran the project I sent them (The entire root folder of the Titanium project), the iPad Simulator launched up then hung. Sometimes it would just simply crash with no error, simply a <code>Simulator closed with no warning.</code> and sometimes it would give a timeout error.</p>
<p>Would it be because that he is trying to build with iOS 4.2 and Xcode 3.2.5? Since it is the actual Titanium project and not the Xcode build files, it would not matter what I am building with <em>(Which is iOS 5 beta 2 and Xcode 4.2)</em>.</p>

							<p>Yea, I can&#39;t see this working correctly at all. Most of your Titanium app would be built at runtime, so the hang is probably happening because there is nothing to do next. You need to build and deploy the app and distribute to him ad-hoc as a test device through Apple&#39;s dev portal or use something like TestFlight to push updates his way.</p>

										<p><p>But it does not make sense that it wouldn&#39;t work. Even if he creates a new project and moves the files over, the project still hangs, which does not make sense. Why would it work on my computer but not his?</p>

										<p><p>Honestly, there could be a 1001 reasons. I don&#39;t have to tell you that no two development environments are the same. What I would suggest is to make sure that he does a clean and build the first time he runs the project. If there are already build files in the project, then some won&#39;t get recompiled for his system, which could&#x2F;would&#x2F;should possibly cause that type of simulator reaction.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m a relative newbie, however I have found that finding the build project file under the iphone section and running the project from Xcode while hooked to a device, works every time.  If it works this way, it&#39;ll work when you compile an adhoc build.  I hope this helps.</p>
