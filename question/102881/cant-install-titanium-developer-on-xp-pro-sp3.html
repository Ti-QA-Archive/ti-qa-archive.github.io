			<h1>Can&#39;t install Titanium Developer on XP Pro SP3</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello, Just downloaded the Titanium Developer MSI and tried to run it on my system, and I get the error &quot;Could not query info: Invalid HTTP Status Code (0)&quot;</p>
<p>I see a similar thread but for Windows7, and saw in that thread a recommendation to another member to create their own thread specific to their situation, so that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing :)</p>
<p>I&#39;m running Windows XP Pro, Service Pack 3,<br>I have AVG 2011, and tried installing the package with and without Antivirus and Firewall on.  With the same results.<br>UPDATE: Forgot to mention, I&#39;m on a home network with a router between my machine and the DSL modem… if that would make any difference.</p>
<p>Any help would be very much appreciated.<br>Thanks in advance,<br>Tony</p>

							<p>I fixed it for my situation!  On a hunch I went fired up IE to check my settings (I use Firefox as a standard).  I almost never use it, and in this case must not have used it for a while because checking my network settings showed it set for a Manual Proxy setup.  I removed this setting, re-tried the installation and it worked.  </p>
<p>Hope this helps someone else, but your mileage may vary.<br>Regards,<br>Tony</p>

										<p><p>It really worked for me. But I was shocked to see that solution to my probs was lying in IE which I never use.</p>
