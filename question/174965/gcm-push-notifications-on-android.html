			<h1>GCM push notifications on Android</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>i see that push notifications on android use GCM. but as i see we should use ACS even if we would like to send push from another server and not ACS servers…</p>
<p>my question is why should we use ACS ? and are we limited with the number of message we can send ? does the function retrieveDeviceToken call ACS function that will call Google services to get registration id ?</p>
<p>why do not we have the same implementation like on iOS where we dont need ACS ?</p>
<p>thanks</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Yes you do need GCM for android - this is due to android not titanium.</p>
<p>You NOT have to use ACS, but if you do, then iOS and android can run through the same solution.  If you are using any of the other ACS features then it makes sense.  Btw 5 million free pushes a month.</p>
<p>You can use another service, Urban Airship is a good example, again cross compatible, 1 million free per month here.  The code is more complicated as nothing is built in but Fokke has a module to solve this;</p>

							<p>Don&#39;t pay fee for push services or any brokers per notification.</p>
<p>I just released a Titanium module to deal with Push Notifications for both iOS and Android with only one code, only one behavior and a clean and simple code.</p>
<p>Build your push notification server with any language and easily receive notifications in your iOS and Android mobile app using my Titanium module.</p>

<p>Whilst limited pertinent self promotion can be tolerated here; it is normally ONLY done during the initial question and answer.</p>
<p>Adding a paid module advert on every question with the words push in it is considered spam.  Also not mentioning the module is a paid module is also disingenuous to say the least.</p>

										<p><p>Sorry by that. Yes, I&#39;m trying to promote my own paid module, but my module can be an real solution to others users.</p>
<p>Moreover, by registering a response or comment, I am also giving a way of letting any user to contact me for help with specific problems about push notification.</p>
<p>Personally I like to find information like that I have posted, in search I came to do about any problem.</p>
<p>Sorry if I&#39;m bothering.</p>

							<p>Hi Djamel ZAHAL,</p>
<p>Don&#39;t mix ACS and GCM. ACS is used for iOS platform and GCM used for android platform.</p>
<p>There is as such no limit of sending push notification from either ACS or GCM. </p>
<p>Both of the services needs device tokens. this device token you can retrieve from Ti.register for push<br>notification callback.</p>
<p>You need to retrieve the device token and send to your server. And on your server side you need to do coding to call ACS and GCM service.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t go for urban airship if you have your own server and server developer to code for sending push notification. Even Urban airship is not free.</p>
<p>If you need further help then let me know.</p>

I think you are confused with APN (Apple Push Notifications?  ACS is not a requirement for iOS.  Both platforms mentioned do have free level limits 5 &amp; 1 million respectfully.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Guys. Just a quick question, if im going to be using the registerForPushNotifications method and retrieve device tokens only, it wont be chargeable would it?</p>
<p>Maybe a stupid question, but this is causing me a lot of confusion. Any information is appreciated.</p>
