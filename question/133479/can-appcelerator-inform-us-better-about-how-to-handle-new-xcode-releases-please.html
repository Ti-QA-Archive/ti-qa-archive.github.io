			<h1>Can Appcelerator inform us better about how to handle new Xcode releases please?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Yesterday Apple announced the new Xcode 4.3.1 and told developers to start using it now. So like a good boy I downloaded it, installed it, allowed it to uninstall my Xcode 4.2 … and then found out (or rather was reminded) that Titanium does not work with the new Xcode. So now I have to go back and re-download 4.2 and install it and get everything working again.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a bit painful, and as I am in the process of final steps of packaging my app for the App Store there were a few brief moments of panic. &quot;Not now!&quot; :)</p>
<p>Anyway. I guess I should check on these things first, and possibly know better, but it is all a learning curve and I just wondered if Titanium could help us out next time by maybe flicking out an email reminder to developers to NOT try and use the latest Xcode with Titanium - and that we need to hold onto Xcode version X.X for the moment.</p>
<p>That would be really helpful :)</p>
<p>Thanks for listening.</p>

							<p>Historically we&#39;ve done such announcements through the dev blog, but I think the Xcode compatibility updates probably do warrant an e-mail blast.  I&#39;ll look at doing that for future Xcode releases and breaking tool changes (a.k.a. every Android tools update - thanks Google :P).  </p>
<p>FWIW Xcode 4.3 and iOS 5.1 are going to be supported in our next release, which is slated for the end of the month.  If you want to live on the edge, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;index.html">you can try it out now (master branch)</a>.</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve been playing around with this.  </p>
<p>If you&#39;re really needing to use this now:</p>
<p>XCode is now installed in the Application&#39;s folder (read more here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;ios&#x2F;#documentation&#x2F;DeveloperTools&#x2F;Conceptual&#x2F;WhatsNewXcode&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;xcode_4_3.html).  So the dev path has changed.  You can modify that via <code>&amp;#x2F;usr&amp;#x2F;bin&amp;#x2F;xcode-select -switch &amp;#x2F;Applications&amp;#x2F;Xcode.app</code></p>
<p>If you go to XCode Preferences -&gt; Downloads, you can select to download the older simulators.  When you do this you can still build with Ti Studio.  It still crash the simulator instance Studio tries to run but not before building and updating the app the older simulator looks at (iOS 5 was what I was using previous to the install, for instance).  You can then run the sim manually and use it.  When you run it manually, go to the menu at the top -&gt; Hardware -&gt; Select version of iOS.  Boom, you&#39;ll see the app(s) you&#39;ve used previously.  </p>
<p>Another way is to go a head and build in Studio and then let the sim crash like it currently does.  Go to the build folder and open the xcode project.  Select what you want to run (ipad, iphone ,etc) and click run.  It will install on the sim and run it.  You can select 5.1 and run and it will work too.</p>
<p>Not ideal, but might get you through a touch spot until it&#39;s fixed.</p>
