			<h1>ACS Push Notifications</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>We are trying to add push notification support, but the instructions tell us to log into the Dashboard, which as far as I know is used for paid clients.  Normally we manage all of our apps via the developer.appcelerator.com &quot;control panel&quot;.  It has a section for push notifications for each app, but does not have any way to access this step:</p>
<p>Click the Services tab, then click Show Key under Cloud &#x2F; Performance &#x2F; Analytics.</p>
<p>Since the control panel does not have a Services tab.</p>
<p>Does this mean you cannot use the free (low monthly API calls) version of ACS with Push Notifications?</p>

							<p>Yes, you can send push notifications with a free account from the &#39;Push Notifications&#39; tab of the &quot;Community&quot; web console:</p>
<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;my.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps">my.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps</a></p>
<p>The instructions you mention are for Platform subscribers using the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;platform&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Appcelerator_Platform_Services_Native_SDKs">Platform Services SDK</a> for native iOS and Android applications.</p>

							<p>Thanks for the answer, but maybe you could have either explained how to do it when using the Community web console, or provided a link?  We are just using ACS, not Titanium.</p>

							<p>Let&#39;s see… </p>
<p>1) We have our .p12 push notification certificate uploaded to the Community Web Console in the Settings section for our app.<br>2) In our Obj-C code we have:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">- (<span class="hljs-built_in">BOOL</span>)application:(<span class="hljs-built_in">UIApplication</span> *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(<span class="hljs-built_in">NSDictionary</span> *)launchOptions {
    <span class="hljs-comment">/// some app init code here</span>

    <span class="hljs-comment">// Let the device know we want to receive push notifications</span>
    [[<span class="hljs-built_in">UIApplication</span> sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotificationTypes:
            (<span class="hljs-built_in">UIRemoteNotificationTypeSound</span> | <span class="hljs-built_in">UIRemoteNotificationTypeAlert</span>)];
}

- (<span class="hljs-keyword">void</span>)application:(<span class="hljs-built_in">UIApplication</span>*)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(<span class="hljs-built_in">NSData</span>*)deviceToken {

    CCLOG( <span class="hljs-string">"My token is: %@"</span>, deviceToken );
}

- (<span class="hljs-keyword">void</span>)application:(<span class="hljs-built_in">UIApplication</span>*)application didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:(<span class="hljs-built_in">NSError</span>*)error {

    CCLOG( <span class="hljs-string">"Failed to get token, error: %@"</span>, error );
}
</code></pre><p>However, when we try and do a push notification to the app, nothing happens.  So we looked at the ONLY documentation on the Appcelerator website that wasn&#39;t for Titanium and it said we needed the &quot;key from the services tab&quot; which is not available for the Community web console.</p>
<p>So, once again, is there some OTHER documentation on how to hook this up?  Something else we need to initialize in our app, or some other setting or function we need to deal with?</p>
<p>In some user comments it talks about registering each device that is going to receive push notifications.  In a couple of others (dated over a year ago) it says that Appcelerator understands that may be an undesirable issue and will look at changing it so it automatically registers the users devices.</p>
<p>My guess is that our issue is because our device isn&#39;t registered.  I&#39;m guessing there is some ACS code to do that (which is what the Platform Subscriber documentation talks about (the &quot;Key&quot; value in the Services tab).</p>
<p>So, is there DOCUMENTATION on how to hook up Push Notifications for Community web console users?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>Ok, it seems you&#39;re using the old ACS iOS SDK <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;acs-ios-sdk&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;acs-ios-sdk&#x2F;</a>? </p>
<p>That SDK was deprecated in favor of the Platform Services SDK, and the docs were updated for the new SDK. For now, you can view the old SDK docs (which contain more info about setting up push notifications) on my acs-ios-sdk fork:</p>
<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tstatler&#x2F;acs-ios-sdk&#x2F;blob&#x2F;readme-update&#x2F;Readme.mdown">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tstatler&#x2F;acs-ios-sdk&#x2F;blob&#x2F;readme-update&#x2F;Readme.mdown</a></p>
<p>I&#39;ve opened a PR to make this the new main repo readme. But please note that Appcelerator is no longer updating the ACS iOS SDK, fixing bugs, etc. as the focus is on the Platform Services SDK.</p>

							<p>We can move to the Platform Services SDK if that works with the Community Web Console.  If it does where can I find it?  If not, I will use the new doc you provided a link to.</p>

							<p>So the very last thing in the Push Notification section you linked to says:</p>
<p>&quot;Then refer to the {@link PushNotifications} API reference to see how to subscribe and send push notifications. You can also log on to your ACS App Console to send push notifications to all your subscribed clients.&quot;</p>
<p>The instructions on that page are not very helpful when there is no link to the API reference it mentions.</p>
<p>I get that we are using an old&#x2F;out-dated API (the cocoafish stuff), so please tell me if we can move to a new SDK and still use the Community Web Console.  If so, where is a link to the new SDK?</p>

										<p><p>Looks like you cannot use the Platform SDK with the Community Web Console.  Just wonderful.</p>
<p>So the only way people who use the Community Web Console can do push notifications is to use the outdated SDK which is no longer supported and has incomplete documentation.</p>
<p>Time to look into moving to another solution.</p>

										<p><p>I need to fix those links, thanks. But you are correct; the Platform Services SDK only works with Dashboard and requires a Platform subscription, for which there is currently no free tier available.</p>
