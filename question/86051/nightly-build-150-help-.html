							<p>@Danno…</p>
<p>with the Nightly build of 1.5.0 ., i have seen people using a .jss file for separating the UI styling…..</p>
<p>And i would be very glad if somebofy could give me pointers on using a JSS file(a simple tutorial or a sample may be)….</p>
<p>(i am pretty sure the question is explanatory and why has somebody down voted my question–)</p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid I agree with danno.</p>
<p>A question title is really important, because it helps other people find the information in future using the search box. How is &quot;Nightly build 1.5.0 Help&quot; related to JSS, except that 1.5.0 introduces JSS?  It also introduces a lot of other features and bugfixes, but your question isn&#39;t related to any of those. What about when 1.6.0 is released, which will no doubt include JSS? Then, surely, your title will be even less meaningful.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the title should be a question, as per the forum name, &quot;Q&amp;A&quot;, whereas yours is a statement, or exclamation.</p>
<p>If someone were to help you in this thread, the only purpose it would serve is to help you, and you alone. Others aren&#39;t likely to find it, because the title is not relevant to the subject matter. While helping individuals is great, I think most Helpers hope that their hard work is useful to more than just the individual.</p>
<p>If you open a new thread with a better title and description, carefully including keywords that people are likely to use in the search tool when they also need help with JSS, then I am sure someone will assist you.</p>
<p>I hope you can appreciate that quality questions are equally as important as the answers.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>

							<p>While I agree the question could be worded better (especially the subject&#x2F;title), I&#39;ll still try to provide something helpful.</p>
<p>There is a project called Redux another user has created which aims to reduce the amount of code needed to create a Titanium application.  Among other things it provides its own JSS support.</p>
<p>Take a look at its code samples.  I don&#39;t know that the syntax is the same as the native JSS support in 1.5.x, but it may help you get started or provide an alternative method to accomplish your goals.  And then some.</p>
<p>See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dawsontoth&#x2F;Appcelerator-Titanium-Redux">redux</a> for more information.</p>
