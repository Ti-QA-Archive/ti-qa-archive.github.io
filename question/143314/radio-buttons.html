			<h1>Radio Buttons</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello guys;</p>
<p>I was wondering if someone could <strong>thoroughly</strong> explain how to make radio buttons for the android from using titanium it&#39;s quite confusing and it will benefit not only myself but the larger community. </p>
<p><em>Please remember you&#39;re speaking to an audience that could be new or have basic knowledge of Titanium, I am looking forward to hearing from your response, if you don&#39;t like my question it would be truly appreciated if you justified your reasoning.</em></p>

							<div><p>Hi Mister Whatever,</p>
<p>It seems from your questions in the community that you are very desperate to code in Titanium but its simple javascript is overloading your nerves and you are experiencing a brain crash every now and then.</p>
<p>So, as a responsible community member, i would suggest you to hire a trainer for Titanium rather than disgusting yourself with negative votes.</p>

<p>Excuse me? firstly my name isn&#39;t Whatever, secondly if you bothered to read my question <strong><strong>PROPERLY!!!!</strong></strong> the issue is regarding Titanium, unfortunately radio buttons are not supported.</p>
<p>So, as a responsible person, I would suggest you hire a trainer to teach yourself how to read and write in <strong><strong>ENGLISH!!!</strong></strong> to prevent illiterate rubbish appearing on this website.</p>
