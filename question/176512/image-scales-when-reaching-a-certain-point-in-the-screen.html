			<h1>Image Scales when reaching a certain point in the screen</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Can you someone suggest a tip to do the following apps that I am making. The scenario is that scroller view consisting of 7 images (buttons) and when one image (button) reaches a certain point in the screen (say middle portion) the image scales bigger then goes back to original size when scrolling down, then the next image scales big when it reaches the same point (middle). It is like a scroller view in the main front menu with images. Thanks.</p>
<p>reference:  Ti 3.2.3.GA, Mac Mavericks, App for both Android and IOS.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>You need to look at a <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.UI.2DMatrix">2DMatrix Transform</a>.  Sounds way scarier than it is.</p>
<p>You detect when you need the event to occur and then apply the transform.  Given your need, you would continue to monitor as it enters, moves through and exits your virtual region.  You would apply a transform on each movement and adjust the value needed to make your images expand.  Best bet would be the scale property.  The value of scale would increase as it moves to centre and decrease as it moves out.</p>

										<p><p>HI Malcolm, thanks again. Since the user needs to manually scroll the images (buttons) up and down while button (images) scales bigger when passing the middle, would you recommend using scrollerView with it?. So there are images inside scrollView then using 2Dmatrix.</p>

										<p><p>Yes it would reduce the overall effort required and also allows the OS to simply take care of that part of the job.</p>
