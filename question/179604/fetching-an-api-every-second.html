			<h1>Fetching an api every second</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve got a general question. In my newest project I have to fetch a REST api every second for getting the actual informations. I can&#39;t cache the response.</p>
<p>The problem is, that the app after a few minutes become veeeery slow.</p>
<p>I do normal xhr requests. Any alternatives?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I would say your biggest problem here is that you are using the wrong approach to your solution. You shouldn&#39;t be calling an API every second, for one if you are calling your API asynchronously you can&#39;t guarantee that the responses will return in the same order and using it synchronously still wouldn&#39;t be the solution. </p>
<p>This is quite a general question. You need to explain what it is you are trying to achieve so that we can provide you with the best solution. But at this moment in time it would seem that you should be using a websocket so that you have a constant connection to your data. This is something that you would need to spend some time researching if you don&#39;t already know about it.</p>
