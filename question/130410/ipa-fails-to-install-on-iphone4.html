							<p>I had a similar problem. I used a provisioning profile and ipad that works fine with apps built in xcode but could not get them to work with appcelerator. After days of frustration I created a new provisioning profile with only one device, my ipad, and it worked like a charm.</p>

										<p><p>In my case I had to go to key chain and delete the old certificate and rebuild. The issues is certainly due to certificate and provisioning file.</p>

							<p>Which titanium sdk did you use? I think iOS 5 was fully supported since sdk 1.7.5 or higher. Try with last sdk (1.8.0.1) to be sure. </p>
<p>And, of course, be sure the ipa file is signed with a valid provisioning profile including those UDIDs.</p>
