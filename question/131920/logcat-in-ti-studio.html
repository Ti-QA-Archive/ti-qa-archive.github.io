			<h1>LogCat in Ti Studio</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>As I&#39;ve been developing Android modules for Titanium, I noticed that they have a logcat view, which is very nice, as it allows you to see all logging occurring on your Android device and filter the log to only contain entries related to your app.</p>
<p>This begs the question, where is this logcat view in Titanium Studio?</p>

							<p>DDMS is still the best tool for communicating with an actual Android Device.  </p>
<p>If you haven&#39;t already installed them, take a look at the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;tis&#x2F;Installing+the+Java+Development+Tools">Java Development Tools</a> and then the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;tis&#x2F;Installing+the+Android+Development+Tools">Android Development Tools</a>. This will allow you to open a view that has the DDMS utility in TiStudio.  This will show you all the log activity on the emulator and&#x2F;or a device.</p>
<p>Even when using the emulator, I use DDMS over the built in console logging as in DDMS I can see how the rest of the emulator is reacting.  Often a JAVA error will not show up in the console yet will in DDMS.</p>
<p>I prefer the DDMS displayed in TiStudio, as I can open code in a pane and browse through.  It really comes down to how you operate.</p>

										<p><p>Additionally, for the emulator, DDMS allows you to throttle data through put, emulate inbound calls.  All things one should be doing to test their code.  How does your app react when the phone drops to a 1x connection from 3g?  Does it time out gracefully?  Does your GUI go all haywire when a call comes in? etc.  You can even push GPS coords into the emulator for geo testing.</p>

							<p>Without any modification, Titanium Studio allows you to view three logs in the console. The first is for the fastdev process. The second is for the Android emulator process, which is what you wanted: the full log from the &quot;device&quot; filtered so that it only includes messages from your app.</p>
<p>The third log is output that you explicitly send to the console via Ti.API.log.</p>
<p>If you want more customization over filtering (though most people won&#39;t need it) you can use Android&#39;s built-in ddms tool. Just execute $ANDROID_SDK&#x2F;tools&#x2F;ddms.</p>

										<p><p>I should have mentioned that logs have worked great for me until Studio 1.0.7.</p>
<p>I spent literally over a week trying to get logs to work in Studio 1.0.7 and Studio 1.0.8, and I just couldn&#39;t do it. I have no explanation. So now I&#39;m back to 1.0.6.</p>
