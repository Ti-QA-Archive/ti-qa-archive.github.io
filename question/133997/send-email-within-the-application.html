							<p>The easiest way would be to have a php file on your server, and have your app send whatever content to that script, and then have the php file send instead.</p>

							<p>As far as I know, Titanium does not ship with a SMTP client. That means you can&#39;t send email from Titanium. You need to do it from a web service, either one that you have written yourself or one someone else offers to the public (which I imagine wouldn&#39;t be free).</p>
<p>I have successfully routed emails through Gmail SMTP using PHP, so I know that works. That&#39;s how my apps send emails.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that there are security risks with having a publicly-accessible web service that sends email from your servers. &quot;To&quot; email address should never be set by a POST variable (instead it should point to a record in a database that contains an email address), and you should do your best to authenticate calls to the web service as coming from your own apps. A good first step would be to use a unique ID from each installation of your app as an access key. This would also help you limit emails to 1 per x number of minutes.</p>
<p>All that said, it sounds to me like you want a database to store stats from your app. You can&#39;t do that much with information sent via emails.</p>

							<p>Thanks for your rapid reply. I need the information stored in the email and don&#39;t want to be spammed. It will contain booking information. I got an acitvation key from Yahoo but rather complicated and missing an example how to do things.<br>Server site is bare not running anything.</p>

							<p>Hi Josh,</p>
<p>The choice of a framework is not that easy since there are many choices. I think I go ahead with senchaTouch. Can you share me some sample code for sending an email thru PHP serversite in combination with gmail?<br>Thanks in advance.</p>
