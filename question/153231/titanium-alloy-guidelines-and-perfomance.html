			<p>I have been trying to develop an iphone app in alloy framework.I have a bunch of questions about titanium development and alloy framework.</p>
<p>1.In my app I am using a lot of remote http calls.whether I need to make these calls in corresponding controller or model?Any particular advantage in doing it model over controller? Or is it better to abstract remote http functionality and put it in a alloy  library(commonjs) file so that I can reuse functionality?Is there any sample alloy application following the guidelines.Please give me a link?</p>
<p>2.If I am putting a lot of code in controller whether it will affect performance or security?</p>
<p>3.If I am putting a lot of code in controller it will affect reusability of the code.isn&#39;t it?</p>
<p>4.While running generated  project file in xcode I got some warnings.whether it is the default behavior or due to the bad code practices?whether it will affect deployment in app store ?</p>
<p>5.Performance wise  alloy framework or direct titanium development which is one better?</p>
<p>6.A broader question Is there any way to filter data from live server to app files so that </p>
<p>1)I can increase the performance of the app</p>
<p>2)direct exposing of client app to server response.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

							<p>1) There&#39;s no &quot;right&quot; answer as to where to put your server querying logic. Ideally you would create a data structure in a model, query the data, and populate the model with that data. But you don&#39;t have to. That may be overkill and you may just as easily execute the call in the appropriate controller. It depends on your situation and usage.</p>
<p>2) Whether or not you put code in the controller does not directly affect performance or security in a fundamental sense. The code that you write could effect those things, but there&#39;s nothing inherent in Alloy that would cause performance or security issues.</p>
<p>3) Reusability of code again is much like my response to #2. It all depends on what type of code you are putting in there and if you plan to reuse it. If it&#39;s common code that is not specific to the current controller, you&#39;d probably do better to put it in a separate commonjs module that can be used anywhere in your app, or even other apps.</p>
<p>4) The generated code may show warnings in xcode, but no, it will not impact your ability to distribute the app on the app store. We&#39;ve had <em>lots</em> of developers successfully submitting alloy apps to the app store for quite some time now.</p>
<p>5) Alloy <em>is</em> building a traditional Titanium app for you. So in general, the performance should be equal. There is some functionality in Alloy that might perform better if you write it from the ground up yourself, specifically for your app (things like the sql adapter or data binding), but these are all optional and you can use the traditional titanium code for them in your controllers if you so choose. You can use as much or as little traditional titanium code in your alloy apps as you want.</p>
<p>6) Filtering data you receive from your server is dependent on the server&#39;s API, not anything that Alloy could do. Alloy has libraries in it that could help you filter data once it arrives in your app (underscore&#39;s <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;underscorejs.org&#x2F;#where">where()</a> function comes to mind), but at that point you&#39;ve already paid the performance price of the query. You&#39;ll reduce query time by improving the server&#39;s API and filtering ability. You&#39;ll reduce your UI&#39;s render time by doing the same to the data set that you receive from the query.</p>
