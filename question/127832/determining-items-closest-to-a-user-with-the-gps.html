			<h1>Determining items closest to a user with the GPS</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>While I somewhat understand how the geolocation feature works in the library, I&#39;m wondering how you all have been comparing data or doing location-based lookups against a user&#39;s GPS location to find results of something near them.</p>
<p>Is there a latitude&#x2F;longitude database that you&#39;re using to determine radius or something? I&#39;m working on a second app right now that will use this to find something that others have uploaded or tagged near them, so this is the basis for the entire application. Just looking for a good place to start with this, as I&#39;m not sure what the best way of looking this up is.</p>
<p>I can store data all day long from users tagging items with location data, but unless I can calculate mileage from those coordinates, it&#39;s bust! :)</p>

							<p>To calculate the distance between two sets of points (lon &amp; lat), you need to think back really hard to what we learnt at school.  If like me you figured on that day WE will never ever need this info, then you will not remember it :)</p>
<p>This will give you a good starting point, examples in javascript as well.</p>

										<p><p>Great feedback. Thanks for chiming in. I&#39;ll be digging around with this a bit. I may work together an include function for people once I figure it out. Something that anyone can easily include into their project to calculate the correct distance value. David&#39;s comment about doing it server-side is a great point, too.</p>

							<p>Push all the heavy lifting to the server. Just send a requested from you app to your server with your geolocation. Get the server to return the ordered list of the closest locations (with the distances away) within a particular radius. Tell me if you need help on the server side.</p>

										<p><p>Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. The less I need to have coded in JS the better, especially since this will be a social app using a server to store data. PHP I can handle…JS is a little bit of a refresher for me, personally. Great suggestion!</p>
