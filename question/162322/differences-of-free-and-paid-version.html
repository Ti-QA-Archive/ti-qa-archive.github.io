			<h1>Differences of free and paid version?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>hello developers,</p>
<p>I have some questions about the differences of a paid and free version of titanum.<br>1-I read that I can create&#x2F;develop my app for free, but I can publish it at google play and apple store without the paid version? Can I publish while using the  free verison?<br>2- Can I code to generate and read QR code with the free version?<br>3-I have acess to device camera with free version?<br>4- Can I have acess to GPS and geolocation with free version?<br>5- Different android devices have different screen resolution, with Titanium I need to code the interfarce for each device or is automatically adjusted?<br>6- Can I create form with TItanium free?<br>7- Can I create .txt, .doc and .pdf documents with free version?<br>8- Can I send these documents to an email (gmail, hotmail, etc)? Can I send a photo to an email?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

							<div><p>You are clearly new so you may not appreciate the community nature of the Q&amp;A, it is made up of a group of people who ask and answer questions.  You have chosen to use a name of <strong>Game Developer</strong> which is your choice of course - but be aware you are very unlikely to gain the support of the whole Q&amp;A community as using something other than a real name that is attributable to a real person will make people think you have something to hide.</p>
<p>You have gained a good and clear answer from Trevor Ward who is part of this community as am I.  We have both used our real names as should everyone.  So whilst you will be forgiven for a short while I would consider correcting your displayed name to that of your real name.</p>
<p>This is a great community and you are of course very welcome here.  We only occasionally have &quot;bad apples&quot; and most of the time they hide behind a generic name that is not a real person.  You have given NO impression you are or would be one of those, which is why I thought it worth pointing out in case you feel future questions go unanswered - that is likely the reason.</p>
<p>Appcelerator Titanium is a great solution and I am sure you will find it an ideal fit for your needs given your questions.  560k other developers like it, so must be pleasing some people.</p>

							<p>You question is very specific.</p>
<p>There is no limit on the Open source Titanium Sdk between the free version and paid version.</p>
<p> the difference is a lot to do with support, ACS etc.</p>
<p> now to answer the specifics. Titanium uses. JavaScript so, can you do what you are asking, 80% out of the box! Things like document creation, you can but you will either need to write it yourself or put in a third party plugin.</p>
<p>I think you are misunderstanding a development framework, with an application which does specific tasks.</p>
<p>however everything you have asked is possible! either via your own code or using a third party plugin.</p>

										<p><p>To add to the accepted answer by Trevor, in short you can do all those things with the free version, many using the core solution and a few using some modules (although I would have to check on .doc support - never personally needed it).</p>
<p>Modules are used to extend the core framework, many modules are free, some are paid, very few of the paid ones are expensive.  Only number 2 is a module, there are lots to choose from and there are a few that are free for qrcodes.  Creating PDFs requires a js library jsPDF, again free.</p>
<p>You do not pay a percentage of the revenue or any other money to Appcelerator.</p>
