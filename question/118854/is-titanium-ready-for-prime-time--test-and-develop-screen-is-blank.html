			<h1>Is Titanium ready for Prime Time ? (Test and Develop screen is blank)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m trying to develop Android apps on Vista. I can easily develop on Eclipse. I decided to try Ti for cross platform development. Developer was working OK for a while. After recently upgrading my Android ADT everything is broken. I have uninstalled&#x2F;reinstalled ADT and Titanium. I changed my environment variables to point at &lt;ADK&gt;\platform-tools before &lt;ADK&gt;\tools. I put links to &lt;ADK&gt;\platform-tools\adb.exe and &lt;ADK&gt;\platform-tools\adbwin.dll in &lt;ADK&gt;\tools. I upgraded to 1.6.2. Now when I run developer the Test &amp; Deploy screen is blank. Is Titanium ready for primetime or should I go back to Eclipse&#x2F;Java ?</p>

							<div><p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>I walked through the install and troubleshooting doc, the only change I had to make was moving my Python install from C:\python27 to c:\program files\pyrhon27. I am still seeing the same behavior,  in Titanium Developer I get a blank Test &amp; Deploy screen with any project, including Kitchensink. I tried installing Titanium Studio, it returns a blank dropdown when I try to select an Android target for the project. I can still build a java Android project in Eclipse.</p>

							<p>I think Titanium is not superb product. Titanium lacks better support (by that I mean better support to the community), it lacks quality (that&#39;s getting better with every new version), usefulness (some things are badly designed and are not intuitive) and maybe it lacks framework (so developers can solve common problems easily).</p>
<p>In general, it&#39;s okay at the moment and it could become great product.</p>

										<p><p>Agreed.  The higher-ups rarely frequent the forums to help out, and the API docs are all out of date.<br>It works ok, seems Android support is lacking.</p>

										<p><p>I respectfully disagree.  While the docs may be out-of-date and an occasional property or method not what I&#39;d expect, I think Titanium is an awesome product.  Just considering the fact that as a new user I was able to create an app and deploy in both the Android Market and the App Store, in a few months, has impressed me.  As the product matures, I think we have a real winner …</p>

<p>It&#39;s hardly ever necessary to reinstall in order to resolve a problem like yours. Let&#39;s first verify that your environment is configured correctly…</p>
<p>Please follow the instructions at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Installing+on+Windows+7#InstallingonWindows7-InstallDiagnosticsforWindows">Install Diagnostics for Windows</a>. Copy the output and paste it to your preferred <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;">pastebin</a> service, and paste the link to it here. It&#39;s important that you do not modify it <strong>in any way</strong>, as this could mask problems with your configuration. Do <strong>NOT</strong> paste the actual code here! This is because the system will change the formatting.</p>
<p>Also, please create and share a screenshot of your android installed packages, using something like <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;imageshack.us&#x2F;">ImageShack</a></p>
<p>State the processor and RAM installed to your system.</p>
<p>Lastly, run the command <code>systeminfo</code> at the commandline and share it in a pastebin.</p>
<p>Then I will help you further.</p>

										<p><p>Hi again, Mark</p>
<p>It&#39;s very rare, but I am unable to fault your software configuration! ;) My only suggestion would be to install the Android packages <strong>SDK Platform Android 2.1-updatex API 7</strong> and <strong>Google APIs by Google Inc., Android API 7</strong>, which will allow you to use the next version of the Titanium SDK 1.7.X (or the development version, named &quot;master&quot;, already available from the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Continuous+Builds">Continuous Builds</a> site).</p>
<p>However, the reason why Titanium will not work when you launch apps using Titanium SDK 1.5.X and above is that, with only 1GB of physical memory, your system does not meet the minimum requirements. See <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Titanium+Compatibility+Matrix#TitaniumCompatibilityMatrix-TitaniumSDKMinimumMemory">Titanium SDK Minimum Memory</a> that explains the reasons for this.</p>
<p>As a temporary workaround, you may be able to use Titanium SDK 1.4.X, although obviously you won&#39;t be able to take advantage of the bugfixes and enhancements of the later releases. That said, I have quite happily developed apps using 1.4.X in the past, so it is indeed possible.</p>
<p>Best of luck with it!</p>
