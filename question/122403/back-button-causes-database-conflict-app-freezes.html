			<h1>Back button causes database conflict? App freezes.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Something weird is going on in my iPhone app. What happens is if I navigate quickly through the windows in my navGroup using the back button the app freezes. What I think is going on is this:</p>
<p>I have event listeners on a few windows that are set to &#39;focus&#39; for the purpose of automatically updating some information that has been changed from within a child window of that window, these functions, among other things, access the apps database. So basically I suspect that when I navigate backwards to a previous window the focus event fires instantly and the app starts reading from the db, a split second later I tap the back button again to move to another previous window in the hierarchy, this window also has a focus event listener and now this event fires and wants to access the database too, at this point the app freezes so I&#39;m guessing there is some sort of conflict, it&#39;s difficult to tell what happens, the console doesn&#39;t tell me anything. Maybe there is a conflict in trying to access the db? Maybe it wasn&#39;t closed properly? I tried setting a boolean to keep track of whether or not the db is open, and then added a &#39;blur&#39; event listener that closes the db if it is open when the window is closed, but that didn&#39;t seem to help. </p>
<p>If I remove the focus event listeners I can&#39;t reproduce the crashing so I&#39;m fairly certain it has something to do with this. Also this only seems to happen on device, I haven&#39;t been able to reproduce the problem in the simulator, probably because it&#39;s much faster and reads the db before I have time to click the back button a second time.</p>
<p>In any case, it&#39;s a major issue since the crash sometimes causes the app to be unable to launch again (forcing me to re-install it).</p>
<p>My primary solution was to disable the navBar back button briefly and wait for an event that I&#39;d fire when all db operations are done to prevent quick backwards tapping, but there doesn&#39;t seem to be a way to programmatically access the native back button. I could use my own button that I do have control over, but there doesn&#39;t seem to be a way to access the native UI back button style (arrow shaped) which I need. I could use a background image with an arrow button to fake it, but that won&#39;t scale it&#39;s width to fit the text that is displayed within it properly which I need it to do, and it won&#39;t animate as the window closes either.</p>
<p>So how do I solve this? Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.</p>

							<p>you could display a &quot;loading…&quot; view that blocks the whole screen so no click events can happen, make it transparent or slightly opaque. Display it when database activity starts and remove it when database activity is complete</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for taking the time. This is one of the solutions I have been trying actually, and also the way I prevent users from clicking the actual table while the database activity is ongoing. But I can&#39;t seem to get it to work for the navBar problem; If I add a view to the window in question I cant seem to get it to cover the entire screen, only the part below the actual navBar (which is what I need to block). Is there a way to put a view on top (depth-wise) of the navBar of the window that contains it?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also tried opening a transparent modal window in the tab that does not have a navBar itself. If the modal has a backgroundColor this works as expected and it blocks the entire screen, however, if I make it transparent the window that is underneath disappears from view, making the screen black instead.</p>

										<p><p>Oh, now I see, I was trying to open the modal within my tabGroup, if I instead call it with open() directly it pops over and is see-through. Now I&#39;ll just have to see if this solves my freezing problem.</p>

										<p><p>Yep, seems to be working fine now, so for future reference if the back button in a tab or navGroup needs to be disabled temporarily: place a transparent modal on top of it.</p>
