			<h1>iPad Popover: What is the rect parameter?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I&#39;m playing around with the iPad&#39;s popover widget.  Looking at the documentation for the <code>show</code> method, it describes a <code>rect</code> parameter that has <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>height</code>, and <code>width</code> properties.  </p>
<p>I&#39;ve played around with different values for these properties, but I&#39;m having a hard time discerning what these properties actually do.  Looking at the documentation here:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;latest&#x2F;Titanium.UI.iPad.Popover.show-method.html</p>
<p>I don&#39;t really understand the explanation of these properties.  Could you please explain to help me visualize what these properties do?</p>
<p>Thank you!!!</p>
<p>-Ryan</p>

							<p>Nevermind, I figured it out now. I was getting some parameters mixed up and now it&#39;s working as it says it does.  Thanks!</p>

										<p><p>For the popover widget, the &quot;rect&quot; property defines the size of the popover (via the &quot;height&quot; and &quot;width&quot; properties) and the location of the popover on the screen via the &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; properties.</p>
<p>That&#39;s what I figured the properties were used for, however, the problem I was having was that the popover wasn&#39;t located on the screen where I expected it should be, despite setting the &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; properties.  What prompted my &quot;nevermind&quot; comment was when I finally figured out that I had inadvertently mixed up the &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; properties.  Once I corrected that problem the popover was located where I expected it should be.</p>
