			<h1>Add a imageview to ScrollableViews</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>So I&#39;m using a scrollable view to show about 23 pages.</p>
<p>Which works fine and all.</p>
<p>Although i&#39;m trying to add a specific imageView to each page.</p>
<p>So I have 23 pages.<br>and I have 23 specific images</p>
<p>I want to add image 1 to page 1, image 2 to page 2 etc etc.</p>
<p>I was trying to use a for loop and doing it that way but somehow it keeps adding all the 23 images to page 1</p>
<p>Thanks for the help</p>

<p>Please state the 3rd-party mobile and Titanium SDK versions you are using, as you should <em>whenever</em> you post a question. The question tags are the best place for this information. See the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.appcelerator.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;contribute.html#participating_in_the_q&amp;a">Participating in the Q&amp;A</a> guide for tips on getting more accurate answers more quickly in these forums.</p>
<p>There is a good example of ScrollableViews in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_mobile&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;demos&#x2F;KitchenSink&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;examples&#x2F;scroll_views_scrollable.js">scroll_views_scrollable.js</a> of the KitchenSink, in which a different label is added to each view.</p>
<p>If you are creating your views programmatically, it sounds like you are omitting to create a new variable (with the <code>var</code> declaration) inside the loop.<br>However, this is purely a guess, as you haven&#39;t provided your code.</p>
<p>If this does not solve it, please create a <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;">GitHub Gist</a> of your code, and someone will take a look.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

							<p>Sorry about that.</p>
<p>Im developing for iPad using Titanium Mobile 1.5.1</p>
<p>Yes i&#39;m using the flipbook component that was posted here on the Q&amp;A.<br>It uses an array to build up the pages of the scrollview.</p>
<p>What I&#39;m trying to achieve is that I have the pages and a different image that is layerd on top, that has an animation.</p>
<p>i will try and prepare some code cause its about 2000 lines at the moment<br>I also need the animations to be their own unique view, cause the way I have it now is that I can start the animation on page 1 and while it&#39;s animating flip the page then the 2nd page image animates the rest of the animation that was started by animation 1, while everything need to have its own animation</p>

										<p><p>Hi Patrick - no problem, thanks for posting the TiSDK version.</p>
<p>By the way, you shouldn&#39;t really answer your own questions. Use the comment facility instead. :)</p>

										<p><p>Hmm, your app sounds complicated! :)  Are you able to whittle down the code to simply the bits causing you an issue? See <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.appcelerator.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;contribute.html#creating_good_use-cases">Creating Good Use-cases</a> for guidelines on this.</p>
