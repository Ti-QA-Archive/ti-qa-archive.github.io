			<h1>Run Option is disabled for One project</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I am new to titanium studio, I have some issue in running a project. </p>
<p>I have imported a titanium project in to Titanium Studio and try to Run it, but on the where we have the Run Option it is disabled and i am not able to Run the app. I tried by right click on the project and got to &quot;Run AS&quot; there also i cannot see any devices to Run. It is Just Showing &quot;Run Configurations&quot;. </p>
<p>In the same Work Space i have two other projects I am able to run it. I dont understand why there is problem for only one project. </p>
<p>I checked tiapp.xml there all the Depolyment Targets are checked just like in other projects, Even in the &quot;Publish&quot; i am not able to see any thing.</p>
<p>What is the issue where i have to change? Why it is issue for only one project in the Work Space?</p>

							<p>After importing, Studio has a bug where it leaves you in a state with no files selected. In that state, the Run options are disabled. It can look as if a file is highlighted. But you have to click to select a file in your project in order for the Run button to become enabled. This is perhaps not your solution, because you mentioned checking the tiapp.xml.</p>

										<p><p>Have you tried running from the CLI? In the project directory, try:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">ti build -<span class="hljs-tag">p</span> ios
</code></pre><p>The CLI might give error messages that indicate something wrong with the project itself.</p>
<p>Next, in Studio, under the Project menu choose Natures. Make sure that Titanium is selected. If this is an Alloy project, I think there&#39;s an Alloy nature, which also needs to be checked.</p>
<p>Did you import it as a Titanium project? There are a couple of options for import, make sure you select Existing Titanium Mobile Project.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>I used the CLI command it is working fine. One thing i noticed is the &quot;Build&quot; folder which will be created when we run the app is adding in to this Project where as in the remaining projects it is not adding. Is it may be issue. I deleted it and run but still it is adding back when running.</p>
