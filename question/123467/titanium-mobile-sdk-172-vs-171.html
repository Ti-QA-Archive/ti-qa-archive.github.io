			<h1>Titanium Mobile SDK 1.7.2 vs. 1.7.1</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve been developing with studio since it has been available. I have it installed on an XP machine, virtual hackintosh machine, and now a MacBook Pro. The virtual hackintosh machine will be deleted as soon as I can get studio working with my apps on the new MacBook Pro. The virtual machine and the XP machine are both sitting at Titanium Mobile SDK 1.7.1</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been working with three apps. 1) Kitchen Sink 2) Database App 3) Dessert App.</p>
<p>All three I have successfully emulated and installed on to an Android device, more specifically an old school Droid, using the XP machine and the virtual machine mentioned above. Enter the MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>I downloaded and installed Studio to the new MacBook Pro. Out of the box, the Titanium Mobile SDK is 1.7.2.</p>
<p>All three apps mentioned above run on the android emulator fine. I get mixed results when installing to to my droid. The database app force closes on the droid but not the emulator. If I take the code back to my 1.7.1 machines, it installs and runs fine. The database app is an app that I am using to follow along on one of the database tutorials (I&#39;ll post a link later if someone asks). The kitchen sink app &quot;fails to install&quot; do to memory constraints never seen before. If I take the same code back to the machines that run SDK 1.7.1, all is good.</p>
<p>Can someone point me in a direction to look for what might be happening?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve run into a few issues with 1.7.2 but they all seem to have been addressed in the recent CI builds http:&#x2F;&#x2F;builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;index.html</p>
<p>I would recommend trying there. I also found in 1.7.2 that I had to remove the contents the Android build direction, update the tiapp.xml, re-index the project, and build twice the first time I updated. Most likely this is because of my custom manifest but those steps worked for me.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

										<p><p>Ben, you should be able to move your customer manifest entries into <code>tiapp.xml</code> at this point. I think we&#39;ve addressed all the issues that would prevent that.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Don, thanks. Verified all custom manifests are working correctly. Still have the custom theme issue TIMOB-4643 in the current 1.8+ branch</p>
