			<h1>hasOwnProperty does not work on UI elements</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Whenever I try to call hasOwnProperty on a UI element, the app crashes immediately. Here is example code to reproduce:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> test = Ti.UI.createLabel();
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> test2 = { foo:<span class="hljs-string">'bar'</span> };
alert(test.hasOwnProperty(<span class="hljs-string">'adsfasd'</span>));
</code></pre><p>If I change the alert to use test2 it works fine. But as-is against the label… CRASH. This is in the iPhone emulator.</p>

							<p>Hi Jason.</p>
<p>Titanium objects are JS host objects, therefore they can implement (or not implement) any behavior they want (in theory).</p>
<p>&quot;hasOwnProperty&quot; works as expected on native JS objects.</p>
<p>That said, since Titanium objects can&#39;t be prototyped, there is no sense in using &quot;hasOwnProperty&quot; on them anyway. Instead of that, just use regular property access:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">test</span><span class="hljs-class">.adsfasd</span>
</code></pre>

										<p><p>I think it should still work as expected though. And if (test.adsfasd) is not the same thing as hasOwnProperty. It would be be nice for those UI elements to act the same as every other object in that regard so that we could test if a property exists.</p>

										<p><p>No, it should not work. :)</p>
<p>&quot;hasOwnProperty&quot; is method of &quot;Object.prototype&quot;, it&#39;s native method that works on native objects.<br>Titanium objects are host objects and they do not inherent native Object, therefore they do not need to implement any native behavior.</p>
<p>&quot;test.adsfasd&quot; is the same because &quot;hasOwnProperty&quot; checks if object has property defined in itself and not in it&#39;s prototype chain. Because of the fact Titanium objects can&#39;t have prototype object, no prototype can exist that is not own property. Therefore, those two are identical in this case.</p>
<p>And I agree that it would be ideal if Titanium object would behave like native JS objects, but unfortunately that&#39;s not possible at the moment. Although, you could write a wrappers around Titanium objects and then use them.</p>

										<p><p>okay… about prototype and all… i understand that it&#39;s different behind the scenes, but would be nice if it would do more to mimick a native js object. Right?</p>
<p>I wanna say I tried  &#39;color&#39; in test   also (again where test is a ti ui object. and if i remember right it always returned true.</p>
<p>I just wish it would let you test for the existence of a property. That&#39;s all.</p>
<p>test.asdfa is not the same because it could return FALSE even if the property does exist (if its null, 0, negative number, empty string, etc)</p>

										<p><p>Yes, it would be awesome if Titanium objects would behave like the native ones. Then you could do a lot of powerful and useful stuff.</p>
<p>But as I said, you can&#39;t rely on host objects, not only in Titanium environment. Specification just defines behavior of native objects, host object can behave in any manner they want (unfortunately).</p>
<p>You can check for property existence with stricter comparison variant like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (test.asdfa !== <span class="hljs-literal">undefined</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">//do something</span>
}
</code></pre><p>Or, you could use &quot;in&quot; operator:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-string">"asdfa"</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">test</span>) {
    //<span class="hljs-keyword">do</span> something
}
</code></pre></p>

										<p><p>Like I already said in my last comment</p>
<p>if (&quot;sadfasdf&quot; in test)</p>
<p>does not work… it ALWALYS returns true.</p>
<p>the only thing that works is </p>
<p>if (typeof test.asdfasdf != &#39;undefined&#39;)</p>
<p>There is just a lot of inconsistency that caused me frustration. Yes, I was able to work around it by trial and error. Just trying to help report things that should be cleaned up to make Appcelerator easier to use and stop people (like me) from getting frustrated by it when it doesn&#39;t work as expected by anyone familiar with javascript.</p>

										<p><p>Always returns &quot;true&quot;?!?! That&#39;s obvious nonsense and should be reported. I tried to loop over Titanium object&#39;s properties using for-in loop, but loop worked only when properties were explicitly defined. &quot;in&quot; operator seems massively broken … :(</p>
<p>I understand your frustration, many times in the past I found that trivial things like that just don&#39;t work as expected - and are not fixed quick enough (or at all). At the time, they are working on V8, I doubt things like this will be fixed soon. That makes me want to learn Java and fix things myself. :D</p>
