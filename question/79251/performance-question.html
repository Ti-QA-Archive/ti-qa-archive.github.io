			<p>I have an app I just started on. Basically I have a map that plots points of interest from a feed on my web server. Then, when the user taps a button, another modal window opens that has 1 textfield, 3 buttons, 2 sliders, and a view that contains 3 buttons and a picker (this view opens when 2 of the buttons are clicked).</p>
<p>I have all this running fine in the iPhone emulator, but when I run it on my actual phone, it is completely unusable due to the slowness. I imagine it&#39;s eating too much memory as well because I get random crashes.</p>
<p>I have several apps (written in objective C) on my phone that have almost identical UI&#39;s to the one I&#39;m creating and they run fine. I was just wondering, honestly, if Titanium mobile is just not going to work for me. I can&#39;t post any code, but has anyone successfully implemented a UI with the complexity of what I described above? Any tips or insight would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>I can assure you that your app is not exhibiting typical behaviour for a Titanium app.</p>
<p>Someone would be happy to take a look it. If you are not happy with posting it, I suggest that you rename your app.js file, create a new blank empty one, and then add back the non-solution-specific code from your app to create the barebones UI. Make sure it at least runs, and then post it here or at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;">gist</a></p>
<p>And, please, include your SDK version.</p>

							<p>Thanks for the responses, guys. Turns out it was just the way I was coding the UI that was making it slow… not Titanium. I definitely didn&#39;t mean to point fingers, but I was a little frustrated that day.</p>
<p>As a tip to others, lazy-load everything. Don&#39;t initialize anything until it has to be seen on the screen. Looking back, this was probably implied by the developers in the Kitchen sink code… so my bad.</p>
<p>Again, sorry for any bad implications. So far, I&#39;m really impressed with Titanium.</p>
