			<h1>Custom ListView Rendering Speed. Is there a faster way?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a custom ListView of about 400 items (may expand to about 1000 in future). Each row includes an load on-demand thumbnail image and 2 labels. Currently it&#39;s implemented Alloy template with sqlite data-binding. On simulators and modern Android devices, the loading time is quick. However on my &quot;old&quot; iPhone 4, the delay before seeing the list is quite noticeable, about 2-3 seconds. I&#39;m wondering if the following alternatives would be faster to render?</p>
<ol>
<li>Statically code all rows in Alloy. (Generate from external helper script)</li>
<li>Parse a .json file and dynamically generate the rows.</li>
<li>JSON binding ? (not sure if it&#39;s as simple as sqlite binding)</li>
</ol>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>From your question it looks like you are adding the entire 400 to 1,000 (in the future) items in one go - this is the problem.  The solution - don&#39;t.</p>
<p>Look at this situation from the users perspective;</p>
<p> <em>&quot;I run this app and it has 400 things for me to view - I want access to all of those things - but my screen only shows around 20 items at most at once.  However often I may only need to look at the first few, only reviewing all 400+ sometimes.&quot;</em></p>
<p>What would be better for the user?</p>
<ul>
<li>Only show a sufficient number to fill the display</li>
<li>Show more items only when the users actions indicate that is required</li>
</ul>
<p>How?</p>
<ul>
<li>When the user starts to move down the list indicating more are required - add another batch, the size of the batches should be larger than the likely screen but enough so the user can scroll the list to trigger &quot;next batch required&quot;.</li>
<li>The process is actually very simple as the ListView has the trigger mechanism built in already - <strong>markers</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>What changes do you make?</p>
<ul>
<li>Gain the data</li>
<li>Cache that data</li>
<li>Show the first x - 25 for the sake of this example</li>
<li>Add an event listener to the ListView for markers</li>
<li>(a) Add a marker to the last item</li>
<li>(b) The even listener is triggered you add another batch to the ListView</li>
<li>Repeat steps a &amp; b, when the even listener is no longer triggered - now more items to show</li>
</ul>
<p>Benefits;</p>
<ul>
<li>Only showing the first x (25 in the example) to start with</li>
<li>If the user never scrolls no more memory taken up for this screen</li>
<li>If the user scrolls a sufficient number are appended</li>
<li>The display time is significantly faster as you are now only showing a TINY percentage to start with</li>
<li>The time to show each extra bunch is also tiny so will not be noticeable during appends</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>I was aware of the partial loading solution. The reason for me to go the said way is that the built-in searchBar is so convenient for users to filter out what they need instantly.</p>
<p>Now thanks for all your input, I know data binding for long list is the reason for bad performance. Maybe let me ask from another perspective, suppose I go the partial loading way and using local JSON data. What&#39;s the recommended approach to achieve the same filtering performance as searchBar? Or is there an Alloy module &#x2F; widget already exist for similar work? Sqlite shall be my last choice as new JSON will be downloaded from time to time and I&#39;d avoid performance search at server side for users may use the app offline.</p>

										<p><p>This is where we have to separate perceived convenience you over the actual solution you need.  In short to achieve what you require you cannot simply fill a ListView and use the filter state of a linked search.</p>
<p>If this was my app this is what I would do;</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the data as you are right now</li>
<li>Loop it and store each row&#x2F;record into sqlite (or model&#x2F;collection)</li>
<li>Add the SearchBar to the parent at the SAME level as the ListView</li>
<li>Do NOT set the ListView search property - these must be unjoined</li>
<li>Add an event listener to the search bar to handle the change event (if every key) or the return event if a true search option</li>
<li>Add the first batch of data from the sqlite database using the marker approach I explained above</li>
<li>ONLY when the user uses the SearchBar and triggers the even do you add a where clause filter to the select statement to retrieve those matching values, again limiting to page sizes and using markers</li>
<li>When the search option is cancelled&#x2F;dismissed then remove the searched data and put back in the first batch of entries again</li>
<li>You can be more intelligent about the last point if you need to add a few batches</li>
</ul>
<p>Later on</p>
<ul>
<li>You download replacement data, then delete the previous entries and repeat the above list from the second bullet.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is more work, but this is the trade off, the convenience of not having to do much is at the expense of performance and control.</p>
<p>I WOULD use your technique for smaller lists as the speed issue is reduced enough to not be an issue.  However for larger lists - you need to manage the process yourself to gain the best memory vs performance vs user experience that you are aiming for.</p>
