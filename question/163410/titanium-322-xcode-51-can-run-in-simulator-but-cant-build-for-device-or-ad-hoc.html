			<h1>Titanium 3.2.2, XCode 5.1: can run in simulator but can&#39;t build for device or ad-hoc</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Configuration:<br>XCode 5.1<br>Titanium SDK: 3.2.2<br>OS X 10.8.5</p>
<p>Things were working fine on previous versions of both (XCode, SDK 3.2.1 GA). Now, today, after install of latest XCode&#x2F;Titanium SDK bits, this is the situation:<br>1: Am able to build and run simulator builds<br>2: Attempts to build for device, or ad-hoc, apparently do nothing. Seems like there&#39;s some disk activity, but no other apparent action. Nothing in the console, etc.</p>
<p>Other evidence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Going into the &quot;Configurations&quot; option (an option on the &quot;Distribute&quot; drop-down), and attempting to view any of the existing configurations shows a IDE &quot;Problem Occurred&quot; dialog (&quot;java.lang.NullPointerException&quot;).</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone else seeing this? Any hints as to how to debug this?</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance.</p>

							<p>Go into xcode, be sure your certificates&#x2F;profiles are still there.   If not, redownload them from apple.</p>

										<p><p><code>1: Am able to build and run simulator build</code> Some folks are the other way round, with device builds working, and simulator having issues.</p>
<p>Every xcode update has issues, but the 5.x have been strange, with apple changing ios versioning to 3 positions, instead of 2 and here xCode itself has eaten more than its share of provisioning profiles during updates.</p>
<p>I also tend to step away from studio and closer to the tools underneath (I&#39;m a cli user) and from a terminal, you can gather a bit of the details from <code>ti info</code> or to use <code>ti setup</code> and work through the various areas.  Studio likes to throw a nullpointer exception if it cant read a config file or something.</p>
