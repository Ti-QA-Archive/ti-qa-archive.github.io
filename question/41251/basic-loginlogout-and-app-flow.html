			<h1>Basic Login/Logout and App Flow</h1>

		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m just starting with Titanium Mobile and I&#39;m having a hard time trying to get the correct structure to handle a Login and Logout mechanism.</p>
<p>A user may enter into the application in three different states.</p>
<ol>
<li>Logged out and no active &#39;session&#39;<br>In this case the user should see the the Login screen and successfully login and then set a &#39;session&#39; pin before being allowed access to data on the device.</li>
<li>Logged in but with an expired &#39;session&#39;<br>In this case the user should see a enter pin screen and successfully enter the sessions pin before being allowed access to the data on the device.</li>
<li>Logged in with an active &#39;session&#39;<br>In this case the user the user will be into the application.</li>
</ol>
<p>Playing around with the kitchen sink app everything drills down from the window created in app.js and then comes back to it. It&#39;s almost like I need to use the tabGroup but without tab buttons to be able to jump around to the various parts of the app.</p>
<p>It doesn&#39;t seem right that the Login window would have the main application as a child window or that it would chain to the pin screen which would chain to the main app. I don&#39;t want the user to go back to the login screen. They should be allowed to get back to the pin screen or some facsimile to choose a new pin if they like.</p>
<p>In what way do I go about creating this?</p>

							<p>Here&#39;s the basic gist of how I handle it, and hopefully this can help. This is real brief, and I can elaborate on more specific points&#x2F;code if you want:</p>
<p>In app.js I have two tabGroups – a Login group and a Main group, each with their own windows. App.js checks to see if the session exists (Ti.App.Properties), and if it does, it opens the Main tabGroup. If it doesn&#39;t (or if the session datetime or whatever you&#39;re storing is too old), it loads the Login tabGroup.</p>
<p>Once the user logs in, if the Login group was called, it closes that out and opens the Main group.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Andrew, that idea seems good to me, I&#39;m relative new in TI, can I ask you if you could provide some code example, please Andrew?</p>

							<p>A modal window with the login page would did the trick too I think.</p>
