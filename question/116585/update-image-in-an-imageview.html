							<p>I believe the image is being cached by the imageView, what I suggest… and what I have done is add a unique id on the end of the fileName each time it is added to the view and then before uploading the image, remove the unique identifier.</p>
<p>I usually use the time in milliseconds as the unique identifier</p>

							<p>I wanted to think you both for your answers. But, I figured out my issue.  I had the event listener for my options dialog INSIDE of the even listener for the button that makes the option dialog pop up. I added some code to have the filename of the image display in the console. When I would select an image the first time, I would see the file name. When I would select and image the second time, no name would appear. When I would try to do it a third time, the app would crash. Once I separated the event listeners, the image view is updating just by using the hide() and show() commands without the temp names. Thanks for your help!</p>
