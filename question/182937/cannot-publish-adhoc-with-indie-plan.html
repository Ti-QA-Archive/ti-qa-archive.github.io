			<h1>Cannot publish adhoc with Indie plan</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Ok, I recently installed Appcelerator 4.1.0 and paid Indie plan hoping to package an app, at least on Adhoc, but failed.  Every time I click the package button it will just open the Plan Details with a link to the packages, which I can see am on Indie.  Right clicking the project and selecting package adhoc will popup the progress window but closes straight away and nothing after that.</p>
<p>I am a little frustrated as I have already asked this in another appcelerator forum but no response whatsoever.  I guess, I didn&#39;t pay that much to get a better support?   </p>
<p>I have searched the forum about this and saw similar issues but no support as well there.  Also tried logging out and logging back in, no effect.  I would really appreciate if someone can help me with this. thanks.</p>
