			<h1>&#34;entitlements invalid&#34; with 1.3, but fine with 1.2?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>hello, </p>
<p>really at a loss here. was about to submit my app today. but, thought, would do the iphone os4 compatibility update. that was fine. then, realized, i was developing under 1.2, so thought i would up it to 1.3. then, i discover that there is a bug that doesn&#39;t allow titanium to load the file into itunes. okay, so i drop it in myself. then, now, after it copies it to my device - it says:</p>
<p>The application &quot;XXX&quot; was not installed on the iPhone &quot;XXX&quot; because the entitlements are not valid. </p>
<p>hmm… </p>
<p>but, i switch back to 1.2 - everything works smooth as butter. what gives? i really want to submit my app, but i just feel really uneasy about submitting an app i can&#39;t even load onto my own device! what&#39;s going wrong with 1.3 and provisioning profiles? or, is it just me??</p>

							<p>hi, the app-id generated by the profiling site on developer.apple.com seems to have changed. i had the same problem while using a wildcard in the app-id. if i remember correctly the wildcard now is located in front of the &#39;domain&#39; instead afterwards (or vice versa)</p>
