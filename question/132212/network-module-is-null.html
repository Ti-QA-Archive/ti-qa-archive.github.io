			<h1>Network module is null</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Mobile App for iOS with iPhone emulator<br>Titanium Studio, build: 1.0.0.201106101247<br>Mac OS 10-6-7</p>
<p>I have inherited a partally completed project at work. I am new to titanium.<br>The program fails at this line</p>
<p><code>var xhr = Titanium.Network.createHTTPClient();</code></p>
<p>because the Network module is null. (The top level Titanium module exists) This line exists in in a file&#x2F;function being called by another file&#x2F;function. I can create the client variable successfully from the original calling function.</p>
<p>I am told this code worked at one point. I have the same project on a PC with an android emulator and it works fine.</p>
<p>What reasons could there be that the Network module is null on the MAC project, but only in some places. Can the way the dev machine is connected to the network affect this?</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, I Cleaned and rebuilt the project but the same thing is happening. The exact error from the console is:</p>
<p>message = &quot;Result of expression &#39;Titanium.Network&#39; [null] is not an object.&quot;;</p>
<p>I am apprehensive about updating the dev environment because the project worked recently. I have evidence this is true because it creates a record on the server at login unique to the iOS device.</p>
<p>This is critical issue for me. I can&#39;t seem to find anyone who had this exact error. A similar issue is unanswered <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;131771&#x2F;problem-with-the-creation-titaniumnetworkcreatehttpclient">here:</a></p>
<p>Under what circumstances would the Network module be Null when created in one file vs another? I don&#39;t believe it is syntax because it runs on the PC&#x2F;Android box fine. </p>
<p>The only variable that I can think of is the last time this development computer ran this app, it was connected to another physical network. But remember, I can Create the client successfully in other .js files in the project. So it&#39;s not as if the network is unavailable.</p>
