			<p>Hey guys, </p>
<p>I&#39;m beaten and bruised from this app submission process.  Finally after getting all of my certificates and everything in place to build the app for app store distribution, I&#39;m now stuck on the actual upload process.</p>
<p>I was reading that you have to use this Application Loader program to upload it, but it won&#39;t allow me to select the .app file or anything.  I just tried zipping it and it&#39;ll let me submit that, but then comes back with a bunch of errors.</p>
<p>The weird thing is that whatever folder I select to output the distribution file to, nothing shows up.</p>
<p>I also noticed in the XCode organizer that whenever I do a build it shows up under &quot;Archived Applications&quot; and has a line item for each time I build.  When I try to submit through there, it requires that I enter my login information and then after a few seconds throws this error.</p>
<p>Uncaught Exception:<br>-[ITunesSoftwareApplicationDescription applicationType]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x20097afa0</p>
<p>Stack Backtrace:<br>The stack backtrace has been logged to the console.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any idea what I&#39;m doing wrong?  I&#39;m trying to get this app uploaded before they shut down the approval process for the holidays.  Any help is greatly appreciated. :)</p>

							<p>I&#39;m using the latest version of Titanium Mobile and the iOS 4.2 SDK.  For some reason XCode wouldn&#39;t submit the app, so what I had to do was go into the Library -&gt; Mobile Devices -&gt; [GUID] -&gt; and compress the appname.app file into a zip and upload that using the separate Application Loader app.  </p>
<p>The weird thing is that TM&#39;s info.plist.template automatically puts a icon@2x.png requirement in the info.plist so I had to create a second icon for it to go through.  But either way it worked and my app is now submitted and will hopefully be approved soon!</p>

							<p>That&#39;s how I was trying to do it at first, but I would keep getting the error that I put in my original post and then XCode would crash and shut down. Seemed to always crash on the validation step.</p>
