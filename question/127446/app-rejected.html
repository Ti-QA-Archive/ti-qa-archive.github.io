			<h1>App Rejected</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>So Apple rejected an app because it was uploaded under my profile instead of my client&#39;s - fair enough.</p>
<p>So I have registered them as an Apple Developer, but I&#39;m concerned that downloading their certificates, etc… will cause a conflict on my system with my existing ones.</p>
<p>Does anybody know if this will cause an issue - there&#39;s no way in the world I can just send them the app and let them build&#x2F;submit, so I need to do everything.</p>
<p>I have access to download all of their stuff but I&#39;m just concerned I&#39;m going to cause all kinds of conflicts and wanted to see whether anybody could confirm or deny before I get started….</p>
<p>Many, many thanks if anybody knows or an alternative way of dealing with this…</p>

							<p>You&#39;ll be fine, I have 4 different clients I develop for.  </p>
<p>Basically you&#39;ll download their certificates, create provisioning profiles under that account, and when you go to archive&#x2F;release and upload, you just login with their itunes connect info and pick the profile you downloaded. </p>
<p>If they&#39;ve created certificates on their system, they&#39;re going to need to export them to a .p12 file, and send them to you so you can import them.  Otherwise, you&#39;ll get &#39;code signing&#39; errors, and have to do it all on your machine.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Josh - thanks for the info, they have nothing all they&#39;ve done is enrolled as an Apple developer and passed me their log-in details.</p>
<p>So I&#39;m free to just do the whole process - download WWDR certificate, create distribution profile, etc…</p>
<p>Thank you ever so much for saving me a lot of time and hassle…</p>

										<p><p>No problem.  </p>
<p>Yes, just do it all on your system, and then if they want to take over development down the road, you&#39;ll just have to export the keys for them.  Otherwise, they can reject the certificates and profiles and recreate and download them.</p>

							<p>Hey Josh - hope you see this. Just trying to add the extra WWDR to my keychain, but it seems as if there&#39;s only one entry afterwards. Not sure whether it&#39;s been added, overwritten my old one, or if everything is ok…</p>
<p>Hope you might be bale to advise.</p>

										<p><p>And another potential issue I&#39;m thinking - this app has already been built once, provisioning profiles, app-id, etc… do I need to create all new ones and start from scratch?</p>
<p>I&#39;m a little confused about the best way to move forwards; if anybody can offer any help it would be very grateful.</p>

							<p>#1 Rule: Start from scratch, delete all their crap unless they have live apps already in the store (which it doesn&#39;t seem like they do)</p>
<p>Follow the instructions in Apple provisioning portal for creating your own private keys locally on your machine, which will create the entries in your keychain. Then you can generate the certificates and when you drag them in they&#39;ll fly underneath those keys you&#39;ve generated. </p>
<p>Then EXPORT the keys with a password that you write down. Trust me you&#39;ll need to move them and it&#39;s a REAL pain to redo it once you&#39;ve launched.</p>
<p>Then drag provisioning portals into iTunes for distribution, or just run &#39;refresh&#39; with &#39;automatic provisioning&#39; mode on in xcode4 for &#39;just development&#39;.</p>
<p>Hope this helps. Main rule is to remember that if you have screwed it up, you need to DELETE all the keys and certs that you have which are related to that client and start over.</p>
