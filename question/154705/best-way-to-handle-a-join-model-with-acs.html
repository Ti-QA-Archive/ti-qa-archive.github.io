			<h1>Best way to handle a join model with ACS</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>With ACS, it appears you can&#39;t query a custom field that is an array. With that said, if you had a join model, what&#39;s the best way to handle the structure on the ACS side?</p>
<p>Simple example. You have a custom object called &quot;Box&quot; and another called &quot;Apple&quot;. Boxes have apples in them, and can have more than one. </p>
<p>For the purpose of this discussion, let&#39;s also pretend that Apples can be in multiple Boxes (despite what physics tells us), so setting a box_id on Apple isn&#39;t a prudent choice. It&#39;s a true many-to-many relationship.</p>
<p>What would be ideal is to create a custom field on Box with an array of Apple ids, since Box owns Apples. Then, query on Box to get the array of related objects. </p>
<p>My understanding is that this isn&#39;t possible with ACS right now. Instead, it seems like the only real way to do it is to use a join model, wherein I have another object called BoxApples, where I store the relationship between them as discrete records. That feels like hacking SQL on top of a NoSQL store, which, well, feels a little dirty. </p>
<p>Is there a better way? Am I missing something here?</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;ve been looking at this over the last week and came to the same conclusion. The only way was to use a <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;cloud&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;CustomObjects">CustomObject</a> to define the relationship, possibly using <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;cloud&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;relationalfields">Relational Fields</a> which would return the related objects in the same API call.</p>
<p>I posted <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;154479&#x2F;acs-implementing-userphotocollection-relationship">this Q&amp;A thread</a> related to my specific use case. I wanted to enable the owner of a PhotoCollection to set access to it on on a per-user basis. I can set permissions to a PhotoCollection to protect it on a per-user&#x2F;global basis using an ACL. But I couldn&#39;t&#x2F;can&#39;t find a way for enabling a user to query which PhotoCollections it has access to based on these defined ACLs alone. So I need to define the relationship between PhotoCollection(s) and User(s) myself.</p>
<p>But PhotoCollection doesn&#39;t provide a query() method - only search() - and even if it did, and I set the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;cloud&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;customfields">custom_fields</a> to something like: <strong>custom_fields = {&quot;user_ids_read&quot;: [id1,id2,id3]}</strong> you can&#39;t query() on an array value for custom_fields.</p>
