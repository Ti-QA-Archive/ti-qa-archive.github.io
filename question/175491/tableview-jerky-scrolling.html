			<h1>TableView jerky scrolling</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>SDK 3.2.3, IOS 7.01, Iphone 4s</p>
<p>I have read many (if not all) of the posts about jerky scrolling on a tableView. </p>
<p>Most of the posts regarding this problem are more than 3 years old and many ended in someone saying this was going to be resolved in a future release.</p>
<p>I have tried:<br>Add class name to each row<br>Checking for memory leaks<br>Removing any images or background colors<br>Removing background images<br>Removing everything from the row until there is just one simple label<br>Removing custom fonts<br>Removing any processing tasks from each row<br>Removing imported modules from the row controller<br>Set absolute height on each row and any containing elements</p>
<p>When I stripped down the row to just one label, it got a little better, but the problem still persisted.</p>
<p>My table has under 100 records in it and I have implemented the continuous scrolling solution so I am only loading 20 at a time. </p>
<p>I have downloaded the Kitchen Sink demonstration to see if it has the same issues and it does, so I am guessing this is a limitation of this framework? </p>
<p>My native apps on my phone do not respond this way when scrolling. They are silky smooth.</p>
<p>Any other suggestions?</p>

							<p>Sounds interesting, I have to say not really experienced this problem, but you seem to have gone a long way trying to solve it.</p>
<p>Firstly try <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;platform&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;ListViews">listview</a>, it is a much cut down version of tableview, with a lot of performance advantages.</p>
<p>If that does not work, please provide some code examples so we can try and better understand the issue.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ll give the listview a try however, on testing it in Kitchen Sink on the simulator, it exhibits the same jerky behavior. It seems to be a little better, but not much. </p>
<p>More than happy to post my code, however, it is a pretty basic view and controller. Nothing fancy.</p>
<p>I have posted videos of the Simulator exhibiting the jerky scrollling behavour. This is pretty mild in comparison to what happens on the phone. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t get video of the phone as I am using the phone to take the video.</p>
<p>Here is the kitchen sink app with the listView<br><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;WRj5D43zdVU">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;WRj5D43zdVU</a></p>

										<p><p>As I was working through the process of stripping my app down so I could identify the cause of the jerky scrolling, I did notice one thing that increased the performance of the scrolling tremendously.</p>
<p>I had a view within the row that contained custom icon fonts. When I removed this view, the scrolling got noticeably better. Not completely smooth, but better than it was. </p>
<p>Hope this helps anyone who is dealing with the same problem.</p>
