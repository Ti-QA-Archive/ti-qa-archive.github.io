			<p>Hi,<br>a few years ago Appcelerator said that they were working on adding RAD possibility in Ti Studio.<br>unfortunatelly I still don&#39;t see anything… and tired designing UI from code (I use Delphi for about 20 years now).<br>Any suggested tool for doing this ?<br>I see ForgedUI and VisualUI on the MarkegtPalce but the reviews are very bad.<br>Regards</p>

							<p>While ForgedUI was not a very convincing product this is true. I must say that VisualUI is pretty good form what I&#39;v see of it. You can even design Alloy views as well a &quot;classic&quot; Titanium Views.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#39;t wait for Appcelerator do put any effort into such a tool though. I was at a conference where Jeff Haynie himself said that the workload was to heavy for a company such as theirs. When you compare it to how much it will bring them, it makes total sense.</p>
<p>So in conclusion, VisualUI would be your best bet. You can even test it on a 30 day trial period and it&#39;s 30$. Come on, these guys deserve at least that much don&#39;t you think?</p>
