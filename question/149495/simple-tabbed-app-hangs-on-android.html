			<h1>Simple Tabbed App Hangs on Android</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I <em>cannot</em> seem to get a Titanium App to run under any of the 4.x versions of Android (ICS or JellyBean).</p>
<p>If I compile with a 1.x or 2.x version of the Titanium SDK, the app crashes immediately on launch.  It doesn&#39;t even get to the first line in the app.js.</p>
<p>If I compile with the 3.x Titanium SDK, with analytics set to false in the tiapp.xml, I get the same result.  Crashes immediately.</p>
<p>If I set analytics to true, the app will launch, but it just hangs on the launch image.</p>
<p>I&#39;m using a brand new, empty project created right from Titanium Studio, build: 3.0.2.201302191606  I just went File -&gt; New -&gt; Titanium Project -&gt; Tabbed Application.  Compile and run.</p>
<p>You can see what happens yourself by visiting this link to the Android emulator:</p>
<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.manymo.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;IU2H2kw-11089-90">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.manymo.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;IU2H2kw-11089-90</a></p>
<p>Is anyone else having this issue?  Has anyone been able to deploy a 3.x app to later versions of Android successfully?</p>

							<div><p>some logs from DDMS would be nice<br>So we, you know, could see what Android thinks is bad and thus crashing.</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;ll give that a shot.  I&#39;ve never played with DDMS, but I&#39;m sure I can figure it out.</p>
<p>The main challenge now is getting my virtual devices sorted out.  By default my app is launching in a tablet form factor when I really want a phone interface.  I&#39;ve setup a phone, but can&#39;t figure out how to make my project launch into that device.</p>

							<div><p>Bryan,</p>
<p>In Studio, go to Run &gt; Run Configurations.  There you can change the Android version used by the simulator for that particular project.</p>

							<div><p>Thanks for the tip Ricardo.  I&#39;ve used those settings before.  Unfortunately, the only screen choice is WXGA.  How do I specify a different screen?</p>

							<p>Following your instructions, I was able to create a tabbed android application and run it without problems on my SGN which is running JellyBean. I ran it on device (I never use the emulator if I can help it). I&#39;m using the same TI SDK version as you.</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s just odd.</p>
<p>Maybe I should blow away my Titanium Studio setup and reinstall from scratch?</p>
<p>One other thing – are you on Mac or Windows?  I&#39;m running the Mac version.</p>

										<p><p>Okay, I&#39;m making progress.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I downloaded a whole new set of Android SDKs, and that seems to have gotten me over the initial problem.  I can now build and run on Android 4.x</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>ARM only</strong>.  When I try on an x86 emulator, I still get an immediate crash.  <strong>Does Titanium not support x86 devices?</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Somewhere along the lines it seems that javascript support has changed in Titanium.  I used to be able to build a webview, and include local .js files.  With the Titanium 3.0.2 SDK this no longer works.  I had to rename my .js files to be .txt in order for them to be included properly.  I see others have mentioned this problem here on the Q&amp;A section.  That&#39;s a PITA for developers, but at least I was able to get around it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for helping me figure out it was something in my setup, not an overall Titanium problem!</p>
