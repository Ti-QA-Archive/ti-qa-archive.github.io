			<h1>Titanium studio, music player slider and getting playing time.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello guys, thanks for reading. I am pretty new to titanium studio. I am developing a music player for iphone and android. I used Ti.Media.createsound to achieve the goal. i actually have two questions: (might seem stupid, sorry about that)<br>1- I am using images instead of buttons for play, pause, stop, etc. is it a proper way or is it better to use buttons instead? because i want it to move forward by 10, 10 seconds when i am holding the FastForward image(which i use as button), and stop forwarding when i release the button. (i used longpress event but it only moves it by one 10 second.)<br>2- i am using slider to show the track duration and to slide player forward and backward. i can&#39;t make it slide to a specific position while playing. is there an example or guide?<br>3- Is there a proper way to show the current time of music being played  (like:  01:21). (i&#39;ve used setInterval method to make the slider move alongside the player, as well as stating the playing time, but it isn&#39;t a proper way because i am increasing a number by 1 every seconds, and display it as current duration) </p>
<p>i deeply apologize for multiple long question, and for my bad english. please help me, this is my school project.</p>

										<p><p>One can apparently get around this problem by using VideoPlayer to play audio files. Play the audio from a Blob buffer</p>
