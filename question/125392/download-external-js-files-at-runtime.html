							<p>You COULD using eval, however Apple would not allow such an app into the store (or would remove it soon after);</p>
<p>Also running large amounts of code through eval would crash the app.</p>

							<p>As Matt already mentioned, doing so is against Apple&#39;s guidelines.  If you try to submit it to the store, Apple would reject it if they caught the fact it did this.  If they didn&#39;t, it would get removed if&#x2F;when they were made aware of it.</p>
<p>So regardless of technical abililty, it begs the question on whether you intend a version to be available in the app store or not.  If android only or if only installed via ad-hoc or enterprise profiles, then the app store guidelines may not matter to you.</p>
<p>There was a product mentioned in the Q&amp;A several months ago which let you do exactly this.  But I can&#39;t remember the name nor find it with a few search attempts now.  I also saw very little mention of it in the Q&amp;A, and I suspect a major reason for that is because Apple would reject any apps found to be doing this.</p>

							<p>Nope (as far as I know)<br>The js compiled into native code so you need to go through compiler.</p>
<p>You could make a &quot;builder&quot; that downloads a json structure and builds the app from there on the execution time, but I don&#39;t think Apple will like this.</p>

										<p><p>technically this is not true, JavaScript is not cross-compiled to native code.  It is evaluated, as JavaScript, on the device at runtime.</p>
