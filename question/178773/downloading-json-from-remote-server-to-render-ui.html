			<h1>Downloading JSON from remote Server to render UI</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, </p>
<p>We are planning to implement a logic where-in a screen will be rendered based on a JSON response received from a remote server. It is something like we will have a parser, which will parse the JSON and create the UI dynamically. </p>
<p>Hence we can change the view anytime we want without going through the process of pushing the APK&#x2F;IPA to production. </p>
<p>The drawing logic will be present in the client side but only the structure will be sent from the web service response. </p>
<p>For example:<br>{<br>controls : [<br>{<br>type : &quot;textfield&quot;,<br>hintText : &quot;enter username&quot;,<br>label : &quot;User Name&quot;<br>},<br>{<br>type : &quot;textfield&quot;,<br>hintText : &quot;enter password&quot;,<br>label : &quot;Password&quot;<br>},<br>{<br>type : &quot;button&quot;,<br>title : &quot;Login&quot;,<br>}<br>]<br>} </p>
<p>Our query is that, whether Apple will approve this process of displaying the UI, that is, based on the JSON received from a web service response. Is there any chance of the application getting rejected or has anyone done anything similar earlier for Apple.</p>
<p>We will be using 3.4.0.GA SDK and targeting iOS 7 onwards.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the link Mark. Ti.Browser is something similar to what we are trying to achieve. The only difference being Ti.Browser is using XML and we are trying to use JSON.</p>

							<p>Whether the JSON def is local or remote makes no difference.<br>I don&#39;t see there&#39;s any reason to worry about this approach. Every webpage renders in browser by this logic, isn&#39;t it?</p>

										<p><p>You are correct Dave. It is just another web service response based on which I am going to render my screen, the only thing being that how the screen is going to look is coming from the web service in JSON format. The parsing will be done in the client end and the screen is going to be displayed.</p>
<p>I agree with you that it should not be a reason for concern, but wanted to validate and see if anyone from the community has already implemented this approach with no issues in approval process.</p>
