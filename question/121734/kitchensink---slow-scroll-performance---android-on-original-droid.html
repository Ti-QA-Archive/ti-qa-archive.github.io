			<h1>Kitchensink - Slow Scroll Performance - Android on original Droid</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m still getting my feet wet with Titanium Studio. I installed Kitchensink on my original Droid because of the slow emulator performance. I have to say, the performance isn&#39;t much better on hardware. My Droid is overclocked and runs other large apps just fine. The main issue is scroll performance, although there seems to be lag in keystrokes (software or slideout keyboard) and the response that is suppose to follow the keystroke.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not setup with a iOS device, so I can&#39;t compare.</p>
<p>I already tried searching here, but the only speed issues I can find from previous Q&amp;A seems to be related to the android emulator.</p>
<p>Is anybody else experiencing this?</p>
<p>Thoughts? Remedies?</p>

							<div><p>Currently, it appears to be Titanium SDK 1.7.1, but I may have been on 1.7.0 when I asked the question….I don&#39;t remember what version I was at when I asked the question. What is the symptom of slow scrolling a function of? The Kitchen Sink app itself? Or is scrolling an issue in general on android based devices? Can you elaborate? Thank yoU!</p>
