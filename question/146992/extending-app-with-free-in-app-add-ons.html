			<h1>Extending app with free &#34;in-app&#34; add-ons</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>What is the best development strategy for creating an app with basic functionality, which is then extensible with more features post installation?</p>
<p>So for example, the basic application allows you to create a user profile and retrieve some data from a service. But then, the app would list plugins one could download, to retrieve further data from the service, or do something nifty with that data, like trend it, graph it, etc.</p>
<p>How would one go about architecting such an app? Can &quot;in-app&quot; downloads from the marketplace be free? How does one then implement the basic app to reflect new functionality from &quot;in-app&quot; downloads.<br>Advice or experience anyone can relate would be extremely appreciated :)</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>This response is biased towards iOS as that is what you are starting with, the basic principles are the same for Android but should research this with both stores yourself when signing up.</p>
<p>An &quot;in-app-purchase&quot; (IaP) is an actual purchase so you cannot offer them for free.  There is an exception though but ONLY for free subscriptions, but this is ONLY for news-stand apps.</p>
<p>In order to add IaPs you add them to the App Store as a list of products that can be purchased and assign at least a name and price to each - you can have 10,000 of these for each app - so go wild.</p>
<p>You are responsible for making your app IaP capable and this includes creating the required setting changes for your app certificate.</p>
<p>You then access the list of IaPs and present them to the user as a list of things they can purchase, which they do with their own iTunes Account details.  The AppStore validates the purchase and returns the sale receipt back to you - MAKE SURE you validate this as some naughty people exploit this communication.</p>
<p>There a few types of IaP but two of the main ones are;</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Consumable</strong>; this is something that can be bought more than once; think gold coins for points to get to the next level in games</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Non-consumables</strong>; these are for things like extra access to the app, example; pro version or a free app or to remove the ads in a freemium model app.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you offer non-consumables you MUST allow the user to restore those purchases without further charge.</p>
<p>Choosing the wrong type of IaP will likely get your app banned - so make sure you understand the differences.</p>
<p>To make things easy you can use the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;794?1480413759">appcelerator marketplace module</a>, this comes with example code to show you how to how to set it up.  You will need an intermediate knowledge of appcelerator and iTunes Connect, as well as patience for your first run.  It gets easier - there are just lots of steps when you include proper tests into the mix.</p>
<p>Plan, plan - plan some more, make notes - it makes it easier for the next time.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the answer! It definitely clarifies in-app updating. I still need to find a solution to add free add-ons or extensions to an app. Any idea how one might go about doing so? I would imagine a code server of some sort would be required.</p>

										<p><p>OK, follow-up question; </p>
<p>If you are adding content, features for free then why are you not simply giving access to that information from day one (when they download the app).  I can give you an answer to your question when you have answered this one.</p>

										<p><p>The features will be built and made available over several years, and the idea is to offer them to the app user as they become available.</p>

										<p><p>So a few ways for you to look;</p>
<p>If the extra features are files, data or anything you could download in a browser</p>
<ul>
<li>Add the content to a server (or CDN service)</li>
<li>Create a features API that pulls down the current list of features available in this technique</li>
<li>Assign each feature a title and ID at the least</li>
<li>When the user chooses a feature from the list you present them - cache the IDs they chose and download the content</li>
<li>Next time the list is shown either hide or disable the features already chosen</li>
</ul>
<p>If the content is logic;</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider moving some code to the cloud in the form of node.js support</li>
<li>If you do not want or can not use the cloud logic style, you will need to add the features to the app and re-submit to the store</li>
<li>Use the same cached IDs logic as in the previous block.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is very project dependant and there are many combinations.</p>
<p>This should have given you enough to mark the question answered :-)</p>
