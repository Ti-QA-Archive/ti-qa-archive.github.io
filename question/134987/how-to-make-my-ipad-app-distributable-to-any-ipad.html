			<h1>How to make my iPad app distributable to any iPad?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have an iPad app that can be deployed to 2 different iPads, linked to specific UDIDs. To add another UDID is a royal pain because I have to redo provisioning profiles on Apple.com, and make related changes locally.</p>
<p>I&#39;m ready to distribute my ipa file to all the employees of the company I made this for; I don&#39;t want to tie it to individual device IDs anymore. How can I make my ipa &quot;public&quot;? I don&#39;t want to put it on Apple App Store. I just want to put it on my web server, and I&#39;ll restrict access to it. What do I need to do on apple&#39;s provisioning portal, and on my local Mac, to be able to make the ipa file publicly distributable?</p>

							<p>If the app is for a company, to be used only by their employees, have them become an Apple developer and pay for the Enterprise program then release it under their account. You do not have to collect UDIDs. You create a manifest and have their web master put the ipa and manifest on their website then email a link to the manifest to their employees. They open the email on their iPad, click on the link, and the app is installed for them.</p>
<p>You do not even have to get the app approved by Apple.</p>

										<p><p>My client has an Apple developer account AND they joined the enterprise program. (1) How do I change my provisioning profile on Apple site so the app is distributable without linking it to device IDs? (2) I know how to get the ipa file from my build, but how do I create the manifest?</p>

										<p><p>An Enterprise Distribution Certificate is only available on an enterprise account so you will have to log into you clients&#39; account and create one. It is just like creating a normal certificate except you check a box for Enterprise distribution.<br>see…<br>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;ios&#x2F;manage&#x2F;distribution&#x2F;index.action<br>and click on<br>&quot;Create and Download a Distribution Provisioning Profile for Enterprise In-House Distribution&quot;</p>
<p>When you are ready to distribute the archiver will give you a choice for &quot;Save for enterprise or ad-hoc&quot;. Pick that.<br>Then when the save as screen comes up, at the bottom is a check box for enterprise. This is where the manifest file is created.</p>
<p>When you check the enterprise box you will be asked for more information. The two that are required are URL and title. Title can be anything, I use the app name and the rev number. The URL is where the app will be on a web site. </p>
<p>If you do not know that yet then that is ok. Put a web site name in the field and move on. The manifest is a plist file so it can be changed. Once the IT guy decides where to put the app for download, he can change the manifest file.</p>

										<p><p>Ralph, I&#39;m trying to follow your instructions, but you lost me at &quot;When you are ready to distribute the archiver will give you a choice for &#39;Save for enterprise or ad-hoc&#39;.&quot; What &quot;archiver&quot;? Where is this option? Is it someplace on developer.apple.com in the provisioning section? I have been all over this area and haven&#39;t seen this option. Where do I get the plist file? Should it be someplace in my build directory, near the ipa?</p>

							<p>You could join the enterprise program. I believe it allows you to provide ad-hoc distributions to all members of a company without creating a new provisioning profile containing all UDID&#39;s.<br>Read over at apple for more info and requirements…</p>

							<p>I&#39;d like to give credit to the answers, but none of them really helped that much. The way I figured out to do this is to install BetaBuilder for iOS apps. It creates the manifest and html for you. Also I had to create a Distribution Profile and redo some stuff, then it all seemed to work.</p>

										<p><p>Ralph more than answered your question, he practically walked you through apple&#39;s enterprise documentation… Big thumbs up to him, his effort to help is commendable. If you want more specific answers you will need to word your question very specifically. As your question currently stands, the answer can be summed up in one word. &quot;Enterprise&quot;. You did not specifically ask for a step-by-step instruction manual to wireless ad-hoc distribution.</p>
