			<h1>getting a value from webview after form submit</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve got a webview running in my iOS app that loads a html form from a remote sever and returns a value I need for my app after a successful POST submission. The returned value is stored in a javascript variable inside the webview and I&#39;d like to get that value back into the native app. </p>
<p>I believe I need to use evalJS to accomplish this but I&#39;m not sure how to invoke it at the correct time. I don&#39;t think I want addEventListener onLoad as that would return an empty variable because the user hasn&#39;t filled out the form yet. </p>
<p>This is probably something thats been done a few times but I couldn&#39;t find the answer in the QA.</p>

							<p>what I would do is fire an event from the webView on the form submission.</p>
<p>as the payload of the event, send back the form data to the application</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Aaron, sorry to be thick but could you maybe give a bit more detail on that solution? Just to provide a bit more detail, what&#39;s actually happening with this form submit is that it&#39;s running through a php oauth procedure and returning an access token that I want to capture and store.</p>

										<p><p>how is the access token returned? you can listen to for the onload event of the webview and parse the html response looking for the token.</p>

										<p><p>Right now it&#39;s sitting in a span element with an ID so it&#39;s easy to grab the innerHTML value. So if I understand everything correctly I set an evalJS to watch for a function that&#39;s tied to the onload event on the page that returns the token?</p>

										<p><p>in the load event of the webView, you are given access to the html content, scan it there looking for the token.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">webView.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'load'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span></span>{

										<p><p>To clarify, the original answer won&#39;t work with remote files.  The solution provided in the comments is the only option I&#39;ve seen discussed without performing another round trip to the server to get the value.</p>

							<p>I didn&#39;t think it work remotely either but it did. I think because the initial content in the webview was local that helped. It seems to fire every time there&#39;s a load event in that view, perfect for my situation.</p>
