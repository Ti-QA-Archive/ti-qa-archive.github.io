			<h1>ListView Remote-Image Performance</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>i&#39;m currently dealing with some performance problems using remote images in a ListView template (the scrolling experience lags). </p>
<p>The remote image problem is also known in the &quot;native&quot; iOS community and there are some tweaks (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;1352594) to improve it. </p>
<p>When replacing the remote images with local images, the performance is improved. So i searched and found a tiny function to manually cache the images so that the actual ImageViews only display local images. The caching works well, but the problem is, when i update the ImageView to replace the defaultImage with the cached image, the ListView component requires to call the updateItemAt() method. </p>
<p>So my question is, how are your experiences when using remote images in ListViews to achieve high performance scrolling experience?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

							<div><p>How do you cache the image and display it afterwards?</p>
<p>The official SDK has btw a small bug (in iOS) that prevents correct image caching. The remote image is always requested from server although the content has already been fetched. You can see this behavious when you load a remote image, close the app, disable internet connection and restart the app. With correct caching, in offline mode the image should still be shown but that&#39;s not always the case.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don&#39;t think that this bug is directly related to the performance issue. But what is important for fast ListView scrolling is the correct calculation of the item row height (dont&#39; relay on Ti.UI.SIZE) and optimized image loading. I&#39;ve seen an extended native implementation for ListView on iOS that prevents image loading while scrolling. If that might help you, I can search for the snippet.</p>

							<div><p>a bit more information on the implementation might be helpful. How large are the images? How large in the list? What is the benchmark you are looking to match or come close to.</p>
<p>The suggestions by Danny are helpful but without a clearer definition of what your objective is other than make it faster, it might be difficult to assist you to reach your final objective.</p>

<p>This module is based on the SDK 3.2.0 for ListView. But you can look at the native code how to implement <code>stopImageLoaderOnScroll</code> for the current SDK. Either as new module or (what I always do) to edit directly the existing code (in this case: TiUIListView.m).</p>

							<div><p>@Aaron Saunders: I use Alloy with an ItemTemplate in Ti 3.4.1.GA. The template contains multiple views and 2 remote ImageViews. It seems like the performance bug only happens, when one cell goes out of the view port and another cell appears. Here are some code details:</p>
