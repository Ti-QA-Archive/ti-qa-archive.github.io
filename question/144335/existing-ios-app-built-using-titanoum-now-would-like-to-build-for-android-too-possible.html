			<h1>Existing iOS App built using Titanoum, now would like to build for Android too. Possible?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, I&#39;ve built a fully functioning iOS App using Titanium 2.1.3 and everything works fine - have submitted it to the App Store without any issue.</p>
<p>Now, I&#39;d like to add an Android build too. Am building on a Mac (ML 10.8.2), I have the android SDK installed. I&#39;m able to push the app to the Android Emulator and can see the App Icon. Upon launch I get a red screen with the words &quot;Error&quot;.</p>
<p>The .apk files are being built and instaleld on the emulator&#x2F;device but can&#39;t be run.</p>
<p>Any advice from anyone on what should I be checking?</p>
<p>FYI, the App was earlier built as iPhone only.</p>

							<p>Yeah, use the DDMS utility, found in your_android_sdk&#x2F;tools and see what the error actually is and post it here.</p>

							<p>Well… yes! that&#39;s the point.</p>
<p>Of course, take into consideration that some controls that are available for iOS devices are not available on Android and vis versa.</p>
<p>I recommend checking out Forging Titanium videos to see some cross platform development techniques. Also, since android and ios tend to act differently on cretonne situations, you might want to check the platform and decide which code to run based on the platform.</p>
<p>I would start by running the project on an android device and see where it doesn&#39;t work and adjust what&#39;s needed.</p>
