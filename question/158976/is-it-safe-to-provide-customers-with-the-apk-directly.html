			<h1>Is it safe to provide customers with the APK directly?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m using Titanium to make an app that is available on Google Play. But I have a customer who is interested in paying me for making a version of the app that is tailored specifically to their needs and requesting that they can make the app freely available to their employees. Hence it would result in me <strong>providing the compiled APK file directly to them</strong>, rather than through Google Play.</p>
<p>But if I do that my concern is now: how easy is it to decompile the APK generated by Titanium? I know everything is decompilable, but the question is <strong>how hard is it?</strong> Would it take quite a bit of effort to retrieve usable source code, or am I jeopardizing my business by making it relatively simple for someone to make a similar app?</p>

							<p>As easy as any other apk downloaded by the Google Play app store. There is no difference.</p>
<p>So you better get your paranoia high horse right now and realise that no matter how <em>smart</em> and <em>clever</em> your code may be. Most people won&#39;t care.</p>
<p>and if by chance they were interested in copying some features of your app, they can retro-engineer it as they will. Pretty much like every copycat application out there.</p>
