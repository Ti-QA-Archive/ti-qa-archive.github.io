			<p>Titanium on my desk top freezes whenever I try and get the Android SDK to install&#x2F;update (so that I can use Titanium), it downloads a file, but then goes to install it but it freezes and locks up the entire program.</p>

							<p>What about you trying to install the Android SDK even *before install the TiStudio?</p>
<p>PS: What I mean is: try to get it installed at least (Android SDK) and after that get it into TiStudio via setting your configs.</p>
<p>Hope that helps,<br>Cheers,<br>Rodrigo.</p>

							<p>I have it installed, I installed it prior to Titanium. It still wants me to press a button &#39;Install&#x2F;Update SDK&#39;, and it&#39;s leaving me unable to use it on my desk top. I have to use Titanium for my assessment for a university class (it is a specific requirement), and while I can use it on my laptop, I would prefer to use it on my desktop while I am at home as I am much less prone to typo&#39;s and can see everything much easier. I just don&#39;t get why it did it no problems on the laptop, but is giving me grief here.</p>

							<p>Hi Rhys,</p>
<p>No problem!</p>
<p>But regarding your issue there, well, it sounds a little bit &quot;weird&quot; at least. You have it installed and working as expected on your laptop as you said, so I assume you know already how to get the installments process properly. :)</p>
<p>When you say: &quot;It still wants me to press a button &#39;Install&#x2F;Update SDK&#39;, and it&#39;s leaving me unable to use it on my desk top&quot;</p>
<p>Does it mean that after &quot;clicking&quot; the button you mention so your desktop &quot;freezes&quot;? Lock?</p>
<p>Do you have all the &quot;minimum&quot; versions of Android SDK installed as well in your laptop? As the Titanium Docs actually asks as well: ensure that the Prerequisite Android SDK &#x2F; API for the latest official Titanium SDK.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure you<code>ve got already into the link I</code>ll pass below concerning the installation of Android SDK with TiStudio, but BTW I will pass the link for you to check out that as there is a kind of &quot;step-by-step&quot; installation process for it (I`ve done that as well with success): </p>
<p>• http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.0&#x2F;index.html#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Quick_Start</p>
<p>In the webpage link above, you go &quot;down&quot; the page and look forward *Android SDK step`s installation. Maybe it will clarify something else for you.</p>
<p>Am sorry if it does not help but I hope it does.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>Rodrigo.</p>

										<p><p>I have done all that (including removing and reinstalling Titanium), and tried again just for good measure. My desk top doesn&#39;t freeze, only Titanium, but I can&#39;t do anything with the program. Only Titanium locks up and it needs to be force-closed as it is &#39;Not Responding&#39; according to windows. Mousing over it just gives the little busy symbol mouse pointer, and clicking anywhere in the window makes it go white for a minute before it comes up with the force-close box.</p>

							<p>Sorry to hear that, understood now.</p>
<p>BTW, are you sure you have the Oracle Java JDK 6-32bit installed on your machine? Are you sure that there aren`t any reference for JDK 7 on your machine? Please, be sure to have only the Java 6-32bit and nothing else about it as looks like that it would be a problem with Ti.</p>
<p>Am running out of ideas right now, but feel free to let me know what you get there so I can brainstorm a little more or even someone else jump into here and give some hot-tips about the issue you`re facing now.</p>
<p>Good luck.<br>Rodrigo.</p>

							<p>Yes, it must be 32bit for it to work, so be sure about that as well.</p>

										<p><p>I tried to run it again to identify the file it locked up on, and it was the JDK file, so I went to look what one I had, and I had the 64 bit version. Downloaded the 32bit version myself, but then Titanium wouldn&#39;t run again. Uninstalled and then reinstalled, and it&#39;s currently installing the Android components it needs (on top of the normal Android SDK). I won&#39;t close this off just yet in case it still locks up on me though.</p>

							<p>Great news! Even the &quot;process&quot; not being so excellent as you are going through but definitely it is something &quot;new&quot; on the scenario you were facing isn`t it?</p>
<p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

										<p><p>Well, it froze about 10% of the way through installing the SDK, and ever since I have not been able to do anything since then with it. It freezes within 30 seconds of launching, even after more reinstalls. I am starting to think that because I don&#39;t like trying to code using my laptop, everything is conspiring against me to force the matter haha.</p>
<p>Also - after each time it freezes now, I have to reboot the computer, or I cannot relaunch it.</p>

							<p>Argh…bad news.</p>
<p>So, I do not know what you could do right now besides trying to get rid of every instance of Titanium&#x2F;JDK7, etc and trying again, sorry.</p>
<p>Also, am not a PC user so I think that maybe my info isn`t very right for you I do not know.</p>
<p>There are not &quot;forces&quot; against you (haha), it is just matter of time and getting a &quot;fresh-brain&quot; to get to &quot;see&quot; where the problem might be. ;)</p>
<p>Keep us noticed and am also starting to think a little more about your issue.</p>
<p>Good Luck,<br>Rodrigo.</p>

							<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>I can see it now as being only a &quot;problem&quot; with the Windows OS Registry. I can not imagine anything else than it as I know that many times we &quot;think&quot; that are deleting&#x2F;removing something from the PC, well, many times(if not most) left &quot;things&quot; still into the Registry and so even trying to install from the ZERO, you`ll be not at the zero if you understand what I mean.</p>
