			<h1>How to upgrade an Alloy project</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I started working on an Alloy project a few months ago.  I recently updated Titanium Studio and all related packages.  I am running the latest Titanium SDK (3.4.1 GA) which includes the newest version of Alloy (1.5.1).</p>
<p>I already updated my project&#39;s tiapp.xml to use the latest SDK.  I&#39;m not sure if there is anything else that I need to do in order to upgrade Alloy in my project.</p>
<p>I am concerned that some of the project files may be outdated.  In particular, I see that nothing has been changed in the \plugins\ti.alloy\ folder and the \hooks\alloy.js file still says &quot;Copyright (c) 2012&quot;.  </p>
<p>Aside from updating the SDK version in tiapp.xml, are there any other steps needed to upgrade my Alloy project?  Thanks!</p>

							<p>Alloy versions are usually released in step with the SDK (though the version numbers differ). Updating, either via Studio&#39;s prompts &amp; dialogs or with the npm update command, will install the latest version of the Alloy libraries. You have the latest released version of Alloy. So there&#39;s nothing there for you to update.</p>
<p>As an aside, (and I&#39;m not a lawyer) by international convention, copyrights last the life of the author (Appcelerator, Inc) plus 75 years. Thus there&#39;s not an imperative for the project&#39;s author to go through each of the many files in a project to update a copyright statement for each release. You&#39;re better off looking to the changelog file, or the readme file for version info. Keep in mind that we don&#39;t update any files we don&#39;t have to with each release, to minimize the necessary testing we must do.</p>

										<p><p>@Tim Poulsen - Thanks very much for your reply.  I suspected that there were no special steps involved since I couldn&#39;t find any tutorials on the subject, but I got a little paranoid when I saw the plugin file dated 2012.  I appreciate you clearing that up.</p>

										<p><p>You&#39;re very welcome. We more often get questions about how to not upgrade (because folks fear breaking existing apps). This was an easy one in light of that!</p>
