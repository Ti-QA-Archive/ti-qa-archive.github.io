			<h1>Solution to all sizing problems (labels, etc.) for both Android and iPhone and some personal advices</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>This is not a question, it aims to be a solution. It&#39;s also the result of losing many hours looking for things that should be essential and easy to do and not being able to find them in this forum. In fact, you find tons of times the same very basic question you are posting that has no good answer at all or that has an answer that only works (if it does) for very specific situations.</p>
<p>First one personal advice (i&#39;m really new to titanium so have in mind i&#39;m noob to this platform):<br>If you are planning to make cross platform apps and you want all window animation capabilities and memory and object management for both Android and iPhone, the best way to achieve this is working with only one Window and creating many views in or out of scope,adding and removing them and moving them as needed. Make your custom navigation methods. Avoid using windows in general. And avoid using TableViews if you plan to have a functionality for them that differs from the very very basic one. Design your own scrollviews and row management.</p>
<p>That said lest go with the label sizing problem (or any other sizing problem).<br>Relying in &#39;postlayout&#39; event only works for specific situations and still has a very random,buggy, and different behaviour between platforms, so it does work sometimes but gives you more work and you are never 100% sure. Anyway, it&#39;s sometimes a cheaper solution when it works.</p>
<p>The way to always correctly know the size (height) of a label is (this works for any kind of view too):</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the width property of the label.</li>
<li>Create the label with visible:false, opacity:0 or out of scope.</li>
<li>Add the label to the base Window (the only one you should have).</li>
<li>Store the height of it using var labelHeight=myLabel.toImage().height;</li>
<li>Remove the label from the Window.</li>
<li>Add it elsewhere and make it visible or put it in the desired scope.</li>
</ul>
<p>Doing this in a view or with many windows its not guaranteed to work in all situations and&#x2F;or in all platforms and you&#39;ll have to implement &#39;postlayout&#39; events or other stuff. It only does always work if you add the label directly to a window and when that window is the only one created.</p>
<p>This is the very simple code:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    var textLabel = Titanium.UI.createLabel({
        <span class="hljs-built_in">text</span>:myText,
        <span class="hljs-variable">width</span>: <span class="hljs-built_in">textWidth</span>,
        left: applicationWindowWidth, <span class="hljs-comment">//So its not visible when adding it to the window</span>
    visible: <span class="hljs-keyword">false</span> <span class="hljs-comment">//The other option (opacity:0 is worse in general imo)</span>
    });

    mainWindow.<span class="hljs-built_in">add</span>(textLabel);    
    var textHeight=textLabel.toImage().<span class="hljs-variable">height</span>;
    mainWindow.remove(textLabel);
</code></pre><p>Please vote this so the solution to this problem can be easily found for beginners like me.</p>
<p>Thanks to everybody that helps in this forum and the titanium guys… keep up the work.</p>

							<p>Imanol,</p>
<p>While I applaud your efforts and desire to share your discoveries, I think the solution you propose creates some problems that will trouble you later. I suggest you investigate cross-platform development practices, window layout modes, measurement units, and memory management before posting an idea as a &#39;solution to all ___ problems&#39;. I think you&#39;ll find established techniques for handling the &#39;problems&#39; you&#39;re seeing. </p>
<p>The <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Building_Mobile_Applications_with_Titanium">guides</a> are a great place to start. I also suggest you look into Alloy as a way to build apps that can leverage the best of each platform, while remaining compatible across platforms.</p>

										<p><p>I agree with Tim, you should be applauded for trying to solve every cross platform in one seemingly simple solution - however this is certainly not it.  Most of the cross platform issues are easily resolvable with careful planning to start with and honouring the target platforms unique benefits.</p>
<p>Additionally Imanol, you mention that <code>tableViews</code> should be avoided when in fact they are exceptionally powerful views when created correctly.  And the buggy references can only relate to your current lack of understanding of them.</p>
<p>Read the guides Tim mentions, start looking at Alloy and keep going but this is not the solution you or any one else should use.</p>

										<p><p>Well, i&#39;m just a noob around in titanium, and maybe i talked in a too general way, but i&#39;m very sure about the fact that when trying to solve the label size problem people (beginners) lose lots of time finding it, so if you want to consider this post as a critic to the forum format, that should be the correct way to read this post.<br>And you should consider too that beginner frustration ends in less people hugging your platform.</p>

										<p><p>And another point. What i posted is in fact a very good crossplatform solution for label size problem at least for beginners. A solution you can&#39;t find easily in this forum (you can try and look for it yourself and youll find tons of people asking and not having one answer). One fact is that you decided to vote this post negatively maybe reasonably but it ended with negative votes. What happens then? Beginners will still have a hard time to find this post. The point is… the post voting system you use is negative for you unless your intention is making learning efforts less effective. Beginners make stupid questions but new beginners will keep making them so they need to find why they are wrong and find the solution following that path, path which this voting system cuts.</p>

<p>Let me say that a number of the larger forum contributors originally agreed not to tear your post apart and to let Tim be politely suggest that some, scratch that, <strong>many</strong> of the suggestions listed above are rather deadly and ill conceived. However, as you, an admitted &#39;noob&#39; failed to appreciate the graciousness granted your new status, I believe that that agreement is now off.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Imanol</p>
<p>I think you read our comments as pure negatives, when in fact they were suggesting the opposite.  You are right beginners should be given a starting point and they do - the documentation that contains guides, videos, how-to&#39;s, example code and much more.</p>
<p>The reason you have been marked down by me a several others is your solution is simply wrong, for the right reasons and based on your understanding but still wrong.  There are many Q&amp;A articles that suggest similar approaches, but they are all old and before extensive work was completed in unifying and improving things.</p>
<p>The other thing to remember is beginners are beginners and that means there is still much to learn.  You cannot learn it all start away and all the seasoned people here will agree they also have much to learn as the target is constantly changing.  Cross platform solutions that take into account everything from screen size and dimensions to controls that are different or do not exist on all platforms in one solution is simply not possible.  That is where good code and real experiences of problems and using all the kit for testing comes in.</p>
<p>No-one here, including myself, has suggested; you or your ambition is wrong.  Anyone coming to this question will see that you have been commended - but also this is still the wrong direction to solve this problem.</p>
<p>BTW take a look at the documentation for the following things that will let you handle labels (or most views) on most platforms;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Ti<span class="hljs-class">.UI</span><span class="hljs-class">.FILL</span>
Ti<span class="hljs-class">.UI</span><span class="hljs-class">.SIZE</span>
layout: <span class="hljs-string">'vertical'</span>
layout: <span class="hljs-string">'horizontal'</span>
Different types of measure other than pixels
