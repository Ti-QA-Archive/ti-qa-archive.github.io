			<h1>Need a little help with the basic structure for an app with lots of screens</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m not not 100% clear on how I should structure an application with lots of tabs, and lots of &quot;drill down&quot; screens inside each tab. For an app with multiple tabs and screens it seems that each &quot;screen&quot; inside a tab would be a new window, thus a new execution context, but that seems a bit &quot;heavy&quot; to me. In addition, a new execution context makes it really difficult to add common components like my custom sliding menu and application wide styles via global variables.</p>
<p>I suppose I could just create and destroy views instead of opening new windows, but then I&#39;d also have to create my own navigation bar from scratch, keeping track of each view, creating a &quot;Back&quot; button that goes to the previous view, etc., etc. That also sounds like a lot of unnecessary work, so I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;m just missing something. It seems there should be a way to drill down a series of screens with the nav bar, without opening a new execution context for each one. Am I just missing something fundamental? If so, can someone straighten me out?</p>

							<p>My personal approach to the structure of Titanium apps have changed after I saw how Tweetanium does it. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;122521&#x2F;learning-more-about-titanium---a-reading-list">These articles</a> should clue you in on that paradigm.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re doing iPhone only, you can use <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;latest&#x2F;Titanium.UI.iPhone.NavigationGroup-object.html">Navigation Groups</a>, that&#39;ll take care of the &quot;back&quot; buttons and sending them to the right screens.</p>

										<p><p>I read through that documentation, but I&#39;m unfortunately none the wiser. I&#39;m already using a Tweetanium style structure for my application, which seems to work fine for a sort of front end of my application, where I&#39;m doing nothing but simulating widows by creating and destroying views, but when I actually want to create new windows they still each have their very own execution context (as expected). I therefore completely lose the nice structure I created with the structure.js, ui.js, styles.js, etc., every time I open a window. So, for example, if I want to share a custom slider menu with all windows in my application I have to create that from scratch for every window, and that custom slider I can&#39;t use any of the global context variables I created in structure.js, ui.js and styhles.js. What am I missing?</p>

										<p><p>Actually, I think I figured out what I&#39;m missing. The problem is that I&#39;ve still been trying to open windows using the url parameter, but after studying Tweetanium a bit more I realized I should instead be building the controls for a window and adding them directly, not loading files via the URL. Since my app will have a lot of windows, memory could be an issue, but at least I understand now how to use the global context in windows.</p>

										<p><p>Glad you figured it out, Jude. It&#39;s important to watch out for memory, I don&#39;t think I had any issues with it yet, though - and my application is somewhat larger than Tweetanium.</p>
