			<h1>setting min-ios-version to 5.1 in Titanium 3.2</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am trying to use an ipad 1 for development but am having trouble running my app from an alloy project in Titanium 3.2. The error says to lower the version to 5.1 in the tiapp.xml file, which I have done, but I still get the same error saying that the apps minimum version is set to 6.0.  Is it possible that that gets overwritten somewhere else?  What else can I try?</p>

							<p>ios 5.x support was deprecated in 3.1.x, the 3.2x titanium does not support ios 5 any longer.</p>
<p>the only way to use your ipad1 will be to use Ti 3.1.3 sdk and install a old version of xcode and a old version of the ios sdk, but you will run into a dozens of problems doing that. It will save you time and headaches if you sell your device and buy a newer one. ios 5.x devices (only ipad1&#39;s) have only a market share about 5%, it makes no sense to develop for this 4 year old device today.</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s too bad.  My ipad is only a few years old and already obsolete.  Great for apple&#39;s bottom line, but what a waste of precious resources.  Thanks for your answer.</p>

										<p><p>yes it is a shame apple didn&#39;t spend 50-90 cents more for every ipad1 in production costs and shipped it with 512Mb instead of 256Mb Ram but that&#39;s product politics today. It&#39;s even worse in the android department, when the vendors don&#39;t update the os of their devices for years and therefore making them one of the easiest malware targets in the world.</p>
