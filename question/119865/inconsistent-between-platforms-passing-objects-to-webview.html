			<h1>Inconsistent between platforms: passing objects to webview</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m having an issue that i am hoping someone can shed some light on.</p>
<p>I am working with Titanium Studio, SDK 1.7 and loading to iOS and Android 3.0 (tablets).</p>
<p>For iOS, I can fire an event to the webview that contains a complex object like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">Ti</span><span class="hljs-class">.App</span><span class="hljs-class">.fireEvent</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'myOnloadEvent'</span>, {
    <span class="hljs-attribute">data</span>: [<span class="hljs-string">'data1'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'data2'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'data3'</span>],
    <span class="hljs-attribute">moreData</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'a String'</span>
});
</code></pre><p>When it gets there in iOS, I can use it like an object.  I have access to the data and reference it exactly as a javascript object (ie, <code>e.data</code> is a reference to my array, where <code>e</code> is the event data passed in the fireEvent call).</p>
<p>When i tried to compile this code on the android, it looks like my object is being &#39;stringified&#39; to JSON, and the webview is picking up everything as strings.  they are useless.</p>
<p>To clarify this more, the result of this line, when run in the webview,:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-title">alert</span>('<span class="hljs-typedef"><span class="hljs-keyword">data</span> is ' + typeof e.<span class="hljs-keyword">data</span>);</span>
</code></pre><p>is <code>data is object</code> in iOS, but is <code>data is string</code> in android.  </p>
<p>Am I missing something?  Why are these acting differently?  Every example I see online is passing simple strings and are not helping me to figure this out.  </p>
<p>(Also, I kept the example here simple to get the point across, but I am also passing full object references in my application that are working with iOS and not with android.)</p>

							<div><p>Hm, that&#39;s strange. I had problem with passing arrays … they would become objects and my &quot;isArray&quot; function would fail (I checked if variable constructor property is &quot;Array&quot;). It seems that passing arguments to other contexts (most probably JSON parser) has some bugs in Android.</p>
<p>Anyway, one quick &amp; dirty solution would be to use &quot;eval&quot; function if environment is Android.</p>

							<div><p>Ivan, thanks for getting back to me.  </p>
<p>the problem with the quick and dirty solution (for my purpose) is that I&#39;m pretty invested in my current solution and changing it would be a major overhaul to the design of the datasets i&#39;m passing.</p>

							<p>I have an app I am working on where I am passing a data object to a data plotter which uses raphaeljs on a webview. I use code just like you are when firing the cross context event.<br> I wrote the app before knowing how important it was to test on IOS and Android, as the UI factories are not 100% compatible. I am untangling the code now, and soon will get to the point where the graphing routine is triggered. I&#39;ll report back my results. If indeed the Android Javascript environment reports a string then it must be a bug and I&#39;ll post it to the profesional helpdesk.</p>

										<p><p>Richard, funny you should mention that!  I am doing exactly the same thing with raphael, and that is how i hit this issue.  I was trying to pass data for the X and Y axes of charts, as well the data for the charts itself.</p>
<p>Another one to watch out for, then, is that evalJS seems to evaluate differently on the two platforms.  I had wrap the android version in a <code>webview.evalJS(&amp;#39;function(){ [my working iOS evalJS code]; return</code> &quot;<code>something</code>&quot; <code>}&amp;#39;);</code> in order to have it perform the same as on the iOS.  However, if you are simply calling a function, I believe you can put it directly in the evalJS and I assume it would work fine (like <code>webview.evalJS(&amp;#39;aFunction()&amp;#39;);</code>.  (I was using this to setup an ID for the webpage so i could define eventlisteners specific to that webpage.  I am reusing the webpages for a couple webviews with different charts.)</p>
<p>I was also getting some issues with <code>alert</code>s in the html javascript freezing the application, but that was caused by having 2 webviews stacked on each other, with both sending errors.  Testing with only a single webview instantiated bypassed this issue so i could resolve others.  Hope that helps you some.  I just did the same thing you are doing yesterday.</p>

										<p><p>I need to fix the syntax on that evalJS example I gave.  It should have been a self-evaluating function:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">webview.evalJS(' (<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span>{</span> [my working iOS evalJS code]; return <span class="hljs-string">"something"</span> })() ');
</code></pre><p>because it is wrapped by Titanium (according to the android log output) like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span>{<span class="hljs-keyword">try</span>{<span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> [my working iOS evalJS code]+<span class="hljs-string">""</span>;}<span class="hljs-keyword">catch</span>(ti_eval_err){<span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-string">''</span>;}})()
</code></pre><p>So, from that wrapper i could tell that i had to pass in something that could be appended to the <code>return</code> keyword.  For some reason, I could run code like </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">webview.evalJS('<span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> pageID</span>=<span class="hljs-string">""</span>; setupPageID(<span class="hljs-string">"page1"</span>)');
</code></pre><p>on the iOS and it worked fine… but it wouldn&#39;t work in that Titanium wrapper above.  So i&#39;m assuming that wrapper is an android piece of code?  And the only reason i needed <code>var pageID=</code>&quot;&quot; on the iOS was that the <code>pageID</code> i have defined in my HTML page was not seen when the call was made.  Android did seem to see it so i could simply run the <code>setupPageId</code> function in the <code>evalJS</code>.</p>
<p>This is unrelated to the original post, but i don&#39;t want to put incorrect syntax up in case someone needs it.</p>

										<p><p>The Android part of the project got postponed by having to give priority a desktop version. Will very soon get into this. Might be able to gain some insights from the Pro helpdesk. I&#39;ve noticed already a more inconsistencies on the JSON libraries and pointed the engineer&#39;s attention to it. I&#39;m surprised tif this issue hasn&#39;t been tackled yet on the new sdk&#39;s. In any case, I need to do some more refactoring before I get to the webview and the synthetic events in Android.</p>
