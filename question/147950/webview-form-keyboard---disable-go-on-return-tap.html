			<h1>Webview form keyboard - Disable &#39;Go&#39; on return tap</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a form inside of a webview that my users are going to fill out. When they fill out a text field, the keyboard shows &#39;Go&#39; as the return key. I don&#39;t want them to accidentally submit the form early by hitting &#39;Go&#39; and thinking that it will take them to the next form field. </p>
<p>Is there a setting in the webview or elsewhere that I can disable this functionality?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The short answer is no.</p>
<p>The common and expected solution is to add JavaScript form handling to check for early presses.  You simply create a boolean (yes&#x2F;no) toggle that loops the inputs to make sure you have enough data when a submit is tried.  If not enough, return the submit function with false and update the form to show which fields need information and focus the first required field automatically.</p>
<p>This allows the easiest and smoothest user experience.</p>

										<p><p>Hmm thanks Malcolm. I was afraid of that. I don&#39;t really want to write extra javascript validation for these forms because it&#39;ll need to be dynamic enough to work on any form&#x2F;set of form fields. Wonderful :).</p>

										<p><p>You have not said; Android or iOS but as both have HTML5 you could get a lot of the way there with the extra HTML5 validation features for input fields.  I would try those first, you may be able to get away without JS.</p>

										<p><p>Good point. I haven&#39;t tried the new html5 form validation yet, so I guess this is as good a time as any :).</p>

										<p><p>HTML5 validation is working great so far! I am using the attribute required=&quot;required&quot; on all input&#x2F;select&#x2F;textarea elements and then doing a JavaScript .checkValidity() on the &lt;form&gt; element upon submit. This method works fantastic. &lt;3 HTML5! Thanks again.</p>
