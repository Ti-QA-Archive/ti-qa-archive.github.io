			<h1>KitchenSink Does Not Install on iPad</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I&#39;m using a Mac with OS X version 10.8.4.  I have XCode with the iOS SDK 7 installed.</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to install the latest (I think) KitchenSink on an iPad 2 that has iOS 7.  Titanium builds the app and installs it to iTunes, but the app is never fully installed on the iPad.  The app icon appears on the iPad, but it&#39;s a dark gray color.  When I tap it to launch the app, the title &quot;KitchenSink&quot; changes to &quot;Installing…&quot;  I restarted the iPad and it exhibits the same behavior.  </p>
<p>At first I thought the problem was because I had an older XCode installed (6.1 SDK) but I get the same behavior after installing the latest XCode.</p>
<p>KitchenSink seems to run OK on the iPhone simulator.</p>
<p>In iTunes if I remove the KitchenSink app, the button returns to saying &quot;Install&quot; but the icon is not removed from the iPad.  I have to tap and hold on the iPad icon, then tap the X to remove it from the iPad.</p>
<p>According to iTunes I have over 16 GB of space available, so it&#39;s not a space issue on the iPad.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried this several times and I can&#39;t get it to work.  Any ideas?</p>

							<div><p>stop using iTunes if that gives you a problem (I stopped using it a long time ago). Compile it as ad hoc, and install it manually on your device, either with an OTA link or with the iPhone configuration utility. You&#39;ll get a better feedback on what you may be doing wrong.</p>
<p>Things to look at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is your ad hoc certificate valid?</li>
<li>Is your device included in the ad hoc certificate?</li>
<li>Is the certificate valid for that bundle?</li>
</ul>

							<div><p>Hi Alberto, thank you for the help!</p>
<p>Can you be more specific on how to &quot;compile as ad hoc and install it manually on the device?&quot;  Right now, within Studio, I&#39;m right clicking on the project and selecting &quot;Install on iOS Device…&quot; and letting it go from there. </p>
<p>I&#39;m not familiar with the compile as ad hoc.  Could you please explain?</p>
<p>Thank you!!</p>

							<div><p>It looks like I was using an incorrect provisioning profile (the profile did not include an App ID that matched the KitchenSink app).  I created a new provisioning profile that included the KitchenSink App ID, installed the profile, rebuilt using that new profile, and I get the result.  The app is pushed to the iPad, but can&#39;t be run.</p>
<p>Any other pointers?  I must be missing something but with no feedback or error messages I don&#39;t know where to look.</p>

							<div><p>click on the little brown box next to the debug button, then select Distribute Ad Hoc Enteprise. select where the ipa should be saved to, select the right provisioning (and make sure that the udid of your device is included in it), and save it. Then download the iPhone Configuration Utility <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;kb&#x2F;DL1465">here</a> and install it through that on your device.</p>

							<p>I finally figured out the problem.  The UDID for the iPad I was using was incorrect.  I used an app to give me the UDID, but it was incorrect.  I used the UDID that was listed in iTunes, which also match the ID displayed using the iPhone Configuration Utility.  Once I created and downloaded a new provisioning profile that included the correct UDID for my iPad, it installed correctly.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone for the help!!!</p>

										<p><p>that&#39;s what I thought in the first place :) it&#39;s 90% the cause of an error while installing an app.</p>
