			<h1>App crashes on HTC  G1 with a trackball event</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>A user has reported: &quot;application keeps erroring whenever I touch my HTC G1&#39;s trackball and I am in the name&#x2F;address fields… The application will shut down&quot;</p>
<p>I don&#39;t have a G1. The app works fine on my Droid and others have reported no such problems. I learned you can simulate the trackball in the emulator by holding the Delete key and pressing the arrows. The app doesn&#39;t crash when I do so. </p>
<p>Without this particular phone, how do I test &amp; fix this problem?</p>

<p>There are known issues when the trackball for android is used in certain situations, described in tickets <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32238-titanium-mobile&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;1346">#1346</a>, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32238-titanium-mobile&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;1711">#1711</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32238-titanium-mobile&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;2237">#2237</a>. If you create an account on Lighthouse, you can watch these items, so that you will be emailed whenever any progress is made.</p>
<p>When you say &quot;name&#x2F;address fields&quot;, are you talking about a stardard textField or textArea view in your application, or a native contacts field? If it&#39;s the former, and if it&#39;s feasible, it may be a good idea to find a similar example in the KitchenSink and ask the user to install it and report to you whether a crash occurs. If the specific issue can be demonstrated with the standard KS and isn&#39;t adequately described by the tickets above, it would be good justification for a new ticket.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Hal, shortly after posting this question, I signed up for the pro level membership. They were able to help me track down the issue … I was using a ScrollableView and adding showPagingControl:false to its constructor seemed to fix the issue. There&#39;s no way to close your own questions here, though I should have posted a follow up. Thanks!</p>

							<p>Hi Tim</p>
<p>Yes, it seems like that is related to ticket #2237 that I mentioned. If you or anyone is interested in showing the paging control, it would be worth watching that ticket to keep up to date with its resolution. Anyway, I am glad you found a workaround.</p>
