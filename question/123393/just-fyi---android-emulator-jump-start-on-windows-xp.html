			<h1>Just FYI - Android Emulator Jump Start on Windows XP</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Just a simple discovery I made.  I am running Windows XP and for some reason I just can&#39;t seem to get the android emulator working from Titanium.  I have been all over the posts and have tried everything.  </p>
<p>Titanium ends up not finding my emulator and timing out.  So if all else fails just go to the Android SDK manager, click on the AVD that Titanium created and click the Start button on the right (manually start the emulator).  Then recompile your code and your program will load and run on the already opened emulator.</p>

							<p>Curtis, I had a similar problem just days ago but on Win7.<br>I could run the emulator just fine, but TI would NOT see it. </p>
<p>What worked great for me is: To resolve problem: Open Android SDK Manager and installed ANDROID SDK 2.1-update1 API 7. Using TI Studio open preferences and browse to SDK folder. Now ALL ANDROID SDK versions appear in drop down list and the app runs in the emulator!</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;122998&#x2F;could-not-locate-the-android-sdk-at-the-given-path#214645</p>
<p>There are also some other great ideas that worked for others.<br>Best of luck!</p>

										<p><p>Hey Joe, </p>
<p>Thanks for the information, I just verified that I have all packages installed in the android SDK manager including the SDK Platform Android 2.1 update1, API 7, revision 3.  </p>
<p>The interesting thing is that a virtual device is created with Titanium in the android SDK manager but titanium does not go any further than that, it just times out with 0 devices&#x2F;emulator found. I have also included the adb.exe, AdbWinApi.dll and the AdbWinUsbApi.dll as others have done in other posts.  I guess this was my last ditch effort after I had tried everything else. </p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Curtis</p>
