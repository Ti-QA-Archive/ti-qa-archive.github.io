			<h1>Push notification callback when app is in background/killed</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I want to know if a custom message sent in Push notification can be accessed all the time, regardless of the state of the app(not opened&#x2F; opened-foreground&#x2F; opened-background).</p>
<p>I know that the callback will be fired when the app is in foreground.</p>
<p><strong>I want to confirm if the callback will be fired even when the app is in background, running&#x2F;killed</strong></p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The reason for my comment earlier is to make sure that people actually perform tests themselves before asking questions.  You passed my tests.</p>
<p>The call back does not run when the app is not running - annoying - but try.</p>

										<p><p>Is there a way to receive notifications when the application is killed then? Using a background service that listens for the notifications maybe rather than the application itself?</p>

										<p><p>No - as any background service would only run when the app is running but not actually active.  If the app &quot;…is killed…&quot; then it is not running.</p>
