			<h1>Plans &amp; Pricing</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I notice that there are new Plans &amp; Pricing on the site - but no mention of the old &#39;Indie&#39; plan? So, (as I am on the Indie plan) what do I get - or what is the equivalent plan in terms of Cloud, Support, Analytics and &#39;Enterprise Extensions&#39; (whatever they are?).</p>
<p>Thanks, Chris.</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;d really like to know what this all means as my &quot;Indie&quot; sub has just expired - and before I renew it, I&#39;d like to make an informed choice</p>
<p>But, despite filling out the on-line sales form and replying to an email about my renewal, I have had no response after several days other than an email asking for my location.</p>
<p>Why can&#39;t the website tell us what the plans cost at the very least!</p>

							<div><p>Well, the answer is - it costs a lot. You are looking at well over 10x the cost of an &quot;Indie&quot; subscription. It is a different proposition, but apparently there&#39;s no option to have anything less any more.</p>

<p>Yes I did. Basically you are now looking at $5000.00 a year minimum. Yes - read those zeros. It does include a lot of training and the promise of commercial leads pushed your way, but I reckon this is pretty steep!</p>
<p>I explained that this was not an option for me being a sole-trader and so I&#39;d just renew my Indie subscription as per the invoice they had sent me for $399. The sales manager informed me that she didn&#39;t think they were allowing any of the old subscription plans any more, but would ask her MD. I was then told that they would allow me to renew, but that it would definitely only be for one more year and would cost $499. When I protested that I already had an invoice for $399, they pretty much said &quot;take it or leave it&quot; - with a subtext of &quot;think yourself lucky&quot;. </p>
<p>In all honesty, I nearly told them where to put it - but, right now I have an important Android  job that needs regular updates - so due to the fact that I have no idea what would happen if I suddenly lost access to the free modules that come with the Indie Subscription, I have coughed up the money and swallowed the 25% hike as well.</p>
<p>I really feel as though they have me by the b@lls at the minute and that I should be looking at alternative ways to develop apps - even if it means a whole lot of wasted time learning the API etc.</p>
<p>The UK sales manager was pretty apologetic about the options available to us Sole Traders and did say that they would be reviewing the options soon, but right now its £xpen$ive and Appcelerator don&#39;t seem to care about us small fish - which I feel is huge mistake.</p>

							<div><p>Wow… I&#39;m in the same boat as you… independent app developer… currently Indie… not sure what will happen when I go to renew… This doesn&#39;t seem to jive with some of the other information posted in the forums by the US group. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;137346&#x2F;pricing-changes-from-20">check this out</a></p>
<p>Not sure what you would be getting for the extra $$ either… The sales information on the site is very vague and is frustrating to figure out.</p>

							<div><p>TBH I don&#39;t object to them charging whatever they want for whatever level of support they want to offer - it is their business model and in fairness, you can build apps for free and sell for $$$.</p>
<p>BUT - I do object to being sold a particular subscription &quot;pack&quot; than included &quot;goodies&quot; such as modules that suddenly and without warning gets pulled and replaced with something costing 10x as much.</p>
<p>It may well have worked out better for me to go &quot;free&quot; and pay the per month fees for modules - but the info is so vague, I just didn&#39;t want to take any chances that my App would suddenly stop working while I am in mid development. I know that the fee structure for modules means that once Published, the fee no longer need apply - but this particular app gets updated and published as an Android APK directly to the client on a Weekly and sometimes daily basis (due to the constant way it is being developed and used). And the way I was being dealt with suggested that the Indie subscription was being offered as a &quot;favour&quot; and wouldn&#39;t be there if I waited to decide.</p>

							<p>At the end of the webinar, they said although new Indie (or Pro etc) subscriptions are available, those who already have one may continue to renew under their current terms and remain an Indie (or whatever).</p>
<p>But I have no idea what Indie or other older plans get in terms of ACS volumes, etc.</p>
<p>Hopefully more plans &amp; pricing data will be available soon, because I am sure there are many of us who will soon be facing the decision of whether to renew or change plans.</p>

							<p>Also, the new pricing says that it is based on PER APP which is also a new thing. I&#39;ve filled out the form for sales about the pricing of the other packages else than the free option but haven&#39;t heard back yet.</p>

										<p><p>Well, it says &quot;per application&quot; which could be referring to the application FORM - ie they decide on what to charge depending on what your requirements are based on your application for their service.</p>
<p>Or it could be per App - who knows, the whole thing is ambiguous - I mean what does <strong>Appcelerator Enterprise Extensions Security element included, access to additional enterprise extensions</strong> actually mean anyway?</p>
