			<h1>The executable .app is not a Position Independent Executable</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Yesterday I submitted an app and everythig went correctly. Today I was submitting another app and I got a message informing me that my binary is invalid. In iTunes Connect does not give further information but I got a message informing me of the following:</p>
<hr>
<p>Dear developer,<br>We have discovered one or more issues with your recent delivery for &quot;your app&quot;. To process your delivery, the following issues must be corrected: </p>
<p>iPhone 5 Optimization Requirement - Your binary is not optimized for iPhone 5. As of May 1, all new iPhone apps and app updates submitted must support the 4-inch display on iPhone 5. All apps must include a launch image of the appropriate size. Learn more about iPhone 5 support by reviewing the iOS Human Interface Guidelines. </p>
<p>Invalid Launch Image - Your app contains a launch image with a size modifier that is only supported for apps built with the iOS 6.0 SDK or later. </p>
<p>Though you are not required to fix the following issues, we wanted to make you aware of them:</p>
<p>Non-PIE Binary - The executable &#39;Dance Club.app&#39; is not a Position Independent Executable. Please ensure that your build settings are configured to create PIE executables. </p>
<p>Once the required corrections have been made, go to the Version Details page and click &quot;Ready to Upload Binary.&quot; Continue through the submission process until the app status is &quot;Waiting for Upload.&quot; You can then deliver the corrected binary.</p>
<hr>
<p>We are compiling with the SDK 2.1.4GA but we got the same message compiling with the 3.0 sdk. My Xcode version is 4.2</p>
<p>Has anyone come across such a message? Does any body know how to work around or solve this problem?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Miguel</p>

<p>This one I have NEVER seen, and google only brings up one slightly related link dealing with an adobe phonegap&#x2F;flash&#x2F;builder problem.</p>

<p>Placing a 640x1156 sized Default-568h@2x.png in your Resources&#x2F;iphone folder will probably resolve this one. Will need to build with a newer sdk.</p>

<p>Just changing the Ti SDK doesnt change the target ios sdk.  Be sure you are targeting a 6.x ios sdk in your build settings.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Can you confirm you have the following images and they are the following sizes;</p>
<ul>
<li>Default.png [320x480]</li>
<li>Default@2x.png [640x960]</li>
<li>Default-568h@2x.png [640x1136]</li>
</ul>
<p>Assuming this app was not done using any Alloy, these files should be located here;</p>
<ul>
<li>{app name}&#x2F;resources&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;</li>
</ul>

							<p>Hello,</p>
<p>you can see how to enable the PIE binary within xcode <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;antid0te.com&#x2F;CSW2012_StefanEsser_iOS5_An_Exploitation_Nightmare_FINAL.pdf">here</a>. </p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro </p>
<p>Ps. i.e., you will need to configure your project in the xcode to produce the PIE binary.</p>

										<p><p>@Mauro I think this needs more explanation than this - is there something @Miguel and the rest of us have to do before apps will now be accepted?  I would have thought this sort of things would have been mentioned to us - so how come this has not worked here?</p>

										<p><p>Hello Malcolm, </p>
<p>PIE is not required to publish an app, AFAIK. It&#39;s just a recommendation. There is no manual about &quot;How to guarantee that your app will be accepted in the Apple Store&quot;, since it depends on the criteria of the person who checks your app. </p>
<p>I have seen apps that get approved like a snap because of a lazy engineer checking them, and others that get a lot of fire without need. </p>
<p>The apple way, I guess.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro</p>
