										<p><p>Thank You…</p>
<p>Seems like the Android Market is going to be tough. My app isn&#39;t appearing in the list when I search on &#39;coffee&#39;.  Maybe they do some indexing overnight.</p>

										<p><p>Do you have a link on how you you were able to sign your app?  I always had trouble getting my package signed, so I just gave up on the Android market and went with straight iOS…so now I have 4 builds of apps just sitting around not making any money.</p>
