		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Application Type: IOS App ( not using Titanium )</p>
<p>I am using the ACS and really learning a lot. I need to know that , is there any way to fetch a feed of all people i&#39;m following ( or friend with ) ? One example is a facebook style newsfeed or twitter like status updates . Right now , i couldn&#39;t find any predefined class to do this work . </p>
<p>Looking forward to learn.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Taha</p>

							<p>Hi Nick , </p>
<p>Thanks for the answer but this is not what i am looking for . The two classes that you mentioned can be used to create the post or&#x2F;and status but what i am looking for is the the news feed. The newsfeed covers all the new posts that my friends post . You can take the example of any good social app lile twitter , vine , facebook , instagram. The very tab of these apps contains the new items&#x2F;posts&#x2F;photos that their friends are posting. </p>
<p>Thanks .</p>

										<p><p>So, you just query your friends and read their posts, or statuses and construct a news feed yourself. The building blocks are all there but if you are looking for something already written, then sorry I dont know of one</p>

							<p>Thanks , </p>
<p>Yes , i am looking for the pre-written &#x2F;feed class. </p>
<p>Going through every friend and see what new they post is really not efficient. I would request this class to be added as soon as possible because it is a primary building block of any social app. Without the feed , whats the point of following someone or &#x2F;friend class. We follow friends , so new posts&#x2F;content from them pushed to us through the feed page.  </p>
<p>Can you guide me on how to request this feature to ACS development team ? </p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>You dont need to go through each feed neccessarily. For example, you could maintain a special list of posts to which you save when the user saves their own post &#x2F; like &#x2F; status etc.  Then you get a feed that it added to by everyone in chronological order.</p>

										<p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Have you done something like this before ? I mean did you experiment this idea ? </p>
<p>I think all i can do is to add the Likes to user likes as well as custom object field.</p>
