			<p>Abit lost at the moment in a world of recording formats and thought i would ask for some advice.</p>
<p>I am building a recording app at the moment with titanium which works great.</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Media-property-AUDIO_FORMAT_LINEAR_PCM</p>
<p>I am using the following compression and format</p>
<p>recording.compression = Ti.Media.AUDIO_FORMAT_LINEAR_PCM;<br>recording.format = Ti.Media.AUDIO_FILEFORMAT_WAVE;<br>Problem i am having is the size of the recordings are hug and when i upload them to my server a 5min recording can be over 1gig which i can then compress but i am looking to record up to 1 hour.</p>
<p>Has anyone got some sound advice on this regarding the best formats to use for quality and compression i would really appreciate it</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>Why not use mp3? Wav files are like the original windows format media filetype.  They are always extremely large and somewhat &quot;clunky&quot;  I bet if you changed the format to mp3, your file would drop by half, if not more.</p>

										<p><p>Gotcha … Welp, WAV and AIFF are both uncompressed, which is why the WAV file is so large.  If you don&#39;t want to lose the quality, I think you&#39;re stuck with the massive files of WAV.  I think no matter what you try to do, as long as you stick with WAV, you screwed on always having a large file size.</p>

										<p><p>Ok thanks paul its not the end of the world just means huge upload times when sending a 30-60 minute recording to the server, i suppose it also relies on the quality of microphone.</p>

							<p>Hello,<br>you can use AUDIO_FILEFORMAT_MP4A or AUDIO_FILEFORMAT_MP3, this will result in smaller size in the file. As you know, the quality won&#39;t be the same as the LINEAR PCM; you can&#39;t have both. :(</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro</p>
