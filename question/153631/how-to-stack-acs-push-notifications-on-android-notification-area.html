			<h1>How to stack ACS push notifications on Android notification area</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Every ACS push message received adds a new notification in the notification drawer, even when they are sent through the same channel. I want the first push message to be listed in the notification area, but the next ones to be stacked over the first notification, maybe showing an increasing number that shows how many notifications are stacked in one place.</p>
<p>I need this for a chat app. Every message sent with Cloud.createChat() has the &#39;channel&#39; and &#39;payload&#39; properties set, so the receiver is push notified when someone chats to him. But every new message creates a new notification in the notification drawer. That is not the desired behavior. There should be just one notification view per chat.</p>
<p>If the app is running in background, the CloudPush callback is not fired until the app is focused. So It cant do nothing with notifications like cancelling or hiding some of them.</p>
<p>Is there a way to stack up notifications of the same kind in the notification drawer with Titanium?</p>
<p>Titanium SDK 3.0.2<br>Android 4.2.2 and 2.3</p>

							<div><p>OK. But that is an undesired behavior in my app. The problem is how to stack multiple notifications over the first one. I know this has to be made grammatically, but how can it be done if the callback is only called when the app is in the foreground?</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;ve been trying with Titanium Android services (in javascript). The service successfully subscribes to push channels, but the callback is never executed. Has anyone done this before? I&#39;ll keep trying.</p>

							<div><p>Hi, did you find a solution? If not, I&#39;m debating on whether I will have to save previous notifications to a list and append to the new notification as one large string before adding it notification manager. Then I&#39;ll have to have a reset once the app is loaded or resumed…an easier solution would be better :)</p>
