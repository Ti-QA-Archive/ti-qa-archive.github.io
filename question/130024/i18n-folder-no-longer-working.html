			<h1>i18n folder no longer working</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>For some reason, I come back to my working app to add more features and when testing the application I can&#39;t seem to load the i18n folder… all I can see are the names of the variables (like I don&#39;t have the localization files in there)</p>
<p>See this for an example <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cl.ly&#x2F;3W3f0v2s1O1Z0p423v32">screenshot 1</a> everything is right where is supposed to be, this is a working app I wanted to update.. I am using the latest stable version of Xcode, titanium studio and the 1.7.5 titanium SDK</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<div><p>Freshly generated project for me seems to be working with Studio and 1.7.5 and 1.8.0.1 both.  AS indicated before the clean build typically will cause Titanium to analyze your project and process your i18n files.  During the clean build, do you see the message &quot;Compiling localization files&quot; in the log output?</p>

							<p>Raul,</p>
<p>Take a look at this thread, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;129657&#x2F;stringsxml-not-working-in-versions-176-and-above">stringsxml-not-working-in-versions-176-and-above</a> and see if it applies to your situation.  If it does, maybe a ticket needs to be opened.</p>
