			<p>Hello, </p>
<p>I want to scroll in an iOS app when animating an image like in the app in the video or in the Spotify app. Unfortunately I do not know how to do that. Can anyone help me? No Alloy please :-)</p>

<p>Thanks Andy</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>There are a few animations going on there so having to guess which one - assuming it is the parallax one that appears first.</p>
<p>The user scrolls the scrollView upwards and the header image at the top moves at a different speed to the scrollView itself.  Although the second animation is similar as it does not animate the top header image but does animate a top button until it locks in place.</p>
<p>The logical thought here would be that the header image and the lockable button are NOT linked to the scrollView and are in fact at the same parent level as the scrollView.  When the scrollVIew scrolls you listen for the &#39;scroll&#39; event and then update the position of the header view and button to show those effects.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Parallax </p>
<p>Simply shows two or more views that move an different rates to give the effect the top most moves over the next one down faster than the top most one.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Locked button</p>
<p>This is moved at the same speed (y positions match when scrolling) until the scrollView reaches a certain value (would be a minus number - 100 to 150 on that video) when it reaches that number or lower then the button stops moving and is locked to the top position, when scrolled down again if higher than that number simply anchor back as it was before.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The scrollView would likely have a layout property set to vertical to allow the other child elements display.  The very first child object would have a top (margin) equal to the image header header in the first example and equal to both image header and button height in the second example.</p>
<p>I am sorry I do not have any sample code to show.</p>

<p>Thank you. Parallax was a good keyword. Have a module found this: </p>
