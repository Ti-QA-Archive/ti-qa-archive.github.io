							<p>I&#39;m pretty sure the latest version of Wunderlist is not done with Titanium. There was a mentioning of &quot;now native&quot; in the update description and there also is no folder named after the application id in the filesystem (by which I usually identify Titanium apps)</p>

										<p><p>@Kathrin you are right it says &quot;now native&quot; in update notes. I wonder what made them moved away from using titanium.</p>

										<p><p>Developing for Android and iPhone in parallel myself, I can only guess that they weren&#39;t happy with the performance&#x2F;stability. I think Titanium works pretty well for iPhone, but trying to get things working for Android is often so frustrating, you have to make too many compromises and you&#39;re never quite happy with the result (just talking about my personal experience here). The only thing that keeps me going is the thought, that it can only get better ;).</p>
