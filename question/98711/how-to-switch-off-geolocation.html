			<h1>How to switch off geolocation</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;m using simple geolocation call on the iPhone by calling <code>Titanium.Geolocation.getCurrentPosition</code> to get the current position. </p>
<p>I can see the geolocation icon in the status bar when I  call the above function.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not using any event listeners because I&#39;m only getting a one off location reading.</p>
<p>My question is how do I switch geolocation off when I&#39;m finished using it?</p>

							<p>I was having the same problem for a few weeks and I finally got around to looking into the issue today. While trying to find a solution I found this thread and thought I&#39;d post the solution I figured out.</p>
<p>BEFORE you remove mapview from the window (or however you&#39;re leaving mapview), set the userLocation to false. So when you&#39;re closing mapview, add the following to the event listener:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">mapview.userLocation=<span class="hljs-literal">false</span>;
</code></pre><p>This will remove the geo icon from the iPhone top bar.</p>
<p>I know it&#39;s 2 months late, but hopefully this helps!</p>

							<p>if you have not created any listeners, you do not need to do anything, it will switch itself off… that is my interpretation of the code.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the response Aaron, I appreciate it. </p>
<p>However the geolocation icon on the status bar still persists long after the call. This indicates that geo is turned on, correct?</p>
<p>My real problem is that when I do a call to <code>getCurrentPosition</code> when that icon appear, it takes like 2 minutes to return. The first time calling this function works instantaneously, so I&#39;m thinking the problem might be because geo is already turned on and that is what&#39;s causing the long delay.</p>

										<p><p>Ok, on further investigation, the persistent geo icon is not due to <code>getCurrentPosition</code> but because in the callback of that function I opened a mapView with the property <code>userLocation</code> was set to true.</p>
<p>It seems that you can&#39;t switch this off when it is switched on by mapView, even the kitchen sink app behaves this way.</p>

										<p><p>It&#39;s actually a new issue&#x2F;question, to summarize, once you use mapView with the property <code>userLocation</code> set to <code>true</code>, there does not seem to be a way to switch off the iPhone&#39;s geolocation feature (as shown by the location services icon in the status bar).</p>

							<p>This bug can be simulated using Kitchen Sink.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <strong>Phone-&gt;Geolocation</strong>, observe that the coords appears.</li>
<li>Now open <strong>Base UI-&gt;Views-&gt;Map View</strong>, observe that the GPS icon appears on the status bar</li>
<li>Open <strong>Phone-&gt;Geolocation</strong> again, observe that the coords now does not appear.</li>
</ol>

										<p><p>i would not use kitchen sink as proof of a bug. My suggestion would be to create a small test project and then log a bug in lighthouse if you believe there is an issue</p>
