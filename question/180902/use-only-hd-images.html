		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am new to mobile and titanium development. I target both iOS and Android.<br>I use &quot;dp&quot; as the default unit.<br>My concern is regarding using different image sizes for the same image.</p>
<p>I want to aford the need to deal with several image resolutions and several folder images in Titanium for ldpi, mdpi, hdpi.<br>Is it possible to use only HD images (hdpi) and let Titanium resize them for lower resolution devices using ImageView ?<br>Is it a good solution to put hdpi images in the root ressource folder and use dp units to have the same layout for all devices ?</p>
<p>I have already read the following posts but I do not have my answer.<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;153558&#x2F;where–how-to-use-images–icons-density-specific-in-android<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;148337&#x2F;how-to-achieve-same-layout-for-android-and-iphone-using-titanium<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;149743&#x2F;images-in-android.html#answer-258910</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The short answer is; no.</p>
<p>Whilst you can technically do this - you will be providing a poor experience to your users and memory management problems to smaller devices.</p>
<p>In order to show and image or any size it needs to be rendered - so if you are showing smaller versions of larger images the larger image still needs to be in memory - so smaller devices with lower amount of memory will run out much much sooner as they have a much high burden to simply display a single image.</p>
<p>Making your app look and act the same way across iOS and Android is also not a good plan as the users of those devices have expectations created by the operating system they are using in how things should be done.  Tabs, navigations, how windows are shown and back buttons are all examples of things that appear they same but are very different in operation and experience.</p>
<p>Using dp (which is the best plan) will give you a consistent method to layout out your apps but it will NOT make the apps have the same aspect ratio or even sizes - just the same measuring method.  For example the iPhone 4s, 5s, 6 &amp; 6+ have different aspect ratios from each other and varying different resolutions.  The dp width of the iPhone 4s &amp; 5s is 320, but the iPhone 6 width is 375 - you have 55 more dp units to fill - stretching is a bad idea - you should make use of the extra space available.</p>
<p>Doing these thing and doing them properly does take planning - but it will make your app much better for your users and a more robust and pleasant experience for them.</p>
<p>Here are a few links to earlier answers I have given to add to the information you already have on dp, cross platform layouts, image handling and more.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;148337&#x2F;how-to-achieve-same-layout-for-android-and-iphone-using-titanium.html#answer-256884">How to achieve same layout for Android and iPhone using Titanium</a></li>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;149743&#x2F;images-in-android.html#answer-258910">images in Android</a> (also iOS)</li>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;176516&#x2F;images-path---android-vs-ios-alloy.html#answer-281165">Images path - Android vs iOS (Alloy)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind using Titanium with the Alloy framework is now the preferred method, so the 3rd link updates the references in the first 2.  Also the iPhone 6 &amp; 6+ have been released since so update yourself on the revised resolutions and that there is now a retina x3 requirement as well.</p>
