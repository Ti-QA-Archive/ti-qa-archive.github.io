			<p>Does anyone know if it&#39;s possible to use openlayers javascript library in TI mobile?  I&#39;ve tried an include of the OpenLayers.js and I get memory problems on the emulator.  I <strong>don&#39;t</strong> want to use openlayers in a webview, that works ok but is sluggish.  I would like to use openlayers natively if possible.   Thanks in advance!</p>

							<p>I worked with openlayers in a webview only. It&#39;s a pain.<br>To make it work in Ti natively you would need to heavy modify it to use imageviews instead of DOM elements.<br>Is doable but there is much work to do.<br>I&#39;m still concerned on the performance though, because android is pretty stupid when is about images (on the load part, you might end with sluggish movements too) and how the scrollview control has only one direction to scroll ( horizontal OR vertical, not both) you would have to control yourself the touchmove part.</p>

							<p>Thanks Dan,  I guessed it wouldn&#39;t be easy.  The webview performance using sencha touch is not unusable just a little slow, which depends upon your data connection. I used the openlayers example with sencha touch and zooming and panning was ok, but I&#39;m used to a faster browser experience.  Thanks anyway, I&#39;ll continue with webviews for now.</p>

										<p><p>I used it with OL only, no sencha or other stuff. OL is heavy enough for a mobile device so I did everything else native and used cross-app events.<br>It was working nice, only that on some low end or older devices (htc hero for example) was somehow slow.<br>But I&#39;ll never repeat the experience. It was too painful :)</p>
