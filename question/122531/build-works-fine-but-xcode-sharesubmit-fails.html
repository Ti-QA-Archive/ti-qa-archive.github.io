			<p>I have got a problem with one of the apps I made with Appcelerator. It does build fine for the simulator, for iOS device and also for distribution, so no problems here. After the build for distribution, xCode opens as expected, I also see the newly created archive, so I click on it, use share or submit and after selecting iOS App Store Package the right identity I get this error message:</p>
<p>&quot;The operation couldn´t be completed. No such file or directory&quot;.</p>
<p>Since it works fine with other projects I made in the past, I wonder where I could start looking, but maybe somebody has a hint for me?</p>
<p>thanks!</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve had this happen when somehow the mobile provisioning file that is selected no longer exists in the MobileProvision folder.  I used XCode to remove the mobile provisioning files and redownloaded them from Apple Dev Center, re-added them to XCode and then re-added them through the TI Studio package app screen.</p>

										<p><p>well I tried a lot of things, in the end I deleted the project, created a new one and put all the files from the Resources directory back. After that it worked again. Strange error. I dug around a lot with codesign in the command line and well, I was not able to fix the problem the manual way.</p>
