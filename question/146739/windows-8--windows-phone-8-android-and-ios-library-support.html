			<h1>Windows 8 , windows phone 8, android and ios library support</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Understand that Titanium is able to support mobile application development for windows 8, windows phone 8, android and ios. Would like to know whether we need to take note on the UI look and feel while developing the interface for windows 8, windows phone 8, android and ios. Or that there is a generic API provide libraries that translate the generic code to the respective native devices (look and feel)? In another words, how do we develop a platform agnositc look and feel for an application   (this is because the windows phone 8 metro style is very different from android and ios, furthermore the resolution of windows phone 8 and windows 8 are different. Worst, the code use for windows 8 cannot be reuse totally in windows phone 8). What library or framework are to be included and what we need to take note while developing.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Whilst support for windows 8 and windows phone 8 are coming, currently this is not the case. It may be a few months before a public release is available.</p>
<p>As to which libraries will be available - that is not known until the actual release.</p>
<p>Creating platform independent code for true cross platform apps is possible even though as you say the windows version are so different in appearance.</p>
<p>Take a look at the similarities;</p>
<ul>
<li>tables are there</li>
<li>windows are there</li>
<li>animations and transitions as well</li>
<li>buttons, switches, sliders and alerts all there</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
<p>They may look different and some may have some differences but when you remove the visual aspect you are looking at the same basic view&#x2F;control.  Take a table, it is still the sum of its rows which is the sum of its contents which react to touch events - same for all.</p>
<p>The underlying logic code - this also remains the same, a function to work out the distance between two points would be the same on both.</p>
<p>So we are now down to MOSTLY visual differences, we have those with android and iOS, maybe not as starkly obvious but still we already work through those.</p>
<p>To start getting ready I would suggest you start looking into and using</p>
<ul>
<li>CcmmonJS; specifically placing code in platform specific folders, this is where you create the same functions with the same calling and return parameters but each platform specific version does the best for that platform visually</li>
<li>Alloy; this is where things are going for titanium, true MVC so you logic, views and styles are separated, this means you can leave the differences to the visuals only in most cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this answers your questions.</p>

										<p><p>Yes metro style (or whatever MS lands on as a name) apps are planned rather than desktop apps.  This is due to the close design similarity and language underpinnings as the windows mobile and other platforms Appcelerator support.  Keep in mind we are months off a public version so everything is subject to change.</p>

										<p><p>Whilst it does not say it specifically the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thinkmobile.appcelerator.com&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;bid&#x2F;236017&#x2F;Appcelerator-Empowers-the-Mobile-Developer-Community-With-Even-More-Choice-and-Flexibility">press release</a> does say;</p>
<p><em>Developers will also be able to easily translate previously built iOS and Android applications to the Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8 platforms.</em></p>
<p>So I would guess yes as metro style tablets are a Windows 8 platform.</p>

							<p>Thanks Malcolm.</p>
<p>Understand that Titanium support for windows 8 and windows phone 8 are coming, would like to know what type of application will Titanium support ? Will the Metro style application be supported (for cross platform development to various devices)</p>

										<p><p>Quick tip; please comment on answers rather than create a whole new answer which is really a comment - it makes it harder in the future to work out threads if answers scores change or other answers are added. (You are not being told off)</p>
