			<h1>Filter search by beginnig of word?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>You can use a searchBar to filter the contents of a tableView by assigning the searchBar&#39;s name as the &quot;search&quot; property of the tableView, as explained for example <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;113161&#x2F;hide-tableviewrow-title-or-explain-tableview-searchbar-to-me">here</a>. But, the contents are filtered so that the matched string can be in <strong>any</strong> position of the word, and I have not found a way to alter that.</p>
<p>Is it possible that only the elements that match the query string at the <strong>beginning</strong> of the word are shown? So that, for example, if I write &quot;pa&quot; in the searchBar, only the elements of the tableView whose filterAttribute begins <strong>begin</strong> with &quot;pa&quot;, like &quot;<strong>pa</strong>rts&quot; or &quot;<strong>pa</strong>ranoia&quot; will be shown, while those that contain this string in the middle of the word, like &quot;s<strong>pa</strong>re&quot; or &quot;com<strong>pa</strong>rison&quot;, will be hidden.</p>

							<p>I&#39;d say since you don&#39;t have a filter function to check for validity you&#39;d have to clone the original array you&#39;re using, use it as the source for the table view, catch the &quot;change&quot; event for the searchBar, and then clear the array and insert only elements that match your search criteria to it, then add it again as the tableview source.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, I already tried to go that way, but I ran into some problems (the &quot;old&quot; rows weren&#39;t hiding and the &quot;new&quot; ones weren&#39;t showing up, I guess I was doing something wrong but I couldn&#39;t find it out what) and temporarily gave it up.</p>
<p>Then as I kept up thinking that there may probably be a more simple and clean way to do this, I finally decided to ask here, but well, there may be not such a thing implemented yet in the end. Thanks for your answer anyway!</p>

										<p><p>have you used setData on the tableview, to bind the new array?</p>

										<p><p>I had had problems with using setData in another piece of code on the same tableView, the old rows leaving a kind of &quot;trace&quot; of their borders and, sometimes, finally crashing the app. I have to say that the tableView is a little big, like 500 rows with a small text and an image each. Finally I could overcome this issue by using two different tableViews and switching their visibilty. This worked pretty well, so I tried to apply the same method to this case too. But here I couldn&#39;t sort it out.</p>
<p>Anyway, I can try again at some moment, it&#39;s just that it was worth it to ask if I had missed something before wasting more hours with this apparently simple thing…</p>

										<p><p>an off topic remark, having 500 rows in a single table is not recommended by any standard. I&#39;d recommend using paging, or load-on-demand (for example, when reaching the bottom of the tableview, load an extra 25 results or so)</p>
