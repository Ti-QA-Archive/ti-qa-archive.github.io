			<h1>Window is not getting painted completely in mobileweb</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, I am developing a Titanium application that use mobile web navigation group and tab group.  When ever I navigate from one window to another window I am adding all the windows to the navigation stack. I am using a window which consists of text fields,labels and scroll view which I am not adding to the navigation stack. I mean in the table add event listener I am opening a window which is not added to the navigation stack. I am using the same scenario in iphone. I mean using navigation group and tab group. The problem is in the table add eventlistener when I open the window which is not adding to the navigation stack it is not painting properly. I mean when I open this window the tab group should not be displayed. But at the bottom of the window the tabgroup is getting displayed. I tried using </p>
<p>tabgroup.hide() when this window is opened. The tab group is hiding but in place of that I am visible with black space. I tried using Ti.UI.FILL for window height. Even though it didn<code>t work. Finally the window is not getting painted completely till the bottom of the screen. I tried using modal:true while opening the window. But didn</code>t work. Can anyone share the solution ASAP why it is happening in mobile web.</p>
<p>Thanks in Advance…</p>

							<div><p>Hi Barber,  I am using window which is opened  in mobile web navigation group. In that window I am having a table. In the table addEventlistener I am opening another window. But the another window which I am opening is not adding into navigation group.  I am able to open the window perfectly. But the problem is when I execute the code in Android device browser the window is not getting painted completely through out the screen. That means I am getting some black space below the window. This is the issue I am facing. Can you share a possible solution ASAP…</p>
