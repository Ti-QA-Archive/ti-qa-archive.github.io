			<h1>Animations abort in iOS 5</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>when I try to do a second animation after the first has finished, the second animation won&#39;t animate but instead jump to the endstate of the animation.</p>
<p>Is this an iOS 5 Problem, or has this occured to someone somewhere else too?</p>
<p>best regards, Tom</p>

										<p><p>Sure, but this really is a general problem. One example:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">arrow</span><span class="hljs-class">.animate</span>({<span class="hljs-tag">right</span><span class="hljs-pseudo">:-80</span>, <span class="hljs-tag">duration</span><span class="hljs-pseudo">:300</span>}, <span class="hljs-tag">function</span>(){

										<p><p>Hmm.. I just tried a similar callback animation, sliding a view off screen then back on again and it seemed to work fine. (iOS5 on iPad2) </p>
<p>Also tried a few other combinations and it was also ok. Have you tried doing a full rebuild? </p>
<p>Are your &#39;slider&#39; and &#39;arrow&#39; objects simple?</p>

										<p><p>Hmm.. very odd then. I have two views, one with a scrollView and a big text label in it and another with a resizing imageView in it. </p>
<p>Are those animation calls within a click event brace or out in another function? Is it all in a &#39;simple&#39; window script, or out of scope somehow?  (not explaining what I mean here very well ;) ) </p>
<p>Try building a simple new app project and try to do a simple example of what you&#39;re trying to do. If it works, then the issue in your main app might be elsewhere.</p>

										<p><p>Could be. Though. mine actually fire from a swipe, which i&#39;s actually expect to cause more problems, since the swipe event fires many times. But it&#39;s ok. </p>
<p>I would build a small test app and work up from there.</p>

										<p><p>Aha. The problem only occurs in TableViewRows. wrapping a View around the elements that are to be animated doesn&#39;t help unfortunately</p>

							<p>Ok solved it. The problem occurs when there are 2 animated elements put directly into a TableViewRow. Wrapping a View around the elements helps.</p>
