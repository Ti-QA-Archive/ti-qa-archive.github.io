			<h1>Memory and Performance Issues in existing App</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>we have a problem with two of our existing Android Apps. You can find them in the Google Play Store under the following Bundle IDs:</p>
<p>com.arvatis.motorsporttotal</p>
<p>de.formel1</p>
<p>They are originally built with Titanium 1.2 and are now running on 3.1.1. Because of that there are still a lot of old workarounds in the code. I undertook the app of a previous developer who left the company. The two apps are more or less clones of each other, in the formel1 app are just not all series included and it has a different CI.</p>
<p>The problem is that both have a huge memory leak. After starting the app it already needs 60MB of RAM and if you use it for a while you will get an OutOfMemoryException. Until now i couldn&#39;t figure out why. The iphone versions run more or less fine though they share the same code. We planed two start working on a relaunch of the app in september because there is also an urgent need to redesign the app.</p>
<p>My first question is now whether anyone has an idea where the memory issues come from and how to resolve them?</p>
<p>The second question is whether we can resolve the issues by relaunching the app or do you think that this is a general problem of titanium. We thought about using Alloy or would you recommend us to go native with the android version?</p>
<p>Thanks, David</p>

<p>You should clean your window after not using them. Check <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;mauropm&#x2F;5923980">this</a> code to get an usage pattern. </p>

							<p>Your post is <em>vague</em> at best.</p>
<ul>
<li>You mention memory problems and ask for help, but you have absolutely <strong>no code</strong> to show for.</li>
<li>You give absolutely <strong>no explanation</strong> of what you application does.</li>
<li>Let me guess, you developed the entire application for iPhone and then hoped it would work just the same on Android?</li>
<li>Memory problems come from bad code and Android is just less forgiving that iOS when it comes to memory usage.</li>
<li>This <strong>is not</strong> an issue specific to Titanium. There are a lots of good Android apps out there that work just fine. This is an issue related to <strong>your application</strong>.</li>
<li>If you ever decided to redo the entire application using native Android SDK, you would be faced with the same problem if the code quality is poor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Listen, I&#39;m not giving you a hard time here. But you&#39;ll surely admit, that simply asking questions without code won&#39;t help you solve your problem. Of course, if you go through your code and identify sections of code that may cause some issues, feel free to post it on the Q&amp;A and we will be glad to help you out.</p>
<p>In conclusion, there is no silver bullet when dealing with software development. My best advice to you would be to look at the code line by line and identify ways you can optimise it. It&#39;s little things like that may get your app to run smoothly in the end.</p>
