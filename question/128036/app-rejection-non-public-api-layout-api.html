			<h1>App rejection non public api LAYOUT API</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>SDK: IOS<br>Build: 1.7.5</p>
<p>My app was rejected today because a non public api:</p>
<p>&quot;<br>2.5</p>
<p>We found that your app uses one or more non-public APIs, which is not in compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines. The use of non-public APIs is not permissible because it can lead to a poor user experience should these APIs change. </p>
<p>We found the following non-public API in your app:</p>
<p>layout</p>
<p>If you have defined methods in your source code with the same names as the above-mentioned APIs, we suggest altering your method names so that they no longer collide with Apple&#39;s private APIs to avoid your application being flagged in future submissions.<br>&quot;</p>
<p>Well, i&#39;ve just search my whole code and i cant found anything on my code refering to layout!!?</p>
<p>Any help please?!</p>

							<div><p>I have just received my app submission feedback from Apple with exactly the same reason for rejection, moreover it was an update they rejected to an app they in fact approved about 2 weeks earlier. I used the same SDK and changes were pretty small, so i&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going on here.</p>

							<div><p>At this point, the rejection appears to be a false positive in Apple&#39;s scanning logic - we have properties inside of our own objects called &quot;layout&quot;, but we are not accessing or in any way reliant on any private APIs, especially not one called layout.</p>
<p>We are trying to find out a good way to message this to Apple, but you might try resubmitting with comments to this effect.  Will comment on the developer blog with more info when we have it.</p>

							<div><p>I just submitted and am having this exact same issue. My app was rejected as well based on this &quot;layout&quot; private API which is no where to be found in my code so I can only imagine its some API being used in the Titanium SDK. Please keep me updated with your findings guys. Thanks</p>

							<p>We&#39;re working on a code change to help address this, although this is Apple&#39;s fault for being too agressive and not smart enough in their binary processing.  We use no private APIs in Titanium.</p>

							<p>We currently have a pull request on github, #672, which resolves this issue. We&#39;re working on integrating it as fast as we can, but you will need to pull continuous integration builds (yes, even for 1.7.x) to pick up the change until we can certify&#x2F;release an official SDK which contains the fix.</p>

							<p>Hi all, I just wanted to add to this with some potentially good news.  I had an app approved this morning.  What is interesting is the app is based on the same code base as one that was rejected.  It was submitted November 8th using the 1.7.5 SDK.  I had not bothered to reject that binary and rebuild it on one of the CI builds because I was waiting to see what happened with the other four apps I had rebuilt using the 1.7.6 builds.</p>
<p>So, same code base in two apps… One was rejected last week with the layout API message.  This one went into review this morning and was approved in an hour.   So I would say this is an indication that Apple may have changed their internal process because of too many false positives?   I can&#39;t see a reviewer being able to override&#x2F;ignore a private API call being discovered… But perhaps they have to catch it manually somehow?</p>

							<p>I was just about to submit an app update and thankfully noticed this thread.</p>
<p>My app is based on SDK 1.8.x, which I know isn&#39;t supported but could anybody explain how I&#39;d go about integrating this hotfix?</p>
<p>Do I simply change the code in my TiUITableViewRowProxy.m file found in my iPhone&#x2F;Classes directory?</p>
<p>This is all a little over my head and just concerned that I wont get this update through; any advice would be extremely appreciated.</p>

<p>The fix isn&#39;t in just 1.7.x - it&#39;s also available in 1.8.x (&quot;last known good&quot; Android) and master (v8 preview).</p>

										<p><p>One would hope that Apple would realize their new approach is creating way too many false positives.  Any chance they will correct this on their end?  We have several apps that have been in for review for the last few days and are debating on if we should reject the binary and resubmit with the patch.  However, it would be nice to know if the patch is working for people or not – hate to lose our place in the queue if the patch doesn&#39;t solve the issue or Apple realizes they are being dumb.</p>

							<p>Having the same problem this end. Bottom line is, it would be useful for Titanium users to be told what the &quot;layout&quot; API is referring to, and how to tweak our apps to remove it. It may be a problem Apple&#39;s side, but it&#39;s being flagged up as an issue with Titanium, so it&#39;s Appcelerator&#39;s issue to look in to, IMHO.</p>

							<p>FYI - Submitted using the new SDK build and got rejected again. I had made sure to clean and rebuild using the new SDK and verified version on the build directory was indeed from the 1.7.6 build.</p>
<p>Also their response to &quot;I&#39;m not using private APIs, your scanners are just ringing false positives on anything called layout&quot; -</p>
<p>&quot;Since you are using the third party, Appcelerator, for some of your code, it would be best to contact them to inform that they should rename their code, as it is the same as a known non-public API.&quot;</p>

							<p>We now have another pull request ready, #684, which could resolve this. If this does not solve the problem, the next step is to break our public API and the property &quot;layout&quot; on views; this is a cross-platform change that will affect all apps in production. We&#39;re really sorry about this issue; it&#39;s not easy to resolve because of Apple&#39;s vague message and sudden change in how they detect these APIs.</p>
<p>I will get Kevin to update the blog and this QA ticket once there are CI builds available containing this fix.</p>

										<p><p>While we can&#39;t be absolutely sure what Apple is detecting, we have a good guess now, and the latest change reflects this:</p>
<p>Your app does not have to use the &#39;layout&#39; property for it to appear in the code. We have hardcoded locations which use the string &quot;layout&quot;, a method called setLayout:, and a data structure with a &#39;layout&#39; member. It appears that Apple was picking up on the last one; it has been renamed and this will hopefully avoid future conflicts. To be safe, we have also obfuscated setLayout: and all of the &quot;layout&quot; hardcoded strings as well.</p>

							<p>Even if you don&#39;t explicitly make use of the layout property, I believe Titanium is still using this on views, tables, pretty much every UI element. From my understanding this is due to a potential conflict amongst names between an update Apple sets of APIs and Appcelerator&#39;s.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Apple is the gatekeeper here and no matter how frustrating it is for all of us, it&#39;s up to Appcelerator to work out a fix that doesn&#39;t cause a conflict with Apple. The team is working hard on a fix, let&#39;s just hope the latest hotfix works.</p>

							<p>Having done some more reading on this subject seems a lot of third-parties are being affected. Noticed apps based referring to things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>appName</li>
<li>setAppName</li>
<li>multitaskingSupported</li>
</ul>
<p>Amongst others are all being flagged up - this is beginning to sound a little concerning. Also would like to see Appcelerator&#39;s response to the post from Matthew Luchak above, who seems to suggest &#39;string&#39; is being flagged.</p>
<p>Looking forward to an update on this guy, although I appreciate you&#39;re all working very hard on this.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Chris, I didn&#39;t mean to give the impression that the string &quot;string&quot; is being flagged - I don&#39;t have any information either way on that, but, who knows.. In my post I was refering to apple&#39;s searching of strings within the code.<br>I would like to repeat that the only plausible solution in the short term is if Apple is pressured to stop flagging strings - there is no way to code against this ype of restriction.  I urge everyone to make what noise they can to get some exposure!!</p>

							<p>This can sound naive at this point, but I think no option should be discarded… </p>
<p>The only time I had to use the App Review Board (about 1 month ago), someone at Apple called me by phone to explain me the reasons why my app was rejected and how to solve it. I was very surprised, even more considering I live in Europe and she called me directly from Cupertino. She seemed to me very reasonable and we had a friendly discussion about their approval process.</p>
<p>So my question is, and excuse my ignorance, has somebody appealed to the app review board and has had the chance to discuss this directly with them?</p>

										<p><p>I think that&#39;s a fair comment - I had problems with an app, updated to fix the problem Apple had - they rejected it again, but I pointed out that we had solved this issue and they approved the app immediately.</p>
<p>Bottom line is they seem pretty receptive once you engage them (politely) through the App Review appeal system.</p>

							<p>This is the first time a app of us got rejected. I send a complaint to apple. This is absolutly absurd and every app developer will be seen as a malware maker this way.</p>

							<p>Signing out for the day but we had an idea - anyone want to try it and let us know? </p>
<p>Run a python script to convert all strings to ASCII  and convert back at runtime -pain in the 455 but need to get something working….</p>

										<p><p>Just an update on the idea:</p>
<p>run a regexp python script on the xCode to convert</p>
<p>foo(&quot;bar&quot;) -&gt; foo(asciiToString(&quot;98 97 114&quot;))</p>
<p>or put all strings into a res file and foo(res.getString(123))</p>
<p>Anybody see why that wouldn&#39;t work?</p>

							<p>Now apps being accepted regardless of warning messages. SDK 1.7.5 and 1.7.6 are working fine. You can submit app using any SDK. Apple has relaxed these requirements around the “non-public” APIs.</p>

							<p>Well, my app which was compiled with 1.7.5 was just rejected today… So Apple did not relax the requirements for sure… Why isn&#39;t there a confirmed fix for this?</p>

										<p><p>Hey Tony was it rejected specifically for the &#39;layout&#39; conflict.</p>
<p>From my understanding Appcelerator made changes to the SDK to accommodate the conflict, but it also appeared that Apple realised they were generating lots of false positives and relaxed things from there end.  So it&#39;s interesting to note that this may not have been specifically the case.</p>

										<p><p>Ok, well all I can say is that Appcelerator kept the community well informed on the forums and blogs, so I don&#39;t think many of us had too many complaints about the way the team handled it. </p>
<p>Apple threw a curveball to the development community (as a whole not just Appcelerator) and I think the team handled it as quickly and efficiently as possible - even if they did miss a crucial selector on the first update:)</p>
