			<h1>User to user message-like system</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello.</p>
<p>This is not a question regarding the functionality of certain code snippets, but rather if someone out there could give me an idea, or maybe a code example on how to solve my idea.</p>
<p>I am trying to make an iPhone application where a user have to sign up and sign in, in order to use it. After the user has signed in, the user will have the opportunity to send a &quot;bet&quot; to a friend, which also have signed up for the application. The friend can hereby see the &quot;bet&quot; on his homescreen, and see who its from, and have the opportunity to accept the bet or not.</p>
<p>This sounds pretty simple - but can&#39;t seem to figure this out. Its basicly sending messages to eachother, but the message have to remain there and not go away.</p>
<p>Anyone has an idea on how to do this?</p>
<p>Thanks and regards</p>

							<p>You would likely use a &quot;middle-man&quot; server with an API of your making. Phones would send and retrieve data based to the API web address using HTTP requests etc. Obviously, the server would need to authenticate and validate all data in the process. </p>
<p>Once a phone pulls data from the server, it can cache it and keep it there for however long it likes, periodically polling the server for new information.</p>
<p>I highly recommend googling RESTful APIs and brush up on your serverside programming of choice (PHP, Ruby, etc)</p>
