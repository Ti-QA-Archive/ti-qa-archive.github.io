			<h1>Educational Pricing</h1>

			<p>Hi,<br>We are a UK equivalent K12 school and would like to use titanium but the monthly cost is prohibitive. Do you plan on introducing educational pricing? I noticed a previous post from 7 months ago that had an answer stating it would be there in next 2&#x2F;3 months but I cant see any sign of that. Thanks</p>
<p>Nigel</p>

							<div><p>Hi Nigel,</p>
<p>I&#39;m engaged in a project for a Dutch highschool, which starts at the end of this month. The objective of the project is to develop an app in which users use several features of the mobile phone. I&#39;ve written educational material for that project in Dutch. If the project is a success, we&#39;ll try to sell this material to other highschools.</p>
<p>If there is demand for it in UK&#x2F;USA, I could translate it in English (and expand it).</p>
<p>Sincerly,</p>

							<p>Free it&#39;s too expensive for you ?</p>
<p>Titanium it&#39;s free and can be used free for either free or commercial apps. You have to pay  only if you want official support or access to BlackBerry beta.</p>

							<p>Daniel<br>I realise it&#39;s free but the support is way too expensive for a school. We need to be able to see the training videos and get help when stuck, although if we had access to the video training at least I doubt we would need much support time. Access to sample apps especially for remote data access etc would be useful. Thanks</p>
<p>Nigel </p>

										<p><p>The Kitchen Sink apps have wealth of information in there. You could go from 0 to 60 in just a few days just from picking through that code.</p>

							<p>Thanks. I&#39;ve looked at kitchen sink and find it useful but where I need more detail is for accessing data remotely etc. If there was a complete project showing a backend .net server web service being used with titanium that would be good. </p>
