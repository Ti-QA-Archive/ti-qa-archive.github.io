			<p>I filled out a JIRA feature request a couple weeks ago and checked on the status…it was declined but I can&#39;t figure out what he means. </p>
<p><strong>Here is the description:</strong> The android audio recording module developed by Codeboxed is exactly what I&#39;m asking to be included in the base software. This feature has been requested numerous times on the Q&amp;A board for quite some time. The Codeboxed module has become outdated due to current Titanium releases, their devs ignore attempts to discover the progress of the module, and for all intents and purposes have abandoned the project. That is an example of the downside of a module market. Users become dependent on a module and then become handicapped due to lack of support. If you can clone the audio recording features of that module, and the ability to customize the user interface (without having to use intents), that would satisfy a sorely missing feature of the android-based titanium platform.</p>
<p><strong>And here is the response:</strong> &quot;We don&#39;t support it. We encourage our customers to develop their own modules.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m reading this response as it&#39;s Appcelerator&#39;s policy not to support audio recording features.</p>
