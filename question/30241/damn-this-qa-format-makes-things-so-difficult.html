			<p>Exhibit 1324:</p>
<p>Question right below this one of</p>
<p>&quot;Is there any way to default to the numbers keyboard?&quot;</p>
<p>This was answered, complete with sample code, just a few days ago…</p>
<p>but it is <strong>next to impossible</strong> to help this new question with a link to the previous one I speak of because you cannot search for a keyword <strong>and</strong> sort by date…</p>
<p>I hope what ever you Appcelerator guys have up your sleeve for changes to this &quot;community&quot; level support isn&#39;t so frustrating</p>
<p>I&#39;ve learned a lot in the past few months, <em>and would absolutely love to help others</em>, but this style&#x2F;format&#x2F;travesty of communication makes that next to impossible…  </p>
<p>this could help explain why so many questions go unanswered too   :-(</p>
<p>don&#39;t take this topic as anything but frustration…  i&#39;m very happy with the product and look forward to rolling out my first application this month….  if you want to product to grow, there needs to be a good avenue to ask (and answer!)</p>

							<p>Kevin…</p>
<p>I just voted on an existing item there….</p>
<p>What&#39;s the attachment to this StackOverflow style?  There&#39;s so many &quot;real&quot; forums out there that would handle stuff like:</p>
<ul>
<li>tracking a topic you are not part of (but want to see the conversation(</li>
<li>locking closed issues</li>
<li>search</li>
<li>categories (iPad specific, Android specific, install issues, etc etc)</li>
<li>view options</li>
<li>markup that makes sense</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of us will take what we can get, but when there are so many already-ready-to-use forum packages out there it doesn&#39;t seem to make much sense to have something like this where just to get threaded conversations is a major undertaking  :-(</p>
<p>I knew making this post I am not the only one with these concerns, but the exact example I brought up above (to which i then spent the time to go through 11 pages of previous topics just to find the answer for him) made me air out my frustration…..     </p>
<p>there&#39;s got to be a lot of people like me that want to <strong>answer</strong> just as much as ask, but this format is tying one hand behind our back and blindfolding us in the effort to help,  and it&#39;s hard to type that way!! :-)</p>

							<p>Yours is not the only frustrated voice we&#39;ve heard.  I&#39;m testing some improvements we&#39;ve been making to our Q&amp;A on a staging environment right now, so we should be pushing out some (hopefully) helpful updates soon.  <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;appceleratordev.uservoice.com">Could you do me a favor and add your sorting request here</a>?  Thanks..</p>
