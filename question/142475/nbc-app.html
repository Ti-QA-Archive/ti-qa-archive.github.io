			<p>Hi, </p>
<p>I am new to all of this and have been asking a few questions and reading a lot but was did have some questions that I hope can be answered.</p>
<p>When I look at the ABC app it does a lot of the stuff I want to do with an app I will be building ( I understand they have people who know way more then I do working on it etc ) but I hope the things I&#39;m looking to do are not terribly difficult or out of the norm.</p>
<p>1) When I look at the ABC app (on android phone) I noticed the bottom navigation, (I had asked a question about this type of navigation yesterday) Is that navigation a custom toolbar consisting of a view and buttons? </p>
<p>2) When I click on one of those items a new page comes up (I&#39;m assuming it a window and not a view correct?)  The tab or selected item is selected and the new page shows, then I click on an item it goes to a detail and the tab still shows selected is this because its a custom view?  The app I would like to build would have a custom toolbar for app settings and windows but the main window would have a list of items then when selected would move to the detail page and the back button would return you back etc</p>
<p>3) The content that is loaded in the app looks nice and Im wondering how they are doing this or are they using webUI or are they just using regular TI.UI code?</p>
<p>4) When navigating the app I also see the loading screen for each section and then it shows and then other items like images etc will show a loading then fade into the image when its done, again is this because it a webUI or is this something different?</p>
<p>Sorry for all the questions I&#39;m just trying to get a better understanding of Titanium and what are the best use cases etc.</p>
<p> I&#39;m coming from a more phonegap html5 world and am hoping to use TI for more responsive and native feel in the app but I want to understand how I would builf things a little more.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help!</p>
<p>Mike.</p>

<p>Title says NBC, you mention ABC in the body.</p>
<p>NBC has a couple of different apps created with Titanium, so it would be helpful if you referenced specifically which ones you are looking at as not all of the apps are on all platforms.</p>
<p>When asking questions of a visual&#x2F;gui nature, would it not be helpful to take a screenshot and mark it up so folks who might want to offer aid don&#39;t have to go install an app (which we don&#39;t know which one it is) and then guess at what you are asking?</p>

							<div><p>Sorry, I to say NBC in the body not ABC (They all mix together sometimes ) :) </p>
<p>The NBC app I&#39;m referring to is the one on google play</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.nbcuni.nbc.portal&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5uYmN1bmkubmJjLnBvcnRhbCJd</p>
<p>That is the link to it</p>
<p>The screenshots on the play store dont seem to be up to date but you can still see a footer navigation </p>
<p><img src="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lh5.ggpht.com&#x2F;l7XdtaWdeALQEA1BslhDejFKoVkuJYEo_JpWhNECVaX62Y-xEOmwUubvVtUWfhPmdcs=h230" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>From this screen you see the video is high lighted and when clicking on one of the icons it would take you to a detail page while keeping all the header and footer information in place</p>
<p>As for the layout of things  was not sure if things were web or native, for example in this screenshot</p>
<p><img src="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lh6.ggpht.com&#x2F;bfUjnLj8zEuNHbNPetoX5TJIFJQxAGN4eCZKXG6odcRYEOgWb-4TdWcj7zEIVoeocyk=h230" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>Is the slideshow a UI thing or is that webUI?</p>
<p>Again thanks for any help!</p>
<p>Mike.</p>

							<p>I assume that you mean the NBC app throughout the post even though you refer to it as ABC. The NBC app is not open source, so one can only speculate as to how its built, but lets tackle your questions one at a time.</p>
<p>1) The tabs along the bottom look like the TabGroup on iOS. It is either a TabGroup with a custom AndroidManifest.xml that moves the tabs from top to bottom, or it is a simple custom made navigation bar made up of views and buttons that mimic the iOS TabGroup.</p>
<p>2) It looks like a window yes. When you open a new window within the current TabGroup, the tab that the window was opened in stays highlighted. </p>
<p>3) Their app is entire native. Not webviews or web UI. Every screen is composed of Ti.UI components.</p>
<p>4) No, they created a loading screen along with loading indicators for smaller content areas.</p>
<p>All your questions will always be better answered by firing up the IDE and writing some code. Find some features that you&#39;d like to create&#x2F;re-create and focus on doing it. Only then will you truly understand what can and can&#39;t be done.</p>

							<p>Hi Anthony, </p>
<p>Thanks for the replys!</p>
<p>I do have another question based off your responses. So if it is a tabGroup and they navigate the page and then click on an item and it goes to a detail page does Android not remove the tabs? </p>
<p>I was doing some testing the other day and I ran into that where I had a tab group, then the detail page from the current tab removed the tabs. I then read that this was just how Android worked so it led me down a path to try and do the view with buttons etc.</p>
<p>So if the app is using the UI components how do you think they are pulling in images? is the initial load downloading all the images and storing them or is there a way to pull in images on the fly from a server, almost like an html page? </p>
<p>I have been opening up TI and messing around and trying different things, there is a lot to take in :)  What I&#39;m trying to do right now is zero in on what I need and how to do it, a lot of the tutorials (I have done many of them) and books focus in on broader things I want to try and get all the items I need or want figured out and then kind of put them all together , if that makes sense :)</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Mike.</p>

										<p><p>Android does remove the tabs when a new window is opened. So, that would lead one to believe that they have either created a custom implementation of the TabGroup, or they are opening windows that are not the full height of the screen, leaving the bottom visible.</p>
<p>As for images, you can pull images from anywhere, they don&#39;t have to be within the app.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="xml">var img = Ti.UI.createImageView(</span><span class="hljs-expression">{
    <span class="hljs-variable">image</span>:'<span class="hljs-variable">http</span>:/<span class="hljs-end-block">/mywebsite.com</span><span class="hljs-end-block">/images</span><span class="hljs-end-block">/image.png</span>'
}</span><span class="xml">);</span>
</code></pre><p>Their entire app is actually powered by their own API. That is how they grab updated shows and schedules. They also have a proprietary video streaming server that streams the video into their app. The ability to talk with services via APIs is what makes most of the best apps on the market so great.</p>

										<p><p>Wow this just makes a lot more sense now :) </p>
<p>So I could create a new window with a height of something other then a full page.. I did not know that:)</p>
<p>Also I was unaware you could pull images in via URL this is something I&#39;m very happy to hear this will make it a lot better for the app..</p>
<p>I figure they were using their own API some JSON file etc. The app I&#39;m going to redo now with titanium is running off our own API so it should work well.</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply Anthony it has really helped!</p>
