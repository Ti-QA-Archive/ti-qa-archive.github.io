			<h1>UI - design with a couple of views and tabs, but not tab-based?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m considering Titanium for building an app that needs to run on iOS and Android, in both phone and tablet layouts. The app has already been designed visually and needs to have a consistent set of tabs on top rather than following the iOS conventions of tabs on the bottom. Essentially it looks like a fairly simple traditional web site - but it needs to run offline, so we can&#39;t just build a mobile web site. I spent a LOT of time trying to modify a tab-based Titanium example, but since by default tabs are displayed on bottom for iOS it seems like it might be a lot simpler to just build the app with HTML, CSS and Javascript. Is Titanium still the best option for such a project? If so, can anyone point me to some sample code to help me get started?</p>

							<div><p>Thanks Christian. I was probably unclear. The tabs I need all need to be on the top of the screen, no on the bottom. Imagine your typical website with tabs on the top? It has to look and function (essentially) like that.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Whilst you do not have to follow the UI conventions for iOS and Android when designing apps (otherwise we would have no innovation) it does make your life much easier - as I think you have been finding out.</p>
<p>Something to consider before you move forwards - if your design is better than the existing ways (not necessarily technically - visually works) then move ahead with your design.  If not you may end up annoying users by trying to get them to interact with a new way of doing things that runs differently than they would expect.</p>
<p>For example a good cross-platform app does NOT look the same, but has the essence of the same and the differences suitable to the platform.  This way you honours the users and the app at the same time.</p>
<p>But as I say - you may have very good reasons for not doing this and that is valid.</p>
<p>No the problem - straying from the path of normal methods makes life a little harder to achieve, and even harder if you are aiming for both iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Given your explanation I would suggest that you create imageViews that represent your tabs and then place a <strong>scrollableView</strong> underneath.  Each page of the the scrollableView can act as the tab container and you add your content in that.  Click events on the imageView tabs can tell the scrollable view to swap pages (with or without animation - there are methods for both).  This will give you app a good base start.</p>
<p>You will have to solve how you add windows though as these will cover the main tabbed window - however if you only use lightweight windows on Android (iOS is good about this no changes needed) you can set the left, right, top and bottom of a window to not cover the tab strip.</p>
<p>I would not recommend using HTML to solve the problem - it will give you too many compromises down the road when you want extras in the app that HTML5 will not give you access to.</p>
<p>You can do this is Titanium and many people do.</p>
<p>Good luck and have fun.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Malcolm. As I noted in my question, the visual design is done already. It is out of my hands so whether or not it is an improvement on the platform conventions is a mute point. Given that these answers will serve a greater audience for years to come, I&#39;m glad you included those design considerations.<br>Your imageViews and scrollableView approach sounds like a good place to (re)start. There are a couple of cases where a window actually needs to cover the tabs anyway (modal information screens) so the window adding problem is only a problem in some cases.</p>

										<p><p>Glad you didn&#39;t take my comments negatively.  You are correct this answer in particular was with a greater audience in mind.</p>
<p>The smaller window thought was to allow those case when you do not need (or want) to cover the tabs themselves.</p>
<p>The <strong>scrollableView</strong> used correctly is a gem of a view as although many use it for image galleries or swipe side to side views - if you turn of the indicators, tell it NOT to scroll on touch events, you get a whole new set of uses out of it.  I use it a lot for wizard style, step-by-step UI elements - for example registration processes and in-app purchasing where it is better to lead people.  As you can programattically set the page to show - you have lots of control.</p>
<p>Hopefully this has given you some pointers to get started.</p>

							<p>Instead of creating tabs you can use buttons which looks like a tab.</p>
