			<h1>How to calculate Label width and height</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Working on a publishing app where the text needs to flow around images. In order to do that you need to be able to calculate the width of each word before you add the label views to the parent view.<br>I tried many of the suggested ways, for example to get the currentWindow and add the label with visible == false, but currentWindow is always null or the label.size has width and height 0.</p>
<p>Any ideas would be appreciated.</p>
<p>This would also be useful in news readers, which need to highlight text and control text formatting.</p>
<p>Using latest version of Appcelerator, 3.0 on iOS.</p>

							<div><p>Can I ask why you want to flow text around an image, and do you really mean something like left aligned images in a HTML page where the image takes the corner of the text space?</p>
<p>This is an expensive feature to add in, for resources, memory and performance.</p>
<p>If you expand on the reasoning a little we may be able to offer another suggestion.  Include things like how big the view and image will be, how much text, does the text really need to site to the right if the image and then underneath?</p>

							<div><p>Wrapping text around images is just one of the layout features needed. You also need the control first line indent, adding large first character to the paragraph, having some words in bold or italic, changing font mid paragraph, etc.</p>

							<div><p>The reason I ask is that you &quot;may&quot; be better using a <strong>webView</strong> if the content requires such specific layout as it is better suited to providing that level of formatting.</p>
<p>But only add one per window as the memory footprint is high.</p>
<p>If you have a screen-shot of what you are trying to achieve, then we can see if that gives us more information.</p>

							<p>You need to listen to &quot;postlayout&quot; event to get element&#39;s dimensions:</p>
<p>Note that &quot;postlayout&quot; can be fired multiple times, so you&#39;ll need to execute that event only once:</p>
<p>Something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">function <span class="hljs-keyword">on</span>Postlayout() {
    win.removeEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">"postlayout"</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">on</span>Postlayout);
    Ti.API.<span class="hljs-keyword">debug</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">label</span>.size.width);

win.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">"postlayout"</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">on</span>Postlayout);

										<p><p>Unfortunately you need to know the size of the labels before adding them to the view. For example the text needs to split in lines based on how much space is available. Therefore you know the text content of each label after you did all the calculations.<br>For example you need to know what text forms the first line in a paragraph when the first line needs indentation.</p>
