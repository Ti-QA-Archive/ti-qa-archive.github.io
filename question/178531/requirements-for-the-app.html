										<p><p>Hi Malcolm,</p>
<p>I am new to this platform thats why I need your help. Is this something achievable within the limit of appcelerator because I have never done such kind of work in appcelerator before. </p>
<p>Could you please tell me how much time this app would take? Thank you</p>

										<p><p>Whilst I appreciate you are new to the platform you need to understand that you will need to spend some time learning how to achieve what you&#x2F;your client are hoping for.  This is not because it is difficult - nothing you listed is difficult and again; all are possible.</p>
<p>If I was doing this then it would take a few days.  Then more once you take into account the requirements of an app beyond that of the raw code.</p>
<p>You are asking for the unanswerable; &quot;how long will it take you&quot; - no idea.  You say you are new to the platform, likely you are new to many of the items on the list you may be new to JavaScript, you may be new to creating apps.</p>
<p>If someone was asked how long would it take to run a mile - some would saw 4 minutes, some would brag less than that, some might say I could do it in 6 to 8 minutes.  I on the other hand am the wrong side of sport, the wrong side of age and the wrong side of flat feet.  I would walk the mile and it would take me 15 minutes if the old 4 miles per hour logic works.</p>
<p>I could do it in a couple of days; but then I having been using the platform for years, I understand JavaScript well I have been building on and improving my techniques each and every day.  Some call me an expert, I am certainly a professional.</p>
<p>This would take others a week or two, some more, some less.</p>
<p>But you will have to judge for yourself how long you will take.  I spent a year learning the platform, how apps worked on actual devices, what different screen resolutions and aspect ratios changed in the app and the user experience.  I learnt how different iOS is from Android, how phones are different from tablets.  How structured code is a must not an aim. How much work needs to be achieved outside of raw code to complete an app.</p>
<p>After I spent that year learning I then started accepting paid contracts.  I continue to learn every day, because it continues to change every day.</p>
<p>You will know how long it will take once you have finished it.  If you are unable to advice your client right now as you are unable to guess for yourself - then maybe you need to learn &quot;how&quot; before you can say you &quot;do&quot;.</p>

										<p><p>Identifying a chandelier when you point your phone towards it, isn&#39;t something that can be accomplished without custom native modules. So Ray&#39;s answer isn&#39;t completely wrong ;) if you have deep knowledge in Obj-C or Java to develop such a module, why should you use AppC instead of developing all native?</p>

										<p><p>@Danny your answer is just as wrong as this whole question… First off If you even need to ask this question, they you most certainly should not even be responding to the RFP. This is the kind of thing that completely destroys the credibility of the Appcelerator Platform… People&#x2F;Companies&#x2F;Teams claiming they know the platform when they dont, and building crappy poor performing solutions and making it worse for everyone else out here who actually know what they are doing.</p>
<p>Now they reason why you shouldn&#39;t just build native, because you need to maintain the applications, it is an oversimplification to state that because part of the application needs to be native, that you should build the whole thing native? That logic is not very convincing to me.</p>

										<p><p>@Danny - did you not realise the &quot;pointing to something&quot; might be related to the beacons part of the original question.</p>
<p>Unlikely that a closed system app (the client is likely a venue owner, rather than someone who wants to randomly detect any old thing) will know the things that need to be detected and have them identifiable.  So pop a beacon in each or use a number of beacons and manage a mesh map.</p>
