			<h1>Places records are gone</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>We have uploaded about 2000 places under a testing account. As we moved along with user registration and testing, we thought it&#39;d be ok to delete the test account.  Until recently we only found out that, the places this particular user has uploaded are also deleted, yes, 2000 of them.</p>
<p>Can someone give an official confirmation, as to whether or not removing an ACS user account (admin or not) will also remove other items that this user created such as Places? (Photos seem to be ok), if yes, what other items are identified removable along with the user id, please provide a full list.</p>
<p>If I have missed a critical documentation about this, my apology, please kindly point me to it.</p>
<p>Thanks and keep up the good work.</p>
