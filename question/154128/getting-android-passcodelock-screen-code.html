			<h1>getting android passcode(lock screen code)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello everyone, I used titanium last year in uni and now I wish to develop some apps. </p>
<p>Currently I am working on an app which gets passcode in android and saves it in a database. I searched for getting a passcode in android but no luck so far. I would really appreciate if anyone could help me out in this. </p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<div><p>i do not think that there is a Titanium API for passcode, but using android native side may be you can achieve that, so create a module when done from native side for titanium.</p>

							<p>This looks more like a malware application than an university assignment to me. (of course, my interpretation may be wrong)</p>
<p>For obvious reasons, here is absolutely no technical way to retrieve a user&#39;s lock screen code (on any platform for that matter). Otherwise, someone could develop an app that does just this in the background and then provide access to the device as well as a user&#39;s personal data.</p>
<p>Hope this fears it up for you.</p>
