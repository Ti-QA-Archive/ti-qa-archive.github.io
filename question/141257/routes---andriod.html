							<p>Hi Steven</p>
<p>I answered this just last week (and two weeks before for iOS).  It is a popular question.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;141002&#x2F;plot-a-route-on-google-map-in-android#answer-245304">Android</a> and <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;140523&#x2F;error-parsing-google-maps-xml#answer-244399">iOS</a> they are basically the same answer - but each one has extra comments that are worth noting.</p>
<p>The problem is that the points you are using are based on the direction changes not the actual route points.  These are held in an encoded form in the property <code>polyline.point</code> and need to be decoded.  Both exmaples provide code to smooth out the points automatically for you and works great on Android (need 2.1 or higher) and iOS.</p>

										<p><p>Hi</p>
<p>Can you provide a screenshot of the Android version please so I can see if it different from what I get.  Use <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;droplr.com&#x2F;">droplr.com</a>, if you do not have a preferred service.</p>

										<p><p>Bad news time, for an Android that looks good, as you zoom in and out it should reveal more detail, but I think you are seeing the iOS version that uses anti-alias techniques to smooth the line, but Android simply shows a fixed pixel edge line.</p>
<p>You can play with line width to see if that improves things, but the Google Maps for Android is nowhere near as good as the iOS version based on image quality alone.</p>

										<p><p>I have noticed that the andriod version pales in comparison, and I don&#39;t think clients will like the maps as I currently have them. I am think of switching to web views, and google maps API 3 for andriod, and this should help to avoid all these issues. The maps also seems to crash a lot. That sucks. But the iPhone version I have built is really great, and we will release it soon.</p>

										<p><p>I agree Google could do better.</p>
<p>So this is answered then, even if it was not the answer you were looking for?</p>
