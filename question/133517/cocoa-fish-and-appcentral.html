			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We are using appcelerator less and less due to the problems with developing cross platform apps and the issues with memory (which are real and significant despite what is said on this forum).</p>
<p>The main reason i say there are issues with cross platform is that functionality that is not available in the main platform is added via modules and generally there are very few modules from the marketplace that are available for both iPhone and Android.</p>
<p>However, both CocoaFish and Appcentral are very interesting new tools that are useful for all mobile development but both seem to only allow appcelerator as the development platform.</p>
<p>Can anyone shed any light on this?</p>
<p>Please dont flame me for speaking badly of Appcelerator as in the current fast moving industry of mobile development, any developer that closes their mind to alternatives is simply foolish.<br>Also I have spent money (license) and lots of time on appcelerator so i have tried to make it work, but i cannot use it commercially very much for the reason mentioned above. </p>
<p>Also I found the value for money in the license was pretty bad as Indie gets you nothing more than free in a practical sense…. i.e. no additional support options and access to modules that are not cross-platform so limited in their use.<br>The appcelerator devs seem to focus on new features and non-platform features (like studio) rather than standardisation for the cross-platform work.</p>
<p>I recently made an app with Adobe Flex (4.6) and it makes an identical app in native code for both platforms from the (exact) same codebase…. sure its flash that is re-written to native, rather than a more directly native code base, but from a commercial point of view this is irrelevant;- it fulfils the need to develop one codebase for multiple platforms….probably the reason most devs come to appcelerator, no?</p>
<p>Jez</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure that this an entirely fair assessment. There is a team that works on the Studio codebase and another that works on the SDK codebase. So features can be added to Studio that do not affect the productivity of the mobile team.</p>

							<p>What I can say for sure is that Cocoafish will be available for non Titanium developers too, don&#39;t know about the Appcentral.</p>
<p>As for the quality of the apps, I KNOW the apps can be done to reach a commercially grade and even for enterprise apps (out of appstore).</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the info.<br>Re apps, yes i agree apps made with Titanium can be of a commercial grade, what i meant was that when making apps for both iOS and Android it is as much effort to customise to each as it is to write native apps….. in my opinion.</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>Jez</p>

										<p><p>@Jez - I think this really comes down to how the app is architected and designed.</p>
