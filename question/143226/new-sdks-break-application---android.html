			<h1>New SDK&#39;s break Application - Android</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Anything higher than 2.0.2 cause problems with Android compile application.  Downloads no longer work, calling android activity&#x2F;intent to open a file no longer works, visual elements are all hosed up too.</p>
<p>I think I&#39;m about finished with Titanium.  In 11-12 years of programming, the absolute worst 5 months I&#39;ve ever endured with a dev environment and now nothing but problems with new sdk upgrades for all of the trouble endured.</p>
<p>So frustrated.  Errors with Android&#x2F;camera&#x2F;gallery used still not fixed or the SDK that fixes that problem, breaks many other things.</p>
<p>How does anyone produce and build quality products with this tool is beyond me.  I&#39;m not bad mouthing Ti, just after five months of literally battling with Ti to even produce a simi-stable application, to have to face all of SDK upgrade problems is so disheartening.</p>

							<div><p>Here is the specifics:  </p>
<p>&lt;= 2.0.2 Works OK except that long standing (show stopping) problem with Android camera&#x2F;gallery use crashing the application.</p>
<p> &gt;= 2.0.2 Crashes, UI inconsistencies&#x2F;placement all messed up, starting android intent after downloading png, jpeg, etc throws an exception  whereas it worked before on 2.0.2.</p>
<p>Not sure what else there is to say.  A quick search of this forum and google seems to indicate that the pain of later SDK&#39;s is felt by many.</p>

							<p>Is there a question in here somewhere? With 2.0 we released some layout updates that changed the way widths and heights were handled and it required some updating. These changes were made to better the entire SDK and improve UI as well as keep up with the layout systems of both platforms. All this is laid out in the release notes for anyone porting their apps from before 2.0 release. These updates were never considered &#39;problems&#39;.</p>
<p>With everything else, you have not provided any error logs, output, messages, or anything that might help someone help you with any issues that you&#39;re having. </p>
<p>People are putting out quality products with these same tools every single day. Keeping on the heels of the constantly updating platforms is usually the best way to stay ahead in this game.</p>
