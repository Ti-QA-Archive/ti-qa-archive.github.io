							<p>Ok, Problem is solved. Many thanks!!</p>
<p>It was really a syntax problem in one of my files (which was not used).<br>But it didn&#39;t cause any problems in the editor.<br>When compiling with Xcode an error occurred during the minimizing process<br>and fortunately XCode told me the file and the line number.</p>
<p>This did happen after I successfully managed to get the version 3.0.1 running which was a little bit tricky.<br>Installing with titanium sdk install ….. unfortunately installed the files in my home directory users&#x2F;schrade&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support…… but the studio expected the files in &#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support….<br>still &quot;titanium sdk&quot; said that the 3.0.1 version was installed successfully and was active but I couldn&#39;t select it within studio.<br>So I moved all the files to the &#x2F;Library directory and then I could select the new version from within studio.</p>
<p>Now everything is working fine. Hopefully the installation of 3.0.1 GA will be easier.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>This one has popped up a few times specifically with 3.0.0 but should be fixed with 3.0.1 which you say you are using.</p>
<p>I would take a look at this similar question with and answer from <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;devlink&#x2F;profile&#x2F;570711&#x2F;chris-barber">Chris Barber</a> <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;145829&#x2F;300ga-could-not-find-the-file-appjs-on-device#answer-252931">3.0.0.GA: &#39;could not find the file app.js&#39; on device</a>.</p>
<p>The problem appears to be where there is a JavaScript error with your code and then the minification process occurs - fails and does not create the app.js file.</p>
<p>A common problem would be a trailing comma in property declarations, but could be anything.</p>

<p>By your own description, works on 3.0.1 and 2.1.x, but not 3.0.0.  Which means you still have a code error and 3.0.0 is not as forgiving as the others are.</p>

							<p>In this case, this error is most likely caused because you originally built your app from Titanium Studio for Simulator, then opened the Xcode project and tried to build for device. There was a bug for this scenario that we fixed in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-11599">TIMOB-11599</a>. The fix has been merged, but hasn&#39;t been tested.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re feeling adventurous, you can preview the fix by running:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">titanium sdk <span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">install</span> <span class="hljs-comment">--branch 3_0_X</span></span>
</code></pre><p>That will download and install the latest 3.0.X CI build. Again, this build has not been thoroughly tested and should not be used in production.</p>
<p>From Studio, clean your project, then edit the tiapp.xml and select the new Titanium SDK version. Next build your app again, open the generated Xcode project, and should be able to build without any problems.</p>

										<p><p>3.0.0.GA has a bug where if any JavaScript files have a syntax error, the build will success, but won&#39;t run (i.e. app.js is not found). We fixed this shortly after 3.0.0.GA shipped, however we have not had a stable release since 3.0.0.GA. The upcoming 3.0.2 release will have the fix.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you are welcome to try the latest 3.0.2 build by running the following:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">titanium</span> <span class="hljs-comment">sdk</span> <span class="hljs-comment">install</span> <span class="hljs-literal">-</span><span class="hljs-literal">-</span><span class="hljs-comment">branch</span> <span class="hljs-comment">3_0_X</span> <span class="hljs-literal">-</span><span class="hljs-literal">-</span><span class="hljs-comment">default</span>
</code></pre><p>The 3.0.x branch is not 100% stable yet, so feel free to use it in development, but don&#39;t ship any production code with it quite yet.</p>
<p>Also remember to update the &lt;sdk-version&gt; in the tiapp.xml to the latest 3.0.2 release that you just installed.</p>

										<p><p>@Stephan, if you do not want to use a 3.0.x build or wait a few weeks until 3.0.2.GA to be released, then you only have one real option, build from the CLI and watch for the error and stack dump halfway through the build output.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">cd</span> /path/to/myproject
titanium build -p ios --<span class="hljs-keyword">log</span>-level <span class="hljs-literal">trace</span>
</code></pre><p>Regardless if you have errors or not, it will say it built successfully. You need to scroll through the output to see if there are any errors.</p>

										<p><p>@Stephan, hmm, I bet I know what&#39;s going on. It&#39;s possible somehow for the symlinks to get messed up when installing the app in the iOS Simulator.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s first try cleaning your project, then build for simulator. When the simulator starts up and assuming that it continues to say app.js not found, then from the &quot;iOS Simulator&quot; menu, select &quot;Reset content and settings&quot;. Close the simulator and try building again.</p>
<p>If it still errors, open a Terminal and run:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">ls -l ~/Library/Application\ Support/iPhone\ Simulator/<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">SIM_VERSION</span>&gt;</span>/Applications/<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">IOS_GUID</span>&gt;</span>/<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">APP_NAME</span>&gt;</span>.app
</code></pre><p>Obviously replace the tokens above with the appropriate values. The directory should contain a symlink to your app.js:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">lrwxr-xr-x   <span class="hljs-number">1</span> chris  staff       <span class="hljs-number">49</span> Jan <span class="hljs-number">31</span> <span class="hljs-number">17</span>:<span class="hljs-number">24</span> app.js -&gt; /Users/chris/appc/workspace/test/Resources/app.js
</code></pre><p>I&#39;ve seen instances where this symlink isn&#39;t copied correctly. I have no clue what I did to my machine to fix this when I caused this error. I do recall having some filesystem corruption and had to run Disk Utility to verify the disk and eventually repair it. I&#39;m not saying your hard drive has issues, but it is possible. Proceed with caution.</p>
<p>I know you don&#39;t want to upgrade to 3.0.x, but I&#39;ve added a new flag called –force-copy that will copy all files when building for simulator instead of symlinking them. Might come in handy when 3.0.2.GA is released and you&#39;re ready to upgrade.</p>

							<p>I am STILL getting the &quot;could not find the file app.js&quot; error on the simulator when compiling in XCode. (I&#39;m only trying to do so because every time I try to run from Ti, the iphone simulator won&#39;t launch and I&#39;m told &quot;The app has exited the simulator&quot; (or something like that)</p>
<p>When i execute titanium -v on my mac I get the response 3.1.2.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried everything I&#39;ve found while googling. All the Q&amp;A suggestions, from the 64 vs 32bit Adobe related applescript reference, all the way to completely uninstalling and reinstalling XCode and Ti! (yes I deleted the Node folder before reinstalling)</p>
<p>I&#39;m at the stage where all I have left is a complete reinstall of Mac OS!</p>
<p>All the details of everything else I&#39;ve tried and my system spec are on my thread here:<br><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;160499&#x2F;application-has-exited-from-simulator-ios">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;160499&#x2F;application-has-exited-from-simulator-ios</a></p>

							<p>I ran into this problem for the first time today after upgrading to the latest 3.2.1 release last week and then when doing a Project Clean for all projects and deleting the simulator app folders. It was occurring on multiple projects and on code that was previously working just fine, even when I created a new project directly from the repo. The part that makes this difficulty to troubleshoot is that even while running in TRACE there are no other messages that indicate why the copying the javascript files fails. I reviewed all of the code and no highlighted warnings or errors showed up.</p>
<p>I tried numerous things to solve this, including the clean operations in CLI, Studio, deleting the build folders manually, upgrading node, npm, switching SDK versions, deleting simulator content and settings, studio build, cli build, etc. The only solution for me was to uninstall titanium cli 3.2.1 and reinstall using 3.2.0 </p>
<ul>
<li><p>sudo npm uninstall titanium -g</p>
</li>
<li><p>sudo npm install titanium@3.2.0 -g</p>
</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>Interesting. I am running on a fairly new MBP with Mavericks. Strange that there are these variations for the cause of the same resulting error.</p>
