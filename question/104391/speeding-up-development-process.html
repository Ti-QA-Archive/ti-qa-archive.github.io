			<p>Hi, I really love the appcelerator concept, however I find developing to be very slow, perhaps I&#39;m doing something wrong.</p>
<p>I&#39;m currently using Eclipse as my IDE to develop an Android app.  However what I find is that each deployment of a simple code change can take upwards of 2 minutes to load on the emulator.  Couple that with lots of JS typos, syntax errors, etc and productivity drops.  On top of that the Android emulator seems to have every few minutes causing me to kill the process and restart.  Overall I&#39;m having a tough time being productive.</p>
<p>Any tips?</p>

							<p>As strange as it may sound for Android development, I find development much faster to code, debug, and test most of the project targeting the iPhone, then periodically build for Android and just tweak what needs to change.  This is true even when I don&#39;t need an iphone version.</p>
<p>Advantages to prototyping in iphone:</p>
<ul>
<li>More *.js lint warnings detected which could point out unintentional typos or bugs in your code</li>
<li>Simulator starts WAY faster than android emulator</li>
<li>Simulator runs code much faster</li>
<li>Aside from app.js, external *.js context windows can be tested dynamically</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me explain the last point because it is the source of a MAJOR improvement in productivity and the crux of why I develop&#x2F;debug for iphone even when I want an android target.</p>
<p>For an iphone simulator build, the <em>.js files are run directly by the simulator without going through the compile step needed for a distribution build.  While this saves some time by itself, the real advantage is that the simulator will dynamically use whatever changes you make to a </em>.js file when you navigate to a window using an external <em>.js reference (i.e. the url property).  So changes to app.js still need to relaunch the project.  But for windows opened later, you can navigate to the window to see how it looks or test code, then just hit the back button in the navigation bar, tweak the </em>.js, and navigate back to the desired window and immediately see the new layout or test the code changes.</p>
<p>This makes tweaking UI layout stuff incredibly fast compared to the android emulator, not to mention code&#x2F;debug cycles for some *.js logic is as quick as backing up a screen, revising the code, and showing the screen again.  Then when you get the logic worked out, switch to android and retest.</p>
<p>Obviously, this does not work for android specific portions of the SDK and the UI layouts are not exactly the same, but IMHO can still lead to some <strong>significant</strong> increases in productivity.</p>
<p>YMMV, but I thought I&#39;d toss in what could sound like a completely off topic suggestion you may not have considered.</p>

							<p>I&#39;d use Aptana over Eclipse, unless you specifically need Eclipse for something else. </p>
<p>The Android phone emulator is slow, especially on hardware older than a couple of years. I recently upgraded one of my machines from a 2004-vintage XP Pro to a current dual-core and the time from cold start to booted Android emulator is like night and day. </p>
<p>It&#39;s also probably quicker to deploy and test with a real device. </p>
<p>It <em>is</em> a fairly labourious build and test cycle currently, made worse by the lack of debugging and the speed of the emulator. Hopefully this will get better with the Aptana integration.</p>

										<p><p>I use a state of the art iMac 27 with i7 processors: the emulator is slow on this machine also. I got the fastest results by prototyping the app for iphone&#x2F;ipad because of the faster emulation and debugging process and then switch to android. Instead of running the emulator I use a real device.</p>

<li>Eclipse should be showing you basic JavaScript errors</li>
<li>I would search the forum for strategies for speeding up the emulator, it is slow regardless… Is not appcelerator specific</li>
<li>do not stop the emulator between iteratations, just click the launch button</li>
<li>I would recommend, a fast machine with lots of memory</li>
<li>There is a js file referenced in the forums that provides code completion for the appcelerator API </li>

<p>JS validation is highly recommended when working with Titanium, and as an android developer it will provide your biggest time-saver. To enable Javascript validation for eclipse, you need to install the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eclipse.org&#x2F;webtools&#x2F;">wtp plugin</a> (Web Tools Platform). </p>
<p>The time it takes to boot an Android emulator or launch an app to an emulator is almost entirely dependent on Google&#39;s SDK. However, with this in mind and to give you an example for comparison, on my Ubuntu (i7 processor, 6GB memory) machine it takes 40 seconds to launch an application to an already-booted emulator, as <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.dropbox.com&#x2F;u&#x2F;14392713&#x2F;ubuntu-local.ogv">this video</a> demonstrates.</p>
<p>The adb process <strong>should not</strong> &quot;hang every few minutes causing me to kill the process and restart&quot;. If this is the case for you, open another question&#x2F;topic, following the advice in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;contribute.html#participating_in_the_q&amp;a">Participating in the Q&amp;A</a>, to ensure that you get accurate answers quickly. I will look out for it, and help you through it.</p>

							<p>Have no idea how old these questions are because no date of posting is listed.. (by design?)..  I think they are relatively old since one of the messages talks about waiting for Aptana intergration and that has be long since completed..   I am new to Appcelerator..  i found developing for Android with it far too painful to the point its was on no use…  I purchased a brand new desktop from Bestbuy, i7 core, 8GB ram, 1TB 7,200RPM drive, etc..   When I click &quot;run&quot;, thats when I go mow the lawn, make dinner, sleep, etc..  then just to return and not find my app in the emulator.. ARGH!  I refreshed my machine, went thru the install doc&#39;s page for page.. have never been able to get the HelloWorld app working in am emulator.. Tried various Android SDK versions, nothing works..   But I refuse to give up, hoping to buy a MAC mini tonight and use the iPhone emulator..  Maybe the Android emulator is a bit faster and more stable on a MAC.. time will tell..</p>

							<p>Android emulator is painfull slow and unreliable. As soon as your app starts to become more complex it will stop runnin most of the time on the emulator to eventually start 1 out of 10 times. But only if you have a lucky streak.</p>
<p>Best advice to speed development up is to actualy get yourself a mac, develop using the iPhone simulator and regularly check for problems on the android emulator. Finally, if you get to the point I&#39;m at - forget the android emulator, do good console output and start debuggin on an android device.</p>

							<p>hi, I&#39;m new to Titanium&#x2F;Appcelerator.  I am working on a Windows 7 pc now.  Really like the concept of it all, but i too find the android development painfully slow, as one tiny syntax error will cause me to have to restart the app.  But i want to make sure i&#39;m doing this right.  I use the Titanium Studio.  I always see mentions of some &quot;Launch App&quot; button in Titanium &quot;Developer&quot;, which I believe i read is no longer used, and has been integrated to the studio.</p>
<p>So in the studio, I usually in the Project explorer right click on my project, select Run As &gt; Android Emulator.  It takes 2-3 mins to load.</p>
<p>Now the important part is when i have an error, and need to fix it and rerun.  I normally click the emulators back button to go to the home screen, and then i do the same thing, select Run As &gt; Android Emulator.  Is this the right process, or is there an easier way to restart&#x2F;refresh?</p>
<p>As Frank mentioned at the top, every few times i rerun, I get some random errors in red in the console, usually about a few things, among them &#x2F;string.xml.  Sometimes i have to kill the emulator bcz of this, or if the emulator sits for a long time, i may have to restart.  But sometimes cleaning the project, touching the tiapp.xml, and selecting Run As again seems to work.</p>
<p>Any advice?  Of our macs here, most are osx 10.6, so I understand i need to upgrade to 10.7 to be able to compile and to get the iphone emulator to work?  </p>
<p>I may try to go the mac&#x2F;iphone dev route as most suggested.  And to be sure, we cannot run the iphone emulator on windows, right?</p>
<p>Thanks, excited and hope i can make this a success for our company.</p>
