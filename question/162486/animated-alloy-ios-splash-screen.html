			<h1>Animated Alloy iOS splash screen?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, I know to change Titanium Alloy&#39;s default splash screen you can just replace Default.png in assets, but is there a way to change how this screen transitions or make the splash screen itself animate? Thanks</p>

							<p>You cannot do so directly. The best you can do is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure your app loads as quickly as possible</li>
<li>Create a window containing the animation you want to use, then show it as the first window of your app</li>
<li>After showing the animation briefly, close this window and open your app&#39;s &quot;main&quot; window</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind that most users will see the splash screen only once unless the app is killed (by the os or user). Otherwise, your app would be in a paused state and when reopened would go directly to the screen the user left off at, bypassing the opening animation.</p>
<p>Further, keep in mind that Apple recommends you don&#39;t use a launch image (splash screen) at all. They recommend you simply launch directly into the app so that the user can get started without any unnecessary delay.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you very much! Even if Apple recommends against them, I&#39;ve read that Titanium requires a splash screen, and that if you delete the files you&#39;ll run into problems, is that true?</p>

										<p><p>Right, you have to have a splash screen with a Ti app. I suppose it might work without one, in which case the user would see a black screen while the app loads. That&#39;s no better than giving them something nice to look at.</p>
