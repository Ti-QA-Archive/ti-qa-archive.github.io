			<h1>Remove WebView frame when loading a PDF</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>When you load a PDF in a <code>WebView</code> you get a border on the side of the pages. Is it possible to remove this? I&#39;ve searched this again and again and have had no luck. I&#39;ve even gone as far as editing the TiUIWebView.m and .h source in the SDK</p>

							<div><p><em>Ronnie</em>, have you seen this accomplished in other iOS apps in the AppStore?  If so, maybe try and find out if those were compiled with the Titanium SDK. If they were not compiled with this mobile sdk, then I would guess it&#39;s not going to be possible, unless you <strong><em>heavily</em></strong> tweak the SDK&#39;s source code as you had mentioned.  As far as I know, PDFs loading on Apple mobile devices within webviews <em>always</em> load with borders.  This is native functionality coded deep within iOS. Titanium has it&#39;s limits, even if you are altering it&#39;s source SDK files. The only way around this might be to program your app in Objective-C…and even then, you might not be able to change Apple&#39;s &#39;default&#39; functionality for loading PDF&#39;s inside of webviews. Maybe try searching for some Objective-C solutions to this problem. If you can find those, then you&#39;re in business with transferring those lines of code (with some modification) over to Titanium&#39;s SDK source files.</p>
<p>Sorry I didn&#39;t have any better news for ya though. I&#39;m still learning all the ins and outs of Titanium, so don&#39;t take my comment as the last, but this is what I have found when trying to highly-customize every detail and the user-experience of my apps.</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;ve seen it done in objective c on some posts I found on stack overflow. I don&#39;t have the links handy at the moment, but ya I figure I&#39;m not the only one who&#39;s wondered this</p>
