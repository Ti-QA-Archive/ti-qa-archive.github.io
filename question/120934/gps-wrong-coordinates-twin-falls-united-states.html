			<h1>GPS. Wrong coordinates. Twin Falls, United States.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Titanium SDK version: 1.6.2<br>iPhone Device family: iphone<br>iPhone SDK version: 4.2</p>
<p>I am developing an iOS app that uses GPS data on a map. There is a strange problem occuring. The first GPS data registered are always Twin Falls, United States. I live in Sweden so this is totally wrong. Is this a default behavior of some sort? When I get the GPS coordinates the next time it is correct.</p>
<p>Does anyone have a solution for this?</p>

							<p>I think the answer is that GPS is a little awkward. It is rare to get the correct co-ordinates first time.</p>
<p>I resolved this by calling the get co-ordinates function 2&#x2F;3 times before setting the event listener for position change. Always waiting for at least the second call to return before continuing.</p>
<p>Set a time out just incase the call hangs, which it can do.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

										<p><p>The main app I have done this in is large and would be out of context to post just a few snippets.</p>
<p>I will try and put together a test app and let you have the code.</p>
<p>Basically I just use a counter which is set on a successful return of location. and timeout which causes the loop to exit.</p>

							<p>This is the way the GPS works. It needs a lot of time to &quot;cold start&quot; so it takes the data it has cached form a previous usage.<br>I use the location event started with a very small distance filter, then after I get the location I close this event (of course if I do not need it ).<br>Keep in mind that everything is async and you have to let the user know that the app is working or it will think it&#39;s a bug :)</p>
