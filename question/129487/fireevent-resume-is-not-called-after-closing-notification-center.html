							<div><p>Ok - is pause supposed to be called? Seems the app still runs with NC showing…<br>My issue is coming from the &#39;pause&#39;, but it also fires &#39;focus&#39; to the top window! So my app is pausing, but the top window is getting a focus (which I use as part of the resume call to restore the app to a running state)</p>
<p>on closing NC - &#39;resumed&#39; is fired, which gets me out of trouble.<br>and by adding a paused flag to my app I can tell the focus to be ignored if it&#39;s set.</p>

							<p>Hi Mick,</p>
<p>Can you explain again what you did? Are you using the &#39;focus&#39; event to know when your app is &#39;unpaused&#39;?</p>
<p>My experience has been that<br>-locking the phone<br>-opening the notification center<br>-using Siri</p>
<p>…all simply pause your app, but don&#39;t put it into a &quot;background&quot; state - which means that the &#39;resume&#39; event is never called. &#39;Resume&#39; seems to only get called if you hit the home button, putting your app into the background, and then re-open your app.</p>
<p>I have been trying to figure out if there is an &#39;unpause&#39; event that I can use… I will play around with &#39;focus&#39;.</p>

										<p><p>Wow, this is interesting: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;98321&#x2F;resume-event-not-fired-on-unlock</p>
<p>Going to try that. It says that &quot;resumed&quot; will get called when the app gets unpaused, while &quot;resume&quot; is only after getting closed.</p>

										<p><p>My app uses a lot of TCP communication - the messages sent depends on which window is in the foreground.<br>The focus event is used throughout my app to start the message timers.<br>So on pause - I fire blur to the front window to stop the timer. On resume - I fire focus to re-start the timer.</p>
<p>The issue with Notification Center: Pause is fired (so my app fires blur).<br>But immediately a focus is fired even though NC is in the foreground<br>(This causes a MAJOR problem). As I mentioned above - I beat it by setting&#x2F;clearing a &#39;paused flag on pause&#x2F;resumed, and then in my focus event - if(myapp.paused) return</p>
<p>And closing NC and returning to app does not fire resume, so now I&#39;m using resumed.</p>
