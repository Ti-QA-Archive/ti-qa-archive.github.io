			<h1>Android deployment target greyed out on New Titanium Module Project</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m hoping someone might be able to assist. I have installed Titanium Studio, Xcode and the Android SDK on my Mac. All have just been updated to the very latest versions. I am able to open a new module project and select either iOS or Mobile Web as deployment targets, but the Android option remains greyed out. Titanium preferences have been updated to point to the Android SDK, which it finds. But the option to open an Android project remains greyed out.</p>
<p>I would appreciate any pointers.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Have you tried running the Android configuration from within Studio?</p>
<ul>
<li>When you first start studio you should have a <strong>dashboard</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Locate the <strong>Getting Started</strong> button; not overly obvious, will be in a row where one has a red background</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Android</strong> button</li>
<li>Choose the button that appears on the right side</li>
<li>Follow this process and it should set everything up for you.</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>@sammy, assuming you have tried the above I would suggest you start a. We question and provide as much information about your experience as possible.  You are not going to find anyone on this 6 month old question helping you except me and I am about to go to sleep.</p>
<p>The above should solve most of the android setup and detection issues so make sure you followed the bullet points and if still failing - create the new question.</p>
