			<h1>Geo Location Application</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have looked at the Geo Location samples for appcelerator.  I have a question on a specific application specification.  The requirement of the application is that the user is only going to be able to see a specific area. (the area is about 15 miles by 1.5 mile).  Only a list of locations give by the user will be shown on the application.  All the samples that I have seen do not restrict the user to viewing a specific mapped area.  Is this possible in appcelerator?</p>

							<p>the specific area is set by the region… there is nothing to prevent the user from scrolling the map.</p>
<p>Not sure if that answered the question? Can you be more specific</p>

										<p><p>I think the question for me is what do you mean by &quot;limit&quot;.</p>
<p>you could create the map, plot the annotations and then convert the map to a image, and only render the image.</p>
<p>Seems like a horrible hack, but it just might work</p>

							<p>Dear Mr Sanders,</p>
<p>The application is for a group that manages a bicycle trail that runs through several towns.  The group would like the application to give them their specific location and then show them specific points of interest that the group has relationships with.  They currently have a web site that has maps of the routes and points of interest.  The maps have been specifically created for the application and only cover the length of the trail from north to south (about 30 miles) and then about 2 miles east to west.<br>I think you have answered my question which is that there is no way for an application to limit the map that the users sees to this small specific area.</p>
<p>Scott</p>
