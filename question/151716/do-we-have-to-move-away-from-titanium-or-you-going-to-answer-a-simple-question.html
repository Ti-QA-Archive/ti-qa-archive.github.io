							<p>Hi </p>
<p>It is clear you are unhappy and frustrated, but from what I can tell you had a single question yesterday that that yet to be answered.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why that is;</p>
<ul>
<li>You asked a question that very few people will have experienced</li>
<li>You asked this question on a Sunday</li>
<li>The question is best answered by an Appcelerator staff member</li>
<li>Employees are not usually available during the weekends and even those that are, this is a specifically difficult question</li>
<li>The Q&amp;A is community driven and almost all the people giving answers are not employees, are not getting paid and are not doing this in their own spare time</li>
<li>You have now provided 3 answers to your own question yesterday, to those looking at the list of questions - they see a big 3 in the question box - they figure that question has already had 3 people assisting - so no need to jump in.  Use comments next time on your own question.</li>
<li>Those answers appear as if someone else wrote them rather than you - so it also confuses things.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tone down the negative stance you have as you are going to get no-where with a bad attitude.</p>
<p>When I started this message you had -1, right now it is -5.  Be polite and patient, we all have times when we need assistance - but it is not our fault your system didn&#39;t&#x2F;doesn&#39;t work or that the right person with the right knowledge has appeared right away (and on a weekend).</p>

							<p>Who are you?</p>
<p>And just who do you think you are talking to here?<br>You <strong>do know</strong> this a community driven forum don&#39;t you?</p>
<p>Now if you ever want to get in touch with Appcelerator, you can always do so <strong><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;contact-us&#x2F;">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>But please, venting some steam is one thing (we all do from time to time) But simply coming here and ranting about a problem you don&#39;t even take the time to detail. That&#39;s another thing.</p>

										<p><p>I totally agree. But in my opinion this Q&amp;A forum is so diabolical to navigate now and hard for newcomers to really know &#39;who&#39; is &#39;powering&#39; it or who is responsible for its content.  </p>
<p>(I can&#39;t get over how much a really hate that top hover-drop-down menu to get anywhere USEFUL for developers.) </p>
<p>Documentation and support links&#x2F;info etc. for newcomers are <em>all</em> over the place. It&#39;s bad enough as a seasoned Titanium dev to find the info of what I need, outside the documentation. </p>
<p>My 2c.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ll give you that and I&#39;m not saying all this is a walk in the park by any means.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Michael if you are thinking that people are silence here and are not answering didnt mean that they want to pay you.Trust me they have much lucrative jobs.You have to wait fo some time to get your answer.All the people are not experienced in same technology some have more idea related to geolocation,some related to Api and etc and i am 100% sure whenever somebody suitable would see that he could answer you he would answer you and you have to elaborate your answer more.Here take a look at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;ask">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;ask</a></p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>Michael, </p>
<p>I still think you need to take some time and cool your head. As many people suggested here. just relax, get your thoughts together and also be patient. As Malcolm mentioned, you asked your question on a weekend and Appc being on the west coast, they barely opened their office a few hours ago at this time of the day. I&#39;m pretty sure someone there will take the time to help you out with the problems you are facing. But as you said <em>&quot;when the client pays&quot;</em>, in this case, I believe you  are not paying so you can&#39;t complaing much about not getting your money&#39;s worth.</p>
<p>One more thing, don&#39;t toot you horn with stuff like: <strong>&quot;My company field makes millions&quot;</strong>, <strong>&quot;I&#39;m the CEO of my company&quot;</strong>, etc. That doesn&#39;t bring anything to the table and it will not get you a faster answer (or respect for that matter). You can look me up on Google if you want, you&#39;ll see that these kind of titles and number don&#39;t impress me… At all…</p>
<p>Now that being said, <strong>what is</strong> the problem you are facing actually?</p>

										<p><p>Hi Michael</p>
<p>I would just like to point out, that as community we endeavour to help. I have to agree with the guys who have answered so far. We do this because we enjoy it and like passing on our knowledge and expertise to others.</p>
<p>If you require full support then you should contact Appcelerator and get a support agreement, or sign up for the new Corporate offerings. Or even contact one of us directly and offer to pay for their time to resolve your issues.</p>
<p>I have looked at your previous question and being honest have no idea what you are asking.</p>
<p>Please take your time and put into a question what you are having an issue with be precise and concise and I am sure one of the community will be all over it to help.</p>
<p>T….</p>
