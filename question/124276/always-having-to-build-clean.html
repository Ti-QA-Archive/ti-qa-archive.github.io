		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Titanium Studio: 1.0.0.201106141356<br>SDK: 1.8.0.v20110811101746</p>
<p>Problem is that I&#39;m always having to build clean as otherwise it doesn&#39;t appear to pick up any of the changes to the files I&#39;m working on.</p>
<p>This is quite a nuisance as before I could quite easily change the JS file, hit the button to load on simulator and I&#39;d be up and testing with my changes.</p>
<p>Now if I do this it doesn&#39;t appear to pick any of the changes up and I have to forcibly clean then build.</p>
<p>I believe this started happening when I switched the SDK (because there was bugs in 1.7.x I had to switch to 1.8)</p>
<p>Is there somewhere&#x2F;some setting for this? I assumed the Ti Studio is checking the dates on files&#x2F;touched etc…… so no idea why this would break.</p>

							<div><p>Yeah certainly a problem with the 1.8.x builds.</p>
<p>I switched back to 1.7.2 (other problem no longer showing which is a way weird problem with the runtime JS interpreter picking weird locations to say methods didn&#39;t exist..) and the re-build picks up changes in the code files without having to build clean..</p>
<p>&lt;sigh&gt;</p>
<p>Buggy.. spend half my time tracking Titanium issues as opposed to the gains I make from developing with it.</p>

							<p>Builds from our continuous builds site can be very unstable and unpredictable. We provide NO SUPPORT (even for Customers) that encounter problems from a CI build. These builds should be considered a BETA of sorts, and while they provide fixes and features, they also at times contain new bugs. For more info, see <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Continuous+Builds">this post in the wiki</a></p>

										<p><p>Hi Matt,</p>
<p>I understand and know the risks. But my statement about general buggyness applies even to the released versions. I&#39;ve done a number of &quot;advanced&quot; apps and I must admit I spent a lot of time tracking through the forums for the &quot;tweaks&quot; and work arounds (or modifying underlying ObjC code).</p>
<p>I also ack that the quality has improved dramatically over the last year and I&#39;m not a paying customer. </p>
<p>Thanks for the answer.</p>
<p>Chris</p>

										<p><p>I 100% understand where you are coming from, and if you are seeing issues with the GA builds I completely encourage you to post here, and to file bugs in JIRA.</p>
<p>The reason for my statement, is this: No matter how good a platform is, it will always have bugs, and so users will always need to search the Q&amp;A for answers to issues they find. When questions are posted regarding ours, or another companies beta software that is released with the understanding that it has bugs, and is provided to test and develop for features that are still being built. The issue comes into play where users down the road are searching for an answer about 1.8 when its released and they find a bunch of things about the beta, it can cause confusion, especially for new users. We always want and encourage questions and bug tickets for released versions when an issue is found, but for the CI builds it just causes issues for other users.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Matt,</p>
<p>Can anyone post to the Jira? I remember being able to look on lighthouse until perhaps 4 months ago then it seemed I needed some account (possibly just my appcelerator account, but it never req&#39;d one before).</p>
<p>Also, without searching, is there an easy way to contribute back to the source? I&#39;ve done a number of bugfixes and useful additions that I&#39;d like to see in the main release as opposed to me having to maintain separately. </p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Chris</p>

										<p><p>We have a community section to JIRA that anyone can post to, once someone on the developer relations team like myself aproves it, it moves on to the core team for a fix.</p>
<p>As for contributing to the source, the details of how to do that are found <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Contributing+to+Titanium#ContributingtoTitanium-ContributingCode">here</a>, but yes thats 100% doable and encouraged!</p>
