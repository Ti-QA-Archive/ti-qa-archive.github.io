			<h1>scrollView stopped scrolling after View added above it.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I just tried to update one of my apps by adding advertisements to the top of each page. So before I just had one scrollView on the page. Now there is a View (ads) at the top and then below that is the original scrollView. All I did was move the scrollView 50px from the top and add a View 50px tall above it.</p>
<p>In the simulator everything works fine. You can scroll the scrollView with no problems. When I tested it on my device you can not scroll the scrollView at all. But if you click on a button or image within the scrollView it will work properly and scroll after that.</p>
<p>It is like the ad View is selected by default on load and the touch does nothing since it assumes you are in that View. You need to &#39;select&#39; the scrollView by interacting with it before it will let you scroll. </p>
<p>Is there a way to tell the app to auto select the scrollView for the user, or get it the app to ignore the new ad View?</p>
<p>Current layout is</p>
<p><code>[Window]
    [View][&amp;#x2F;View]
    [scrollView]
        [imageView][&amp;#x2F;imageView]
        [webView][&amp;#x2F;webView]
    [&amp;#x2F;scrollView]
[&amp;#x2F;Window]</code></p>

							<p>Hello Grant,</p>
<p><strong>WebViews</strong> is do not play well inside of other scrollable components. This is a limitation of the underlying native components. WebViews are pretty greedy when it comes to touch interactions and this will often steal those events from any containing views that have their own touch handlers. If you must include WebViews inside other scrollable components, your best bet will be to disable touch events on your WebView by setting its <strong>touchEnabled</strong> property to <strong>false</strong>.</p>

<p>Let me know if it works</p>
<p>Thanks<br>Jigar</p>

										<p><p>Hi Jigar,</p>
<p>Thanks for responding, but the webView has always been touchEnable false. The problem is with the new view created by ti.admob at the top of my scollView. If I remove the new view added above my scollView everything works properly.  If that makes more sense.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Grant</p>

										<p><p>just add <strong>layout : &quot;vetrical&quot;</strong> property to window and remove the <strong>top</strong> property from <strong>[View][&#x2F;View]</strong> and <strong>[ScrollView][&#x2F;ScrollView]</strong>.</p>
<p>Let me know if it works.</p>
<p>I am not sure about this because your app is working in simulator but please try this , clean build and run app again.</p>
<p>thanks<br>Jigar</p>

										<p><p>Nope didn&#39;t work, scollView still not responding with the above edit. I also tried to give the scrollView a zIndex but that didn&#39;t get it going either. Still works fine in the simulator but not on device.</p>

										<p><p>hello grant,</p>
<p>I think problem is a webview. Just remove web view from scroll view and add some other views in the scroll view instead of webview and run the app again.Can you please try like this way.</p>
<p>Let me know the output</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>Removing the webView from the scrollView has indeed fixed the problem of it not scrolling. But it wont be a solution for me since all of the content in the app&#39;s sql database has been formated in html. We pull html from the sql and display it in the webView.</p>
<p>We have been using the webView since it was the only way to properly format any large amount of text in Appcelerator. I can&#39;t use a label for 3 paragraphs of text that needs to have custom formatting. Bold, Underline, Spacing, Paragraphs etc.</p>
<p>Looks like I will need to remove the ads from these pages or figure out a different way to display them. We wanted them pinned at the top above the scroll view so they stayed on screen but this does not seem like it will work.</p>

										<p><p>Hello Grant ,</p>
<p>You can assign zIndex property to a View or you can try like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[Window] 
    [View][/View] 
    [View] 
        [scrollView] 
            [imageView][/imageView] 
            [webView][/webView] 
        [/scrollView] 
    [/View]
[/Window]
</code></pre></p>

										<p><p>Already tried that. I made a &#39;container&#39; view to put the scrollView inside of but it still resulted in the scrollView not responding. Also tried zIndex&#39;s on the scrollView its self and the &#39;container&#39; View I tried to make.</p>
<p>The original question has been answered with your help so I will mark it as correct if anyone else runs into this. Seems now my problem will be how to display ads working around this problem.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>
