							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Titanium is a cross platform app development system.  It is designed to provide a very simple way to create an app that &quot;could&quot; be used on more than one platform using the same code.</p>
<p>There are differences for each platform, and you are able to provide code that says; if iOS do this, but if Android do it this way.  Those are usually limited to the sections of the platform operating systems that do not have direct equivalents, for example;</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS has a navigation controller that handles windows opening and automatic back button creation</li>
<li>Android does not, it does have other ways to achieve the same goal though, including ActinoBar on newer versions of the Android system.</li>
</ul>
<p>But in short you write your app in JavaScript, add any logic for platform specific behaviours and then Titanium will compile your app to iOS or Android, or both. You also now work with Blackberry and soon (so we are told) windows phone.</p>
<p>The are things you have to have to work on specific platforms, iOS requires use of an Apple Mac of some fashion for example.</p>
<p>All that information can be found here ; <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Titanium_Compatibility_Matrix">Titanium Compatibility Matrix</a></p>
<p>You can get up and running in minutes once you have downloaded the Titanium Studio and followed the setup guides for your target platforms.</p>
<p>Have fun.</p>

										<p><p>Having just seen your clarification, here is more information;</p>
<ul>
<li>You cannot take an app created for iOS using ObjectiveC and import it into Titanium</li>
<li>You cannot take an app create for Android in Java and import it into Titanium</li>
<li>You can create a single cross platform app in Titanium and compile for both platforms and Blackberry and Windows phone (when available)</li>
</ul>
<p>You have to start by using Titanium.</p>

							<p>If I had a dev build an iPhone app for me, could I take the code that he sends me and put it into Titanium and create the Android version? Instead of using web languages from the start could it take the code from iPhone or Android and create the other?</p>

										<p><p>I think some people may have thought you wanted to take existing code others had created and simply churned out another version without having to do any real work yourself.</p>
<p>It happens, it does not mean it was a bad question, just one some may have misunderstood.</p>
<p>It happens to us all at some point, even me :-(</p>
