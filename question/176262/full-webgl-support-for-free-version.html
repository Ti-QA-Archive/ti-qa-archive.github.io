			<h1>Full webgl support for free version???</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi. I&#39;m just become a registered member in the comunity. I&#39;m willing to begin building my apps. Hope to learn fast and so bring to market some apps non-viable with others frameworks…</p>
<p>But I don&#39;t want surprises: My apps will be using webgl most part of time as as are video&#x2F;image related processing apps. Can I do such things with the free version of Titamium??? I don&#39;t mind paying for that if necessary but, when learning, I&#39;d like using free vrersion and then, after testing if things goes fine, upgrade another step.</p>
<p>So, Do I get full access to webgl with the free version of appcelerator?</p>
<p>Thx.</p>

							<p>This isnt really a question about Titanium, its about the support for WebGL within browsers &#x2F; mobile browsers . Take a look <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;WebGL#Mobile_browsers">here</a></p>

										<p><p>WebGL is a browser technology so it will only work  within a web browser.  The link provided explains support and fir ios as an example full support is nit due until Ios8.  So. Titanium webView running on ios 8 may give you want you want.  Keep in mind this is nit a Titanium restriction, the same issues will occur in all dev platforms as far as i can see.</p>

							<p>Nick:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">I'm developing <span class="hljs-keyword">some</span> apps using WebGL, web apps right now.
</code></pre><p> I can execute them on some android devices using HTML5,  css3 and Javascript so, they work.</p>
<p>What I want to know is whether I will be able to &#39;compile&#39; them with Titanium as the version of the product is the free version or not. I read on the web there are some issues with this, so you have to pay for the version which can do this… Is that true?</p>
<p>First I&#39;d like to test Titanium for free and know if it can suit my needs and then, if necessary upgrading for a better suite, I&#39;ll do it for sure. </p>
<p>I tried another tool (beggining with letter &#39;P&#39;) and got webgl operations were veeeeery slowly.</p>
<p>So the question remains: Can I implement webgl process and will it compile with appcelerator whit the free version I&#39;m about to get?</p>
<p>Thx.</p>

							<p>Titanium is open source and FREE. Read <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;162147&#x2F;what-is-the-pricing-agreemeant-for-appcelerator.html#answer-274689">here</a> for a full explanation.  </p>
<p>No, you cant just &#39;compile&#39; WebGL and expect it to work in Titanium.. See <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;6313768&#x2F;deploy-webgl-applications-as-native-ios-or-android-applications">here</a></p>

							<p>Nick:</p>
<p>Thanks for the links.<br>For the first one, now I know Titanium is free and there&#39;s no missing features relating to just coding…</p>
<p>About the second link, I have to admit that now I&#39;m a bit confused… I&#39;ve been reading for a while the link and related ones and now don&#39;t know whether makes sense using Titatium and then coding by my own the webkit related glue and more… Maybe could be better just coding an Android native app and then another for iOS… well, crazy…</p>
<p>All the info I&#39;ve been reading for some days made me think the best option for building all platforms native apps  was Titanium. Now, your link directs me to Ludei, which handles webgl very well (they say) but, it seems no compilation takes place…..But instead of that what not symply a typical web app and just do what I actually do??? … To be honest, don&#39;t know how Ludei tool works  (Something more: Don&#39;t like the idea of submitting my source code to &#39;compile&#39;)</p>
<p>Better making some tests instead to get a better idea of what to do… Maybe I could leave webgl out of Titanium compilation and make calls to compiled functions (will it work?…)</p>
<p>Well… I&#39;ll be back with many questions after playing with this.</p>
<p>Thx Nick.</p>

										<p><p>Malcolm:</p>
<p>You&#39;re right! I&#39;m not used to make questions in forums. I usually find the answer to any question I     have looking at those and no need to participate. This time I&#39;m a bit lost because I&#39;ve been looking for info about my question and all that I&#39;ve found seems to be a bit confusing for me. So I asked for help, Nick helped me and then I answered appreciating his help… It&#39;s fine to say thanks.</p>
<p>So, again, you&#39;re right.</p>
<p>And now back to working on understanding what&#39;s on this webgl with Titanium.<br>Regards.</p>
