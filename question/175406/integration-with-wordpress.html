			<h1>Integration with WordPress</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am developing a application for iPad from which my user will post data to his&#x2F;her wordpress blog. How can i achieve this. In Google i found some resource regarding this integration but as I was new to Titanium, I am getting confused with those resources. Can anyone suggest me how to do this. I want some clear explanation. </p>
<p>I found that by using JSON API plugin in WordPress we can post data to the WordPress blog and also we can retrieve the data. If this is the way, how can we do it. </p>
<p>In my application I am integrating the following features, </p>
<ul>
<li>user login using WordPress credentials.</li>
<li>Posting a new post to his&#x2F;her blog.</li>
<li>While creating a new post user can including attachments like pictures and video clips. </li>
</ul>
<p>Regard&#39;s</p>

							<div><p>Hi  Upendra ,</p>
<p>you can use the service <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;apiomat.com">APIOMAT</a>. In this BAAS is a WP - gateway. It works awesome!. On the other hand there is a JSONAPI module in wordpress.</p>

							<div><p>Hi Rainer, Thanks for your suggestions. From the side of Titanium I am using HttpClient for sending requests to the WordPress. Now I choose JSON API for accessing data in WordPress and now I am able to post data to the WordPress site. But as of my knowledge JSON API did&#39;nt provided any methods for user login. If you have any idea regarding this please share it to me.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>You need to investigate the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;HTTPClient_and_the_Request_Lifecycle">HTTPClient and the Request Lifecycle</a> documentation.  This gives you the building blocks of sending a remote request to server and retrieve the results of that request if there any.</p>
<p>These are also must reads;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Working_with_Remote_Data_Sources">Working with Remote Data Sources</a></li>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Network.HTTPClient">Titanium Network HTTPClient</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is an ambitious first app, I suggest you spend some time learning the basics before attempting to remote connect to third-party services.  Start with some tables, windows, navigation, buttons, events.  Network calls (especially those to third-party services) can and often are, complicated - understanding the basics makes it easier to understand how to resolve some of the difficulties you will encounter.  This is not a Titanium fault - it is just that things like network authorisation, custom headers, session monitoring are not the easiest first time problems to understand.</p>
<p>Good luck though</p>

										<p><p>I assume this has answered your question about how to connect to external APIs - as you have asked a follow question related to this.</p>
<p>So can we assume this is answered?</p>

										<p><p>Hi Malcolm, Thanks for your quick reply and for the clear explanation. But this is not the exact answer for my question. With my question I am willing to know about connecting my app to WordPress a site. It is my mistake that i have not clearly mentioned what I want in my question. In this question I asked regarding posting data to an WordPress site from titanium app, i achieved this by using HTTPClient on Titanium and JSON API plugin on WordPress side. So for posting data to WordPress i found an solution. Here is the code that i tried </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var req = <span class="hljs-string">"http://localhost/wordpress/api/?json=create_post&amp;nonce=a6962cd217&amp;status=publish&amp;title=TitleOfThisPost&amp;content=ContentOfThisPost&amp;author=AuthorName"</span>;
    var conn = Ti.Network.createHTTPClient({
                onload : function(e){
                    Ti.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">"Resp: "</span>+this.responseText);
                },
                onerror : function(e){
                    Ti.API.debug(<span class="hljs-string">"Error: "</span>+e.error);
                }
            });
            conn.open(<span class="hljs-string">"<span class="hljs-keyword">GET</span>"</span>, req);
            conn.setRequestHeader(<span class="hljs-string">"Content-Type"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"application/x-www-form-urlencoded"</span>);
            conn.send();
</code></pre><p>By using this I am able to send data to the WordPress site.<br>Thank You.</p>

										<p><p>I am not sure what you are saying here.  Are you saying;</p>
<ul>
<li>You were not able to send data to the JSON API you had already referenced?</li>
<li>You did not understand how httpClient worked?</li>
</ul>
<p>If this in the case what did you do that I did not point out?  I am also not sure if this question is answered or not.  You asked how you could send data, you were shown everything you needed to achieve that - given all the examples were in the documentation links provided - so surely this is now answered?</p>
