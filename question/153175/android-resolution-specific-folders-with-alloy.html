			<h1>android resolution specific folders with alloy</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>I can&#39;t display images paced under resolution specific folders lik -hdpi, -xhdpi, -mdpi, -ldpi.</p>
<p>Is it working for you?</p>
<p>I would like to load images from &quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;&lt;res-hdpi&gt;&#x2F;tabicons&#x2F;default.png&quot;. I tried every possible combination: with and without leading slash, with and without &quot;res&quot;, or &quot;tabicons-hdpi&quot;, none of them works. If I move the resource in a folder without &quot;hdpi&quot;, the image correctly displays.</p>
<p>I&#39;m using titanium CLI but the problem is he same also with Studio.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Titanium SDK:</strong> 3.1.0.GA</li>
<li><strong>Platform &amp; version:</strong> android 4.2.2, device</li>
<li><strong>Host Operating System:</strong> OS X 10.7.5</li>

							<p>To help reduce confusion, I added a test app to the alloy github repository that shows exactly how to handle android density specific images files. It&#39;s a very basic app to make it clear exactly how it works: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;alloy&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;test&#x2F;apps&#x2F;advanced&#x2F;android_density">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;alloy&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;test&#x2F;apps&#x2F;advanced&#x2F;android_density</a>. This will show exactly how it works.</p>

										<p><p>You&#39;re right, it&#39;s not a good example, it&#39;s a great example. The size is of each image irrelevant. Each image file consists of black text on a white background. The text corresponds to which density-specific android folder was used to house the image. That way if you run this app on a low density screen, you know it is working if you see the image that says &quot;LDPI&quot;. Same goes for a high density screen and &quot;HDPI&quot;. </p>
<p>This shows you exactly how to use the folders, gives you a visual cue to confirm that they are working, and does so in the bare minimum of code possible. What more were you expecting from a sample? This was tailored specifically to your problem.</p>

										<p><p>It is not a good example for a real world app. A 300x300 image in a 300x300 container on a xhdpi device is BAD! This is a test and supposed to teach something like how to use images in real apps. This is teaching something wrong. I&#39;m afraid you think it is not only a good but a &quot;great&quot; example…</p>

										<p><p>Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read your original question</li>
<li>Look at the sample I gave</li>
<li>Realize that the sample I gave answers your question exactly and completely</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have additional questions, like &quot;How do I properly make low, medium, and high density versions of a single image&quot;, then ask them as another question. But realize that that is not what you asked and your original question, which has been answered in full.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m not here to troll.. There&#39;s no &quot;difficult situation&quot;, Aaron… I just think that test apps should be perfect because users learn from those, and this android_density app is not perfect. Aside from this, I&#39;m sorry Luke but your app doesn&#39;t solve my original problem (I read my original question, and you?), cause I said one of my attempts was the 4 folders &quot;res-ldpi, res-mdpi, res-hdpi, res-xhdpi&quot;. Now, if you think you deserve the &quot;best answer&quot;, I will give you, no problem. I know you spent time trying to solve my problem and I thank you for that.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m saying your attempts at using those folders were likely in the wrong place or you were trying to access the files from those folders incorrectly. The sample app shows you exactly how to do that. Why not just put your density specific images in place of the <code>theImage.png</code> in all the folders? Would that not be exactly the same thing?</p>
<p>The test app is not &quot;perfect&quot;, as perfect doesn&#39;t exist in development. It is however an exact answer to your original question. It shows, in detail, how to achieve what you were unable to get working. I don&#39;t typically create full test cases for developers when they have issues, I usually request them. I thought I would be nice and go the extra mile in your case. I see that that was apparently a mistake because you are unable to draw a line between the sample app and how you can apply the <em>same exact principles</em> to your own app. </p>
<p>So… if you still need help and are still unable to use android density specific images in your app despite the instruction given in the test app, I&#39;m still here. Please provide a minimal test project that displays your issue, minimal meaning pretty much identical to the sample I gave you. It can&#39;t just be code since you&#39;ve made it clear that the sample app which provides this information is not adequate. A minimal, complete test project (not your whole app) that includes the density specific resources you want to use since the size of the images, even in a POC, is very important to you.</p>

										<p><p>Examples are for learning, tests are for proofs.</p>
<p>Tests are used to determine the validity of a claim (such as technical knowledge, or technical operations).</p>
<p>Your complaint in a nutshell &#39;its broken&#39;.</p>
<p>Tony responds with a test that shows that no, the tooling works, the tooling is &#39;not broken&#39;.</p>
<p>Your respond with &#39;It is not a good example… all images are 300x300&#39; (please note your use of the word &#39;example&#39; vs the use of Tony&#39;s word &#39;test&#39;)</p>
<p>Regarding @aarons statement, it <strong>is</strong> a &#39;difficult situation&#39; for Tony as he can&#39;t publicly call you a jackwipe for being ignorant and rude to someone trying to assist you.</p>

										<p><p>thanks for the android_density example! I think it would be good to add the assets&#x2F;image folder to an empty alloy-default project! When I create a new project there is no image folder under assets, so I&#39;ve put my images inside the normal assets folder and the android hres images inside the assets&#x2F;android&#x2F;images (which is create by default). And thats where I&#39;ve mixed up the folders. When using assets&#x2F;images it works. So if it was there it would be better.</p>

										<p><p>quick update: when I change your image to a view and use &quot;backgroundImage: &#x2F;image&#x2F;theImage.png&quot; it will display &quot;default&quot; in my xhdpi emulator! When I just run your example with the Ti.ImageView its displaying xhdpi!</p>

										<p><p>I didn&#39;t mean to be rude, Tony, I was actually glad you made a &quot;test&quot; for me but when I discovered it was not working I started debugging and just noticed that your images were not fully resolution specific. Again, thank you for your time. I already tried to tell you that I know how to use density-specific resources on android and that my problem is with titanium (yes Stephen, this time I&#39;m saying it&#39;s broken) and not its use. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;seguri&#x2F;ti-alloy-android-density">This is the app which originally caused my troubles.</a></p>
<p>Michael G, I added a view in the first tab of my app with a resolution specific backgroundImage, can you test it with xhdpi?</p>

										<p><p>when I run your example I&#39;m seeing 64 as backgroundImage. BUT when I put a background.png file inside &#x2F;assets&#x2F;images this file will be loaded and the xhdpi images is ignored.</p>

<p>The only difference between a traditional Titanium app and Alloy is that instead of putting your platform-specific folders in <code>Resources</code> you instead put them in <code>app&amp;#x2F;assets</code></p>

										<p><p>Marco, did you find a solution to the issue. I&#39;m having the same issue with alloy and 3.0.2.</p>
<p>Something weird appears to be going on during the build with images being renamed. Here&#39;s the link: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;153433&#x2F;alloy-and-android-density-specific-images</p>

										<p><p>I didn&#39;t find a real solution. I just deleted and pasted again the images and it worked. One important step I always do before executing <code>titanium build</code> is:</p>
