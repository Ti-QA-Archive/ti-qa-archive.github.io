			<h1>Simulator crash when entering values in TextField</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Maybe this is a known issue, I&#39;m not sure as I can&#39;t seem to find anything related to my problem here in Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>Anyway, as soon as I want to enter a value into my TextField the iPhone Simulator crash. This is happens overtime but seems to be find on the actual device? Cleaning project, restarting Titanium Studio, not seems to help…</p>
<p>Anybody else experienced this before?</p>

							<div><p>Can you create a small example app that reproduces the issue and post the code. Also, it helps to share your environment specs, os, platform and version, mobile sdk version, and studio version.</p>

							<div><p>Yeah, we can&#39;t do much without some more detail. Do you have any event handlers set on this TextField?</p>

							<div><p>Hi guys. Sorry for my late reply… I wanted to give you some more details and an update on the issue. I was running Xcode 4.1 on Mac OS X Lion with the latest Titanium SDK. I moved my project to my other laptop today with pretty much the same setup on both machines. However, with one difference… On the machine which I&#39;ve experienced the issue mentioned in my original post I had Xcode 4.2 Beta 4 installed together with Xcode 4.1. </p>
<p>Working on the the other machine now which has Xcode 4.1 installed with no other BETAs of Xcode present on the machine seems to be just fine and I no longer get those crashes. </p>
<p>I suppose installing those BETA versions of Xcode might be the reason why I&#39;ve experienced those crashes.</p>

							<p>I have seen this happen when using the beta version of the iOS SDK… if this is the case with you, please downgrade to the latest GA version of xCode… if not… let us know :)</p>
