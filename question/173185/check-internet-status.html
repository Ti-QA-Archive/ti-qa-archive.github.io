							<div><p>I read this question as &quot;how can I check the network status actually resolves to a working internet connection&quot;.  As the network check only checks that it has the ability to have a connection it falls a little short of knowing if that connection will make it to the internet.</p>
<p>As I said below this is an error handler problem the app needs to do when any app API calls are made.</p>

							<div><p>Hi Malcolm thanks for replay, if i do checking url by sending a client request, this i need to call for every url before loading the page. this will display the error but after that url is active (that mean internet is connected) how can i get it back my success page. write now i am recalling the url and checking status every time at certain interval but i think it is not a correct way to achieve it.</p>

							<p>Why not just use the HTTPClient to hit something you know will be up, like Google, and then do your &quot;real work&quot; in the onLoad function?  You don&#39;t care what is returned but if it doesn&#39;t error you have internet connectivity.</p>

										<p><p>That &#39;unneeded -1&#39; was me, I can not see the pict of making a call to a third party website to check a connection status instead of correctly handling the error if there is one inside the apps own API call.</p>
