							<p>You have not said why you have created this test, have you had any failures setting titles and retrieving titles when not running this test?</p>
<p>I suspect this test is possibly causing a false negative.</p>
<p>In trying to create a thousand windows and then setting the title and asking for the title back, you are giving the system a massive amount of memory handling processes to achieve in a solution that works on call backs - so that you setting the title will start a thread to do the work, you then ask for the title straight away yet the previous thread may not have finished, thus the undefined you are seeing.</p>
<p>The underpinning of operating systems of all kinds require that the sub-systems thread out work that may not need a response so urgent that it should lock the system until that thread has complete.</p>
<p>I would imagine if you did not recreate the window and destroy it each interval you would have more success.</p>
<p>Yet it still comes back to what situation would possibly cause you to do this.</p>
<p>One last thing always use setters and getters - setTilte() and getTitle() in this case, I have found properties are best left to only be used when creating an object.</p>
<p>If your test came about because of another issue, let me know with a sample code block and we can see what is happening</p>

										<p><p>&gt; You have not said why you have created this test</p>
<p>I was logging the window title to the console for debugging. There was no more than about 3 windows, but I suppose as you pointed out above, that there wasn&#39;t enough time between setting and retrieving the title.</p>
<p>&gt; setting the title will start a thread to do the work</p>
<p>Really? That&#39;s surprising! I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a good or technical reason for that, but I don&#39;t get why it&#39;s necessary to create a thread for setting a string property.</p>
<p>Finally, for setTitle&#x2F;getTitle, I got the same results. Though, everything is fine under &quot;normal&quot; conditions (ie: with a reasonable amount of time between the calls).</p>
<p>Conclusion: that&#39;s pretty frustrating to find out that the bug you&#39;ve been tracking for hours is caused by something like that. I mean setting and getting property is pretty basic to me. If that doesn&#39;t work as expected, I wonder how many other &quot;surprises&quot; like that there is…</p>

										<p><p>Hi Patrick</p>
<p>It is not so much a bug more the way it is done.  The thread I mentioned would do more than just title - just that was what we were talking about.</p>
<p>In all operating system that manage multi-tasking there are processes that are deemed urgent so they get a higher priority and there are those that are deemed low priority.  Plus some that are deemed to be synchronous and other asynchronous.</p>
<p>Because in this case rendering the window &#39;frame&#39; can be run in parallel to allow other operations to also run at the same time.</p>
<p>There is an event for the window called &#39;open&#39; this is fired once the window object has completed it&#39;s load process.  It would be able to provide you with the title at that point.</p>

							<p>Hello,</p>
<p>— As we know that window is heavy object and if you try to open it 1000 of times, so there may be serious memory issue in the application. May be sometime application get unresponsive.</p>
<p>—  Secondly window is heavy object and it keep on adding into application stack , so only by assigning it to null you can not free the application memory ,what you need is to close the window by window.close(); so that ilt could  be removed from windows stack.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Ishan</p>
<p>This is really a new question as it is not related to the original question other than the reference to using the window title.</p>
<p>That said.  The tital area can display any view you can physically fit in that space, including nested views (see the mail app when sending an email or sms app when sending texts).</p>
<p>Simply create a view or specific control then us the window property <code>titleControl</code> or method <code>setTitleControl</code> to your change to the specific window.</p>

										<p><p>Hi</p>
<p>This is why I suggested I separate question as this additional information may not be found by others looking.</p>
<p>I mentioned you can add views, so you could use a <code>label</code> to show plain text content, you could use a <code>styledLabel</code> (available in the market place) to show HTML, a <code>button</code>, <code>slider</code>, <code>progressbar</code>, a <code>switch</code> or any other Titanium <strong>view</strong>.</p>
<p>There are some great examples in the Kitchen Sink App that show you some of the ways to mix an match.</p>

							<p>Hi Patrick, thats the result with correct way of doing with titanium</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> wrong = 0;
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> ok = 0;

function <span class="hljs-keyword">test</span>()
{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">win</span> = Ti.UI.createWindow();
    <span class="hljs-keyword">win</span>.title = <span class="hljs-string">"test"</span>;
 <span class="hljs-keyword">win</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>()
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">win</span>.title == undefined)
        wrong++;
    <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>
        ok++;
 <span class="hljs-keyword">win</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">close</span>();
    <span class="hljs-keyword">win</span> = null;
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> i=0; i &lt; 10000; ++i)
{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">test</span>();
}

alert(<span class="hljs-string">"ok:"</span>+ok+<span class="hljs-string">" wrong:"</span>+wrong);
</code></pre><p>its will give you consistent result. I think the possible reason of inconsistency in your test case is due to <code>missing win.open() and win.close()</code> also <code>Async JAVA Script behavior</code></p>
