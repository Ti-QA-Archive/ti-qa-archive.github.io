			<h1>App not appearing in Android Emulator</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I successfully built an app on an iPhone. I wish now to build it on Android. I compiled with the target: Android SDK 2.2 </p>
<p>The emulator took ages to load. After about a good 10 to 15 mins, and receiving a huge spool of emulator&#x2F;Android information messages, the emulator launched. My app was not there.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Has anyone had this issue before? </p>
<p>THanks for any advice you can offer.</p>

							<div><p>Hello,</p>
<p>likely you don&#39;t have too much RAM. In those cases, I recommend to hit the build button again, without closing the emulator. That way, fastdev will kick in and you will be able to see your app running. </p>
<p>What kind of computer are you using? The android emulator is pretty memory&#x2F;cpu consuming. </p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro</p>

										<p><p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>I started to port to Android, and then I got a headache with Android so I stopped for bit. I will have to get back into it soon though.</p>
<p>I did however pass the hurdle above. What I did was to choose Android 2.2. I had to wait for ages… i mean, AGES, until the simulator launched. </p>
<p>I hate Android. I have no shares with Apple, but really, this must be the slowest environment I&#39;ve ever compiled on. I think coding on iPhone is harder, but I prefer it as Apple obviously have built a better system. </p>
<p>Good luck to you!</p>

										<p><p>Thanks man, cause I have 2.2 selected and the console keeps throwing WARNINGs and ERRORs at me and Kitchen Sink won&#39;t even launch! It&#39;s true what your saying though, my app on the iPhone works perfectly, already launched… And now people want the Android version… oh hell.</p>

										<p><p>I really hope Titanium manage to make porting to Android easier than what it is. Having said that, I don&#39;t think all the fault is on Titanium. It will be extremely hard to get a system that compiles on 2 platforms without ANY modifications at all. The fact of the matter is that Android is sluggish, and not as smooth as iOS.</p>

										<p><p>Perfectly said.</p>
<p>You mentioned you chose Android 2.2? So did I. Should it be 4.0.3?</p>

										<p><p>Well, here&#39;s the thing:</p>
<p>Of course there are benefits with using a newer version of Android, however, my strategy was to use a version that could work on older versions of Android and new releases, hence, i chose 2.2. Maybe this is wrong, or someone else can disagree and perhaps inform you better. </p>
<p>In any case, I tried to compile with a version &gt; 2.x and it was a nightmare… some huge screen appeared that I didn&#39;t ask for (it was probably those silly tablet Android things on the market) - it appeared on the tablet - and from the 1st minute I could see I needed a vacation before starting to debug my code on Android.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
