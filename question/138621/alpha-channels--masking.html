		<section>
			<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to simply place a static image on the screen. It presently has a black background which I would like to make transparent so you see just the graphic itself but I can&#39;t get &#39;color; &#39;#0000&#39; or &#39;#00000000&#39; to do the job.</p>
<p>I need this to work on both Android and iOS so I am not keen to use the iOS only APIs.</p>
<p>I&#39;m guessing I&#39;m doing something wrong. I am loading an image as a background image into either a view or imageView (neither work).</p>
<p>Should I be using blobs? Is there any documentation on these please as I can&#39;t find anything terribly helpful.</p>
<p>Can someone tell me what I need to do please?</p>

							<p>I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re doing in your code to add an alpha channel to the image.  You can&#39;t do that – either the image has an alpha channel or it doesn&#39;t.  JPEG files do not have alpha channels.  You have to use a PNG.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t like the days of GIF where you would designate one color as transparent.  Each pixel in a PNG has R, G, B, and A components.</p>
<p>If you display a PNG with an alpha channel in an ImageView, the parent view&#39;s background will show through the transparent parts of the image they way you want.</p>
<p>You should load the image in question into an image editor and remove the black pixels, leaving transparency behind.</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s really helpful, thank you. I had eventually got a png to work but i didn&#39;t know why! If you look in the documentation for &#39;color&#39; it mentions that you can add an alpha &#x2F; mask at the beginning of a color declaration to control the opacity of that color, that&#39;s why i had gone down that avenue! This is so much easier though! Lol. Thanks again!</p>
