			<h1>Push Notification confusion on Device Tokens, User ID, In session.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi I have been reading the documentation on push notifications and I am very confused and was hoping to get some clarification.  Here is what  I need to do. </p>
<p>In my app a user needs to be able to send a message(custom object) to another user. The two users know each other from Facebook. The approach that I was taking was fairly straight forward. I would pull user1 list of Facebook friends and then he would send a push notification to a channel named after user2 Facebook id. </p>
<p>This approach doesn&#39;t seem to be working. Reason being that I need user2 user_id or device token to send him a push notification. </p>
<p>So my question is. How am I supposed to get user2 user_id or device_token? Must I use the Friend object? </p>
<p>Also I don&#39;t clearly get the difference between device_token method or user_id method. They talk about the second one having to be in-session but don&#39;t explain what in-session means. Does that mean that the app must be on? If the app is in background on iOS is that out of session? I want users to get notifications no matter what. </p>
<p>Thanks for your help in advance.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Aaron, Thank you for the links.<br>Unfortunately they all talk about setting up push notifications which I have had no problem in doing. None of them talk about using push notifications. I haven&#39;t found a case similar to mine in the questions area nor any tutorials.</p>

										<p><p>you can not just pull a list of the users facebook friends, you need to get a list of facebook friends that have signed up for the applications, when then signed up for the application you need to capture the facebook_id and the device_id and and map them to one another.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your reply Aaron. From Facebook I query the list of Friends which have the app installed. This gives me the user id&#39;s straight from Facebook. The missing link is in ACS. To link a user to another I seem to have to use the friend object, as I need to get their device ID and as you mentionedACS needs to have a map from one to the other.</p>
