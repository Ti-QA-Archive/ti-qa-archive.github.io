			<h1>&#34;Xcode Installation is Missing&#34; When Running in App in Studio</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Having a frustrating time configuring Studio to access xcode 4.5.1.   When I originally downloaded xcode 4.5.1, I ended up having it along with 4.3 (not on purpose).  Ti Studio kept accessing 4.3. My quick workaround was to launch 4.5.1 and then run Studio, which resulted in the 6.0 SDK being picked up.</p>
<p>Since I recently distributed my app, I wanted to clean up my environment, so I got rid of 4.3 and try to point Studio at my 4.5.1 installation.  I followed the instructions in the docs by getting into a terminal session and running sudo xcode-select -switch &lt;xcode_folder_path&gt;.</p>
<p>After that didn&#39;t work, I tried re- installing xcode 4.5.1.  Still not found by Studio.  Issued the sudo command again, and that didn&#39;t help.  Tried pre-launching xcode and that no longer works.</p>
<p>Now, every time I try to run on the simulator I get the message &quot;Xcode installation is missing&quot;.   I would greatly appreciate any help as I&#39;m completely unable to work on my app.</p>
<p>Thanks….<br>  Sam</p>

							<p>The most common issue is that people don&#39;t notice that when you update Xcode, you have to re-install the command-line tools. Have you done that yet?</p>

										<p><p>No, I have not re-installed the command-line tools and didn&#39;t know of that requirement.</p>

										<p><p>I just installed the command-line tools and that didn&#39;t fix my problem.   Studio is still not finding xcode.  I still think it&#39;s related to that sudo command I ran earlier.  Do you think I should run that again?   Thanks…</p>

										<p><p>Now it&#39;s fixed.  After getting to xcode, and Locations, I had to point to the 4.5.1 command line tools in the dropdown box.  Upon doing that, Studio found xcode.  Thank You !!!</p>
