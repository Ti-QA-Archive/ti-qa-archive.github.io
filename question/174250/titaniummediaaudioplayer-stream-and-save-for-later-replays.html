		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been using the AudioPlayer to stream larger audio remote files in my application.</p>
<p>However, this application is to be mainly using 3G (or equivalent mobile data plan), and thus, must reduce the amount of transferred data to a minimum.</p>
<p>This turns out to be an issue since, on one hand I have large audio files that have to be played multiple times, and AudioPlayer doesn&#39;t give me an option (that I know of) to download the audio to a file, nor it allows to perhaps replay the whole thing without retrying the download.</p>
<p>I cannot use Media.Sound, since I require the file to be playing as soon as possible (instead of having to wait for a full load).</p>
<p>Is there a third approach I am missing to solve my issue? Has Titanium perhaps overlooked&#x2F;oversimplified key features?</p>

							<p>First, if you are streaming large files, I am surprised that Apple (wait, you didnt mention your platform, thus this quite nearly qualifies as an incomplete question…) hasn&#39;t forced you to use HLS.  HLS is supported in the iOS VideoPlayer.  We have a series of apps that can stream and download audio files in the background for offline play. </p>
<ul>
<li>Android simply streams the mp3 from a web server (com.kcwdev.audio module as we customize the controls).</li>
<li>iOS streams via HLS from the web server (videoPlayer).</li>
<li>Both can download the mp3 for local playback (com.kcwdev.audio &#x2F;videoPlayer).</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-title">Has</span> Titanium perhaps overlooked/oversimplified key features?
</code></pre><p>Saying things like this will not make you any friends around here. Assuming that your lack of knowledge regarding all possible options is equal to a flaw in the framework you are using is small minded.</p>

										<p><p>I apologize for my less adequate statement. Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>As for platform, I am only testing on Android, but the final Intent would be to support both platforms.</p>
<p>However, for the time being Android-only is fine.</p>
<p>&gt; Both can download the mp3 for local playback (com.kcwdev.audio &#x2F; videoPlayer)</p>
<p>Can you share some light into this please?</p>

										<p><p>we have a custom json feed to the app.  In that feed, each item has a stream url and an mp3 url.<br>The stream is an <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;streaming&#x2F;">HLS</a> that by default the ios videoplayer is used to play.  The android client by default streams the mp3.  We could have used the build in audioPlayer, however, because our videoplayer on ios has a custom set of rw, pp, s, ff buttons, to match the interface on android, we used a custom module purchased through the marketplace.</p>
<p>The user can choose to download the MP3 for offline playing.  We use a downloader module from the same guy that made the android audioplayer, to pull the mp3s down.  When a user chooses an audio file, we check to see if we have a cached version.  If the version is local on the filesystem, we play that instead of the stream.</p>
