			<p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>We are a team of Java developers  and have to write Titanium Applications. Appcelerator only provide a JavaScript API but we came accross Titanium4j (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;emitrom.com&#x2F;titanium4j) which seems to use Java.<br>Has anyone used this products.<br>Any experience ? </p>
<p>Thx,</p>
<p>Frank.</p>

							<p>Hello Frank,</p>
<p>We have been using Titanium4j about a year now. And like you we are a bunch of  enterprise Java Devs writing mobile apps with Titanium.</p>
<p>Beeing able to leverage our Java  knowledge was a big productivity plus.</p>
<p>Here is my experience with Titanium4j</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<p>1) Java.<br>Tooling around Java are simply awesome compare to pure JS(No offense to Titanium studio).<br>Beeing able to catch errors at compile time rather than runtime is something you learn appreciate once you dont have it anymore.<br>Before Titanium4j we developed using JavaScript and it s was a bit painful</p>
<p>2) Softqare Engineering pattern<br>We are able to use real software engineering pattern(Interface design, Design pattern, etc) in Titanium development.<br>Something that s not easy to do with pure JavaScript</p>
<p>3) Good support + Open Source<br>The guyz behind the tool are very responsive and Titanium4j is opensource ansd Apache 2</p>
<p>4) Same result as with JS<br>We are able to get the same result as with JavaScript while leveraging a more robust language.<br>Plus the GWT compiler generate a single optimized  JS output saving us some extra build process.</p>
<p>5) Easy to pick up<br>Well this is bit subjective because we are Java Devs. JavaScripters will probably think the opposite.</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<p>1) Development process<br>As for now one needs to  compile to JS first before seeing the result. Something like an incremental compilation of the Java code would be awesome.</p>
<p>2) No Debugging<br>There is currently no way to debug the Java Code and debugging with the console only(or in JS) is not enough.</p>
<p>3) Not much tutorials<br>I wish the team would put more tutorials out there. Something like a Titanium4j version of the Kitchensink would be terrific</p>
<p>So to me Titanium4j is probably to best add on to Titanium. I can only recommend you giving it a try.<br>You wont regret</p>
<p>I m very surprised Appcelerator has nt had a closer look at that tool. Can only be good for the platform</p>
<p>Good luck and let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>Debugging… ahhh the eternal dilemma.  It has been one of those things that we&#39;ve wanted to have for a long, long time.  We may finally have something for you, so stay tuned.  Check out the G+ community since we&#39;ll post any advancements regarding debugging in that space.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your answer. I downloaded  Titanium4j  and I must say we are really impressed!<br>Like John I m also wondering if Appcelerator is aware of Titanium4j.<br>You should advertise your product more David. It s worth it.<br> A debugger will definitely make it THE tool around Titanium mobile.<br>Keep up the good work.</p>
