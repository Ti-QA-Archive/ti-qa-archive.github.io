			<h1>Signed Android App Launch Timeout problem</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi There,</p>
<p>I have a couple different physical Android devices. An older Samsung Galaxy S and two Samsung Galaxy s3 &#39;s.  My app works fine on both when I build and deploy to the device from Titanium Studio.   It also works on my Samsung Galaxy S when I publish the app and email it to myself and then install.  It doesn&#39;t work when I do the same thing (publish and email, or publish to Play and download) on the 2 different S3 &#39;s. </p>
<p>When I tap on the app icon, my splash screen appears but nothing else happens.  I looked in DDMS and I get a device log entry stating the Application Launcher timed out, but I can&#39;t figure out the root cause.  Has anyone seen this issue?  Does anyone have any hints how to further trouble shoot this and&#x2F;or what my be causing it to time out? </p>
<p>I&#39;m using the 3.0.2 GA SDK.<br>Both the S3 s are running Jelly Bean.<br>I&#39;m building this on  Mac OSX 10.7.5.<br>I have set the build to use Google APIs Android 4.2.2 [armeabi-v7a]. </p>
<p>Thanks…</p>

<p>does this happen with other projects? I.e., try to create a new one and run it in the failing device.</p>

							<p>Maybe you could try sprinkling your code with Ti.API.info calls at different points of your startup and see if they are reflected in DDMS? It&#39;s not pretty, but I&#39;ve used that kind of technique when facing the kind of problem you&#39;re trying to track down…</p>

										<p><p>I peppered the app.js file with Ti.Api.info statements.  It appears the app doesn&#39;t get far enough start logging in app.js or the output isn&#39;t working.  Does debugging have to be enabled for that output to show up?  From reading&#x2F;researching I wonder if it needs to be set to true in the manifest file.  If so, what&#39;s the process to do that?  I don&#39;t think I can do it after the fact in the apk cause it&#39;s signed.  Is there a way to get some debugging output put into the bootstrap code that Appcelerator generates?</p>

										<p><p>You don&#39;t need to do anything, it will work, even with published&#x2F;signed apps. All you need is to have DDMS running, your phone connected and your device highlighted in the list of devices…</p>
<p>If you&#39;re not seeing any of the info statements, you should probably try and isolate your startup in app.js. For example, not sure how many external files you are referencing or loading, but commenting out all or most external files and then adding them back in one at a time, kind of a pain (because you need functionality from the other modules), but it&#39;s difficult to troubleshoot stuff like this.</p>
<p>Are you using any third party libraries&#x2F;modules? Could be that one of them is having trouble… </p>
<p>Best advice I can give is simplify as much as possible, see if it works, then start adding stuff back in. If you want to post your app.js, might be able to help with some ideas… Your call.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks.   …  I was never able to get Ti.API.info output in DDMS from my failing app or my successful test app.  In trying many different things I was able to get the install to fail consistently on all 3 of my test devices.   Not sure what changes made it start failing on all of them but it helped trouble shoot further and I found a work around.  I haven&#39;t determined the root cause of the issue but I suspect it&#39;s something to  do with how the app is signed and modules I&#39;m using.  Working thru the differences between what happens when I &quot;Deploy to Android&quot; versus &quot;Publish&quot; I noticed there is a difference in the way the app gets signed.</p>
<p>Deploy to Android:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">jarsigner -sigalg MD5withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -storepass <span class="hljs-keyword">*</span><span class="hljs-keyword">*</span><span class="hljs-keyword">*</span><span class="hljs-keyword">*</span><span class="hljs-keyword">*</span><span class="hljs-keyword">*</span><span class="hljs-keyword">*</span> -keystore ...
</code></pre><p>Publish:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">jarsigner -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -storepass <span class="hljs-keyword">*</span><span class="hljs-keyword">*</span><span class="hljs-keyword">*</span><span class="hljs-keyword">*</span><span class="hljs-keyword">*</span><span class="hljs-keyword">*</span><span class="hljs-keyword">*</span><span class="hljs-keyword">*</span><span class="hljs-keyword">*</span><span class="hljs-keyword">*</span> -keystore
</code></pre><p>The Android guidelines found <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;tools&#x2F;publishing&#x2F;app-signing.html#setup">here</a> indicates that the app should  be signed using MD5withRSA in their example.  I&#39;ve also found some reference to the Google Maps module and an issue with it loading when being published.  I&#39;m not using the Google Maps module but I am using the payment module and would guess that&#39;s the one causing the problem (didn&#39;t bother removing that completely from my code to confirm this but simply commenting out that module doesn&#39;t solve the issue).  So for now, I&#39;m manually building my app for Publish because I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to override&#x2F;configure the defaults.  Does anyone know if it&#39;s possible to change the jar signing default.  Or have build scripts they care to share?</p>
