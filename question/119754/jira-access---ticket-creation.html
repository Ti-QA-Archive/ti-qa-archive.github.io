						<section>
							<p>Guys, we are <strong>extremely</strong> interested in tickets raised by members of the community. Without them, Titanium cannot hope to reach its full potential.</p>
<p>Indeed, with our previous ticketing system, Lighthouse, we found that a good number of community members raised tickets that:</p>
<ul>
<li>were well-researched (accurate, no duplicates)</li>
<li>were clear</li>
<li>were concise</li>
<li>were factual (no conjecture)</li>
<li>were well-defined (included platforms used, SDK versions, environment)</li>
<li>included a minimalist usecase</li>
</ul>
<p>These tickets were very much responsible for making Titanium much better far more quickly than it otherwise would have been.</p>
<p>However, tickets require an awful lot of management, especially when they don&#39;t meet the aforementioned level of quality. This can really slow down the core devs, and consequently hinder Titanium&#39;s development.</p>
<p>I am sure that you will agree that it would be better for everybody if the core devs spend more time coding and less time deliberating over tickets. This is why we have created the Jira <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC">Titanium Community</a> project, to act as a clearing house for new tickets. A ticket created here will be reviewed, tested and refined by a member of our team, with the help of the person who raised it, before it reaches the core devs.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is a new process, so we will see how effective it is in due course. If it proves a success, though, we will very much welcome the input of our <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;01&#x2F;titanium-titan-program.html">Appcelerator Titans</a> to help out, if it interests them.</p>
<p>So, if you think you have spotted a bug, and you have checked it here in the Q&amp;A and other community members have confirmed this, and you have kept in mind the guidelines above together with those explained in the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Contributing+to+Titanium#ContributingtoTitanium-SubmittingBugReports">Submitting Bug Reports</a> guide then, by all means, go ahead and raise a ticket.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for all of your keen eyes!  ;)</p>

										<p><p>Note, I updated my last answer to make it clear that any potential bug should be discussed here with the community before a ticket is raised.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

										<p><p>Thus, please provide a link to your Q&amp;A post in your ticket, so that any help provided for user-specific issues, that does not serve to progress the bug, may be discussed outside of the ticket. Thanks.</p>
