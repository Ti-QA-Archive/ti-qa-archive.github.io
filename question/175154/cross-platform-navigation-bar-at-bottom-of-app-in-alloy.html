			<h1>Cross Platform Navigation Bar at bottom of app in Alloy</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to build a simple navigation bar at the bottom of an app.  It needs to be persistent (always there no matter which screen they are on), cross platform (both iOS &amp; Android) and simple to implement in Alloy.<br>I want it to behave and appear like the bottom navbar in the new Yelp app, for example.</p>
<p>To me this seems like a very simple thing to do in Alloy.  But I&#39;ve only found NavigationGroup (which is iOS only), and searched around all over the net and Alloy sites, but I&#39;ve found nothing that is simple, cross-platform (both iOS &amp; Android) and easy to implement.</p>
<p>How can this be?  I&#39;d love some help in getting started with this, since I don&#39;t want to re-invent the wheel here.</p>
<p>Shouldn&#39;t this be easy?  Am I missing something?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>They have two, distinct native UIs.  If you want a cross platform UI, then you will need to custom design the bar yourself.</p>
<p>Android tabs since 4.x are at the top with the actionbar, while ios tabs are at the bottom.</p>

										<p><p>Well, thanks for the unhelpful and snarky answer, Stephen…</p>
<p>Considering that the Titanium platform is marketed as a &quot;platform designed to handle device compatibility&quot; and is looked at as having APIs that compile down into BOTH native platforms, with simple ways of handling the most complex tasks (from bringing up the camera to GeoLocation), I don&#39;t think it is beyond reason to ask a simple question to see if there is such an easy way to create a cross-platform navigation bar.</p>
<p>It would benefit the developer community to have more professional and mature guides when it comes to helping newbies like myself, but I suppose that is lost on you, Mr. Feather.  Being patronizing and condescending by pointing out the obvious (&quot;iOS !== Android, nor does Android === iOS&quot;) is unhelpful and reflects your poor attitude towards others, in particular those who need it the most: we who are still learning.  If you have nothing helpful to say, don&#39;t say anything at all.  You&#39;d think someone with as much experience as you appear to have would have known that.</p>
<p>Anyone else able to help me out?  Sounds like I should be using a TabGroup?  Anyone worked with TabGroup across Android and iOS before?</p>

										<p><p>I am not sure how you took this fact based answer so personally as some sort of attack upon you and all newbies.  It is certainly not my job to defend Stephen or anybody else - but I am struggling to work out why you took this so badly. </p>
<p>Stephen is very much correct and answered your two main questions clearly so as not to be confusing.</p>
<p>We will work on the main points;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Shouldn&#39;t this be easy?</p>
<p>Yes and no.  Yes; it should be easy in so far as Titanium is a cross development solution that enables you to write common code and then compile to many platforms.  No; Titanium does not create identical applications from one set of code.  All business logic and functions work the same way - but as each device has unique ways of handling many things there are differences.  You note yourself that only iOS has the navigation group - so Titanium cannot make that up for another platform - as that is simply trying to make all platforms the same - they are not.</p>
<p>Developing software is hard, you can tell that by the facts; not everybody does it and also makes a fortune, you have to learn new things constantly just to keep up.  It is also not just about the code - you have to have a complete understanding of how the Android, iOS (and any other) platforms work from the users perspective.</p>
<p>Without this understanding you will never be able to deliver an app from the same base code that presents itself to each platform by honouring the UI guidelines for each, the differences in inter-app communication, managing of graphics and all the other things.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Am I missing something?</p>
<p>Yes you are and he pointed it out.  You are not the only one, many new users take some time to understand that a cross platform development solution does not take all platforms and make them look and act the same - if it did then your users would have a poor experience and your competition would gain a new user because they understood that a little more than you have.</p>
<p>The reference to !== is a really cool way of keeping comments to those of us developers.  You know what !== means, and because of that it is an &#39;in phrase&#39; something only developers get.</p>
<p>As I have said and Stephen before me - Android is not the same as iPhone.  Whilst you may now say you get that - it is clear you do not yet - that is not an insult that is fact.  I didn&#39;t get it either - I owned an iPhone and wrote apps for iOS long before I started to support Android - it was then that the differences came out and some are significant - the one you face is a significant difference.</p>
</li>
<li><p>So back to the original issue and what you were told.</p>
<p>You want the UI to act in a certain way - that is fine, you can do that, some apps do that - but not those that want to honour the platform.  It was common to be &#39;lazy&#39; (my word) and simply make everything the same.  It is not the same, understand and honour that - Android users especially do not like to think the app they are using looks iOS based - they are a scary bunch.</p>
<p>Stephen pointed out you need tabs and went further to explain that their position is not in your hands.  They are placed where they are placed due to their respective operating systems.  It is your job to work with them and not to fight them.</p>
<p>So yes it sounds like you need tabs - but you do not need them and should not want them in a place of your choosing - smarter people than us have made those UI&#x2F;UX guidelines and by honouring them you help to make your app look professional.</p>
<p>There are some REALLY bad attempt at trying to make cross-platform identical looking and acting solutions.  Do not try and be one of those people.</p>
</li>
<li><p>WhatsApp</p>
<p>Having reviewed the screenshots on the Google Play site and checked the same on Google images - I am unable to see a constant tab bar of any kind on any screen within the app. The iOS 7 redesigned version of the app does have a tab bar - but a customised one.</p>
<p>So your provided example app does not have a consistent cross platform interface either.  Which is great - it is honouring the platform guidelines.  All the tables, alerts, dialogs and more act more or less the same way as the other platform - but still each one has differences.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>What does cross platform really mean then?</p>
<p>With WhatsApp - you look at it know it is not identical in look but it is identical in function.  This is cross platform development.  You write core code that works across each platform that performs all the things your app needs to do.  But when it comes to presenting to or interacting with you must take note to do that in the way each platform should.  Some times they are identical, many times almost the same the rest completely different.</p>
</li>
<li><p>What are your responsibilities as a newbie?</p>
<p>Learn - and learn lots.  Make sure you have each platform you are developing for.  If you choose both iOS and Android then understand that both of those has two distinct UIs from different OS versions.  iOS pre 7 and 7+, Android 2.3x and 4.x (3.x should be ignored).  Each of these UI are distinctly different - not only in looks but in how the user interacts with each and how the OS themselves interacts with the user.</p>
<p>Make sure you have each device - USE it do not play with it, make it your normal phone for awhile and understand the differences.  Know that in Android there are small but important differences between; 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 &amp; 4.5.</p>
<p>Understand how the platforms handle graphics, learn about density and retina variations, never assume you know - it always changes.  Understand how local storage differs and how apps talk to each is different.  Keep in mind that Android !== iOS - you may not have like the phrase but it is the best way to describe it.</p>
<p>Learn today, learn tomorrow and learn the day after.  Everything changes, priorities swap and needs of the develop evolve.  I have been writing commercial software for 25 years.  During that time I have written two apps that became the industry standards in their fields.  I have learnt 20+ software languages, written 3 scripting languages of my own.  I still have to learn new things every single day.  I have three R&amp;D proof of concept projects running right now using things that were not available 12 months ago - you never stop learning.</p>
<p>We are all newbies.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In conclusion </p>
<p>Stephen gave a great answer - you took offence at it.  That is fine, better would have been asking follow up questions though - the annoyance and rudeness level should have been turned down.</p>
<p>Use a tab group, as right now that sounds the most likely solution - just understand it goes where it wants and looks how it wants - you have limited ability to change that - but your users will love you for it.</p>
<p>Research the platforms - so you know what is and what isn&#39;t the same.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If it was me; I would apologise for your comments - I hope you are a better person than those comments make you out to be.</p>

							<p>Unreal.  Stop crying girls, all I&#39;m looking for are some samples.  But I guess there aren&#39;t any.  Sheesh.</p>
<p>Offend a titanium newbie then shout him down.  Great strategy guys!  You guys are winning hearts and minds one post at a time here.  What a fun atmosphere…</p>

							<p>Good lord, the drama… <em>&lt;facepalm&gt;</em></p>
<ul>
<li>all I am looking for is an educated answer, which is still missing, despite your lengthy response, professor.</li>
<li>If anybody shoud be apologizing for their comments, it is still Stephen.</li>
<li>I referenced Yelp, not WhatsApp.  You missed what I was talking about.</li>
<li>There is a dearth of samples and examples out there addressing simple use-cases like this one for Alloy which still hasn&#39;t been addressed; hence my raising this question.  I&#39;ve used all the ones available to me so far.  Appcelerator has acknowledged this and said more are on their way.  Still not here.</li>
<li>I understand software development just fine, as well as the ins and outs of cross platform development.  Titanium is the first of many languages I&#39;ve learnt but the first one that has a pretty poor community and learning environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Or, maybe I should know better than to just try and come here to ask anything in the first place for fear of getting responses like &quot;iOS !== Android, nor does Android === iOS&quot;…  No attempt at long-winded erudite erasure is going to sway the tone or lack of solution in Steven&#39;s response (despite you incestuously up-voting it, Malcolm).</p>
<p>Maybe you guys should hire a real community manager so these threads aren&#39;t cluttered with &quot;Titanium Certified&quot; people posting the equivalent of &quot;RTFM&quot;.  You may not like that phrase, but that is the best way to describe it…</p>
<p>There&#39;s the exit, Malcolm, Stephen.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now, back to my original question, if you don&#39;t mind…?</p>
<p>Anyone built a cross-platform TabGroup or worked with one on either platform with much success?  How have you handled sub-navigation within tabs so that windows don&#39;t display overtop of the tabs?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Jorge</p>
<p>I have to be honest and say you have just managed to insult two of the nicest hard working people in the titanium community.</p>
<p>you have then gone onto say that the community is a waste of time.</p>
<p>&quot;Titanium is the first of many languages I&#39;ve learnt but the first one that has a pretty poor community and learning environment.&quot;</p>
<p>You say Stephen has to apologies for answering your question. Seriously, you insult everybody and expect them to respond and answer your question, then expect them to apologies.</p>
<p>The community behind this platform is awesome, the people who give up their time freely and openly give their knowledge are excellent.</p>
<p>You obviously didn&#39;t get the answer you wanted, so you slag them off.. </p>
<p>I will answer the first part your question.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyone built a cross-platform TabGroup or worked with one on either platform with much success? &quot;</p>
<p>ANSWER</p>
<p>Yes they have.</p>

										<p><p>BTW - comments to answers go as comments to the answers - not as answers themselves.</p>
<p>How was anything I said in my follow up caused you further annoyance.  Everything was factual, nothing was personal, it included lots of information.  But you choose to insult me as well.</p>
<p>How uneducated was my follow-up?  I explained why your wish top create a cross platform navigational element in the way you want is contrary the UI&#x2F;UX guidelines and still match the guidelines of each platform.</p>
<p>You are VERY welcome to re-invent the wheel but my view is always only do so if you think your wheel is better.  If your wheel is simply different - then it is not a better wheel.</p>
<p>Your attitude from your original question has been poor and continued to be confrontational. </p>
<p>You seek an easy answer to a development problem that has no easy answer.  Even ignoring all the valid points I have made about UI&#x2F;UX guidelines - if your wheel is truly better then there is no easy answer - you are going to have to manage the whole navigational and window management process yourself.</p>
<p>You asked for an easy solution but there is none, this is a task for someone with experience enough to not need to ask the question.  I am sure that last statement will somehow annoy you - but the fact is those who are new to development (as you have stated you are) who are wishing to change how things work and not take advantage of the each platforms OS own way of achieving this - will find it very hard.  Only once you have truly understood how things work can you gets to grips with the significantly hard things.</p>
<p>You say you have learnt many languages with Titanium being the first.  However the community and learning environment are the worst you have ever seen.  You joined 2 years ago - so as Titanium was the first language - the others must by your words have come later. So your experience is limited to two years - which is fine - but to have so much aggression so quickly for something paid nothing for is simply strange.</p>
<p>I am not sure if you think the people who assist on this community Q&amp;A are paid - or in fact work for Appcelerator - but no, mostly not true.  There are a few employees who help out but for the most part it is less than 1% of the community helping all those who genuinely require help and are grateful for assistance. We ask for nothing in return but welcome the occasional thanks.  We certainly do not expect abuse, insults and suggestions we are not here to help.</p>
<p>Your comment;</p>
<p><em>There is a dearth of samples and examples out there addressing simple use-cases like this one for Alloy which still hasn&#39;t been addressed; hence my raising this question. I&#39;ve used all the ones available to me so far. </em></p>
<p>I am not sure which direction this sentence is actually going - guessing the suggestion is that despite many many examples that give you the apparent answer - none are in Alloy.  So convert one of them, not a hard task.  If one worked - wondering why you are not doing that right now - rather than coming here and insulting people offering advice.  </p>
<p>And this;</p>
<p><em>Appcelerator has acknowledged this and said more are on their way. Still not here.</em></p>
<p>So Appcelerator has said it is sorry that there are no solutions to your problem - but they will get on to it soon, but they have yet to do it.  Seriously?</p>
<p>If you hate the fact that you are not getting premium support for a product you paid nothing for, pay for the paid version and get the premium support.  At least then you can abuse people on the phone as well.</p>
<p>BTW If you had RTFM then you would have noted the platform differences with <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.UI.TabGroup">TabGroups</a>.  But that is fine, you may not have spotted it - but why insult people for pointing out the same thing - BTW no one said the equivalent of RTFM.</p>
<p>I did make one huge mistake though (besides trying to assist you) you did mention Yelp (not WhatsApp) that was entirely me - I was helping too many people and got confused with the apps I was referring too.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>So here is the incorrect version for all to see;</p>
<p><em>WhatsApp</em></p>
<p><em>Having reviewed the screenshots on the Google Play site and checked the same on Google images - I am unable to see a constant tab bar of any kind on any screen within the app. The iOS 7 redesigned version of the app does have a tab bar - but a customised one.</em></p>
<p><em>So your provided example app does not have a consistent cross platform interface either. Which is great - it is honouring the platform guidelines. All the tables, alerts, dialogs and more act more or less the same way as the other platform - but still each one has differences.</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>And just to be clear here is the change in my statement when reviewing the correct app;</p>
<p><strong>WhatsApp</strong></p>
<p>Having reviewed the screenshots on the Google Play site and checked the same on Google images - I am unable to see a constant tab bar of any kind on any screen within the app. The iOS 7 redesigned version of the app does have a tab bar - but a customised one.</p>
<p>So your provided example app does not have a consistent cross platform interface either. Which is great - it is honouring the platform guidelines. All the tables, alerts, dialogs and more act more or less the same way as the other platform - but still each one has differences.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One word - weird that - still the same.</p>
<p>So you are right let us move on from your petty rudeness.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Anyone built a cross-platform TabGroup or worked with one on either platform with much success?</p>
<p>Yes, the examples are in the documentation - they do what Stephen said and what I said - True cross platform tabs, honouring the correct UI&#x2F;UX for each platform.</p>
</li>
<li><p>How have you handled sub-navigation within tabs so that windows don&#39;t display overtop of the tabs?</p>
<p>Yes - but here is the problem; I explained it earlier &quot;it is very hard&quot;, you have to know so many things in order to get it to work and to manage not only windows but memory and more.  You will have to ignore both platforms built in versions of tab group to achieve it which means you will need to create your own controllers for each circumstance.  Those code examples you speak of achieve the visual sides.</p>
<p>You are correct many examples have been given before of the basic principles behind this - but you need serious knowledge, lots of experience understanding of things you cannot see.  To explain it would take a book to get it right - not a Q&amp;A article.</p>
<p>So again I explain - if you were capable of achieving this you wouldn&#39;t need to ask as you would understand the true undertaking and either do it or not do it.</p>
<p>The reason I know you are incapable of achieving this is you clearly have not tried tab groups - by your own admission.  If you had you would have understood they were the starting point of the logic - the question however talks only of Navigation Groups.  So I can only assume that you have tried neither of these as a potential solution to the problem.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You appear to hate Titanium, so stop using it, you hate the community stop using it, you have used better use it.  But that would be a shame, understand what you have been told - politely and with lots of details provided.  You asked a question and it was answered, you expand the question, it was followed up - in each case insults.  Would be nice to see the better side of you.  Hoping that will come out soon.</p>
<p>I can help you develop this if you really want; as I said a good solution that self manages will take time.  I never cut corners so it has to work as smoothly as the native versions - just under your rules.  So 40 days @ £750 + VAT should cover it.</p>
<p>Keep in mind we give up our time and work Pro Bono for those who want help.  It costs us time and by extension money to assist here, we give now because others gave when we started.  Not after your respect and certainly not your rudeness or insults.</p>
