			<h1>Overhead Retrieving UI Object Attributes</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>So yesterday I spent half a day scratching my head trying to figure out why &#39;for&#39; loop was so slow. After all, it was doing some very basic operations 100 times per second.</p>
<p>I was trying to see if Appcelerator was cut out for creating a sidescroller. I was merely doing some collision detection. However, the collision detection was being down on a UI object and within the loop I was calling .top and .left on that object. Sure, it was kinda silly not to have called them just once <em>outside</em> the loop but had I not done this I don&#39;t think anyone would know about this performance bug.</p>
<p>Turns out the overhead for calling .top and .left on just about any UI object is so ridiculously high that calling it 100 times a seconds will make an iPod touch limp like an old man kicked in the crotch.</p>
<p>1) I suppose this could be the same as the &#39;View performance&#39; ticket that keeps getting pushed back release after release. I have another app that makes extensive use of UI objects and noticed it was slow at drawing them on screen but I had never equated the problem to the overhead of reading top, left, height and width attributes.</p>
<p>2) This problem seems to be getting little love by the Appcelerator team…if this falls into the &#39;View performance&#39; problem, I noticed that it got pushed to 1.4.</p>
<p>3) I know Appcelerator isn&#39;t meant for creating games and that other tools may be more appropriate but the game I was trying to create was very basic…there was nothing much going on but the scrolling of a view and some very basic collision detection. Is there any incoming APIs or API changes in Appcelerator that may alleviate this performance problem? Is the &#39;native Canvas API&#39; going to allow Appcelerator apps to draw things rapidly without the use of a WebView and Webkit?</p>
<p>4) Drawing the game using Webkit&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;Javascript would certainly fix the problem, but I would only do this as a last resort thing.</p>

							<p>If you would be willing to share your example code, it would help us in addressing the performance issues you noticed.  Thanks…</p>
