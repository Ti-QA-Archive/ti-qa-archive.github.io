			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>i have a couple of questions regarding best practises for handling data:</p>
<p>I want to create an ios app for guide tours. we have around 10 tours (a tour has many routes, POI etc.) and i want to sell them via in app purchases. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>how to i store the data for these tours? should i have all of them in one sql DB or keep seperate ones for each tour? i want to keep in mind easiest upgradability</p>
</li>
<li><p>I want to store the users purchases locally, so i do not have to query apple every time to see if they have purchased a tour. if i store this data in a sql file (e.g. preferences.db), this can be easily modified by a user ( i tried with one of my in appstore apps, and it worked with iexplorer to modify a sql file stored within an app). how can i safely keep user data on the device? i thought about using md5 hash values for properties and adding dummy data to the preference.db file to make it harder. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>using cloud service is a bit over the top for this project i think, as users would have to create accounts etc.</p>
<p>any help would be much appreciated</p>

							<div><p>Just a note on the in-app-purchase issue:<br>Apple rejects apps that sell real-life products &#x2F; services with in-app-purchase. And if you use in-app-purchase you can&#39;t avoid to query apple (or your own server) - don&#39;t store purchases locally: users may purchase products from another device.</p>
<p>I would store the tours data on an application server and pull it into a local DB</p>

							<p>hi, ty for the answer. </p>
<p>the tours are all virtual, so its just a package of routes, POI etc. </p>
<p>the thing is: the routes go through the countryside, where ther might be no or very limited internet access. i do want to store as much data as possible on the device.</p>
