			<p>I am trying to take a screen shot of my current screen.</p>
<p>I have the screenshot working well, and it saves off as required.</p>
<p>The issue I have is the view is a view through the camera with an overlay. The screenshot is required of this complete view of the camera and the overlay.</p>
<p>The takeScreenShot only captures the overlay with a black background.</p>
<p>Is this possible ? and if so how…. I cannot take a picture and then add the overlay on later.</p>
<p>I also require this view to work on Android which at the moment it doesn&#39;t. The camera works but the overlay display is rotated 90%.</p>
<p>Hope you can help</p>
<p>T…</p>

							<p>I would assume you&#39;re taking the screenshot of the wrong view&#x2F;window.  Also remember if the views are not children of them then they won&#39;t show up in a screen shot of that view. </p>
<p>Perhaps you need to wrap all your objects&#x2F;views on the window with another view and generate the screen shot off of the wrapper.</p>

							<p>Thanks for the answer I think I understand but…</p>
<p>I have a window which then fires off the Ti.Media.ShowCamera within the window. This has the overlay attached to it.</p>
<p>Basically window loads, on open goes get some data, builds the overlay and shows the camera with the overlay. the screenshot only captures the overlay with a black background.</p>
<p>I have a button which then triggers the Ti.Media.takeScreenshot(function(evt){ get image data});</p>
<p>Not sure how to put this into a separate view.</p>
