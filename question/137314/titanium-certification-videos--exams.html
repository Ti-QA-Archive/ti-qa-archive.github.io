			<h1>Titanium Certification Videos &amp; Exams</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I was looking over the training videos and certification exams that Appcelerator offers to become an &quot;expert&quot; on Titanium. Unfortunately, those videos seem a bit outdated with Ti&#39;s new style of CommonJS principles and way of doing things.</p>
<p>Are the videos and certificates really worth the time to go through them? I wouldn&#39;t want to teach myself bad&#x2F;out-of-date habits.</p>

							<p>I posted updated versions of the videos yesterday (4 June 2012). The new versions cover CommonJS, ACS, layout changes, and geolocation changes released with Titanium 2.0. </p>

							<p>Haha! Thanks, Sharry! :)</p>
<p>Yea, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been doing. Was just wondering if the vids were up to snuff. I know the Titanium team, and Appcelerator in general, have A LOT on their plate right now (2.0 releases, ACS, Geoloqi, doc &amp; api updates, etc.), and I don&#39;t know how big their team is to be able to handle it.  It&#39;s really exploding all at once (in a good way). They just need to hire more of us (not at all a little hint for any Ti hiring managers out there ;P).</p>
<p>With that said, once the chaos calms, I&#39;m really expecting that they&#39;ll amp up everything (docs, videos, tutorials, etc.) to the newest ways of developing. Stuff like the Kitchen Sink and Tweetanium are great, but again, they&#39;re not the best for &#39;best practices&#39;. THAT&#39;s really the <strong>BIGGEST</strong> thing missing from Titanium&#x2F;Appcelerator right now - a truly comprehensive, developer-oriented library (almost a suite or knowledgebase) of go-to information. Don&#39;t get me wrong. They&#39;ve done a <em>great</em> job so far, and I know the wiki&#39;s there, but I&#39;m talking about an updated video library, beginning to advanced tutorials, etc.</p>
<p>And, what I think would really be awesome is the creation of a community-driven library of resources, such as a place on the Appcelerator site where developers could upload their own tutorials and&#x2F;or videos, or even (do I dare to dream?) sample apps with available source code, for approval by the Titanium Developer Relations team (Kevin, Tony, etc.). Then, once approved, these Titanium Tuts (ooo, I like that ;P) could be made public for others wishing to &#39;get started&#39;, wanting to understand ACS and its components, or simply to reference code snippets for a proper xhr request. Oh, how I could only dream! XD</p>
<p>Okay, sorry guys. Rant over. Off my soapbox.</p>
<p>Cheers to all! And code strong! :P</p>
