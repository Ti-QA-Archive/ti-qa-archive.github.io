			<h1>Submitting a free app to apple&#39;s app store</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve been working on an app that is basically a portal to some videos on our server. The first screen you see is a login and password window. I figure I have to make a demo username&#x2F;password or else apple reviewers cannot test the app.</p>
<p>The thing is, this app is made for my clients to use. Basically, when they hire me to make their project, they have the option of adding the ability to have it accessible via mobile. I direct the client to download the app for free and give him his login credentials and viola, they can see their videos.</p>
<p>Now I charge extra for the project for adding mobile access. Is this not allowed somewhere in the apple terms and agreements?</p>
<p>Sincerely, someone who has never submitted an app.</p>

							<p>Hi Ronnie,</p>
<p>Yes, you&#39;ll need to give them a username and password in the &quot;review notes&quot; section of your app when you submit it.  Easiest way might be to treat them like a client, and create one or two test videos for them.</p>
<p>You may have a problem with your revenue model, though, since you&#39;re basically cutting Apple out of the deal.  You want to charge people to use the mobile app, but you don&#39;t want them to pay through the app store. :( Section 11 says you can&#39;t do that:<br><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;appstore&#x2F;resources&#x2F;approval&#x2F;guidelines.html">iOS developer guidelines</a></p>
<p>I understand, however, that you want to charge per client, not per seat, which is the only option if the app is non-free. So why not have the app still for free, but build this additional charge into your base costing?</p>

										<p><p>Hey Todd, thanks for your reply. The additional charge will be included in the base cost of the entire project. Before the project starts, they basically opt in or out for it. If they opt in, then the base cost goes up, so hopefully that won&#39;t be an issue</p>
