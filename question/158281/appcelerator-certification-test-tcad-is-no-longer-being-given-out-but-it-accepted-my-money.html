		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I just purchased the appcelerator certification test (TCAD) from the marketplace and after purchasing it I went to take it and it says Invalid Access Code. Contact your administrator for more information.</p>
<p>Has this happened to anyone else? Is the exam no longer availible but its still in the marketplace for some reason??</p>
<p>How do I access the test or get my money back that was just charged on my credit card less then 5 minutes ago?</p>

							<p>Sorry about that! We have made some changes to try to implement some new tests. I didn&#39;t think anything we did would have affected the existing tests. Please email us at training@appcelerator.com and we&#39;ll get this straightened out for you.</p>

										<p><p>The TCAD and TCMD exams are being phased out, to be replaced by TCD and TCE. The new exams cover Alloy and other Ti 3.x features of Titanium.</p>
