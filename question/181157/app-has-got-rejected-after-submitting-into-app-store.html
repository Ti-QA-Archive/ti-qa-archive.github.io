							<p>Sounds like its something that happens when first installed - have you removed the app from the simulator and started from scratch? Have you tried a fresh install on an iPad?</p>

										<p><p>Good call, Larrie.  This could well be something like a property value.  If you don&#39;t start clean once in a while, you might not notice that the app&#39;s startup code is not handling the missing property value.</p>

										<p><p>You say above that you tried once and got this error but you didnt post the error. If you got the error once, and not again, then that is the error that is getting your app rejected.</p>
<p>You need to post the error, and you need to update the sg.flurry to be 64-bit or get the developers to.</p>
