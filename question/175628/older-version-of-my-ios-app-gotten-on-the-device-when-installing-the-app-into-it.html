			<h1>Older version of my ios app gotten on the device when installing the app into it.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I tried to test the push notifications of the ios version of my app and i had to do that on an iphone device having ios 5 as OS as the push notifications don&#39;t work on an emulator.</p>
<p>Now the problem is that i&#39;m trying to run my app after cleaning it and i see it on itunes and from itunes i install it to the device but the problem is that the installed version is never the latest version that i runned but what i got is an older version which comes from a code that i have already deleted and it doesn&#39;t remain on the latest version (which i tested on the emulator and it worked all fine except the push notification )</p>
<p>I even tried to re-clean the app many times and delete the latest instance from itunes and from the device and repeated all the steps from the beginning but i still have the same result.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if itunes has a folder in which it keeps my app instances so i go there and delete its content or same for the device .. i&#39;m only sure that cleaning the app is always successeful and it deletes all the build folder content..</p>
<p>Cheers.    </p>
