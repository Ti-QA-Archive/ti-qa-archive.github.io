			<h1>Abandoning Ti Studio</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve decided to go back to TI Developer, as I&#39;m spending way too much time fighting with TI Studio. Since making the transition my productivity has gone way down and I&#39;m giving up for now.  Developer was too lean but Studio is definitely too bloated.</p>
<p>I&#39;m finding the UI to be awkward and unintuitive.  I like the integrated editor and code completion, but everything else really gets in my way.  Some of the problems I&#39;ve had:</p>
<p>1) I&#39;m not getting any syntax error messages to display on the console.<br>2) Unable to run w&#x2F;o the debugger. Any time I hit RUN, trying to avoid the debugger (which I dislike), I get a TI error indicating that its unable to connect.</p>
<p>Anyone else throwing in the towel with TI Studio?</p>

							<p>Ditto! After a week of trying to get the Ti Studio to work with Andriod, still no luck! Ti Developer worked with Android SDK 1st time. So frustrating…</p>

							<p>Ditto, and to make things worse Developer is, from what I can tell, no longer available on the download page, though I think you can still grab it from github and build yourself.  </p>
<p>I am surprised that they are pushing the Ti Studio so hard considering, among other things, that all the training videos still only cover usage of Ti Developer. I think forcing on IDE on developers is a really bad idea that likely will not last long, especially if we all continue to voice our opinions. Lack of freedom to choose a  text editor is often a deal breaker in selecting a job for many developers, many will just secretly just use their own.  A favorite question of mine to ask in interviews is &quot;what is you favorite text editor or IDE?&quot;, because good developers have a passion for theirs.   </p>
<p>Ultimately there is no reason the build and edit environments can&#39;t be separate.  My feeling is that Appcelerator should either continue to support Ti Developer or at least provide full documentation to the command line build&#x2F;test&#x2F;deploy interface as an alternative to using Ti Studio.</p>
<p>my 5¢</p>

							<p>Me too. I&#39;m so much more productive using my favorite editor and using Ti Developer for compilation.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t meant to be sarcastic or anything but Ti Studio have made me appreciate how lean Ti Developer is. Theres a thing to be said about doing just one thing and doing it well.</p>
<p>Probably part of the problem is that Studio is written using Java which degrades the user experience with it&#39;s laggy UI.</p>

							<p>Well I actually prefer using TiStudio to Developer, maybe thats because I am at home using Eclipse to develop Java and PHP projects already. There are  features&#x2F;functions missing from TiStudio at the moment (compared with using Eclipse for PHP dev), but I am sure they will come as it evolves.</p>
<p>I was originally using Ti Developer to create and compile a project and Eclipse to do the actual coding (and got really frustrated by this process), so for me now it&#39;s great I can do both from the same app.</p>
