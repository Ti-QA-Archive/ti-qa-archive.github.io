			<h1>Ti.Contacts super slow on Android + inconsistent with native contacts app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m having some issues working with contacts on Android and I was hoping that someone might be able to provide some insight. I&#39;m using <code>Ti.Contacts.getPeopleWithName(query)</code> to query my contacts database, but it takes several seconds to query the database and return results. </p>
<p>On iOS, with the same set of contacts, the results are very fast (nearly instantaneous). </p>
<p>Here&#39;s where things seem to be going wrong:</p>
<p>On Android, when I count the results of getAllPeople, it returns 7,842 contacts. On iOS (again, with the exact same contacts setup), I get 733 contacts. </p>
<p>The difference appears to be that my contacts database is synced with Google Contacts&#x2F;Gmail, and on iOS, it&#39;s only returning the My Contacts group from Gmail; on Android, it&#39;s returning My Contacts + Other Contacts (where Other Contacts is everyone who&#39;s ever emailed me ever).</p>
<p>What&#39;s strange is that this isn&#39;t the Titanium behavior on iOS, and it&#39;s also not the behavior on my Android&#39;s stock Phone app. So I&#39;m wondering:</p>
<p>Is there a good way to handle this? I don&#39;t see any options for specifying contact groups on Android, but I can&#39;t help but feeling like I&#39;m missing something obvious.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help!</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>You have not provided any code to enabled any reasonable reviews.  So here are some generic answers;</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS is Faster than Android</li>
<li>733 entries would be faster to retrieve than 7,842</li>
</ul>
<p>Have you looked at the iOS only contacts - (getAllGroups](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Contacts-method-getAllGroups) method?  It sounds like you are getting one group and your device may have more than one grouping of contacts.  Chances are Android sees them all as one thing.</p>

										<p><p>I know that iOS is looking at a different set of contacts than Android is. I want to know if it&#39;s possible to search just the 733-contact group on Android rather than the full 7,842 group.</p>

										<p><p>Then no, as I mentioned related to my poorly formatted link above this grouping filtering is iOS only.</p>
