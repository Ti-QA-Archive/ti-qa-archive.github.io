			<h1>Icon on submitted app looks incorrect</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>My app is in the store waiting for review, but look at the icon:</p>
<p><img src="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;img.skitch.com&#x2F;20110610-p97bm9b76h8i2uxssc3ctsuuyc.jpg &quot;icon&quot;" alt="icon"></p>
<p>There are 2 sets of rounded corners. I never saw that before: in testing on devices it looked fine.</p>

							<p>Did you send one which you had already &#39;rounded&#39;? Or a square cornered one?</p>
<p>It&#39;s possible that the iTunes connect page there just has some dodgy CSS going on there. (if you have sent a squared one)</p>

										<p><p>No, my icon was square.  Anyway, the compiled app on the phone looked fine, so I hope it&#39;s just that page.</p>

							<p>Apple does a couple of things to your icon including adding the light reflection effect (which can be turned off if you want) and rounding the corners. I suspect that your original image has rounded corners - you are now seeing your original rounded corners as well as Apple&#39;s automatically added ones. Modify your image to have square corners with no hint of rounding and Apple will round them for you. </p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>

							<p>Also, the image that is in the screenshot you showed is the &quot;Large Icon&quot; that is uploaded into iTunesConnect independent of the app and NOT the one from inside the app bundle. I have several native apps on the App Store but have not yet submitted a Titanium app so I don&#39;t know if the process is different but the icon you showed above is handled in iTunesConnect separate from you app bundle - this means that you can change it AFTER your app is reviewed and released in the store so don&#39;t worry to much about changing it now.</p>
