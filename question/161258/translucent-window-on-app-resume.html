			<h1>Translucent window on app resume</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Since upgrading to Titanium 3.2.0 I noticed that sometimes when resuming my app a translucent black window with nothing on it will cover the screen. I cannot click anything in my app while this window is there. When I hit the physical back button the app closes and when I open it again it restarts and everything is fine. What could be causing this?</p>

							<p>This could be caused by a window wich was lightweight on 3.1.3 and it is now forced to be heavyweight on 3.2.0</p>
<p>You will need to share your code for a more accurate answer.</p>

										<p><p>The window I open in app.js was not modal in 3.1.3, but in moving to 3.2.0 it changed the appearance so I made it modal to regain its former appearance. This is pretty much how all of my windows are declared in my application:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> win = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
  layout: <span class="hljs-string">'vertical'</span>,
  backgroundColor:<span class="hljs-string">'#000000'</span>,
  navBarHidden:<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>,
  exitOnClose:<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>,
  modal:<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>,
  orientationModes: [
        Ti.UI.LANDSCAPE_LEFT,
        Ti.UI.LANDSCAPE_RIGHT,
        Ti.UI.PORTRAIT,
        Ti.UI.UPSIDE_PORTRAIT
    ]
});
</code></pre></p>

										<p><p>Opening this window on top of an existing window would do what you described, wouldn&#39;t it? Maybe you can prepare an executable example that reproduces you issue?</p>

										<p><p>The window I posted is my &#39;log in&#39; window. I append fields and images to it further down in my code. The window in question has nothing on it and appears to have an opacity setting as I can see my &#39;log in&#39; window and its&#39; fields through it; I just can&#39;t click on the fields through this translucent window. I can&#39;t provide code to reproduce this as it isn&#39;t consistent. It only happens if my app has been in the background for a while and then I click on the icon to resume it.  And I do not open any windows with the opacity setting.</p>
