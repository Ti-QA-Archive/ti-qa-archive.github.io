			<h1>App Notification settings under the Notification section in iPhone settings</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I managed to implement my app settings in the iPhone settings.<br>However, I would like to have them under the Notification section in the iPhone settings so that they can appear in a standard way as the other applications.</p>
<p>Would anyone know how to do that ?</p>
<p>Many thanks !</p>

										<p><p>Actually, that was not precisely my question. I managed to put the settings under the iphone settings page. What I would like is to put the &quot;notifications&quot; under the &quot;notifications&quot; category of the iphone settings. There is a dedicated section for that.</p>
