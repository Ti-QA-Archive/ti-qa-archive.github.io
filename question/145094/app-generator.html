			<h1>App Generator</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi everyone,<br>currently I am working on my Bachelor thesis. The topic is &quot;Development of Component-based, platform-independent mobile applications&quot;. My current approach is to develop a mobile platform where a customer has the ability to create a mobile app. He simply needs to make certain information about the app, and then a titanium-project will be created. After that, I only have to import that project into Titanium Studio and then the project is distributed to the stores. </p>
<p>So my question is: Is there a better way to achieve this goal? Or is there any other approach?</p>

							<p>Not really sure what this question is trying to achieve</p>
<p>You start by explaining you are doing a bachelors thesis with a very long topic name and then suggest you want to auto generate an app that does an unknown task that can change this task for all subsequent apps.  </p>
<p>Then &quot;he&quot;, not sure when a someone was introduced, but hey what do I know - has a Ti app produced. With so little information you want the best way to approach this task.</p>
<p>So my question is: surely if you are doing a bachelors you would be better able to explain yourself and also capable of determining, through a process of self guided determination using the products yourself in order to prove your own thesis?</p>

							<p>If someone could develop a wizard where you answer a few questions, and all of a sudden your magical app is delivered to stores, they&#39;d be rich, dont you think?</p>
<p>I&#39;d get a better topic if I were you.</p>
