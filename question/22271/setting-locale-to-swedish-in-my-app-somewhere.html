			<p>When I install my apps on my iPhone all standard buttons and controllers appear in English. So when the camera is started it states &quot;USE&quot; instead of the Swedish word which whould be &quot;ANVÄND&quot;.</p>
<p>Can I tell my Titanium project to set localization to Swedish somewhere?</p>

							<p>Ahhh!</p>
<p>now I can answer the question - I found a way to set the language for the app:</p>
<p>simply edit the &quot;Info.plist.template&quot; file in your app directory (appdir&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;build&#x2F;Info.plist.template) switch the first line (now &quot;English&quot;) to what you need.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>

							<p>UPDATE: NOW IT WORKS!</p>
<p>I am not entirely sure what I did to make this happen. All I can say is that I did the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Moving my Info.plist from &lt;ProjectName&gt;&#x2F;build&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;Info.plist to &lt;ProjectName&gt;&#x2F;</li>
<li>Opening the Info.plist file and changing the language to &quot;Denmark&quot;.</li>
<li>Compiling (which somehow makes a copy of the Info.plist and puts the copy in the original place, but keeping my changes).</li>
</ol>
<p>I guess maybe I did something to make a complete recompile (you can force this by deleting the directory: &lt;ProjectName&gt;&#x2F;build&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;).</p>
<p>All of the sudden it started working… :D</p>
<hr>
<p>I am having the exact same problem. I am developing an application for the danish market, and would like the native elements to appear with danish texts (my specific problem lies with the search field and the associated cancel button).</p>
<p>So far I have tried fixing the Info.plist file - I followed the advice from another thread:</p>
<ol>
<li>Moving my Info.plist from &lt;ProjectName&gt;&#x2F;build&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;Info.plist to &lt;ProjectName&gt;&#x2F;</li>
<li>Opening the Info.plist file and changing the language to danish</li>
<li>Compiling (which somehow makes a copy of the Info.plist and puts the copy in the original place, but keeping my changes).</li>
</ol>
<p>This, however, did not do anything for me with regards to getting danish working in the native elements. Maybe I am not using the right value for danish; I have tried some different variations, such as Danish, Denmark, da, dk and so on. No luck so far.</p>
<p>I tried doing the same changes to the Info.plist.template file, as suggested elsewhere in the thread, but it didn&#39;t change anything.</p>
<p>I have seen quite a few threads regarding this issue, but so far no answers. Any thoughts?</p>
