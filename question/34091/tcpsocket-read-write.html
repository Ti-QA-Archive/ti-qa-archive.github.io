			<h1>TCPSocket read, write</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello</p>
<p>I am currently testing the development of a desktop application.</p>
<p>I need to interact with a server through a TCP socket, which, for my test<br>setup, instantly communicates back data contents transmitted by the client<br>(the client being unique).<br>Client side (Titanium).</p>
<p>I create an object TCPSocket with the createTCPSocket function, I assign a callback on<br>OnRead, OnWrite, ontimeout and onReadComplete events. After that, I connect<br>this object to the server with the connect function.</p>
<p>The connection is done properly (I get some server logs). Server-side, it<br>turns out to be pending datas from the client using a function &quot;select&quot;<br>(server written in c)</p>
<p>If I do a write command immediately after the connect on the socket, I get<br>the contents of write command through the OnRead event.<br>Server-side, I can see in the logs that the select is released and the data<br>sent.<br>Then I do a write command again on the socket and the server does not<br>receive anything any more, so I do not retrieve anything on the OnRead<br>event.</p>
<p>If I do a write command a few time after the connect, I have an answer on<br>the OnRead event with a – at least - 7 seconds delay. (The server receives<br>the data after 7 seconds delay according to tcpdump).<br>Then I do a write command again on the socket and the server does not<br>receive anything any more, so I do not retrieve anything on the OnRead<br>event.</p>
<p>I noticed that the onTimeout event is often triggered.<br>Regularly, when I do the first write command, the onWrite event is triggered<br>after the ontimeout event, then comes the OnRead event.</p>
<p>My questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is there a latency on the write command that is not done immediately<br>after the connect ?</li>
<li>Why doesn’t a second write command to the socket work? Is it necessary to<br>close the socket and to reset the connection?</li>
<li>Should we change the server so that it works with two sockets like &quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;690072&quot; ?</li>
<li>What is the point of the timeout on the TCP socket and is there a way of<br>bringing it unlimited?</li>
</ul>
<p>Benoit</p>

							<div><p>Could it be that the server needs to flush its output? Depending on what software the server application is written in, you might need to call a flush() method or at least send a terminating CR+LF at the end of the message for the server to send the message immediately.</p>
