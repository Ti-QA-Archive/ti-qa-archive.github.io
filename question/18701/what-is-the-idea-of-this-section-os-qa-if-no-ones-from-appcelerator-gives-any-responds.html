			<p>sorry, but I left a question regarding how to get access on login screen when you hava a proxy with authentication. If I am going to test your tool and you expect to sell me that tool, I just wish to start working on it, so I need to log in.<br>Therefore, no answer from Appcelerator, no trial or interest from developer, no selling; that&#39;s definetly is a non win-to-win schema.! </p>

							<p>As far as I know, you can do login with proxy like normal you would do if you got a web-application.</p>
<p>Maybe I could help you, cause I´m very familiar with http-authentication and got enough knowledge with titanium in that case too.</p>
<p>What is you environment? Did you mean http-authentication (htacces) or what specially? What kind of proxy?</p>

							<p>I am behind a proxy on port 80, which also has authentication to get network access. In this moment, I have access via browser, skype, googletalk, etc. But Titanium allways shows me the same error instantly:</p>
<p>Requested time out, make sure you are online</p>
<p>Therefore, I can&#39;t do anything. In fact there is not option to configure a proxy and cloud image at botton-right is gray as well as the indicator of network. But again, this only happens with Titatinum, the rest apps works fine with internet connection.</p>

							<p>You mean, Titanium Developer is not working, it is not a problem when developing your app?</p>
<p>In that case, you need to now what kind of proxy you are using….  SOCKS proxy?</p>
<p>Did you tried   http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.proxifier.com   (for MAC)?<br>With this tool you can configure you whole traffic or even single applications to use a specific proxy connection… and with this Titanium Developer should work too….</p>
<p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>I just checked it out with &quot;Charles Proxy&quot;  and Titanium Developer is connection to<br>api.appcelerator.net on port 443</p>
<p>Therefore you need the proxifier tool to map this connection access to port 80 on your proxy…. but maybe… your proxy will not allow connections on port 443 …. (SSL)?</p>

							<p>I have same environment and I made TD working. The problem is that TD also uses ICMP packets to check is connection available or not. First, you need to set HTTP_PROXY variable in the form http:&#x2F;&#x2F;user:password@host:port and you also need to comment out some code of TD, which checks network availability. Right now I can&#39;t give more info, since I&#39;m at home, but I&#39;m talking about office environment. If the problem still exists, I&#39;ll give more info on Monday</p>

							<p>I think Konstantin Vorobyev could give us more information on this subject.</p>
<p>I am passing through the same problem. Using Windows, behind a NTLM (Windows) network which uses NTLM authentication. I tried adding the HTTP_PROXY environment variable in the format http:&#x2F;&#x2F;user:pass@server:port but even though it didn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>I am still looking forward to finding a solution so I&#39;ll be able to simply log into TD. I use it with my Mac but I am also trying to use it in my PC at work.</p>
<p>FYI, I also tried to change appcelerator.xml file (Program Files&#x2F;Titanium Developer&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;appcelerator.xml) and it also caused nothing.</p>
<p>Any new ideas?</p>

							<p>I confirm Appcelerator DOES NOT work behind a proxy (a SOCKS 5 proxy, correctly configured for ANY other app).</p>
<p>No answer from those people.</p>
<p>Too bad. </p>
<p>Really not a good way to start working with this product.</p>

										<p><p>I just found the answer in another post.<br>(I had to set the SOCKS_PROXY env var properly)</p>
<p>Please note you mention in the documentation that Titanium Developer and the Mobile and Desktop SDKs are tested using Windows 7 and XP. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, the step-by-step installation guide is available for Windows 7 only, which could be misleading in some way.</p>
<p>With regards</p>
