		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We built an app which was connected to an ACS account. We created a new ACS account, updated the app to connect to the new ACS account, and now the app is stuck in the ACS Development environment of the new account… The app has a register username functionality and regardless of which mode is on in ACS when we register a new username through the app the username always shows up in the Development environment. We&#39;ve entered the correct credentials for Production and Development in tiapp.xml and tried doing a clean build.</p>
<p>Is there a way to force the app to work with the Production environment? If not how do we see which environment the app is interacting with in the Console?</p>
<p>This is SDK 3.0.2 and we are using the iPhone simulator to test this. </p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>I see. Is there a variable that we can set in the app which can be used to tell whether it is working in debug&#x2F;development or production&#x2F;release mode? Right now we have an acl_id hardcoded and we have to change the value every time we go from development into production. It would be ideal if we can just put put both acl_id&#39;s in a JS if statement (and not have to change the hardcoded value every time). Thanks.</p>
