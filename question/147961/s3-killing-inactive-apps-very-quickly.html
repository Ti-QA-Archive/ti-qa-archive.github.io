			<h1>S3 killing Inactive apps very Quickly.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I create simple Titanium app which uses cookie to communicate with web services.</p>
<p>My problem is only S3, becuase it is killing the app very Quickly.</p>
<p>Setps:-</p>
<p>1) I opened my app, logged in  and started call web services.</p>
<p>2) Press home button (center button). Now app is in Inactive state</p>
<p>3) Open Contacts, Browser, Dropbox, Facebook, and few more</p>
<p>4) Now open my app, I can see my app again shows splash screen and I can access web services too. (May be cookie is also clearing)</p>
<p>In other devices: But the case is diff:<br>Same issue I am facing when I open my app and go to application manager and force close the app.</p>
<p>and open my app, it is not connecting to web service. I am losing connection. But, it works fine in iOS devices.</p>
<p>In Android itslef works fine when I close the app using backbutton and reopen after sometime. </p>
<p>is there any why to over come from this issue.  By the way Cookie will expire after 1 day only.</p>

<p>I tried with two S3 device. In both it kill apps (even default contacts, phone dial pad).</p>
<p>It is not happening with HTC explorer (even thought it is low configuration)</p>

										<p><p>Android dev is indeed interesting. We learned that the Nexus 7 deletes tmp files within seconds of you last accessing them. Makes for a good time. <em>grin</em></p>
