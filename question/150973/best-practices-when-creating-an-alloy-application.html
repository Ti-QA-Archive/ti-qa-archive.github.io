			<h1>Best Practices When Creating an Alloy Application</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi there-</p>
<p>I was wondering if anyone can share some best practices when creating Alloy applications?  There were several examples, tutorials for best practices in developing Titanium apps that I followed, which greatly helped my organization and performance of my Titanium applications, and I was looking for similar advice.</p>
<p>In my Titanium applications, I heavily used self calling&#x2F;anonymous functions and organization by namespaces.  For example, I had a library of functionality which was required on startup, which setup my network functionality, database functionalty, configuration profiles, etc., all withing individual &quot;namespaces&#x2F;objects, such as:</p>
<p>ApplicationName.Network<br>ApplicationName.FileSystem<br>Etc</p>
<p>These libraries could be used throughout my application (and I actually intend on bringing these libs to Alloy.</p>
<p>Here is where I am stuck.  In organizing my patterns with MVC, do I need to organize application functionality further with self calling&#x2F;anonymous functionality, under namespaces within controllers?  Are there best practices to employ within controllers for performance?  Do I simply load controllers with a bunch of call backs, that relate to the view, and let Alloy handle the linkage?  Is there a best practice that I should use to help out Alloy for my own organization here, as I did in the standard Titanium applications?</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your help.</p>
<p>Talk soon<br>Chris</p>

							<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a silver bullet answer to all your questions here. As with most things in development, it depends on the situation. That said, let me take a stab at some of your concerns.</p>
<h2 id="in-organizing-my-patterns-with-mvc-do-i-need-to-organize-application-functionality-further-with-self-calling-x2f-anonymous-functionality-under-namespaces-within-controllers-">In organizing my patterns with MVC, do I need to organize application functionality further with self calling&#x2F;anonymous functionality, under namespaces within controllers?</h2>
<p>Not unless you want to. If you have a pre-existing set of functionality that you want to make available globally throughout your app, there&#39;s no reason to further sub-categorize it unless it serves you in terms of organization or scalability. There&#39;s nothing preventing you from requiring your pre-existing modules in all your Alloy controllers, or even making a single global reference to your module that can be referenced throughout your app. For example:</p>
<h3 id="app-x2f-alloy-js">app&#x2F;alloy.js</h3>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// Alloy.Globals.refToYourModule will be available in all controllers</span>
Alloy.Globals.refToYourModule = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'yourModule'</span>);
</code></pre><h2 id="are-there-best-practices-to-employ-within-controllers-for-performance-">Are there best practices to employ within controllers for performance?</h2>
<p>The same best practices that apply to traditional Titanium development still apply in the world of Alloy. In fact, everything you can do in traditional Titanium development you can do in Alloy&#39;s controllers. So remember the best practices you learned to this point with traditional Titanium dev and they will serve you in Alloy. That said, the best trick you can use now is taking advantage of the compiler directives to speed up runtime performance. Check out this guide to see how to use them: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Alloy_Controllers-section-34636384_AlloyControllers-ConditionalCode">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Alloy_Controllers-section-34636384_AlloyControllers-ConditionalCode</a></p>
<h2 id="do-i-simply-load-controllers-with-a-bunch-of-call-backs-that-relate-to-the-view-and-let-alloy-handle-the-linkage-">Do I simply load controllers with a bunch of call backs, that relate to the view, and let Alloy handle the linkage?</h2>
<p>You can do this, or you can use eventing between your controllers to handle this communication. The latter would be my preference as it encourages loose coupling between you controllers. For a basic example of using controller eventing to communicate between controllers, check out this test app from the Alloy repo: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;alloy&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;test&#x2F;apps&#x2F;advanced&#x2F;master_detail">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;alloy&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;test&#x2F;apps&#x2F;advanced&#x2F;master_detail</a></p>
<h2 id="is-there-a-best-practice-that-i-should-use-to-help-out-alloy-for-my-own-organization-here-as-i-did-in-the-standard-titanium-applications-">Is there a best practice that I should use to help out Alloy for my own organization here, as I did in the standard Titanium applications?</h2>
<p>I think the previous answers cover this to a degree, but as I said, there&#39;s no silver bullet. It depends on the size and depth of your existing organization. You need to determine if it makes sense bend Alloy around your existing organization, or bend your existing organization around Alloy. Obviously I would lean towards the latter for personal reasons :), but aside from that, the less individual to you the organization and the more like Alloy it is, the more likely it is that someone will readily be able to help you with your app if&#x2F;when you encounter issues. One of the driving forces behind Alloy was a need to standardize the many disparate Titanium coding methodologies out there. In doing so well not only make it cleaner and mosr in line with best practices, but we also give it a familiar feel and structure that makes it easier for other developers to help and contribute.</p>
<p>This should give you a bit to chew on. Hopefully it helps guide the decision in shaping your app as an Alloy one.</p>

										<p><p>This is great guidance, and what I was looking for.  Thank you taking the time to helping out with the pointers.  I think between keeping libraries and using the Globals for some network&#x2F;dbase&#x2F;logging functionality to be common and available across all controllers, and the eventing paradigm to provide loose controller coupling, I should be in good shape.</p>
<p>Thanks again for the continued help as I stumble through the framework. :)</p>
