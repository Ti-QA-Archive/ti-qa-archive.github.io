			<h1>App runs fine on all Android SDKs up to 4.1 and above where it fails to install</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I havent updated my android app in a while now, and decided to do so for the new year.</p>
<p>Anyways, I installed the new titanium, all the new SDKs, basicly a fresh start.  My app continues to run well on all Android SDKs up to the 4.1.2 SDK.  On that SDK and the 4.2SDK it fails to install (the emulator itself runs, but the app icon isnt on the emulator).</p>
<p>I have no idea where to begin to diagnose this issue, but was there an obvious change in structure that has happened that may be causing this abrupt failure to install?</p>
<p>Thanks for any tips on where to begin!</p>

							<p>Well, let me start by saying the android emulator is a crap shoot no matter what API its trying to run. At least a lame horse has value as glue or dog food, the emulator ranks well behind a lame horse.</p>
<p>Second, lets refer to android levels as API and Titanium versions as SDK so that no one gets confused.</p>
<p>Third, in all Android development, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;tools&#x2F;debugging&#x2F;ddms.html">DDMS</a> (now the monitor binary) is your friend as it will let you know whats going on behind the scenes with a device or emulator.</p>

										<p><p>Here in the states, folks will sell you a used Verizon phone and as soon as the transaction goes through, they call up Verizon, claim its stolen.  Or folks lose their phone, report it as missing, then find it and resell it.  In both cases, Verizon enters the EMID&#x2F;ESN&#x2F;IMEI into their database.  That phone can NEVER be used on their network again.  </p>
<p>There are thousands of perfectly good test devices floating around that can&#39;t be activated, but can be used for testing.</p>
