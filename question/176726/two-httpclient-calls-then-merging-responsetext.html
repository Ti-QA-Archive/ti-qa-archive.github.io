			<h1>Two httpClient calls then merging responseText</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Dear fellow Developers</p>
<p>Android. Alloy . Titanium Studio.</p>
<p>Ive run into a snag. I have two httpClient calls … same database but two different tables. I would like to merge the two resulting responseTexts into one array so that I can add this as record to a third table. </p>
<p>Two possible solutions. Either merge at js level and append to 3rd table or use PHP script to do so.</p>
<p>My question: how do I extract the two separate reeponseText from their onload call and merge them into one array. </p>
<p>Your insight and suggestions will be most appreciated.</p>

<p>I&#39;m with the guys on this one, if you are in charge, combine where you can.<br>Too often APIs are viewed as &#39;free&#39;.</p>
<p>An API call is anything but.  On some backends there is an actual $$$ associated per API call.<br>But there is the cost of time for your user of the app.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>If you are in charge of the APIs; either you wrote them or you can affect changes to them - merge the results into a single call and get the data back in one result.</p>

										<p><p>You can make two different <strong>httpClient</strong> calls and merge the data together, but there are concerns which we will go through first and then I will explain what to do to achieve the double call if you still want to use it.</p>
<ul>
<li>httpClient calls are async (can be turned off on some devices - NEVER do that)</li>
<li>You can chain the calls or at the same time</li>
<li>You cannot guarantee which will finish first</li>
<li>The users experience will depend on a timely response, adding two calls reduces that potential</li>
<li>Network problems are easier to resolve on a single call, double calls increase that problem a lot</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>If you really must then, you just have to think the process through a little differently;</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a single function that handles the responses</li>
<li>Call both at the same time</li>
<li>Allow the handler to determine when completed</li>
</ul>
<p>Something like this - adjust to your own needs;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> data = {};
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> processData = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (data.somepage &amp;&amp; data.otherpage) {
        <span class="hljs-comment">// process the data - it is now available</span>
        Ti.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">'data:\n'</span> + <span class="hljs-built_in">JSON</span>.stringify(data, <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>, <span class="hljs-number">4</span>));
    }
};
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">exampleCall</span> = <span class="hljs-title">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">obj</span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> xhr = Ti.Network.createHTTPClient({
        onload: <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{
            data[obj.node] = <span class="hljs-built_in">JSON</span>.stringify(<span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.responseText);
            processData();
        },
        onerror: <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">e</span>) </span>{
            Ti.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">'stuff happens'</span>);
        }
    });
    xhr.open(<span class="hljs-string">'POST'</span>, obj.url);
    xhr.send(obj.param);
}

exampleCall({
    url: <span class="hljs-string">'http://somewhere.com/somefolder/somepage.php'</span>,
    param: {
        something: <span class="hljs-string">'somevalue'</span>
    },
    node: <span class="hljs-string">'somepage'</span>
});
exampleCall({
    url: <span class="hljs-string">'http://somewhere.com/somefolder/otherpage.php'</span>,
    param: {
        more: <span class="hljs-string">'another'</span>
    },
    node: <span class="hljs-string">'otherpage'</span>
});
</code></pre><p>The basic principle is you pass the normal stuff plus a JSON object node name, once the data property has both nodes then both calls must have completed&#x2F;</p>
<p>But again - if you can do it on the server.</p>

										<p><p>Malcolm, Nick .. thank you both for the feedback. Seems clear then the most efficient path is to leave the processing serverside … should also mention that I&#39;ve merged barcode scanner and NFC into one app … a barcode is scanned … the result is used to secure array1 from table1 via httpClient… then the NFC is scanned … the result is used to secure array2 from table2 via httpClient … this is working well … and I&#39;ve managed to do both httpClient calls in one .js controller file …  I now need to merge the two arrays as previously mentioned … </p>
<ol>
<li><p>I shall first try serverside solution … perhaps write the indivudual arrays to one record into table3 … still need to decide on a mutual key.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Failing above try run both calls in one httpClient … you guys got suggestion of how to run two httpClient calls with both responseTexts rendered under one onload result … can this be done?</p>
</li>
</ol>

										<p><p>OK last part first &quot;Failing…&quot; that s the code example to solve that, you cannot call two urls with one call, so you call perform two calls, each listens for the data and then runs processData - if says both are finished then THAT is where you run your processing code.</p>
<p>However your additional information adds the context missing from before.</p>
<p>If you have a two step process; barcode to remote DB, that passes back a key that is used with the nfc scan before another call to the database - then that is the process.</p>
<p>You call the barcode routine to server first and then inside its onload you then trigger the NFC process.  Use the same logic as did above, create a module level variable <strong>data</strong> in my case that your calls set the data to.  When both are finished - that IS the merged data.  The example above shows how that works.</p>

							<p>My two pence…</p>
<p>It is always a good idea to attempt to combine your remote data into a single request&#x2F;response if at all possible as the additional latency in retrieving two result sets will slow operations much more and also consume more battery.</p>
<p>Also, passing off the &#39;processing&#39; to the server is again more efficient for your App and will speed things up.</p>
<p>Make sure your response data is in an easily accessible format for processing. In other words use JSON</p>
