			<p>Hi folks, thanks in advance for any help. I have a notebook with Core i7, 16GB Ram and a SSD with Windows 7 Pro 64bit and HAX installed. I&#39;m trying to use Titanium as platform for developing mobile apps just for Android not without frustration for a lot of reasons (unexpected behaviors, strange errors and so on) but the worse thing is that I must wait almost 60 secs to see the app in the emulator because the time for building&#x2F;install the app in the emulartor is hideously long. It&#39;s not possible to wait so much just to see the effect produced by changing the color in a view for example. To avoid this wasting time I adopt this solution: I test the code logic in a WHS file and if it is all ok I copy it into my Titanium project or I try the code as a mobile web app. But, as you can see, these approaches are unconfortable especially if I have to use some kind of special feature (e.g. the camera) Is there a solution (also a manual solution using some sort of script) to address this inconvenient? If so please tell me how can i do clearly. Thanks</p>

							<p>Couple of things. First, download and use <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tishadow.yydigital.com&#x2F;">tishadow</a>. That will address 90% of your issues. The other thing is to install and use the genymotion android emulators. Both is these together will make you ecstatic to develop for android!</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the reply. Unfortunally it seems so complicated to use tishadow that I&#39;m<br>discouraged. I try to follow all the guides I found but there is not like a simple and clear step by step guide for Winodws. Trying to use it  I got errors like &quot;Could not create destination directory. Error: null&quot;  and &quot;Failed to install apk on &quot;emulator-5554&quot;. I don&#39;t know what can I do. Bye</p>
