			<h1>Background Image Fails to Load on iOS Device, Works on Simulator</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>So I&#39;m having the same problem as a lot of other people - but so far no solutions are working for me. Setting the background like this (keep in mind this all works in the simulator) yields a blank image on the device:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="xml">var view = Ti.UI.createView(</span><span class="hljs-expression">{ <span class="hljs-variable">backgroundImage</span>: <span class="hljs-variable">Ti.Filesystem.appDataDirectory</span> + '<span class="hljs-variable">games</span><span class="hljs-end-block">/game</span>1<span class="hljs-end-block">/app</span><span class="hljs-end-block">/tile.png</span>'}</span><span class="xml">);</span>
</code></pre><p>The data directory will have a bunch of folders&#x2F;files loaded into on first run - at the time of the bug, there are two folders within the Documents&#x2F;games folder:</p>
<p>Documents&#x2F;games&#x2F;game1&#x2F;app&#x2F;tile.png<br>Documents&#x2F;games&#x2F;game2&#x2F;app&#x2F;tile.png</p>
<p>(I heard XCode flattens the file paths? Maybe that&#39;s the issue?)</p>
<p>Anyway, everything is the right casing (all lowercase everything) and it doesn&#39;t seem to be working.</p>
<p>Anyone have any ideas for what the issue could be?</p>

										<p><p>Via the simulator, yes - everything works perfectly in the iOS simulator, which I&#39;m happy about. However, as soon as I deploy to a device, when I load the app, any image that isn&#39;t located in the Resources folder is not shown.</p>

										<p><p>So it turns out it was an issue with the file structure of all things… Ugh. Such a simple thing to overlook. Since I was copying files manually, I forgot that the structure isn&#39;t exactly the same as it is on my server (where the files are actually supposed to come from). <em>facepalm</em></p>
