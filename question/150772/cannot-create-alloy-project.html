			<h1>Cannot create Alloy project</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi There,</p>
<p>I&#39;m new to Appcelerator.  I&#39;ve installed everything that was asked for as far as I can tell.  I even uninstalled the latest node.js and installed the 8.22 version.  I can load and run the &#39;kitchen sink&#39; sample app just fine.  My Ti Studio is at 3.02.  I cannot tell what version of Alloy I have, but I know it seemed to install separately during an &#39;update&#39;.  When I try to create a new Alloy project using the UI, I fill in all the required fields, all looks good.  When I hit the &#39;do it&#39; (Save) button, i get the following error:</p>
<p>Internal error: &#39;node&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command,<br>operable program or batch file.<br>&#39;node&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command,<br>operable program or batch file.<br>java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException</p>
<p>There <em>is</em> a project created, and it does have some files in it (none of the MVC folders that I expected).  I have to cancel out of the create dialog.</p>
<p>I have tried creating the project from the dos prompt (I&#39;m on win 7), and I get a shortened version of the same error:  &#39;node&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command</p>
<p>I&#39;ve read a bunch of similar threads.  Some point to the node.js version thing.  Some point to a newer version of Ti Studio.  Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>-David</p>

							<p>Sounds like the node executable is not on your PATH. Add the location of your node executable to your <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;geekswithblogs.net&#x2F;renso&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2009&#x2F;10&#x2F;21&#x2F;how-to-set-the-windows-path-in-windows-7.aspx">PATH environment variables</a>.</p>

										<p><p>Not sure about the ins and outs of exactly what Windows expects for those strings, but yes, you should have the nodejs bin folder on your PATH as that is where the executable actually lives.</p>

										<p><p>OK… I understand the notion of a &#39;bin&#39; folder, many things have them.  In Node.js case, at least on my Win 7 system, the C:\Program Files (x86)\nodejs\ folder contains the node.exe file.  However, there is also a sub-dir there called node_modules, which has a npm, which has an actual BIN dir, which contains such things as npm, npm.cmd and npm-cli.js    Is <em>this</em> the bin folder you mean? Or do you mean the nodejs folder, which, contains the node.exe but isn&#39;t called &#39;BIN&#39;?</p>
<p>Assuming the &#39;bin&#39; folder is correct, and, it&#39;s already in my PATH, then… ???  Any more ideas on why this wouldn&#39;t be working?</p>

										<p><p>More info:  I am able to use the &#39;dashboard&#39; to create new template-based projects.  I created both a &#39;standard&#39; project, and an Alloy project.  both seemed to create fine, including all the sub directories on the Alloy project.</p>
<p>I do have a problem though with &#39;running&#39; either of the new projects - Even with the Kitchen Sink removed from my App Explorer, it is the only app that shows up in the emulator.  Neither of the new test apps show up.  I have seen this behavior on a friend of mine&#39;s system  once he had run the Kitchen Sink, it was the only app that ever got displayed in the emulator.  Any suggestions on that one?</p>
<p>Finally - when coding inside the Alloy &#39;view&#39; file, should I expect to see any &#39;intellisense&#39; (code helpers)?  I am used to Visual Studio C#, Adobe Flex and even PHP within Eclipse.  All provide tons of intellisense.  Without it, how would one know what is &#39;allowable&#39; to type?  I tried looking for documentation on all of the allowable &#39;xml objects&#39; and their allowable attributes, but found hardly anything.</p>

							<p>Thanks Tony, however, when I went to add the path to my PATH var, I found that it was already there (at the end)!  The value is:  C:\Program Files (x86)\nodejs.  Now, upon re-reading the &#39;installing Node.js&#39; directions, I noticed thing mentioning the BIN folder in the Node directory, as well as some place else in the document that mentioned aliasing the &#39;path to the program files&#39; string.  Would you say that what I have is ok, or do I need to use %PROGRAMFILES% instead?  The path vars for Java and Git all use the &#39;true&#39; string for the program files dir.</p>
