		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve been running my app on devices fine up until this point. Now when I try to install to device, via xCode Organiser, I&#39;m prompted with the not too friendly error message:</p>
<p>&quot;The argument is invalid.&quot;</p>
<p>I did change the provisioning profile over the weekend. I deleted all existing profiles from the device, installed this latest version - but now I&#39;m getting this message every time I try to install…</p>
<p>Any help would be grateful…</p>

							<p>When you install to device, you are typically prompted by Titanium Studio to upload a provisioning profile through Studio. Did you install your new provisioning profile through Studio? If not, you may need to do it this way.</p>
<p>If you can&#39;t get it resolved, you may also want to try creating a new project, copy your existing project&#39;s resources to it, then trying to install to the device again. There&#39;s a possibility something got messed up with the project settings when you switched profiles.</p>

										<p><p>Also just for further info - I&#39;m having to install via xCode because synching via iTunes would remove all the apps on this device (their not linked).</p>
<p>Would installing via Ti Studio use iTunes synching or can I install via this manner safely?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help…</p>

										<p><p>Installing via Titanium Studio would indeed use iTunes syncing, and it would resolve the issue with you changing your provisioning profile as you would be able to assign a new one to the build. What you could try is to attempt to install from TiStudio, wait for it to prompt you about your new provisioning profile, upload the profile that way, then cancel out the install from TiStudio. You may need to build your project again. Try your xcode install again after that.</p>
<p>This is some guessing though because we typically always use TiStudio to do the app installs.</p>

							<p>Hi Tony, really appreciate your help.</p>
<p>This helped.  I had to follow the Ti-Studio procedure and make sure to cancel before iTuens synched, this threw up the following error in Ti.Studio:</p>
<p>2011-10-04 14:22:30.478 osascript[79711:607] Error loading &#x2F;Library&#x2F;ScriptingAdditions&#x2F;Adobe Unit Types.osax&#x2F;Contents&#x2F;MacOS&#x2F;Adobe Unit Types:  dlopen(&#x2F;Library&#x2F;ScriptingAdditions&#x2F;Adobe Unit Types.osax&#x2F;Contents&#x2F;MacOS&#x2F;Adobe Unit Types, 262): no suitable image found.  Did find:<br>    &#x2F;Library&#x2F;ScriptingAdditions&#x2F;Adobe Unit Types.osax&#x2F;Contents&#x2F;MacOS&#x2F;Adobe Unit Types: no matching architecture in universal wrapper<br>osascript: OpenScripting.framework - scripting addition &quot;&#x2F;Library&#x2F;ScriptingAdditions&#x2F;Adobe Unit Types.osax&quot; declares no loadable handlers.</p>
<p>But I could then install the app via the xCode method.</p>
<p>One other thing, the prov profile from Apple came in this manner appName.mobileprovision, but I had to change this to a 32 alpha-numeric.mobileprovision file name?!?</p>
<p>Anyway thanks for all your help…</p>
