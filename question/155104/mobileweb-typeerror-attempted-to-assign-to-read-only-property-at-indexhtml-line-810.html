			<p>How am I supposed to debug something like this in mobileweb?</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">TypeError: Attempted <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> assign <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> <span class="hljs-command">read</span> only <span class="hljs-keyword">property</span>. <span class="hljs-keyword">at</span> /index.html (line <span class="hljs-number">810</span>)
</code></pre><p>I get a big red flashing screen with the above message. But, when I go look at index.html line 810, I do not see my codes, but some default generated by Titanium. Please note that I am using Safari both on Mac and iPhone to achieve this error. I have no idea what is causing it.</p>
<p>Mobileweb is a very interesting platform that would make Titanium very complete. However, I am feeling very blind using it now. Titanium on iPhone and Android produce much better reporting.</p>

							<div><p>I found out further that I get this error on Safari on Mac and iPhone, but Google Chrome does not produce this error. I Googled around and think it may have something to do with &quot;use strict&quot;, but I currently do not know how to resolve this.</p>

							<p>I had the exact same issue. Had to literally comment out line after line to finally find it. Turned out I was declaring a tab (createTab) with an icon .png that didn&#39;t exist. Amazing that find that wasn&#39;t simpler. Maybe this will help someone.</p>

							<p>FYI Mobile Web is a little stricter than the other platforms when it comes to read only properties. On iOS, if you try to write to a read-only property (such as Ti.Platform.osname), it does nothing, but on Mobile Web it will throw this error.</p>
<p>With regards to debugging, the index.html file contains the Mobile Web SDK itself, but you should be able to see app.js as it was originally written. The debuggers often show index.html first, so you may need to use the debug tools to navigate to your code. I find that it&#39;s helpful to add a &quot;debugger&quot; statement to my code so that you can easily get to debugging your code without having to step through the SDK.</p>
<p>To diagnose this issue, I would recommend telling the debugger to break on all uncaught errors. Once this happens (right before the red screen is shown), it will halt inside the SDK. If you go up the call stack, you will eventually get to the offending code.</p>
