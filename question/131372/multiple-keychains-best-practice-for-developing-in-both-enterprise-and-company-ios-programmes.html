			<h1>Multiple keychains.  Best Practice for developing in both Enterprise and Company iOS programmes?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Does anyone have any advice on best practice for App Development when you are in both the Company Development Programme AND the Enterprise Programmes?</p>
<p>Up until now I have been using the Enterprise Program.  Everything works fine like this but now, for the first time, I want someone outside my organisation to test an app for me. We have joined the Company Development Program now which will allow us to do that.  </p>
<p>I hit problems when trying to build the app using my new Distribution Provisioning Profile.  Because you cannot have duplicate certificates in the keychain. My default keychain was the one called &quot;Login&quot;. I created a new one and I called this &quot;App Store&quot; and I think (well, I thought) I have the newly created certificates and keys all set up ok in that keychain (these were all created from scratch in the Provisioning Portal against the Company Development Programme account).  </p>
<p>However, when I make this new &quot;App Store&quot; keychain my default and then try to build my app in Studio I get the following error.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[<span class="hljs-keyword">ERROR</span>]

</code></pre><p>I&#39;m obviously doing something wrong - I guess it&#39;s to do with certificates and keys and my new &quot;App Store&quot; keychain.  But I don&#39;t know what - and I&#39;ve tried repeating the whole process and got the same error.</p>
<p>Is there some best practice for doing this i.e mixing Enterprise and non-Enterprise Programmes?</p>

							<p>I sorted this out.  Problem was caused by having certificates&#x2F;keys in two keychains but with the same company name.  All works fine now but what I had to do was:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Delete all keys&#x2F;certificates relating to my company in Login and System keychains.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create two new keychains.  One for Enterprise and one for App Store.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When I build I need to delete the unused Keychain and make the other one the default.  At the time I do this I just delete &quot;References&quot; when prompted.  This means its very easy to switch Keychains.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope that helps anyone with a similar problem.  I don&#39;t think there will be a problem at all for anyone who does not have the duplicate name issue I had.</p>
