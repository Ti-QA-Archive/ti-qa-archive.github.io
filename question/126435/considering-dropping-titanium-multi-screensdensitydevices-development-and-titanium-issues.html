			<h1>Considering dropping Titanium ....Multi screens/density/devices development and titanium issues</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am developing an application for android since a while. I used to develop native application… but this time I tried Titatium. Recently, I tried my application in another emulator. A HVGA, which is medium density. The application was a complete failure. The icons&#x2F;labels placements, label font size. I also tested on the iphone and everything was broken too.</p>
<p>How do you handle your application on multiple screen, devices and platforms? Am I missing something or we have to create different UI for all the different platforms? Do I have to do my own independant-pixel unit or something?</p>
<p>I see that titanium has good benefits for a lot of non-complex applications, but I see that that it has its limitations too, probably too often. Why there not much doc&#x2F;tutorial&#x2F;examples on the developer center? It seems to be tricky to get an answer everytime from the community since there is only that <em>bad</em> questions and answers system. Everytime I look for an issue I have… I see some kind of workaround.. but mentionning that it wont work on iphone or another device. How far titanium is a multiplatform framework? Where is the doc about JSS? When will we have a good compiler&#x2F;parser? So many times I have to delete the build directory and rebuild entirely the project, which take like 3-5 minutes. Would all those doc&#x2F;help issues be solved with the professsional support plan?</p>
<p>I really appreciate titanium and its current benefits. I hope I&#39;m not the only who see all those issues. Just want to see if I missing something…</p>
<p>Thanks for your answer.</p>

							<p>You should probably check out this post on handling screen density in Android with Titanium: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;06&#x2F;new-defaults-for-android-layouts-in-1-7.html">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;06&#x2F;new-defaults-for-android-layouts-in-1-7.html</a></p>
<p>Pay especially close attention to the use of density independent pixels with &#39;dp&#39;</p>

							<p>Sorry, I forgot to mention that.. it seems to be so tricky to create complex UI with the code system… not talking about all its limitations…. compared to what I can do using native xml android UI format.</p>

							<p>Thanks for your anwsers. It helps me a lot. The most important part is to determine before developing all devices&#x2F;screens&#x2F;etc. I guess. And there is no way to escape to adapt all UIs if we want a good and native application.  The &#39;dp&#39; works great using titanium 1.8dev. Sometimes, the dp unit just doesn&#39;t work though. ie. I haven&#39;t been able to use it in createTableViewRow(), which create a … obviously you know. It took me (again) precious time to find that bug since nothing was reported. The table view was just broken. FYI, to fix that bug, I created custom function to convert manually from dpi to pix and used it in that case.</p>

							<p>The screen issue is a common one in Android development.  It&#39;s not really the fault of Titanium, but moreso the lack of standardized hardware which runs the Android OS.  You can&#39;t even target a recent release of the OS if you expect to make it to a large number of devices, due to carriers disinterest in providing timely updates.  Hopefully, we&#39;ll see some improvements to this as the platform progresses.</p>
