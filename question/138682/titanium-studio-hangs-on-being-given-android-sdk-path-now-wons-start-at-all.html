			<h1>Titanium Studio Hangs on Being Given Android SDK Path, Now Won&#39;s Start At All</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I tried to give Titanium Studio on Windows 7 (64-bit) the path to the Android SDK, and it hanged. After that, subsequent launches fail. I tried uninstalling, redownloading and reinstalling Titanium Studio today 6&#x2F;22&#x2F;2012, and it still won&#39;t launch. I installed the Android SDK on 6&#x2F;13&#x2F;2012 so these installations are fairly fresh.</p>

							<div><p>and when I log off to kill them, log in again and relaunch, the process just sits there with an allocation of 104K. Again, I have to log off to kill it. The only way I&#39;ve been able to get it to launch again is to reinstall, which I&#39;ve done a dozen times now.</p>

							<div><p>I do still have a problem with TS finding the SDK. I downloaded it per http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;129786&#x2F;could-not-locate-a-titanium-desktop-sdk-at-the-given-path, but regardless of whether I set the path to the base of the downloaded directory, the sdk subdirectory, or the sdk\win32 subdirectory, it still complains. That thread should be updated with explicit instructions on how the path should be set.</p>
<p>If all of this is being caused by a path problem, is it possible to try some other options (configuration file or registry keys) so I son&#39;t have to keep uninst5alling, rebooting, and reinstalling?</p>

							<div><p>Ok, I fixed the SDK path issue. I hadn&#39;t realized the download <em>added</em> to what was already there. It made no difference with the hanging on setting the Android SDK directory. I know there&#39;s nothing wrong with my Android SDK because I can use this same installation to build Android projects with Eclipse.</p>
