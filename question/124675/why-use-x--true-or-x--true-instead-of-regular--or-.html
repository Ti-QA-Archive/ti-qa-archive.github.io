			<p>Title is my question, just wondering about a while back before summer. </p>
<p>Now i got back into tita using the TiDev community and what i see is that the code editor there gives an explanation mark if i use the == operator and should use === instead</p>
<p>But this is not always the case as with the following line:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// This must be ===</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(e.<span class="hljs-keyword">index</span> === <span class="hljs-number">0</span>){ recentWebView.html = recentUpdatesHtml; }
<span class="hljs-comment">// This can be == and doesnt give me the explanation mark for an extra =</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(e.<span class="hljs-keyword">index</span> == <span class="hljs-number">1</span>){ recentWebView.html = recentSocialHtml; }
</code></pre><p>So could someone explain me what is the difference and why i should use === instead of == , ?</p>

							<p>Hi Kami.</p>
<p>First comparison is strict (===) and second one is type-converting comparison. The difference is that the first one checks if operands are of the same type, beside their value, and the second one does type converting if operands are not of the same type and then compare their value. The algorithm how are they compared and type-converted is described in ECMA-specification (JavaScript is implementation of that standard).</p>
<p>Now … you can use both operators and they are valid to use in any case. Sometimes it&#39;s better to use &quot;==&quot;, sometimes it&#39;s better to use &quot;===&quot;. Algorithmically, they are very similar and performance difference between them is negligible.</p>

										<p><p>Allright thank you for that, can understand why they want to have an === in javascript since you can compare an string with any other type.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, exactly. Sometimes you don&#39;t care if operands have same type (because JS is loosely typed language), sometimes you want to check if operands have same type and same value (as you can see in example below, &quot;undefined == 0&quot; is &quot;true&quot;, which you don&#39;t want to get in cases where you want to get some index). You just need to have in mind what are you comparing to and how different types casts to each other.</p>

<p>Basically === is more strict than ==. </p>
<p>If you were to use <code>if(e.index == 0)</code>, then in the case that e.index actually has the value <code>&amp;#39;&amp;#39;</code> or false, that comparison would evaluate to true. using === ensures that it would only be true of e.index was 0 specifically.</p>
<p>This is used with 0 in particular because it&#39;s the only number that evaluates to false in boolean operations in javascript.</p>
