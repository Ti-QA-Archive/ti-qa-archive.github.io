			<p>The licence agreement for the new Titanium Studio 1.0 includes the following:</p>
<p>&gt; <em>2. TIME-SENSITIVE SOFTWARE. The software will stop running on June 1, 2011. You may not receive any other notice. You will not be able to use the software when it stops running. Your license granted under this Agreement will terminate upon this date.</em></p>
<p>This deadline is less than two weeks away, but the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;05&#x2F;major-titanium-updates.html">developer blog</a> says that Titanium Studio will have the status of &quot;<em>General Availability</em>&quot; in &quot;<em>Early June</em>&quot; but will apparently be split into &quot;<em>Standard</em>&quot; and &quot;<em>Premium</em>&quot; versions.</p>
<p>Does this mean that between 1 June 2011 and &quot;<em>Early June</em>&quot; I am not going to be able to access Titanium Studio or continue to develop my apps?</p>
<p>What exactly is going to happen to my current installation of Titanium Studio and my apps-in-progress on 1 June 2011?</p>
<p>Can you please confirm that if I use Titanium Studio to work on my apps now I am not going to have to suddenly pay a fee at some stage in order to finish them or any part of them?</p>
<p>We can trust you, Appcelerator… right?</p>

							<p>Not to worry we are not going to lock you out of studio or your apps. Worst case would be you have to download a small update as a bridge between the first and the official release.</p>
<p>Developers are the life blood of our company and we would never lock you out from your projects! :)</p>

							<p>Hi there, </p>
<p>I always found strange that Titanium Studio doesn&#39;t work offline and after reading your post, I became a little worried, so I did a little research.</p>
<p>I found this <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;05&#x2F;major-titanium-updates.html">post</a> on the developer&#39;s blog and I think I know what is going to happen.</p>
<p>If you open the page and scroll all the way down to the title <strong>Titanium Studio</strong>, you can read all about the new changes to Titanium Studio.</p>
<p>For summarize, Titanium Studio is going to be divided in two: the <strong>standard</strong> version, which is going to be available to everyone and the <strong>premium</strong> version which is going to be available to developers with paid subscriptions. </p>
<p>I think that&#39;s why we need to login every time we want to use Titanium Studio. Because some features, like debugging, who are available to everyone today, are going to be exclusive for developers with paid plans, so the login is going to be a mechanism to filter developers with access to those features from the others (maybe!). But it really sucks having to login every time we want to use Titanium Studio.</p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>
<p>Cumps</p>

							<p>As a developer bit worried. but the Titanium team has to make some money out of this nice software instead of giving it free.<br>Also i think developers community is more active than the titanium paid service. </p>

							<p>I certainly hope that Titanium Studio will work offline. I like to code on trains and planes, where connectivity is often non-existent. </p>
<p>I&#39;m still using Ti Developer and hope to be able to use it for some time. </p>
<p>I&#39;m not a big fan of the Studio IDE so far. (Which I&#39;ve set up on a separate laptop to my main development laptop) </p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot of things with the editor that I don&#39;t like, which I&#39;m used to in other text editors. The code completion doesn&#39;t seem to always work. There seems to be a lot of overkill features. There are little niggling things too - like the folder icons in the side navigator being &#39;open&#39;, when the folder isn&#39;t open. </p>
<p>I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s not a very clever and useful product - it is (I used&#x2F;tried Aptana for a bit, back when I started trying AIR and Nokia&#39;s WRT) but I actually like the simplicity of Titanium Developer. </p>
<p>I seriously hope that we won&#39;t be &#39;forced&#39; to use Studio (though, obviously support of Ti Dev will vanish at some point) to build and test apps. I guess that since we have command line methods to build and test stuff, there will always be a way.  Recent updates and goings on with the very latest builds and KS demos have hinted that things won&#39;t work in Titanium Developer for much longer. </p>
<p>This comment&#x2F;response isn&#39;t to grow any &#39;FUD&#39; at all, it&#39;s just my thoughts on these recent developments. I&#39;m a huge and active supporter and admirer of the Appcelerator team, solutions, products and vision.  The new product announcements the other day were incredible. </p>
<p>Code strong, as they say! ;)</p>
