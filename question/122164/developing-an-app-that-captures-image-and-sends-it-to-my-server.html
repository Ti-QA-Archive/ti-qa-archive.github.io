			<h1>Developing an app that captures image and sends it to my server</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;d like to develop a Titanium application that guides a user through taking a photo and sending the image to my server, along with location and date information. The <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;oilreporter.org&#x2F;">Oil Reporter</a> application, which was developed using Titanium, essentially does the same thing.</p>
<p>So, does Titanium give me easy access to the OS API&#39;s needed to capture and then send the image with the metadata? I found some threads on this forum that suggest that transferring images from the phone device to a remote server is not a very straightforward process.</p>
<p>——- Rick</p>

							<p>I am currently in the finishing stages of an app that does exactly this - Except with 4 images instead of 1. You have the option of adding 1 - 4 images, as well as information about these images and some other information regarding the content of the app, and then in the end you can send these images via Email and&#x2F;or to a remote MySQL Database and remote server, which is hosted by my company.</p>
<p>It is essentially done through HTTPClients and a PHP script on my server. Depending on how many images there are it loops through the HTTPClient and sends the image to the server, which uses the PHP image functions to check the size of the image and then uploads it to a folder on the server.</p>
<p>If you are looking to see some code, send me an Email at coltonarabsky@me.com and I can show you some code that I hope you would find useful.</p>

							<p>The short answer is yes, you should be able to do this without much issue. Check out the Kitchen Sink demo for most of this functionality.</p>

							<p>Colton….</p>
<p>curious if you are having 100% success with the Android Camera&#39;s On Success event?  We&#39;ve tested using 1.6.2 and 1.7x on an original Droid running Android 2.2.2 and the success event triggers randomly for us.  We&#39;re using the basic kitchen sink example.</p>

										<p><p>Right now my app is only available on iOS, but starting yesterday we began converting the code to work with Android as well. As soon as I convert the image system to work with Android I will be in contact with you.</p>
