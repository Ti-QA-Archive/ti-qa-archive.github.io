			<h1>Project title for iPhone and iPad</h1>

		<section>
			<p>I am making an app for iphone and ipad. Lets say I have named it &quot;My App&quot; for iphone. When I go to make it for the iPad, I want the name to also be &quot;My App&quot;. The problem is when I make a new iPad project, it will obviously complain about that project already existing. So if I title it &quot;My App iPad&quot; is that going to be the actual name that ipad users see?</p>

							<p>Pulling this out because we&#39;re getting lost in the last comment. When you want to launch for iPad, you should be able to choose Run &gt; iPad Simulator, this will automatically choose the iPad Sim for you.</p>

										<p><p>This might be some of your issue. We actually no longer support Ti Developer. If you use Ti Studio, this is all separated out and handled for you. You can choose to run or deploy for iPad or iPhone or Android.</p>

										<p><p>Everything is just the same. File &gt; Import &gt; Existing Titanium Project will get your project into studio. Please do a Project &gt; Clean before attempting to launch your app. Then choose the Run icon from the app explorer and you&#39;ll see all the simulators you can launch. If iPad is not available, edit your tiapp.xml file and flip the iPad boolean.</p>

							<p>Umm, the whole idea is that you don&#39;t have to build a second app to deploy for iPhone and iPad … you use the same app for deployment on both … then they both have the same name and you don&#39;t have to worry about it.</p>

										<p><p>The app will be the same with the exception of some layout changes. So rather than having the code separate I have to have a bunch of if iphone else its ipad?</p>

										<p><p>You can separate the code rather easily by using the platform specific folders within your project among other way … all this is explained in the docs on the wiki. One of the core ideas behind Titanium is that you dont have to create a new app for every platform or every device.</p>

										<p><p>Anthony as far as I am aware there is no way to have specific iPad files. There is only the &quot;iphone&quot; and &quot;android&quot; folders. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;The+Application+Project+Structure#TheApplicationProjectStructure-PlatformspecificResources">This</a> page seems to agree with me and Ronnie.</p>

										<p><p>The only way to launch the iPad &quot;version&quot; is to launch the iphone emulator and then in the emulator software, under Device-&gt; choose iPad, which at that point renders the debug panel useless because it closes. Also, even when launching iPad via the method I mentioned above, you get the little &quot;2x&quot; at the bottom so it already knows its an app made for iphone, not ipad.</p>

							<p>You have to create yourself the folders.</p>
<p>In app.js, do something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(plateform == <span class="hljs-symbol">'iphone'</span>){
    <span class="hljs-keyword">include</span>(<span class="hljs-symbol">'iphone</span>/app.js');

										<p><p>That is what I thought. One thing to note is if you start out with a mobile app, the only way to launch it for ipad is to launch it in the iphone emulator and then in the emulator software, under Device-&gt; choose iPad, which at that point renders the debug panel useless. That would be a bug in my opinion. Also if this is the correct way of doing it, why when making a new project is iPad on its own line? Doesn&#39;t make sense</p>

										<p><p>This really only happens the first time. If you launch the Sim, then change to iPad, then quit, the next launch will launch the iPad … it just remembers. iPad is on its own line because it is its own device and can be run an such. If you have a 2x at the bottom of your ipad app, it means that you are running an iphone app on the ipad, not an ipad app.</p>

										<p><p>I launch my app, switch to ipad, exit, relaunch and it still goes to iphone. If I am supposed to have one project for all devices and I make a mobile app, why is it not recognizing that when I launch it on ipad, it should be an ipad app and not an iphone app?</p>
