			<h1>iOS Development Certificate is NOT found (Ti 3.0 Studio, SDK 3.0.0.GA)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>When I use Titanium SDK 3.0.0.GA and want to run the app on an iOS device the Provisioning Profile is found but the Development Certificate is NOT found. So no compilation possible.<br>When I change to the Titanium SDK 2.1.4.GA in the tiapp.xml everything works fine.<br>All certificates are found. Same problem with all apps.<br>What is the problem here with the SDK 3.0..GA? How can I solve that?</p>

							<p>To confirm that Titanium can see your developer certs, run <code>titanium info -t ios</code>. If the Titanium CLI can&#39;t find them, then there are some bigger issues going on. If the CLI can see them, then it must be a Studio issue.</p>

										<p><p>Well, that&#39;s not good. When you say certs, you mean provisioning profiles?</p>
<p>When you run <code>titanium info -t ios</code>, Titanium is scanning the output of <code>security dump-keychain</code> and we search for all certs named &quot;iPhone Developer&quot;, &quot;iPhone Distribution&quot;, and &quot;Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certification Authority&quot;. Manually scan the output of that command and see what it says.</p>

										<p><p>Yes. A lot of provisioning profiles are found by <code>titanium info -t ios</code> - but not the 3 iOS Certificates.<br>When I run  <code>security dump-keychain</code> and manually scan for the cert names you told me I find them. As I initially wrote the problems only occur when using SDK 3.0.0.GA. Older ones still (2.1.4.GA) work and find the certs.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going on here. What version of Mac OS X are you running? Is it possible your version of <code>security dump-keychain</code> is not output in the same case as newer Mac OS X versions? For example, I&#39;m matching &quot;iPhone Developer&quot; exactly and if your says &quot;iphone developer&quot; it won&#39;t work.</p>

										<p><p>I am running Mac OS X 10.8.2 with all updates. Also the latest Xcode - Version 4.5.2 (4G2008a). No hacks, no modifications.<br>I checked the output of <code>security dump-keychain</code> exactly incl. case. Matches exactly (eg  iPhone Developer).</p>

							<p>Oh, I have idea as to what is going on. When we run the <em>security</em> command, if the output is larger than 1024 x 1024 (1,048,576), it essentially does nothing. Try this at the command line:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-constant">TMP</span>=<span class="hljs-string">`security dump-keychain`</span>; echo <span class="hljs-variable">${</span><span class="hljs-comment">#TMP}</span>
</code></pre><p>If the number if outputs is greater than 1,048,576, then we found our problem.</p>
<p>FWIW, my keychain dump is about 175,498 bytes, so when I coded it, I figured at least 5x bigger buffer should pretty much do the job.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m having the same issue  and was getting 1,210,817 - So I went in to keychain access and deleted a bunch of old keychain items (I had a whole keychain for 1Password which I haven&#39;t even used in years) which got the number down to 636,329 and titanium seems to be able to find the certificates now.</p>

										<p><p>I have only around 1.400 elements in 4 keychains. I am trying around resorting them in different keychains. <strong>No success</strong>. Is it possible that the system has a problem with multiple keychains or multiple entires on the keywords like &quot;iPhone Developer&quot;?</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s just a buffer size issue. We have the fix coded up, but we need to test and merge it in for the 3.0.1 release.</p>

							<p>I have Studio 3.0.1 and I&#39;m still getting this error.  I switched down to the 2.1.4 SDK, and the build worked as intended. Is this a Studio problem, or an SDK problem? Do I need Studio 3.0.1, or SDK 3.0.1?</p>
