			<h1>Initalizing Node.ACS (30%) - STUCK</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I hadn&#39;t used Titanium for a few months because I&#39;ve been on other projects. Today I fired it up on my Mac 10.7.5 and was unable to run my project. It threw an error about CLI something not found. I can&#39;t tell you exactly because it&#39;s not happening anymore. After that error I updated to all latest stuff, and it froze up in the middle of installation for a long time. So I called it and started again. Hung up again. So I completely reinstalled Titanium (TWICE), and it&#39;s completely jacked up. The two symptoms are:</p>
<p>1- Down in status bar it continuously says &quot;Initializing Node.ACS (30%).&quot; It has said this for hours. I have reinstalled twice and rebooted several times. When I try to run my TI project, it spits a bunch of errors into the command shell:</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if this is relevant, but something got jacked up in my Keychain Access, but I think I have that all reset and sorted out. Even after fixing that, Ti used to always remember my account credentials and now it never does. Is this all related?</p>
<p>I don&#39;t see how all these problems can be persisting across total, fresh reinstallations, this is making me crazy. I have read numerous posts about this Node.ACS problem, but I keep getting stuck. 1 post said to &quot;uninstall Node&quot;, but they don&#39;t say how to do that. So I tried uninstalling all of Ti. I&#39;m happy to try anything, just please explain how. I&#39;m not a mac guy at all, sorry. Please help.</p>

							<p>I have partially figured this out and I&#39;m back in business. I want to post what I learned in case it helps someone else. 1st regarding the CLI errors. I believe (though I didn&#39;t take the time to prove) that my provisioning profile was blowing up TI or CLI because there are spaces in the name. Spaces in the name should be fine because Apple allows it (in the online dev center, in Keychain, and in Xcode). I learned that in the latest version of the SDK, spaces are allowed. But my TI settings were pointing at an older SDK: 3.0.2 GA. Once I pointed at the newest SDK (3.1.1 GA) the errors went away.</p>
<p>Next, regarding the annoying error &quot;Initalizing Node.ACS (30%)&quot;, this never did go away, but it also didn&#39;t cause any problems. I&#39;m able to run and build, no problems. I am certain this is a bug in TI because it has been seen by many others, as evidenced in other posts and bug reports I have seen. Appcelerator: PLEASE fix that in the next release. Thanks.</p>
