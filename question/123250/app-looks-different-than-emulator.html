			<h1>App looks different than Emulator...</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have been developing an app that looks how I want it to on the Android 2.2 Emulator. I recently ran the app on my device which has Android 2.2 as the OS and the app looks SOO much smaller. Even the icons at the top are tiny… Is there anything I can do to make it the same size as what the emulator shows? It looks just awful as a real app.</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>Couple of things.</p>
<p>-the screen on your device may have a high density screen.  There was a <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;06&#x2F;new-defaults-for-android-layouts-in-1-7.html">change in 1.7.0</a> that removed a previous setting that auto-adjusted the size of fonts and layouts based upon screen density.  You can add that back in with this line in your tiapp.xml</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">manifest</span>&gt;</span>
   <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">supports-screens</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">android:anyDensity</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"false"</span>/&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">manifest</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>-you can adjust the &quot;skin&quot; attached to the emulator your are testing under to change the resolution.  This does a fairly good job of representing the general view you will have on a particular screen size.  This is not always perfect.  Large, high density screen of the DroidX and DroidX2 gave us fits.  Downloading the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.motorola.com&#x2F;docstools&#x2F;tools&#x2F;">development add ons from Motorola</a> and testing in them allowed us a better understanding of layout on those devices before throwing the apps on actual devices.</p>

										<p><p>Should also say, that on the other side of the device line, having add ons for the micro-droids from motorola has been a help as well.</p>

							<p>Again thanks for the answer! That is a big help. To anyone who has this same issue… You can place the &lt;manifest&gt; node fix stated above in the &lt;android&gt; area of the tiapp.xml, save and re-run config to get it to work. That&#39;s what did it for me!</p>
