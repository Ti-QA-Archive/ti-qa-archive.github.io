							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Firstly be aware that most Android apps are now automatically updated by the Android OS automatically and usually within a week most of the users of the previous version will be on the new version.  You can check this out in the Android developer console and watch as the first and second versions swap over installation numbers in the next few days.</p>
<p>There are two ways I use to achieve what you are trying to do, neither of which you can do now as you need to plan ahead for these to work.  You can however make the changes in your app and future users will get these changes.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Push Notifications</strong><br>If you use push notifications, add a <strong>tag</strong> with the version number included in addition to whatever data values you use.  Then when you have a new version you simply send out a push notification to the tag you added for the previous versions.  So if you have a &quot;v1&quot; and then a &quot;v2&quot; - you send a push notification to &quot;v1&quot; saying there is a new version.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Update Poll checking</strong><br>Have a web service API that you call from your app periodically that returns the current public version of the app, if the returned value is greater than the one on the current app - tell the user there is a new app.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these techniques are simple, but both require work.  It may turn out that the automatic updates that occur by Android itself are sufficient.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that NONE of these solutions will force an update as soon as you publish one, there is always going to be some that take a while and some that never update.</p>

										<p><p>That is the problem, you cannot read the current version from the Google Play Store there is no currently exposed API to get this information.</p>
<p>This is why I provided the wording in my answer and the comment at the bottom - that auto updating makes this mostly irrelevant.</p>

							<p>You can use push notifications if the updates do not contain any changes in database.<br>Or else you can use web service.<br>You can hit the web server every time user opens up app and check if new data is available.</p>

										<p><p>Did you not read the other answer that already gave those exact answers in really easy to read bullet points and lots of detail?</p>
<p>I am happy you are willing to give assistance but can you try adding something rather than copying something already suggested 3 days ago?</p>
