			<h1>Android Video rotation issue</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m playing streamed videos using the Ti VideoPlayer in an Android app where its only window is set to [Titanium.UI.PORTRAIT]. When the video starts to play it does so in portrait mode and one has to physically rotate the device to shift to landscape, however in doing so the video stops, sometimes reloads (can take two minutes to do so) and continues playing  - but sometimes throws an error and crashes.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried forcing the window to landscape just before creating the videoPlayer using Ti.Android.currentActivity.setRequestedOrientation(Ti.Android.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE) and that works, but the device will still not stay in landscape as on rotation it shifts back to portrait and exhibits the behaviour as described above. The error message in the log at this point is E&#x2F;ARTSPConnection(176): Server unexpectedly closed the connection.</p>
<p>I also tried using the &#39;orientationchange&#39; event to catch when a rotation was taking place during a video play to force it back to landscape, but the server still seems to want to close the connection.</p>
<p>What is the trick here? Ideally I want to change to landscape on starting a video and return to portrait only on its exit it with no pauses or crashes. Too much for Android?</p>
<p>Mobile &#x2F;Titanium SDK version 3.1.3.GA&#x2F; Android&#x2F; Nexus 7&#x2F; Mac OSX</p>

										<p><p>Thank you Rainer - this is very close to the code I am using, but for using using a new window, which it seems on Android you don&#39;t need. The videoPlayer opens it&#39;s own window in the background (apparently) and punches a hole through the main window to reveal the video.</p>
<p>It did try the video.widget.js but found that on my Nexus 7 the stream continues to stop and restart when the orientation changes. Interestingly this does not happen on a cheap Chinese tablet I also test on. So maybe this issue is device specific.</p>
