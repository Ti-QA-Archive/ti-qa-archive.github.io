			<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I am ahead of implementing In-App purchases in my app. The only documentation I&#39;ve found so far is http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;StoreKit+Module+In-App+Purchase+Testing. I&#39;ve done every single step 10 times already in this guide, but it does not work for me. It keeps me saying that my products are invalid.</p>
<p>Is there anyobody who implemented In-App purchases working with Titanium?</p>

							<p>For some reasons, I had to switch to Titanium SDK 1.7.3. I have downloaded the new TiStoreKit 1.2 from the Titanium Marketplace. It seems it is now free, and does not need the indie (or higher level) account anymore. But it does not work. The error is the following:</p>
<p>&quot;Invalid type passed to function. expected: TiBlob, was: NSDictionary  in -[TiStorekitModule verifyReceipt:] (TiStoreKitModule.m:103)&quot;</p>
<p>Can anybody help me?</p>

										<p><p>Ah, the problem was, that the parameters of the <code>Ti.Storekit.verifyReceipt</code> function have changed. See the example for further details.</p>
<p>Now TiStorekit 1.2 (Marketplace version) with Titanium SDK 1.7.3 and iOS 5 works for me.</p>

							<p>Ok, a little bit comical, but I am who implemented an In-App purchase :D</p>
<p>The guide mentioned above is fine, the key thing why it has not been working is: my phone was jailbroken. The In-App purchase testing DOES NOT WORK with jailbroken deivces (at least with iPhone 4&#x2F;4.3.3&#x2F;redsn0w).</p>

							<p>So sarcastic Kristof, well I&#39;m planning to upgrade to Indie monthly subscription, but I hope your documents and guides are sufficient for the in-app purchase TiStoreKit. My senario is simple I have 5 products, each one of them has a different Tier price, and hence I&#39;d have 5 different functions for each product upon successful purchase. So, does your Guide cover this part for multiple product purchase listener (if I can call it listener)?<br>I hope you reply with yes, so that I can immediately start my indie membership!</p>

										<p><p>The only way In-App purchases are working for me is to build the project with Titanium 1.6.3 (1.6.2 maybe also works, I don&#39;t know, but 1.7+ doesn&#39;t). Beside that, the guide is very clear and the sample code is working.</p>

							<p>Kristof,<br>My app has an auto renew subscription feature, but while looking at the itunesconnect I found that there is something you need to add in the application called &quot;Generate Shared Secret&quot; which is used only for auto-renew products! does your documentation cover this part of how to include that shared secret for auto-renewable products? Please advice before I subscribe to your indie membership. thank you.</p>

										<p><p>Hello, I&#39;m using in app purchase also for auto renewable subscriptions with 4 different ids (Auto renewable Subscription Periods) and different prices but, Storekit seems to recognize only the first product id on itunes connect witch is a 7 days subscription. If I change for the other ids (periods) StoreKit can&#39;t recognize and don&#39;t return any price. Any suggestion???</p>

							<p>Kristof, since yesterday I was trying to subscribe to the indie plan, my application has nothing left but the TiStoreKit to begin uploading it to the app store! I tried to contact support@appcelerator.com and sales@appcelerator.com and info@appcelerator.com with no response ! don&#39;t they want to make money from subscribers ! you people are strange! the funny part that they deducted 1 dollar twice (2 dollars in total) but without subscribing me or even mailing me! Absolutely no response at all! Now I&#39;m stuck in the middle of the road, I cannot upload my app to the app store, and I cannot get in touch with anybody here to enable me do the in-app purchase feature inside my app! Please talk to someone about it! or I&#39;ll be forced to move to something like Nimblekit that has only one time payment of 99 dollars and you get everything including the in-app purchase and it is also javascript!<br>Looking forward to your help Kristof.</p>

							<p>Hi Kris, I followed the instructions required to install the tistorekit, but my titanium developer 1.2.2 seems not able to detect it! is there a difference between titanium developer 1.2.2 and titanium studio in this issue ? do I really need to install titanium studio in order to have it recognize the module; knowing that I have the latest version of tistorekit 1.2 and not the previous 1.1 and I edited the tiapp.xml file and added the following:<br>&lt;modules&gt;<br>    &lt;module version=&quot;1.2&quot;&gt;ti.storekit&lt;&#x2F;module&gt;<br>&lt;&#x2F;modules&gt;<br>and ofcourse I unziped the ti.storekit directory in the following path:<br>&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;modules&#x2F;iphone<br>did any one experience this with the new version of ti.storekit 1.2 ? can any body help ?</p>

							<p>RESOLVED! I resolved the issue and discovered my mistake that I was unziping the tistorekit into the same path but not from the root directory (MAC HD), instead I was pasting inside the path of the library from the user directory. it has nothing to do with titanium studio nor developer.</p>

							<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Since the introduction of Titanium Marketplace, there is no need to pay for Indie dev program to be able to use Ti.StoreKit. Just download it from the Marketplace for free!</p>
