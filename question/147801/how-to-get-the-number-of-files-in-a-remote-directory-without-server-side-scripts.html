			<h1>How to get the number of files in a remote directory (without server-side scripts)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I&#39;m wondering if anyone knows whether it&#39;s possible to retrieve and store<br>all the URLs of the files in a remote directory (i.e. not on device) in an array, or otherwise how to get the number of files in that directory. The thing is that I have a gallery in which i use imageViews with remote URLs (saved in a folder on my server as 0.jpg, 1.jpg etc),<br>but I need to get the number of images (which of course may vary over time)<br>of the directory to be able to set the condition of the for loop (e.g. &quot;i&lt;numberOfFiles.length&quot;). </p>
<p>I know how to solve this by using either json and&#x2F;or a php script, but I won&#39;t be hosting the image content on my own server when the app is done, so a non-script solution would be preferable! </p>
<p>Thanks for your help guys!</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The short answer is no.</p>
<p>The only way to get information about a remote file system is to have code on the remote system you can query. </p>
<p>There is another way if you really cannot run code on the server.  It is not the best solution and it is inelegant but it will work.  This does depend on the files being either consecutive or at least being predictable.</p>
<p>Using hhtpClient you can try to download a file and determine if you get a 404 status code.  By using some simple routine you can determine when the files stop.  Ideally you would keep the last number in memory and then the next time skip a few ahead and check again, if not 404 skip again until it is.</p>
<p>As I say - this is not recommended and should be  a last resort only.</p>

							<p>Thanks for your quick answer, Malcolm!</p>
<p>I kind of figured this would be a long shot, but I still thought I&#39;d give it a try :)</p>
<p>A PHP DirectoryIterator it is, then!</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>Quick tip for next time; always try and comment on an answer rather than creating a new answer. It really helps keep threads together on busy questions and especially in the future when others review (you are not being told off)</p>
