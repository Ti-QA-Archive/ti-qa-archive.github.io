							<div><p>Doing some checking, it looks like the required functionality comes from UIPrintInteractionController , which I don&#39;t even see a mention of in the Ti code, so it seems this is a no :(</p>
<p>I&#39;m amazed there aren&#39;t any developers working on custom Ti modules to add functionality like this.. I&#39;m sure there&#39;d be some market demand for it (heck, who wouldn&#39;t pay a few hundred bucks for a module that does something you need)</p>

							<div><p>I was also trying to get this functionality into my latest ipad project. But since it&#39;s not available through Titanium yet, I&#39;ve wrote my own custom printing module. The goal was to print a custom designed pdf, and to get that working on the ipad, i wrote a small printing server which runs on the computer connected to a(ny) printer. iPad sends json data to it and voilá, I don&#39;t need an AirPrint capable printer anymore.</p>

<p>Can you provide more information on your custom printing module?  I think lots of folks would benefit from this.  Thanks.</p>

							<p>you can try using airPrint sharing software like the ones listed here http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;yYzgv5  this will enable your mac tobe &quot;the airprinter&quot; itself hooking into it&#39;s others as shared ones. However, i find that the appcelerator airPrint module is not working despite you can print anything else like photos, notes, email and etc.</p>
