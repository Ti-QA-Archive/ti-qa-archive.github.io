							<div><p>I am a moderator as I mentioned below.  Your quality of question was and is in question as mentioned in detail here.  The question has been asked and answered. By your own admission your questions are short in nature and give little to no proof of any attempts to resolve the issue yourself.  The answer was perfectly suited to this question, pointing out your shortcoming (by the way not just me who is frustrated with these) and explaining what you had to do.</p>
<p>If you want help, provide the minimum level of requirements to increase the chances of a reasonable answer.  Keep in mind people offering assistance do so in their own time for no money, so when a question appears to have little effort given to it and follow up comments are plain rude it does not help you get new answers.</p>

										<p><p>What&#39;s the matter with you? Can&#39;t you see that&#39;s exactly why I&#39;m asking? Don&#39;t you see many apps have such ability where users can just dismiss the formsheet by tapping outside of it. It seems possible with native coding: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;2623417&#x2F;iphone-sdk-dismissing-modal-viewcontrollers-on-ipad-by-clicking-outside-of-it">here</a>. That&#39;s why I&#39;m curious if Titanium can achieve the same.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve searched the forum and the internet. No answer on this, okay?</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t know how, you don&#39;t have to answer. If you are sure it&#39;s impossible, simply say so. Why make offensive false assumption like that. It&#39;s useless.</p>

										<p><p>@Shawn; I am moderating this question.</p>
<p>Nick answered your question by directing you to the documentation.  His tone is justified given your history of asking questions without any clear indication that you tested any code or referred to the documentation in any way.</p>
<p>I can understand this, as I have noted this is a common theme of your questions and I have picked you up on it before.  Easy to remember as your aggressive rebuttals and decision to blame the other party for your own laziness is a common theme.</p>
<p>So back to the point;</p>
<ul>
<li>The documentation does explain this point clearly - as noted in the answer</li>
<li>A simple test of the example code found in the documentation would provide you with the answer</li>
<li>Having just performed a simple google search myself &quot;ios form sheet dismiss&quot; provides the answer from several locations</li>
</ul>
<p>So in order to assist anyone else who reads this post later this is the reason (iOS focused);</p>
<ul>
<li>A window does not provide any automatic dismiss ability</li>
<li>A navigation controller &#39;Back&#39; buttons are navigation based and not considered a self dismiss</li>
<li>Modal dialog&#39;s are designed to mask anything below - even if a portion can be seen, no events bubble</li>
<li>Pop-over&#39;s, alert dialogs, options dialogs are examples of things that do offer dismiss opportunities outside the visual portion of the view itself</li>
<li>Research of stock Apple apps will confirm this; mail app in landscape new mail dialog is a form sheet - this cannot be dismissed without use of elements specifically provided by the app developer - buttons for example</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>@Malcolm. You kept misunderstanding me. It&#39;s like if I don&#39;t ask the question the way you want, then you don&#39;t get it. This is not the first time. You missed key information yourself, but blamed the other party for it.  Example <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;175363&#x2F;listview---search---no-results">here</a> and <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;175416&#x2F;ios---repeated-view">here</a>. See how you missed the &quot;titles?&quot; Last time you picked me up I&#39;ve already let you know why you were wrong. Please remember you accepted it. But… same thing happened again.</p>
<p>I apologize if I sounds rude in my last response. I don&#39;t mean to be rude to anyone. It&#39;s just I want to defend myself when someone says something not true about me. It&#39;s not me who initiated this.</p>
<p>Please pay some respect to the others when they don&#39;t ask the question the way you want. It doesn&#39;t mean they are lazy. You shouldn&#39;t blame someone when you don&#39;t really know about the truth.</p>
<p>I fire quick questions. I know. I&#39;m busy, not lazy. I provided minimum information that was just enough for people to answer the question. So quick answers are totally fine to me. If you don&#39;t like my questions, you don&#39;t have to answer. I&#39;m not forcing you, and I don&#39;t blame you for not to. I won&#39;t say something like &quot;You are lazy. Why don&#39;t you answer my question when there is enough information?&quot;</p>
<p>Back to the point and why I still asked this question:</p>
<p>I know according to TiDocs the modal form sheet can&#39;t be dismissed by tapping outside. But there seems a workaround if you code in Objective-C. See <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;2623417&#x2F;iphone-sdk-dismissing-modal-viewcontrollers-on-ipad-by-clicking-outside-of-it">here</a> and <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;4946767&#x2F;how-to-dismiss-a-modal-view-controller-presented-as-form-sheet-when-a-touch-oc">here</a>. But I can&#39;t find a workaround for Titanium over the internet. (This is what I meant in my last response; don&#39;t misunderstand me again).</p>
<p>Your example, Mail App, that&#39;s a page sheet, not form sheet. With page sheet it makes sense not having this ability. With form sheet it seems intuitive to have it. An example is the App Store.</p>
