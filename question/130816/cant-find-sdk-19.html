			<h1>Can&#39;t find SDK 1.9</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I got an email from the automated bug tracking system that an issue I was tracking was fixed in 1.9 however I can&#39;t find 1.9 anywhere. On the continuous build site I see there is an update to 1.8 as recently as today. DDL up top has 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, etc. but nothing for 1.9. What am I doing wrong?</p>

										<p><p>Thanks…was looking for a 1.9.x in the DDL. Just so I know for the future what is the significance of &quot;master&quot; over a 1.X.X build? Thanks again!</p>

										<p><p>A master would include new development concepts + approved bug fixes sent up from the released branches.</p>
<p>1_8_X had a release. Under it, you will find a path of updates, minor releases to solve bugs. It should not have any new functionality in it, just bug squashing. If approved, these are passed up to the MASTER. At some point in time, 1.9.X will emerge as its own branch, feature frozen.</p>
<p>Thats a rough idea of how its supposed to work.</p>
