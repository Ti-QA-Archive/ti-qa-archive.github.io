			<h1>Facebook authorize doesn&#39;t detect if user has revoked permission</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m pretty new to the game, but as far as I can tell Ti.Facebook.authorize doesn&#39;t go back to facebook to check every time it is called. </p>
<p>So if I request &quot;publish_stream&quot; permission and authorize, in the app I log in and get authorization. However, if I then go to facebook and remove the permission (from my app privacy settings), I can no longer publish to my feed. That&#39;s fine and I can detect that from the error message I get back. But at that stage I want to re-request authorization, as this is an essential feature of the app. </p>
<p>Ti.Facebook.permissions still shows &quot;publish_stream&quot;. Ti.Facebook.authorize() doesn&#39;t seem to do anything. The only way I can do it is to log the user out and then have them log back in to re-authorize. Is this the only way to do it?</p>
<p>Thanks!<br>Bill</p>

										<p><p>I think you need to go down the logout&#x2F;re-authorise route.  If someone removes an App permission through Facebook online then they would also expect that the app would no longer work - IMHO</p>

										<p><p>Hmmmm… maybe you could help me with this too:<br>By default the permissions that I wish to authorize are optional. The user on the phone can uncheck them and still login. Is there any way to prevent this, or at least detect that they have done so?</p>

										<p><p>Not really. Other than that you can make another call to the facebook graph to find out what permissions are granted and then decide how to handle it.</p>
