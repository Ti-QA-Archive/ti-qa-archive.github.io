			<h1>App not working because of connection to api.appcelerator.net</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, my app is created with Titanium Mobile SDK 2.1.0.GA.<br>It is a very simple app which connects to our server when it launches. But it works three times out of ten which is driving me crazy. </p>
<p>Finally I found out that the app try to connect api.appcelerator.net every time it launches but the analytics setting in tiapp.xml has been <strong>TURN OFF</strong>. </p>
<p>Why is appcelerator still collecting data from my app? Actually I don&#39;t mind what appcelerator try to collect. The biggest issue is that server connection of api.appcelerator.net is really <strong>Slow</strong> here. The network of my app is blocked by the connection to api.appcelerator.net. My app is pretty useless because of it.</p>
