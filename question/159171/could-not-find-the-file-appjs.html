			<h1>Could not find the file app.js</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>When making a build for the iPhoneSimulator, then transferring the .app file to <strong>another machine</strong> and running on the simulator (via ios-sim) an error message appears &quot;could not find the file app.s&quot;. Note, the .app runs fine on the machine it was built on.</p>
<p>The build command we&#39;re using is:<br>titanium build –build-only –platform ios –project-dir myproject –device-family iphone –ios-version 7.0 –sim-version 7.0</p>
<p>Doing some investigation I do notice absolute paths in the binary myproject.app&#x2F;myproject so I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s not portable as it is now.</p>
<p>Is it possible to make a portable simulator build? </p>
<p>Ti CLI 3.1.2</p>

							<p>Personally, I would Export the project from the first machine, and Import onto the other.</p>

										<p><p>I should mention one catch: we don&#39;t want to ship the source code with it. Ideally just a binary thats built for the sim that someone could grab and then run on their own machine.</p>

										<p><p>Ah… I&#39;m not sure you can do so because the build process for iOS to the simulator does not bundle the actual resources, it just creates symlinks back to your workspace.</p>

										<p><p>But… if you dont want to ship the source code, you can&#39;t bundle it as the .js files will be available in the bundle, unminified&#x2F;obfuscated</p>

										<p><p>Looking at <code>titanium</code> build commands</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">titanium build <span class="hljs-comment">--h</span>
</code></pre><p>It states that Simulator builds are never minified. I think you&#39;re out of luck without a lot of manual hacking to rebundle the app with the actual js files and also manually minify them to hinder (but not prevent) reverse engineering.</p>
<p>Why not create and Adhoc build for an actual device ?</p>

										<p><p>Thats ok though since its really for testing purposes, not so much security. We just don&#39;t want to have to rebuild it from source code. I am trying out that one stack overflow solution now but if there are symlinks to resources I&#39;m not too hopeful of it working.</p>

										<p><p>If that utility isnt smart enough for follow symlinks, perhaps take a look at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rorohiko.com&#x2F;wordpress&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;aliasherder&#x2F;">this</a> to auto-convert Alias-&gt;Copy of original (untried)</p>

										<p><p>Yep. Just tried it, and it seems to work</p>
<p>Just drop your app bundle from the simulator folder into that utility and it copies the js files in place of the aliases. I can then run it stand-alone on the simulator by drag-dropping the app bundle onto the simulator shortcut and it loads.</p>

										<p><p>Awesome, that does work! Thanks for the help! </p>
<p>Also seems that <code>cp -LR</code> seems to be enough as well. I guess it&#39;s just as simple as following those symlinks.</p>
