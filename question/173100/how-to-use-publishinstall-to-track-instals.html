							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The quickest way to get answers for this sort of problem is to contact the author of the module themselves.  There is an email address for the author on the parent page.  He also appears to work for Facebook. The FB SDK version mentioned appears to be an earlier version of the current one so it may be some small tweak that is needed.</p>
<p>It is possible that someone may have a specific answer for you here but the number of people who use a particular module (I have never had need for this one) against those who are currently reviewing the Q&amp;A is low or zero.  So the email route might be the best.</p>

							<p>Hi Eduard,</p>
<p>as of our experience, that module stopped tracking FB activity on March 25th 2014, probably because FB dropped support for the old method of tracking installs by publishInstall in favor of activateApp. </p>
<p>The module&#39;s author, Daniele, is not with FB anymore so we are stuck.<br>Apparently, FB itself does not even know the module has been created by their own employees.</p>
<p>The best thing is to expose activateApp in the Titanium Facebook module, which is now open source under <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator-modules&#x2F;">Appcelerator Modules in GitHub</a>, but this would be better managed by Ti team.</p>
