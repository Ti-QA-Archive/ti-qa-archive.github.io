			<h1>How to increment build version for iOS project?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I recently uploaded a build to iTunes Connect but realized there was an issue so I rejected the binary. Now I have it fixed and am ready to upload again but cannot. iTunes Connect is ready for a 1.0.5 build but wont let me delete the current build that is up there nor will it allow me to upload the new build with the same version number (I get a &#39;Redundant Binary Upload&#39; error). So from the below article the only fix is to increment the build version and upload another build.</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;25699404&#x2F;new-itunes-user-interface-unable-to-find-ready-to-upload-binary</p>
<p>I tried grabbing the info.plist from the build&#x2F;iphone folder and increment the bundleversion property and then placing it into the root of my project and rebuilding but that did not seem to work. I still got the &#39;Redundant Binary Upload&#39; error.</p>
<p>Any suggestions on how to increment the build version so I can submit this app?</p>

<p>Here is all the info just in case though:</p>
<p>Titanium Studio, build: 3.2.3.201404181442</p>
<p>Ti SDK 3.2.0 GA</p>

										<p><p>You can&#39;t replace a binary once it was uploaded to the &quot;new&quot; itunes connect.</p>
<p>You have to increment either the Build or Version number of the binary. Since I don&#39;t know a way how to change the Build number with Titanium, I suggest you to increment the Version number. You can then go ahead and add a new build to itunes connect, upload it and select it before submitting for review.</p>
