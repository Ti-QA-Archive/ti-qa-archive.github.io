			<h1>Beginner: why iPhone and Android code. Thought it was cross-platform JS?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m new to Titanium. Have successfully installed all SDKs and Kitchen Sink is working but .. in the guides I hear much about &quot;building an iPhone [this]&quot; this and &quot;designing an Android [that]&quot;. All the talk in the intro videos was about cross-platform JS. The programming guides are also full of details about Objectivce C and Java. I thought we didn&#39;t have to mess with that? Confused.</p>

							<p>Titanium is not designed to be a &quot;write once, run everywhere solution&quot; and this is intentional. Android, iPhone and BlackBerry are all very different devices, and OSs, each with there own UI styles, and native OS APIs. If Titanium were to work cross platform for all devices, many features, simply could not exist.<br>That being said, you have 2 options for writing apps that work on many platforms:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write your code with if statements to distinguish your code on the diff platforms you are compiling for.</li>
<li>Use the device directories in the resource folder to separate your code. Details of how to do this can be found here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;The+Application+Project+Structure</li>
</ol>
<p>For the most part option 1 is best for small-ish apps where there are not as many changes between platforms, and option 2 is best for larger apps. Or you can use a mixture of both those solutions.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about any of this, please feel free to ask :)</p>

							<p>Generally it is cross-platform JavaScript. What you&#39;re reading is more advanced, or limited resources. Such as if you are building on a Windows machine, which is only available to build onto Android, so they completely ignore all iOS-only modules and only ask questions based on Android.</p>
<p>Objective-C and Java is for advanced module-creating and adding your own functionality to the mobile SDK.</p>

							<p>Hi Gerald.</p>
<p>I think it&#39;s not cross-platform JS, it&#39;s rather cross-platform-compiled JS. The difference is that JS is not interpreted by JS interpreter at runtime, it&#39;s converted to native source code (Objective-C &amp; Java) and then compiled for native platform. Otherwise, Titanium application would not be native application, it would be web applications that runs inside (web) browser.</p>

							<p>Also, in general, the same JS source code should compile in two platform specific applications that should have same functionality (or should have similar UI experience). But the problem is the difference between two platforms, so there can be (JS) source code that is specific for particular platform.</p>

							<p>A number of issues quickly arise when you do cross-platform projects, so you need to be aware of that. In example, YouTube movies in a Webview won&#39;t play in Android. There&#39;s no left or rightnav button location in Android, so you need to plan for that. Objects have no auto .width and .height readable attributes, so you will need to account for that in Android (Android will return &#39;auto&#39; and not the width or height of the element). Images are not automatically scaled by one of the two factors as they are in iOS. And much more… Not necessarily all about Titanium, a lot is about limits of the Android system.</p>
