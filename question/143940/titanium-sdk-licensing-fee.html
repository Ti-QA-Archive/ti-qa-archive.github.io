			<h1>Titanium SDK Licensing Fee?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Sorry if this is a stupid question to ask but im new to appcelerator. Just downloaded the app explorer and tried it around and it seems nice. Im planning to develop a mobile app on both iOS and Android and Titanium seem to be a nice choice however im confused as to the licensing on the SDK. The app will be used internally in my company so i looked up on the plans and pricing for the SDK but could not comprehend what the packages mean. Can someone shed a light as to what those packages mean? Do i have to pay for the SDK?</p>

							<div><p>From Thierry Godfroid&#39;s link I&#39;m free to develop any application with Titanium SDK without any financial obligations so as long I dont use appcelerator&#39;s analytic and cloud services or are within limits of the quota under app explore package?</p>

<p>To clarify my objective is to create a cross platform apps for internal usage that deals with internal databases. I have no problem whatsoever in purchasing a license but in this case I&#39;d like to understand more as to what appcelarator package provides. Hopefully its clear enough for what I&#39;m asking.</p>

							<p>There is a free tier.  You get the sdk.  You get an ide with debugger on ios.  You can publish to the app stores. You get a limited number of cloud api calls. </p>
<p>You can then pay for support as needed.</p>
<p>You can pay for additional APi calls for the cloud services.</p>
