			<h1>Getting Started Help - Emulator failing</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I downloaded and installed Titanium (SDK and Studio) today, and am attempting to follow the setup guides found at http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Setting_up_Titanium_Studio</p>
<p>I followed all the instructions successfully for installing Studio, making sure that it and the SDK are up to date.  I then successfully followed the instructions for setting up the Android SDK.  I installed the Android SDK Tools, the Android SDK Platform-tools, and all components for Android 4.1 (API 16)</p>
<p>This all completed successfully (except I was instructed to exit Titanium Studio during the Android SDK installation, as it said studio was using the Android SDK and must be closed to proceed) After closing studio and saying Yes to proceed, the android sdk finished successfully.</p>
<p>I moved on to the next document, Creating your first App found here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Creating_Your_First_Titanium_Apps</p>
<p>I sucessfully imported the Kitchen Sink project as instructed - opened the app.js file and chose to run in the Android Emulator - and it failed.  The console window displayed the following:</p>
<p>[ERROR] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 1</p>
<p>Am I missing something?  I want to make sure the basics are working before I go any further - should the android emulator successfully run the sample apps after a fresh install or am I missing a step not documented in the online docs?</p>
<p>TIA!</p>
<p>I am on Titanium Studio, build: 2.1.1.201207271312</p>

							<p>Try a couple things here. First, try cleaning the project you imported. Project &gt; Clean … from inside Titanium Studio. If that doesn&#39;t work, try creating a new default project and running that in your emulator to see if that works. Either way, report back with your results.</p>

							<p>Thank you for such a fast response!</p>
<p>I cleaned the Kitchen Sink project and received the same error.</p>
<p>So, I created a new app, and after setting all the options and clicking Finish to create the new app I received the following error:</p>
<p>Unable to create new project.<br>No &quot;android-8&quot; or &quot;android-2.2&quot; in the Android SDK</p>
<p>This makes me think I may be missing a big piece of the puzzle, so I apologize if this turns out to be a stupid mistake on my part. I should say this is my first step into mobile app development.  I am more a web developer, so before installing Titanium today I have no mobile development tools on my machine.  Did I need to install the Eclipse tools or something Android-specific prior to installing Titanium and using it to &quot;update&#x2F;install&quot; the android sdk?</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

										<p><p>Try to use the comments features when responding to an answer, it makes the thread easier to follow.</p>
<p>Now, as for the SDK issue, fire up your Android SDK manager. You can do this easily by running the command <code>android</code> from the android-sdk directory and then running the SDK manager. From there, make sure you&#39;ve installed the apis and tools (its always good to not only have the latest ones, but a few back for testing). Also, make sure you&#39;ve got the Google APIs version for each tool. In this case, you&#39;ll need to make sure you have Android 2.2 (API 8).</p>
<p>You can also change the default Android API for the project in the project settings if you want to use Android 4.1 as your default Android version. Again, make sure that you have the Google APIs version before you try to use it as a default.</p>

										<p><p>I do have all the tools and apis for 4.1 installed, and I have 4.1 set as the default sdk for the project.</p>
<p>I used the sdk manager and installed all the tools and google tools for the 2.2 sdk as well.  Now when I attempt to launch the Kitchen Sink project in the android emulator I still get the original error, and I also get the following:</p>
<p>[ERROR] Error locating JDK: set $JAVA_HOME or put javac and jarsigner on your $PATH</p>
<p>Installing the JDK was the first thing studio did when I installed in.  Not sure where all the problems are coming from, but I do appreciate all the help!</p>

										<p><p>Have you made sure that your JAVA_HOME env var is set properly, along with any other vars that need to be set? See the docs here for info on that: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.1&#x2F;index.html#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Software_Locations_and_Environment_Variables-section-29004844_SoftwareLocationsandEnvironmentVariables-Windows">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.1&#x2F;index.html#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Software_Locations_and_Environment_Variables-section-29004844_SoftwareLocationsandEnvironmentVariables-Windows</a></p>

										<p><p>I sincerely appreciate all the assistance.  It looks as if NO environment variables got set up when I installed Titanium or the SDKs.  I created the JAVA_HOME variable, and saw on the link you provided in one of the screenshots there was an env var named android_sdk - so I went ahead and created that as well - Do you know off hand the proper names of any other environment variables I should look to create?</p>

										<p><p>OK - every message we get rid of, a new one takes its place :&#x2F;</p>
<p>I still get the original error whenever I attempt to run in the emulator:</p>
<p>[ERROR] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 1</p>
<p>However, now I have created the JAVA_HOME env var and pointed it to my java directory, I no longer get the error about the $JAVA_HOME as before.  Instead, now I get a listing of required files that aren&#39;t found, that looks as follows:</p>
<p>[ERROR] Required jarsigner not found<br>[ERROR] Required keytool not found<br>[ERROR] Required javac not found<br>[ERROR] Required java not found<br>[ERROR] One or more required files not found - please check your JAVA_HOME environment variable</p>
<p>My JAVA_HOME variable is set to C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_25\bin</p>
<p>When I look in that folder, I see all 4 files listed, all are applications with .exe extensions.  I ran a command windows and entered the SET command to view all my env vars and verified that my JAVA_HOME variable is pointing to that location….but yet the app says they are all missing.</p>
<p>Is it possible my version of java (1.6.0_25) is no good?  What else can I do?  And any thoughts on the first &quot;abnormal process termination&quot; error that has persisted all along - or is that just a side-effect of all the other problems I am hitting?</p>
<p>Thanks again!  Hopefully I am getting close to being able to actually start using &#x2F; learning Titanium!</p>

										<p><p>OK wow - I think i got it.  On the advice of a co-worker I deleted the JAVA_HOME environment variable and instead added the C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_25\bin location to the PATH environment variable.  After a reboot, I am now able to load apps into the android emulator!</p>
<p>May want to document somewhere that the PATH variable in Windows 7 seems to want the Java bin path in it instead of a JAVA_HOME variable.  Thanks for all the help!!</p>
