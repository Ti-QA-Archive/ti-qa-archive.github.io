		<section>
			<p>Since I upgraded to SDK 4.0.2 and Titanium 1.4.0 I have tons of problems compiling my app.<br>Those problems arose beforehand from times to time but now it has come to a complete impossibility to compile.</p>
<p>depending on the release I use it gets stuck either at &quot;[INFO] iPhone SDK version: 4.0&quot; or at &quot;[INFO] iPhone SDK version: 3.2&quot; or at &quot;[INFO] Skipping JS compile, running from simulator&quot;…</p>
<p>Anyway it does not compile, does not run…</p>
<p>Any solution someone ?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

So I had to compile directly using XCODE</p>

							<p>Hi Olivier</p>
<p>I have been having problems with install errors. I found i had a corrupt PNG which was breaking the build and then i discovered it was looking for an old provision file?. I downloaded the provision again from apple and added it to the same folder as the project  and linked to it from there instead of the mobile devices folder in the library folder. this is now installing fine although i have a couple of loading database issues now, but im working through them now.</p>
<p>good luck.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
