							<p>event.media variable in your code would give you the image, if you want to get the image after its been saved to the photo gallery, you have 2 options… Save the file manually yourself, to your apps documents, or download a module like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;1291">this</a> that will let you access the images in the photo gallery, but there is not any way to know what image is what as it is coming back into your code</p>

							<p>hi Matt,</p>
<p>thanks for  your solution.<br>I run module successfully.<br>But I want default name of image that device photo gallery give to image thatI take using camera and save to photo gallery.</p>
<p>I can not save all camera captured images to application data dictionary because as no of images increases in application data dictionary , Application crash on my iPod 8gb with iOS 4.3. but run smoothly on iPad2 16gb with iOS5. </p>
<p>for solving this issue I save all images in device photo gallery.But now I want reference of image that i save in device photo gallery or at least name ofthat image ,so that i display name to user.Here I do not want to use photo gallery picker.Because If i use that than each time user have to select photo from picker and it is not user friendly way.</p>
<p>So any idea to solve this.</p>

										<p><p>Please post code samples of what you have thus far… the sample should be able to just be pasted into an app.js and run.</p>

										<p><p>There is no way to extract a single image by name&#x2F;path from the photo-gallery even in native code. You can get all images, but there is no way to know what image is the one you wanted.</p>

							<p>I came across the same issue and was able to store the image name (of event.media) by using a simple php function:</p>
<p>$theFileName = $_FILES[&#39;userfile&#39;][&#39;name&#39;]; &#x2F;&#x2F;&#39;name&#39; of image</p>
<p>When you are writing an image to your server, you first need to extract the name of the .jpg and this is partially how you do it.  Hope this helps!</p>
