							<div><p>I have this problem as well.<br>I wonder why the could packaging services are not updated with the SDK.</p>
<p>I would think this would happen first before releasing the SDK to prevent people running into this problem.</p>
<p>I cant wait to have a full release of the SDK that prevents the<br>application crashing from the HTTP bug.<br>(I am hoping that the bug tracking version 1.3 in the calendar is then the full release of 1.2, As it says next Monday is when that happens.)</p>

							<p>Ray, Typically the packaging servers have not had release candidates on the, AFAIK, and you have needed to package locally to accomplish that. I&#39;m not sure if that will change or not, but I wouldn&#39;t expect so…</p>

										<p><p>There is a problem with this, when there is a fatal&#x2F;crashing bug the turn around for online packaging is weeks&#x2F;months.</p>
<p>My suggestion would be to release two types of versions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Crash bug fixes that are included on the packaging servers</li>
<li>Feature additions that are localised versions for testing.</li>
</ol>

										<p><p>Thank you for clarifying that. A helpful feature would be to have a message saying cloud packaging is impossible when using an early release SDK to avoid the confusion.</p>

										<p><p>Ray, I&#39;ll add a comment here also, but the SDK is copied up to the packaging server so you should be able to package now. I just packaged with RC3 on OSX and it works fine now.</p>

										<p><p>Ray, the packaging servers have been updated with the SDK and should work now. Let us know if you are still having problems. Also there is a bug with the previous Studio, so if your using Studio make sure you get the 1.04 release that was built on 08&#x2F;10&#x2F;2011. The broken Studio will return a 400 for the request, which is a bad request.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Alan, thank you for the update. I&#39;m still having trouble with the errorwhen I try to package in the cloud:<br>Packaging failed with message: &#39;NoneType&#39; object has no attribute &#39;rfind&#39;</p>
<p>Anyways, I actually find the local packaging to be way faster and much better and probably would use that for now.</p>
