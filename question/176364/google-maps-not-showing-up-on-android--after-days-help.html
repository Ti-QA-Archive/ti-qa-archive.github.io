			<h1>Google Maps not showing up on Android ... after days. Help!</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi<br>I have been spending days with this on, nearly crazy now. Please help, and make my day :-)</p>
<p>Titanium sdk 3.3.0.<br>Android SDK is pretty much up to date.<br>Developing on my device - Nexus 5 (android vers 4.4.4)</p>
<p>Trying to get Google Maps to show up, console keeps saying:</p>
<p><strong>E&#x2F;Google Maps Android API: Failed to load map. Error contacting Google servers. This is probably an authentication issue (but could be due to network errors).</strong></p>
<p>Maps works as expected in other apps (Google Maps for instance) on my phone.</p>
<p>This is another error in console:<br><strong>GooglePlayServicesUtil: The Google Play services resources were not found. Check your project configuration to ensure that the resources are included.</strong></p>
<p>However, when I test in code from within application, it shows success:<br><strong>ALERT: (KrollRuntimeThread) [1209,1209] Google Play services is installed.</strong></p>
<p>I have followed instructions several times, on how to create the API-key in Google console (and enabeling Google Maps for Android vers 2 in api console), I am pretty sure I do that part right but I am not sure if I should really use different keys for run-configuration and package-configuration.</p>
<p>I have yet only used my own keys = have not used the built in Titanium keys<br>I have pasted the API key into my tiapp.xml according to instructions in documentation.</p>
<p>Another thing - I have two projects in Titanium using the same id. One for ios and one for Android, only the names are different. Could that be a problem? Should I rebuild one of them under a new id?</p>
<p>Yet another question: If I would need some professional help on this, where could I get it?</p>
<p>Best regards from Tove, near the edge of map-insanity ;-)</p>
