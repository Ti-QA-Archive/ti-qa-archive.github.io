		<section>
			<p>Hi there,<br>I am a newbie, I like the platform and would start by building a desktop application but it seems that there is not much emphasis on Titanium Desktop. </p>
<p>Are there any tutorials or guides on how to get started on Desktop apps. </p>
<p>Thanks, Kazam.</p>

							<p>Kazam, welcome!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been on the platform for about two weeks now and yes, finding technical information is pretty hard, though not impossible.</p>
<p>First, be sure to read these guides and refer to them often:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.appcelerator.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;getting_started.html</p>
<p>Next, do download the &quot;Kitchen Sink&quot; application and become familiar with it. Most things you want to do are contained in it. Do this after you install everything.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#39;t waste time watching those intro videos they have here, they are fast and have extremely little substance. If you&#39;re inclined to pay $300 you can get the set of eight, but the previews I saw, were not insightful. The Kitchen Sink was.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Way has published a video on a really quick overview that I found to be really helpful. It&#39;s over at Net Tuts here:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;net.tutsplus.com&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;javascript-ajax&#x2F;quick-overview-a-few-moments-with-titanium&#x2F;</p>
<p>There is a VERY good series of 6 videos by Dr. Rafauel Hernandez on You Tube. These are extremely helpful.  The first of the series is here:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=tX_7NGvcNk4&amp;feature=relmfu</p>
<p>As you begin to design your first app, you&#39;ll find that the Kitchen Sink app will become the first place you reference. After that, the Q&amp;A board is very active and filled will very nice, patient people who provide lots of insight and support (remember that&#39;s NOT the Appcelerator support organization, but just people that are using (and learning) the platform.</p>
<p>My hope is that the Apcelerator folks will address the deficiency they have in &quot;getting started&quot; and documentation.  The guides are good, and provide much more detail than the actual API pages (which are errant in some cases). They need to adopt an approach like CodeIgniter, which has probably THE best documentation for its users. Not only that, but their videos are detailed.</p>
<p>Good luck! </p>

							<p>There is some info here Kenan but after that it does seem you are on your own. Most of &#39;Desktop&#39; is the same as programming an AJAX style website in any case.</p>

							<p>Same to me. I don&#39;t understand the difference from a web page and Titanium desktop other than this is working in a window where the browser is hidden inside.<br>There are not native controls as in mobile version.<br>I event don&#39;t find the way to use php or filesystem.</p>
<p>Great ad here<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;titanium-desktop-application-development&#x2F;<br>but… HOW?!</p>
<p>About<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;doc&#x2F;desktop&#x2F;get_started<br>it is not a great help.</p>
