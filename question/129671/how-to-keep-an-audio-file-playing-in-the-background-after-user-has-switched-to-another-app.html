			<h1>How to keep an audio file playing in the background after user has switched to another app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am playing an audio file in my app and I want the audio file to keep playing in the background even after the user has pressed the home button or switched to another application.  I don&#39;t want to restart the audio file from the beginning as a background service.  Rather I want the audio file that is already playing to just continue to keep playing in the background.  For instance, if I am playing a 2 minute audio clip, and the user presses the home button about 90 seconds into the audio clip, the remaining 30 seconds of the audio clip should still keep playing in the background after the user has pressed the home button.  Thanks in advance for any help!</p>

										<p><p>Thank you Rafiq and others.  I am developing the app for iPhone.  How do I keep it playing in the background.  I already tried setting the property allowBackground=true but as you mention that does not work on the iPhone.  Thanks!</p>
