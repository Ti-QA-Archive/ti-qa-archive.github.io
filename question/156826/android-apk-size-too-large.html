		<section>
			<p>###Android APK too large as compare to Android Native Plateform<br>I am using Titanium Appcelerator since last one year and have successfully developed more than <strong>15      apps for Android, iPhone and iPad</strong>, but I always faces in android <strong>apk size</strong> problem and I think this<br> is a big issue as compare to Android Native Platform. I know Titanium uses V8 engine which have extra<br> library after spend some more time on internet I found rhino and see reduce apk upto 4MB. Recently I<br> update Titanium Studio and SDK but give message <strong>Rhino is deprecated in Titanium SDK 3.0 and<br>above.</strong>What is this ? And please tell me Why we stay with Titanium more ?**</p>

							<p>Hello Vijay,</p>
<p>The first question that comes to mind is <strong>How is this a problem for you</strong>? Besides the fact that it is an inconvenience, <strong>how</strong> does it affect your application?</p>
<p>While it is true that native applications are smaller; but in all fairness, is that really a problem. People today have absolutely no problem downloading games that range in the 20MB these days. So 4MB doesn&#39;t look half bad in this context.</p>
<p>I will attribute the part where you mention wanting to leave the Titanium as <em>a rant</em>. Sometimes, frustration can push people to say things. I had my fair share of frustration with Titanium trust me, but somehow I always found that the benefits outweigh the inconveniences.</p>

										<p><p>####Hello  Christian Brousseau####<br>I agree with you, people have no doubt downloading games within <strong>20 to 30 MB</strong> but I am talking<br>about enterprise and 4 to 10 pages apps in titanium(Specially for Android).You say that How is this problem for me ? Few days before 10 clients was demanded enterprise apps with minimum apk<br>size. I made all apps in Titanium but still I faces size issue and received <strong>Negative Feedback</strong> .<br>I will give you one simple example: <strong>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.guavasofts.aerofleet&amp;hl=en</strong> this is live app made with Titanium on Play store have only 4 pages but apk size 5.8 MB and now I am made it with Eclipse(Still Development) better for that only <strong>1.8 MB</strong>. I think<br>you can understand that <strong>How is this a problem for you?</strong>. I hope Titanium solve this problem with next SDK.</p>

										<p><p>Well, I looked the link you provided and I failed to see the negative feedback you were talking about. Maybe you were talking about another application…</p>
<p>But even so, how is this a problem for your client? Do their device have limited storage space? Or is it just <em>subjective perception</em> from their part.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not trying to give you a hard time or anything like that. I juste want to highlight that the size issue (especially on Android) is debatable at best.</p>

							<p>You already know that v8 is included in the build and that&#39;s why the size of the app is bigger than the native one. Rhino is deprecated for the performance reasons being inferior to V8. </p>
<p>For your last question, nobody holds you here, you can move on and start developing with any other platform or natively if you are not satisfied with the results Titanium gives you. Trolling the QA will only make the members of the community reject you and all your next questions you might have.</p>

							<p>you&#39;re asking what other people asked for the past 3 years, and there&#39;s no real solution to it.</p>
<p>Have a look at the following threads:</p>
