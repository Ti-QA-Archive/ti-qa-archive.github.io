			<p>I have an app I am building for a client. I know you can test on your own physical devices and emulators… I am ready to send my app to the client, but I don&#39;t want to have him download Titanium Studio and import the project to test the app… I dont&#39; want him to have the source code… so, is there any way I can compile the app and send it over to him so I can run it on his iPhone???</p>

							<p>When you test your  on your own iPhone you should already have created a &quot;Provisioning Profile&quot;. Ask your Client for their iPhones Unique Identifier (UDID) - register it with your provisioning profile and generate a new test app- like you would do to run it on your own iPhone. Then go to the folder build&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;build&#x2F;Debug-iphoneos&#x2F;YOURAPP.ipa get the file and send this and the provisioning profile to the client. Ask him to drop both files (the profile first) onto their iTunes… this will install your app- in a complied way and for him to preview….</p>

							<p>You can do this a couple different ways. The first way would be to use your Apple Dev Center and build for ad-hoc distribution. You&#39;ll need to gather some info from your clients phone to add it as a test phone, but it will allow you to send an app file that can be installed via iTunes. Check the ad-hoc distribution steps in the dev center for detials.</p>
<p>The second, and arguably easier way, is to use a testing distribution system like TestFlight. The idea is the same, but the TestFlight app can be installed on an iphone and will allow over the air installation and will also automatically notify your client when you update the app. Check out testflightapp.com for those details.</p>

							<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.testflightapp.com">testflightapp</a> is what I use.  You still have to go through the steps to add them to your device list for provisioning but it makes getting their info much easier for ad hoc distributions.</p>

							<p>The IPA file is generated when ever you compile your app (when you select run on iOS Device in Titanium Studio). It is the actual APP. You could say it is like the .exe file of a program</p>
