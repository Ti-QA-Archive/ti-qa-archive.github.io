			<h1>Programatically filling PDF forms</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve been creating some of my previously desktop based solutions as mobile solutions using Titanium Studio.</p>
<p>One of my apps captures information using a form system which is then stored to a server. That data is filled into an existing PDF form that can then be printed, allowing the customer to sign an original. The data can also be collected by other users of the software that then also fills it into their PDF to give a nice readable version of the data being stored, on their own official PDF.</p>
<p>I would like to replicate this functionality on an iPad. So far I have been able to create the dynamic form system for capture, collect data from existing applications on the server that was created by the desktop app, and display that data in various ways, like using ListView.</p>
<p>I have seen some solutions around creating PDF documents from scratch, and even a commonJS module for creating an FDF to fill a PDF form using  binary app on you computer, but nothing so far on filling PDF on iOS.</p>
<p>I have posted the question to a few Titanium module developers that have mad PDF modules.</p>
<p>Has anyone here done something similar and can point me in the right direction?</p>
