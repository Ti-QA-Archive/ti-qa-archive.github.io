			<h1>Remote images in backgroundImage property</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Because of scaling issues I want to use the backgroundImage property in an imageview instead of the image property, however I&#39;m using remote images and it seems backgroundImage can&#39;t take remote images. Is this true or has anyone got this to work?</p>

							<p>I was working on this just today as well. At first I just had them stored locally, but I realized the images (Both regular and @2x) were causing the app to be quite large, so I dumped them onto my WebServer and tried setting them as backgroundImages, but it didn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>What I did was simply add an ImageView to the row (Same height &amp; width as the row), then set the zIndex of the Image to 1 and the zIndex of all the other content that is supposed to be ontop of the image to 2.</p>
<p>Seemed to work quite good :) I also created a 1x1 image and set the defaultImage of the ImageView to it so that when it loads it doesn&#39;t have that ugly grey default &quot;no image&quot; image that Apple supplies.</p>
<p>Note that I do not believe resizing of a remote image is very well supported. It seems I can downsize the image, but upsizing it is quite difficult and annoying. Also, if you need to figure out whether to use @2x or not, use the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;latest&#x2F;Titanium.Platform.DisplayCaps-object.html">Ti.Platform.DisplayCaps.density</a> API. Retina = &quot;high&quot;, regular = &quot;medium&quot;.</p>

										<p><p>I figured this out its super simple. All you do is use the image property and set a NEW &#39;hires&#39; property to true and it works!</p>
