		<section>
			<p>Hi</p>
<p>I know iOS4 and greater support background apps hence one <em>may</em> be able to send notifications. What if Application is not active even in background. Can I still send notifications?</p>
<p>I am working on a TODO app so have to send notification for due tasks.</p>
<p>please note I am not talking about APPLE&#39;s Push Notifications.</p>

							<p>Hi Adnan</p>
<p>The app does not need to be running in order to receive the push notifications, the certificates you create and attach to the app allows iOS to know which app to talk to when the push notification comes in.</p>
<p>So you can receive push notifications in these situations;</p>
<ul>
<li>App running in forground</li>
<li>App running but not in foreground</li>
<li>App not running</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically as long as the app user has agreed to receive push notifications, they will get them.</p>

										<p><p>A local notification only works when the app is running as it is designed to work when the app is running in the background.</p>
<p>Direct quote from help docs.</p>
<p>&quot;Local notifications are a way for an application that is <strong>not running in the foreground</strong> to let users know that it has information for them.&quot;</p>

										<p><p>Ahaan. How would one tackle this locally, i.e. without using the APNS? How does the native Clock app set an alarm? :S</p>

										<p><p>There is a difference between Apple built in apps and downloadable apps that you and I make.</p>
<p>Apple built in apps have access to some functionality that we do not.  In particular if we want to handle events like an alarm&#x2F;timer then our apps MUST be running either in the foreground or background.</p>
<p>This may be changed in the future, but right now all but Apple share this situation.</p>

<p>I will confirm with the client what he wants then will be deciding its implementation.</p>

										<p><p>Hey Malcolm, can you check Things 2 and see how Things does the notification bit? This feature existed in v1 of Things as well. I would really appreciate if you could look into it and write back here.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Nikhil</p>
<p>Can you ask this as a separate question as this is not directly linked to the original question.</p>
<p>Could you also let me know exactly what you hope I (or others) can explain about things.  I do not have this app so have no experience of it directly - so tell me what I am focusing on.</p>
