		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve read through a few (maybe all?) questions and it seams people are having the same issue. However none of the suggested solutions seems to be working for me.</p>
<h2 id="system-info">System info</h2>
<p>I&#39;m on Mac OSX Snow Leopard with all the latest updates (including JDK 1.6).</p>
<p>Titanium Developer: 1.2.2<br>Titanium SDK 1.5.1<br>Installed Mobile SDKs: iPhone and Andrioad SDKs are found.</p>
<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>When i try to run the emulator for Andriod, the SDK and Screen keeps saying &quot;loading…&quot;. When setting the filter to &quot;Trace&quot; I get this message &quot;[TRACE] Exception: No &quot;android-4&quot; or &quot;android-1.6&quot; in the Android SDK&quot;.</p>
<p>Going back to the Android SDK and AVD Manager it clearly states that I have everything installed, including 1.6 API 4.</p>
<h2 id="question">Question</h2>
<p>Am I missing something here?</p>

<p>Make sure your installed Android packages list looks like the following:</p>
<p><img src="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;img214.imageshack.us&#x2F;img214&#x2F;9506&#x2F;screenshot060t.png" alt="android screenshot"></p>
<p>Ensure that the correct Android SDK location is set on the Titanium Developer Edit Profile screen:</p>
<p><img src="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;tLMV2.png" alt="edit profile screenshot"></p>
<p>TiDev simply runs commands that you could run yourself manually. Try to gain more insight into what TiDev is doing, and where it is failing, by noting its various output. See:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;troubleshooting_your_installation.html">Troubleshooting Your Installation</a></p>
<p>Hope this is useful.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

							<p>So, I had a look. Tried and checked everything but nothing. I&#39;ve also spent 7 hours plowing through Q&amp;As and Google and the only thing I&#39;ve found is a lot of people with the same issue but no answers, just a bunch of suggestions for workarounds that really doesn&#39;t help. </p>
<p>Man this is the second time I&#39;ve decided to give Appcelerator a chance and for the second time it falls short before even getting my hands dirty. I guess it&#39;s not that great after all. I&#39;ll keep an eye open for improvements but I think I&#39;ll just stick with Java and Objective-C for now.</p>
<p>Thanks anyway both of you!</p>

<p>Did you try the suggestion at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;troubleshooting_your_installation.html#when_all_else_fails_%28let_titanium_fix_it!%29">When All Else Fails (let Titanium fix it!)</a>? If this does not work, then read the guide <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;troubleshooting_your_installation.html">from the top</a> to properly understand what is going on.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

							<p>Yes, I did all that. I will do everything once more just to make sure. Even after doing the &quot;let titanium fix it!&quot; I can&#39;t create a project (see image).</p>

							<p>Do you really have directories that use square parenthesis in their names, ie [DEV] and [PROJECTS], as per your image?  It may not make any difference, but I would recommend renaming them to use standard characters, just to be certain.</p>
<p>Have you copied the adb executable over to the android-sdk&#x2F;tools directory, as per <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2010&#x2F;12&#x2F;titanium-and-android-sdk-tools-r8.html">Titanium and Android SDK Tools r8</a>?</p>
<p>Ensure that you are using the correct Java version, using the information in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;getting_started.html#preparing_for_android_development">Preparing for Android development</a></p>
<p>If you have done all of these, I can only think that it is a permissions issue, so you should follow the guide I posted before. Also, this guide will tell you where the debugging information is, so that you can gain insight into what is really going on.</p>

										<p><p>Yes I use square parenthesis too keep my folders organized. I don&#39;t see how that could mak a difference(?).</p>
<p>Yes I&#39;ve made an Alias of the adb and copied it to the tools folder. That was when the Android SDK got a green check mark for &quot;Installed Mobile Platforms&quot; as seen in the image below.</p>
<p>The correct Java version is installed from the OSX Update.</p>
<p>It is not a permission issue. I have tripple checked all files and directories. But again, I will go through it once more just in case.</p>

										<p><p>I did that, just to be sure. Same issue. Now I have also checked the permissions for the fourth time so I think I can check that as not being the reason as well. The same goes for that whole guide. It would be interesting in hearing other people sitting on the same systems as I do but who has made it work. What systems are you on Hal?</p>

<p>Almost all of the Appcelerator team use macs, from what I understand. The same can be assumed about most of the people in this forum, judging from the number of iOS queries, but very few are experiencing this problem.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;d say quite a few are in fact experiencing this problem. Just make a search for &quot;Android SDK loading&quot;. Lots of questions but no real answers. I can&#39;t remember even seeing a single response from the A-team. Hal, thanks anyway for taking your time!</p>

<p>Yes, there are lots of reports of &quot;Loading…&quot; messages, and lots of different causes, and many answers provided for each cause.</p>
<p>I have had this issue before, but I have solved it every time using a methodical and logical approach. Each time, it was an issue specific to my machine&#x2F;configuration, and each time I resolved it I gained greater insight into how Titanium works and how to set it up correctly.</p>
<p>Remember, this is a community Q&amp;A. There is no assurances from the &quot;A-team&quot; (as you call them) to answer questions here. Personally, I prefer they concentrate on resolving bugs and making enhancements.</p>
<p>I have already posted a link to the troubleshooting guide, which explains exactly the kind of process that I would go follow to resolve these kinds of issues. I suggest you try it again.</p>

										<p><p>Hal I understand that it is a community Q&amp;A. A-team is short for Appcelerator-team although I must admit it was funny how it came out. I also understand that there is no assurance that they answer questions here. What I don&#39;t understand is the logic behind that. If I had to point out one great source for gaining new paying customers, it would be in the &quot;free&quot; community. I&#39;d prefer them showing some dedication here instead of sending me emails about discounts for the payed service. And I bet I&#39;m not alone thinking so.</p>
<p>I have gone through the troubleshooting guide 4 time already. I&#39;m not going to do that again because I don&#39;t have more time to lose. If it takes this time just to get the software to work, I don&#39;t want to know about the problems that might occur using it. To me this product is not yet ready for business and as I&#39;ve said before, I&#39;m going to follow its progress but I&#39;m not going to use it nor recommend it to anyone for now.</p>
<p>And again Hal, I appreciate you taking your time. Thanks.</p>

							<p>I had this same problem using the free version of Titanium. I only got it to work by changing the Titanium SDK version from 1.5.1 to 1.2.0. Otherwise everything is exactly as described by the walk-thru, FAQ, etc. Maybe a restriction on the free version?</p>
