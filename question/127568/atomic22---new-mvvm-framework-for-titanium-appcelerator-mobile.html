			<h1>Atomic22 - New MVVM Framework for Titanium Appcelerator Mobile</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Since I&#39;ve decided to stick around and continue on with mobile development with Appcelerator, I want to try to contribute as much as I can.</p>
<p>I had previously started to build a custom framework for my apps (one launched, one overcoming bugs with deploy still). This weekend I have it a major overhaul and converted it to be CommonJS module compliant. I think this is a big move in the right direction.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I have decided to open source this framework. I personally think it&#39;s a pretty good base, but I&#39;m biased. Maybe you will think it&#39;s garbage, but I hope some people will like what I&#39;m doing with it… maybe even want to contribute extensions to it who knows.</p>
<p>Right now it is very basic, partially by design and partially because it&#39;s just built on my needs. I have some &quot;widgets&quot; or controls that I have written that I haven&#39;t ported over to CommonJS yet… so I&#39;ll be adding that type stuff and whatever else I need as I go. Let me know if you&#39;d like to see something specific in it also.</p>
<p>Please give your feedback positive or negative.</p>

							<div><p>Thanks… working on another update for tonight to add some polyfills, make the &quot;get&quot; method (which I alias with jQuery familiar $ inside the view and view-model) more powerful and flexible, and a few other changes.</p>
<p>Example so that you cn do…</p>
<p>$(&#39;.heading&#39;, &#39;#lblSomething&#39;, &#39;window&#39;, {<br>   backgroundColor: &#39;#ff0000&#39;<br>});</p>
<p>to apply a style setting to multiple… same thing with getting elements with multiple selectors (returned in an array of all matching).</p>
<p>so more to come. again would love any feedback or ideas.</p>
