			<h1>Using the Camera to measure objects?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Would it be possible to use Titanium to build an app that measures objects using geometery from the camera and accelerometer, similar to this app (Smart Measure) in Google Play:</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=kr.sira.measure#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDIxMiwia3Iuc2lyYS5tZWFzdXJlIl0.</p>
<p>From the description the app estimates the height of the camera, the distance to the object, and uses the accelerometer to measure the angle and then calculates the objects height.</p>
<p>I know how to use Titanium to access the camera and accelerometer, beyond that any suggestions how one might approach  building an app like this with Titanium?  Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated, thanks.</p>

							<p>To such things you are better with native Code. This will involve Image processing which can become tricky with Javascript.</p>
<p>Short answer:   no</p>

										<p><p>I would dissagree Alexander. It&#39;s very easy to work with the camera in Appcelerator. now, as regards the image processing, there are quite a lot JavaScript image libraries out there which could help! Even if you decide to go natively you should consider a third party image processing library, so why not using the JS one?</p>

										<p><p>Yeah but you need a video stream from the camera if you want nice UX, how you want to do that? Also I am quite sure you will have many issue on the road to the app, which will be much easier to solve natively than with Ti where you will need to create custom modules over and over again. The JS libraries were not made for Ti and often use DOM&#x2F;canvas and therefore need attention of adjusting&#x2F;fixing it.</p>

										<p><p>You are right, there will be a lot of issues on the road to the app, but that&#39;s part of the beauty of creation! :-) Ok, I won&#39;t disagree that with native code you may be closer to do what you want but again, it depends on the developer&#39;s experience. You may get something things easily done in Titanium, maybe some issues that need to be addressed with custom modules.</p>
<p>Personally, I would go for Titanium, a project like this would also help me build on experience with this wonderful platform.</p>
