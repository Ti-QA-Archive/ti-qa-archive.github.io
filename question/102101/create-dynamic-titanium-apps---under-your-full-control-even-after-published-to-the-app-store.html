<p><strong>www.cloudebug.com</strong> is introducing an API to create Titanium applications which can be altered at any time, just like web pages, <strong>even after they are published to the App Store</strong>, but, unlike web pages, <strong>these apps are native apps and can use every feature of the Titanium SDK!</strong></p>
<p>While this feature might not be that important for the Android developers, it is crucially important for the iOS developers, where we may wait unspecified period of time (while our app&#x2F;update is being reviewed by Apple) just to fix a bug, collecting negative feedbacks while waiting.</p>
<p>This wait is over now! <strong>You can have a total and instant control over your code at any time!</strong></p>
<p>Based on our own experience, having your application under your total control at all times totally changing the way of developing apps for the iOS&#x2F;Apple&#39;s AppStore! Changing it for the better!</p>
<p>Code strong!</p>

<p>If so, I feel like I&#39;ve opened some kind of horrible Pandora&#39;s box. As others in that Q&amp;A pointed out, this would be very much against Apple&#39;s policies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even if that weren&#39;t the case, this could lead to some horrible user experiences. My intent with this was to enable small updates in Android without requiring a full app upgrade.</p>
<p>Having completely dynamic apps that could change entirely at any time without warning the user, though? Dear Darwin, what have we done….</p>

<p>As far as &quot;horrible user experience&quot; goes - horrible app can most definitely be designed this way, just like any other way, by qualified developer, of course…</p>
<p>Also, regarding the user experience:<br>I like it when a user can report a problem in my app, and I can fix it in 30 seconds, not in 30 seconds + week(s) of waiting for approval, and I can fix it for everybody at once, without the need for my users to download any updates…</p>
<p>Thank you for your deep thoughts, they can not go unnoticed.</p>

							<p>this post has negative rank…<br>i&#39;d like to know what it means.</p>
<p><strong>would you, people who do that, have a basic courtesy to explain your frustration?</strong></p>
<p>this forum&#39;s rules call for &quot;Ask your own question or <strong>lend a helping hand</strong>&quot; - which i&#39;m trying to do - <strong>helping</strong>.</p>
<p>so, whoever has an issue with that - please come out to have an open discussion!</p>

<p>I am not one of those who have voted your question down (in fact, I will vote it up in a minute), but I can speculate about why people may have done so, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>the &quot;question&quot; is not a question; it&#39;s a statement</li>
<li>your post is badly formatted - remember to use the &quot;preview&quot; button before you submit your post</li>
<li>your post is an advert. That said, as there is currently no place for 3rd parties to advertise to the appcelerator community, I can understand why you did this and therefore think it&#39;s excusable</li>
<li>you have apologized for double posting, when you could simply have edited and deleted the contents of the answer</li>
<li>you have answered your own question. It&#39;s recommended to use the comment facility instead</li>
<li>from what I understand, loading remote js usually contravenes Apple&#39;s and Google&#39;s terms and conditions. If you have evidence that proves why your service is an exception, then it would be a good idea for you to provide it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you don&#39;t take offense. You may not agree with some of these points, but I have just listed the reasons why people <em>may</em> have taken exception, based on what is generally-accepted in this forum. This is, bear in mind, what you requested.</p>
<p>Good luck with your webservice. If you can satisfy the skepticism and prove to people that it can work as you describe, you may well be onto a winner! :)</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>paul,<br>thank you for the support.</p>
<p>also, can you tell me how can i remove an entry made in error (such as my double post)? all i see is the &quot;edit&quot; and &quot;add comment&quot; buttons, no &quot;delete&quot;.<br>of course, i can make the body of the post an empty string, or even get smart and post &quot;&amp;nbsp;&quot;, but it&#39;s kinda… un-cool :-))</p>
<p>so, what do i do to remove an unwanted post?</p>

										<p><p>Don&#39;t worry, yury - we&#39;ve all done it at some point. ;)  The best thing you can do is edit it and delete the contents. This makes it easy for people to ignore, meaning it won&#39;t spoil the flow of the discussion. Admittedly it&#39;s not perfect, but it&#39;s…better.</p>

										<p><p>paul, please take a look at my <strong>empty comment</strong> below:</p>
<p>i&#39;ve tried to follow your advice and deleted a comment made in error by making it empty - and got &quot;-1&quot; for it?!<br>people are brutal :-))</p>
<p>of course, that was a test (but not the &quot;-1&quot; - it&#39;s real, somebody did not like my empty comment even a tiny bit), but my point is: <strong><em>maybe it&#39;s time to update this blog soft and make comments deletable, or hidable?</em></strong></p>
<p>just a thought…</p>

							<p>i&#39;ve decided to withdraw the invitation to apply for the dynapp sdk pilot.</p>
<p>my reasons are deeply rooted in the current practices and regulations that major app stores are imposing upon us, developers. and, though, we all know that people who mean harm will do harm quietly, and people who are vocal about freedom seldom mean and do harm - at this time we have to comply, unquestionably.</p>
<p>i&#39;ve been through the appeal process with the apple&#39;s app review board more than once, and, although, i do believe that the &quot;truth is out there&quot;, i know it&#39;s not at the infinite loop…</p>
<p>so, let&#39;s wait and see where the evolution will take us.</p>
<p>thank you, all of you, who asked for the participation.<br>once the situation will become more reasonable (actually - less insane) - i&#39;ll notify everybody.</p>
<p>good luck and good fun! </p>

							<h2 id="since-i-keep-receiving-requests-for-the-dynapp-access-i-39-ve-decided-to-post-this-additional-information-regarding-the-dynapp-technology-and-the-dynapp-project-status-">since i keep receiving requests for the dynapp access, i&#39;ve decided to post this additional information regarding the dynapp technology and the dynapp project status:</h2>
<p>&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;<br>first, i want thank all of you for your interest.<br>&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;<br>&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;</p>
<p>the dynapp way of designing and distributing apps is as powerful and optimal as the internet&#x2F;web itself, no need for more explanations.<br>&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;<br>&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;</p>
<p>unfortunately, based on some negative feedback coming from the titanium community, and also some implications which dynapp might trigger (but, never did for over a year that i use it) from the apple&#39;s side, i&#39;ve decided to withdraw my offer of a public beta (as i&#39;ve stated in my previous post here).<br>&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;<br>&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;</p>
<p>that said:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>i&#39;m using dynapp for all my ios and android apps and projects for over a year, and can not even imagine going back to the &quot;brick&quot;-style distribution;</p>
</li>
<li><p>quality of my apps went trough the roof. reason: nobody see any bugs&#x2F;updates; i collect the trace info using cloudebug service, at the run time, and fix bugs before users realize there is a bug :-));</p>
</li>
<li><p>app becomes a living entity, making customers to come back to it, to see what else has happen since the last login: best suggestions are being implemented in a matter of hours, sometimes;</p>
</li>
<li><p>with commercial customers (this is what my company mostly does: commercial business apps for mobile) - dynapp, as you can, probably, imagine, is priceless: you can demonstrate different solutions&#x2F;aspects as you communicate with the customer, sometimes - as you speak&#x2F;demo; you can deploy apps into production with 0-effort, single-point of maintenance is a king, single code-base is a blessing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>BUT, at this point, dynapp is the hosted environment running on my servers and not open to public.</p>
<p>i might consider some sort of licensing, but still, at least at this time, would run it off of my hosting environment.</p>
<p>it is possible that i may provide full distribution in the future, but not at this point.<br>&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;<br>&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;</p>
<p>sorry for the less than positive news, but, in business, we all do what makes the most sense in most aspects.<br>&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;<br>&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;</p>
<p>all the best with your projects!</p>
<p>code strong!</p>
