			<h1>The correct way to mark an answer as accepted when the solution is in a comment</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Sometimes I find that the answer to a question in this forum is not correct, but a user in a comment for this response, provides the right solution. If I put it as the correct answer will be providing a false solution, but then I can not make a comment as the accepted solution. Any suggestions on how to act in this situation?</p>

							<p>Hi Xabi,</p>
<p>This thing happen in very rare case, but what you can do is you can ask the developer who has provided the correct answer to make a separate answer for it, so that you can mark it as correct answer.</p>
<p>Other option is you can add a comment at last with conclusion that this guy answer is correct one. If you mark answer as accepted it provide help for others, and other can look into your answer as reference.</p>

							<p>Actually you should ask the user of that person to put the answer in the answer area.</p>
<p>there are always some rules which should be taken care of and are suggest in QandA community.If somebody is not following then we should ask them to do that.I have always asked the questions askers to put the comment in comment area and answer in answer.This helps us also in the future to other users</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
