			<p>I thought the answer should be NOTHING. They are just signed differently.</p>
<p>That is apparently NOT the case. Because I have an app that runs FINE when I build to the device. Or debug. Or run in emulator.</p>
<p>But I take that same app with NO CHANGES and deploy it. Take that packaged apk and install it manually…. CRASH.</p>
<p>The crash message is meaningless. It doesn&#39;t tell anything.</p>
<p>But the point is…. runs fine until you deploy. So WHAT is the difference?</p>

							<div><p>It&#39;s apparently something different between 1.6.2 and 1.7.3 because if I change it down to SDK 1.6.2 then it works again. But i need 1.7.3 for the changes with dp vs px measurement.</p>

							<div><p>I already did in another post and no one helped. The error says undefined is not a function… so it&#39;s not picking up something.</p>
<p>But like I said above it works fine with 1.6.2 and it works fine when I debug or build… just not when I go to deploy it.</p>
<p>So that&#39;s the real issue… something is changing between build and deploy and to my understanding it shouldn&#39;t! It just should sign it with the keystore. So whatever.</p>
