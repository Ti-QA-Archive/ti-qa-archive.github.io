			<p>Total noob to this so that&#39;s why i&#39;m asking so stupidly. I also asked a quite similar thing here but nobody answered…</p>
<p>I just want to send a string from the server to the app as a response when i upload a file to the server.</p>
<p>Is this supposed to work like this?</p>
<ol>
<li>I get the response as the whole HTML code page. I see that text in this.responseText or this.responseData. (this is what i actually receive).</li>
<li>I get rid of all the HTML except for the string that i wrote in the &lt;body&gt; myText &lt;&#x2F;body&gt;.</li>
<li>I use that string.</li>
</ol>
<p>This works this way? I&#39;ve been taking a look to this example: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;08&#x2F;handling-remote-data-with-httpclient-and-json.html, but there i can&#39;t see where he gets rid of the HTML code… it looks like the string is directly in this.responseText as i would like ^^</p>
<p>Thanks in advance if anyone can clarify me this.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The question is not really &quot;how do you get rid of the HTML from your own API&quot; and more &quot;why are you sending back HTML from your own API&quot;?</p>
<p>If you are in control of the API (the page you are sending your uploaded file too) then simply send back the response content and DO NOT add in any standard HTML.</p>
<p>Given you example - it looks like you are in control.  Do not forget that the API is ONLY ever expected to be used by the APP or other API consuming services and not any human being that requires any type of visual presentation.</p>

										<p><p>Hi</p>
<p>If you are using a server running ASP then UNLESS your server is forcing HTML into every page automatically (unlikely) then you are in control.</p>
<p>Try this test, create a brand new text file called <strong>testapi.asp</strong> on the root of your website, then add the following code (and ONLY this code).</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">&lt;%
    dim bytSuccess

    <span class="hljs-string">' your upload code will go here eventually

    bytSuccess = 1 '</span> you would use <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-literal">it</span> was successful <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">not</span>
%&gt;
{
    <span class="hljs-string">"success"</span>: &lt;% =bytSuccess %&gt;
}
</code></pre><p>Then access this file as you would any other URL on your website. <strong>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;localaddress&#x2F;testapi.asp</strong></p>
<p>You will notice there is no HTML but you will return a JSON object.</p>
<p>You could return a simple string by changing it slightly.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">&lt;%
    <span class="hljs-keyword">dim</span> bytSuccess

    <span class="hljs-comment">' your upload code will go here eventually</span>

    bytSuccess = <span class="hljs-number">1</span> <span class="hljs-comment">' you would use this if it was successful or not</span>

    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> bytSuccess = <span class="hljs-number">1</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">then</span>
        response.write <span class="hljs-string">"Success!"</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">end</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>
%&gt;
</code></pre><p>Then once you understand no HTML is required paste your existing upload code in the top section (commented).</p>

										<p><p>Worked perfectly. The thing is that i&#39;m using .aspx files. I&#39;m trying things with the &quot;Response&quot; object that seems to manage the response but i clear everything in it and i still get the full HTML code. I&#39;ll try ome more noob thingies anyway… you gave me some ideas (that will end being quite useless, but who knows) Thanks!</p>

										<p><p>You mentioned ASP rather than ASPX so I gave an example for that.  The principle is the same though.  It is likely you are using asp.net web forms and have master pages set up.  You will need to pair back to just simple content.</p>
<p>Not sure what you meant by &quot;…that will end up being quite useless…&quot; I am hoping this was not meant to show a lack of respect to those who offer help.</p>
