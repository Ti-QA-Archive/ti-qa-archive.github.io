			<h1>How to save rotated pictures</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>This one has me puzzled. I am writing an app that lets my users collect field data along with pictures. Pictures can be selected from existing photos in the gallery or by starting the camera from within my app. Since the pictures are large and will later be uploaded to a web service I re-size them, display them on an image view and let the user rotate them as they see fit all before saving the picture. When the user is finished I save the picture to a photo directory created by my app within the app directory and save the photo name to the DB. Files later transferred are smaller as expected.</p>
<p>Problem is I can&#39;t seem to save the rotation of the picture. If the picture was taken in portrait mode it will be saved rotated 90 degrees counter clockwise. Seems to me I am using the 2D matrix and rotate to display it on the image view properly, but I can&#39;t save the actual image that way.</p>
<p>Here is my code where I get a picture from the gallery,  save it to a temp imageView to resize it with max width of 300px with another function, then set my apps imageView to that resized picture.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> galleryImage</span> = event.media; <span class="hljs-comment">//user selects image from gallery</span>

<span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> tempImageView</span> = Titanium.UI.createImageView({
                        image:galleryImage });  <span class="hljs-comment">//create temp imageView for resize</span>

galleryImage = resizeImage(tempImageView,<span class="hljs-number">300</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">//resize image max width 300</span>
galleryImage = tempImageView.toBlob();           <span class="hljs-comment">//convert to blob for imageView        </span>
ivCurrentPicture.image = galleryImage;     <span class="hljs-comment">//show resized picture to user</span>
</code></pre><p>If desired the user can rotate the picture&#x2F;imageView by tapping a button</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var transformCurrentPicture = Titanium.UI.create2DMatrix()<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

...

//button event listener has 2 lines below to rotate picture

transformCurrentPicture = transformCurrentPicture.rotate(90)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
ivCurrentPicture.animate({transform:transformCurrentPicture})<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>Finally when user is finished selecting picture and rotating it I save it.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">//prior to saving I get my path all set up the way I want it.</span>
photoPath = photoDir.nativePath;
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> f = Titanium.Filesystem.getFile(photoPath,photoName);    
f.<span class="hljs-keyword">write</span>(ivCurrentPicture.toBlob()); <span class="hljs-comment">//Note that .toBlob() works fine for saving the resized picture</span>
</code></pre><p>At this point most everything is how I want it. I have a re-sized (smaller picture) saved where I want it. The only problem is it is orientated how the original picture was taken not how the imageView was rotated. Pictures later are transferred up to the web server for viewing a report, but of course the pictures taken in portrait mode are rotated incorrectly.</p>
<p>What am I missing???</p>
<p>Any and all help greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Currently this is on Android but I will need it to work on iOS too.</p>

							<p>David thanks but that did not work. I added a view (containerView), then added that imageView to that view. Tried saving with .toImage, but no file was saved. From earlier work I am pretty sure .toImage only works on iOS not android. The view only has .toImage which does not work on Android while the imageView has both .toImage and .toBlob. toBlob seems to work on Android. Somebody please correct me if I am wrong</p>

										<p><p>Frank, sadly no. I actually have a paid subscription with Appcelerator but not quite sure what I am getting for my $2K+ a year, as I seem to get faster&#x2F;better results with the community. </p>
<p>At any rate I opened a ticket with them and they told me all my problems would be solved by making the move from SDK 1.7 to 1.8 and that saving a rotated image view to a file would work. 1.8 came with all sort of other issues so here I am a couple of months later with my app way behind schedule, rebuilt for the second or third time and still no rotated pictures saved.</p>
<p>Sorry for the long winded rant, but short answer no. If you figure anything out please let me know.</p>
<p>Anyone, anyone???</p>
<p>Best, Rich</p>

							<p>Try modifying your code so that ivCurrentPicture is added to a view (e.g. call it container_view) and then do <code>f.write(container_view.toImage());</code></p>
