			<p>Hey Folks,</p>
<p>I am using multiple xhr clients to fetch images. I Don&#39;t have any idea on how to deallocate xhr objects from memory. I am declaring xhr objects in a loop.<br>Will asigning xhr to null in the end of xhr.onload do the trick? do i also need to remove the event listeners  -&gt; xhr.onload and -&gt;xhr.onerror on each object?<br>using Android 2.3.3 with ti sdk 2.0.1GA2</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>Sounds like a bad idea. Why don&#39;t you just get your application server to generate a single JSON file with pointers to all those images? In this way you can loop over a single xhr client and get everything. (of course this depends on what exactly you are doing).</p>
<p>but roughly speaking, going through a loop of xhr&#39;s … sounds nasty :-)</p>
<p>Just share your code to get a feeling of what you are doing and see how to improve this.</p>

										<p><p>well actually i am receiving a single json file which  has stored links of all the images which i have to load. But if i assign the image link to the &quot;url&quot; property of ImageView in a loop the UI is locked, By locked UI i mean my UI cant receive any click, tap e.t.c events until all the urls of images are loaded!<br>So thats y i am making different xhr requests for each image and in the onload on each xhr object i am creating the respective imageview with image. In this way my app behaves like a threaded app with each thread for each image.</p>

										<p><p>Maybe you can load only the images that you need ? (i.e. if the screen can hold up to 5 images, then load 5, and if one scrolls down, you can load the next 5&#39;s)</p>
<p>The problem with tapping is that it cannot work because the full loading event has not been completed….</p>
