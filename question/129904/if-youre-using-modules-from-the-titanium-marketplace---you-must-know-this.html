			<h1 id="if-you-39-re-using-modules-from-the-titanium-marketplace-you-must-know-this-">If you&#39;re using Modules from the Titanium Marketplace - you MUST know this!</h1>
<p>Titanium just <strong><em>made a breaking change in it&#39;s 1.8.0.1.RC3 SDK release</em></strong>, which has been pushed to all Titanium Studio users and automatically installed, so good chance that your installation is affected. <strong><em><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;12&#x2F;upgrading-android-modules-to-1-8-0-1.html">Here is the link to the details of that change.</a></em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Since Titanium Studio will automatically choose this version of SDK for all newly created apps, developers might be unaware of the reason why some Marketplace modules they are using will do compile anymore!</strong></p>
<p>We, Marketplace vendors, can not communicate to our users about the fact that some of our modules are not compatible with the latest SDK release, because, as insane as it sounds, <strong><em>the whole company left for the 10 days Holiday break after pushing this breakng chage to it&#39;s entire customerbase, and updates which vendors are making to their listings are not being published!!!</em></strong></p>
<p>As a result - we have negative remarks and reviews from angry (and rightfully so) customers:</p>
<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;1260#reviews">see the review for my CloudeKit module posted during this time</a></p>
<p>So, all, please be patient with us, Marketplace vendors, we did nothing wrong!</p>
<p>Hey, Appcelerator, what have you been thinking?!</p>
<p>From the people who created such a brilliant product - we would expect some more evident signs of intelligence…</p>

							<p>I&#39;m sorry to hear that your module update has not yet been processed - I will look into this today.  We are trying to provide as much information as we can to module developers for 1.8 compatibility, starting with that blog post.  What I think we did wrong in this case was not give module vendors enough advance warning about the changes before pushing out 1.8.  I&#39;ll make sure this mistake gets run up the flag pole so it is not made again in the future. We definitely want to make the migration to 1.8 for module developers and users as quick as possible.</p>

										<p><p>Kevin,</p>
<p>As you know, I&#39;m a very active and enthusiastic module publisher. Out of 3 modules featured on the 1st page of Titanium Studio Dashboard - #1 and #2 are my modules. I love your product, I love the Marketplace concept, I love the spirit of your company, and I do understand that you guys are trying to move a mountain, considering the scope and ambition of your goal!</p>
<p>BUT, the product you put out in the area of module development - <strong>is not a production quality product!</strong> Only crazy people like me, who can not sleep at night if an issue is not resolved, would keep trying, and trying, and trying to find a way to make it work. I believe this is the only reason the Marketplace inventory is not growing as fast as it could and should.</p>
<p>I see a definite positive changes in Studio&#39;s support for Module development, in related documentation, in responsiveness of your Help desk techs. But present situation, especially considering this latest release and all the issues triggered by it, is not acceptable, IMHO. </p>
<p>It would be so much better for everybody, if you&#39;d slow down your release frequency a little and take your time to do the necessary QA before dumping it on us and our&#x2F;yours customers. Just look at the history of this last release: you&#39;ve put RC1 out, it had critical bugs, you re-published it as RC2 in a matter of hours, and than, KABOOM!!!, you released RC3 containing breaking changes, in a wake of major holidays, and got all of us &quot;destroyed&quot;!</p>
<p>I hope you will learn from this, I really do!</p>
<p>But, in a mean time, me, and probably many other Marketplace vendors, are getting negative and angry reviews for all our hard work! That hurts, man…</p>
<p>Happy New Year!</p>
