<li>What are the files I need to send him (so he can publish it using xCode-without installing Titanium)?</li>

							<p>1 He needs the IPA and the ability to sign it himself.</p>
<p>2 Easily? no. Ever? I never make a claim that all code is inaccessible, however, your code is encrypted using AES encryption before being packed into the binary.</p>

										<p><p>Let me change that, not the IPA, but an xArchive.</p>
<p>You could submit it for him using his credentials.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sensing a lot of distrust in this relationship.</p>

							<p>FWIW, your JavaScript code is ONLY minified and encrypted when packaged for the App Store or Adhoc distribution. The new Titanium CLI (which does the actual iOS application compiling) will now encrypt by default for device builds too so that you can see the real world performance of your app.</p>
<p>Additionally, only JavaScript files are encrypted. HTML files, text files, images, etc are NOT encrypted. That might change in the future since a lot of people would love that feature.</p>
