							<p>If you don&#39;t want to have to provision with device ids, you&#39;ll need an Apple Enterprise Distribution license .. then you just follow the distribution instructions there.</p>

										<p><p>You can also use something like TestFlight where the users all add their own devices and you just export and build with the exported devices list. Then all users just install from their TestFlight page.</p>

										<p><p>You still need to have their id in your provisioning profile.  Testflight just lets you email a link to install it.</p>

										<p><p>The original answer is correct… You need an Apple Enterprise license</p>

										<p><p>TestFlight also collects the device ids for you. If he was just being lazy, he wouldn&#39;t have to input all the ids like he asked in his question. All he&#39;d have to do is export the list from testflight and provision with that list. So in this case, TestFlight would do a whole lot more than just email a link to let someone install it, it would allow him to NOT have to input every single device id.</p>

										<p><p>As Shannon so eloquently pointed out .. the original answer is the correct one. The second answer was only given because the OP often asks questions where he is simply looking for an easier way to do things.</p>
