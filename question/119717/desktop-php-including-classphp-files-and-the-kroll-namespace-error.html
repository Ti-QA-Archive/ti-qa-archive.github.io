			<h1>Desktop, PHP, Including class.php files and the &#34;Kroll&#34; namespace error</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have run into several issues thus far with Titanium Developer, but glad to say I have pushed through all my issues, and have come a little ways in the program I am developing. Ofcourse, I have run into another issue, and would like to share it &#x2F; curious if anyone has a fix.</p>
<p>I have a class.php file, which includes one of a few other driver.classes.php based on settings used when starting up the new Class(); After reviewing the documentation, http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;doc&#x2F;desktop&#x2F;php, I found that when your &quot;preprocess&quot; php by simply doing an include, you lose access to that php content through the kroll namespace. Resulting in a, &quot;Couldn&#39;t execute function <strong>kroll</strong>namespace__1\functionNameCalled&quot;.</p>
<p>I have found &quot;preprocessed&quot; php ability is great to have, so I feel this error should be here. For some of my smaller classes I have simply copied them into the start of my &lt;script type=&quot;text&#x2F;php&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;script&gt; block, so I would have access to them through Kroll. This worked great, til I ran into another class I am wanted to include, which ultimately has a large series of &quot;includes&quot; for specific other classes, that it is just to much to copy &#x2F; paste into the head of the script block, and then hunt through and change all the includes code to work for me.</p>
<p>So in the end my question come down to, is there any way to include a class.php file, without compromising the kroll__namespace access?</p>
<p>I have tried the other way of including php file, the &lt;script type=&quot;text&#x2F;php&quot; src=&quot;class.php&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;script&gt; as well, but this way still does not provide me access to the functions via Kroll… Even if it did, I would still find myself having to change up alot of &quot;includes&quot; throughout all of the class files anyway..</p>
<p>I have also tried the &quot;Titanium.include()&quot; method within a javascript script block, and also $Titanium-&gt;include() within a php script block. Both give the error, &quot;TypeError: Result of expression &#39;Titanium.include&#39; [undefined] is not a function.&quot;  (which is shown as a function here, http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;desktop&#x2F;latest&#x2F;Titanium-module)</p>

							<p>WOW! Ok, so after I posted this I noticed a few crucial things, that got me thinking. First thing I noticed was &quot;The PHP module for each platform is bundled with PHP 5.3.1&quot; on this page (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;doc&#x2F;desktop&#x2F;php)</p>
<p>With that, I realized, if thats the case, the &quot;kroll<strong>namespace&quot; must be a php style namespace or something, as php 5 has the whole namespacing ability. So if that was the case, I could call my functions without the kroll</strong>namespace, so instead of trying to call &quot;myFunction();&quot;  it would assume to use the kroll namespace, so it would call <strong>kroll</strong>namespace__1\myFunction, and fail. The fix is to simply call &quot;\myFunction();&quot; as that would then try to call the root namespace, not the kroll namespace.</p>
<p>This WORKED, after several hours of me messing with this, this actually worked! So to any one else with this issue… here ya go..</p>
