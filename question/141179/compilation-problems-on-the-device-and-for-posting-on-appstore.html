			<p>Mountain Lion<br>xCode 4.4.1<br>simulator iPhone iOS 5.1<br>Titanium sdk 2.2.1GA<br>Titanium Studio build: 2.1.1.201207271312</p>
<p>My problem is that I can start my app only on the simulator. When I try to start the app on your iOS device, and even when I try to prepare the app to deploy to appstore, I get this error.</p>

							<div><p>At present I am not able to compile for Google play on Android. I take a deep breath and relax, coz&#39; my customer is mainly iPhone focused, but I do have to deploy their app on Android as well. But to think, that right now I would have to tell them that their program is running fine, and I can install it on their phones if we connect it to my machine, but I will not be able to launch on play. </p>
<p>I am sorry I have no real input for your problem, but I am flabbergasted by the carelessness for absolute essentials. Last week i made a syntax error that caused build to fail with a &#39;missing file&#39; error. Took me 2 hrs to realize that a bug in the javascript validator combined with the &#39;uniqueness&#39; of the appcelerator build system could cause such an error: Forget a comma in your source and you get an error about a file missing? After the bughunt, that had me searching in X-Code buildfolders and whatnot (the missing file was even there!) - every 2nd compile would fail on iOS. Every 2nd!. The trick to solve it? Escape a filepath in builder.py … :&#x2F;</p>
<p>But tell me: if you switch workspace folder to a completely new folder (this is often just as good as reinstalling, and often better than reinstalling and using the old workspace) and do a brand new project - do you get the error as well?</p>
<p>Another test: One of your &#39;source-is-ok-but-build-still-fails&#39; projects - clean it, and DELETE THE BUILD FOLDER MANUALLY. Why on earth this should work I don&#39;t know, but it does for another type of error. The error that Ti can&#39;t find this-or-that-view-proxy (take note of this advice, it will happen to you one day when you have fixed this problem, and it&#39;s a nightmare - who would think to delete a folder that has been cleaned in order to fix that Ti can&#39;t find its own objects?)</p>
<p>This last error btw is particularly cunning, because it only raises an error if you run the app on the emulator. If you &#39;ad&#x2F;hoc&#39; compile, the app works, it just simply does not show any views added after the &#39;bad viewtype of the day&#39; has been created. I started out with this new customer - I compiled on emulator: Everything is juuust fine, then I compile for ad-hoc, and without me realizing it - the error arises and I sent them an preview app that simply just showed them their logo :&#x2F;</p>
<p>Anyways, there&#39;s a couple of vague hints for you … wish i could do better …</p>
