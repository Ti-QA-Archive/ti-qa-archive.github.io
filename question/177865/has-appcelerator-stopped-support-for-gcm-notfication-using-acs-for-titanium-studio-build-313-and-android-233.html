			<p>Has appcelerator stopped support for GCM notfication using ACS for Titanium Studio, build: 3.1.3 and Android  2.3.3 </p>
<p>i am trying to bulid an app using ACS and GCM which provides notification using gooogle GCM api.</p>
<p>i have got everything running the GCM and production and development keys all are proper, </p>
<p>i even get the details of 1Android device subscribed in ACS Development console, even the push logs state Send Status    Success for 1 Android device <strong>However I NEVER receive the GCM notification on MY DEVICE</strong> i have no root firewall installed but i disablled it while testing still no success. i am trying data connection and not WIFI moreover i  also tried copying the build app from bin folder and then insatlling it on device still i have failed to receive notification on adnroid device </p>
<p>i had posted a query earlier thinking something was wrong with my settings or code<br>here </p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;177836&#x2F;titanium-acs-shows-1-subscriber-for-android-not-receiving-gcm-notification-on-device</p>
<p>now my question is specific to old verion of titanium sdk and android sdk</p>
<p>1) i am using Titanium Studio, build: 3.1.3 for devlopment<br>2) Android SDK is for  Android  2.3.3<br>3) is there some issue if we test it on an actual device (i have not been able to create an emultor hence i test it directly on device)<br>4) is there any addition requirement for the device (play store is already installed)</p>
<p>5) i am referring to this tutorial<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.titaniumtutorial.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;10&#x2F;acs-push-notification-using-gcm.html (which stated Titnaium SDK  3.1.2 , Ti.cloudpush 2.3.3 I have both installed)</p>
<p>6) is it got something to do with ACS production and Development console as there is no device subscribed on porduction console</p>
<p>please provide proper explanation for the reason</p>

							<div><p>When you are sending a push from the acs console, are you sending it to specific user ID or just to a channel?</p>
<p>If you have successfully registered a device on the development keys you should also be able to do it on the production ones. It is the same setup. My advice is to double check you have them correct.</p>
<p>Not sure if your problem is being caused by the older software, but in my opinion it is always good practice to keep reasonably up to date with software updates. Is there a reason you are targeting that specific android sdk?</p>

							<div><p>well i did solve the issue however its still beyond my understanding<br>1) i did receive the gcm message but when i restarted my phone<br>2) it worked only in wifi connection, not my data connection<br>3) i received my  message 3 days later (when i accidentally restarted my phone not on the same day when i had send my message and had access to wifi)<br>4) just to confirm i resend my message the next day which i received promptly<br>5) is there any requirement to restart the device for either ACS or GCM<br>6) i have not tested on production i just want to know will all my users be subscribed to developer option or will it ever go to production , what is the procedure to do it.</p>
