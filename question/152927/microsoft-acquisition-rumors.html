			<h1>Microsoft acquisition rumors?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m sure this question will get kicked. But… how true are the rumors that Microsoft will acquire Appcelerator?</p>
<p>If Microsoft acquires Appcelerator, I will devote every waking moment to converting all my apps to another framework. Seriously, I will NOT support another application with Microsoft behind it. EVER. Yes, there&#39;s a ton of past pain in that statement.</p>

							<p>Rich, with all the melodrama aside.</p>
<p>This rumor was debunked <strong>months ago</strong>. So rest assured, your apps won&#39;t need to be ported in order to respect your personal convictions.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, the drama was a bit of a joke to get the point across.When you have experienced Microsoft Support Services drop the ball multiple times, to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars, you tend not to trust them anymore.</p>

							<p>Cheers Rich</p>
<p>Because of you Appcelerator has decided not to go ahead with the buy out from Microsoft - they were into it and then read this and have since changed their minds.</p>
<p>Joking apart - as Christian said, this is VERY old but the internet people keep dragging it back up again and again.  Around the same time as this rumour Appcelerator went out for another round of funding - if they were getting bought out this would not have been done.</p>
<p>Probably best to continue creating great apps rather than spending all your future on your plan of heading off future developer though ;-)</p>

<p><em>Nice one Malcolm. :) Ever built an entire business on a platform that got bought out or sacked completely? This is my hesitation with Appcelerator. Think Titanium Desktop. But then again, most developers don&#39;t have to justify the longevity or financial stability of their development business model. Ramblings… cheers.</em></p>
<p>Whilst I understand the logic of your concern, let me try another thought for you - taking not to all that follow MS is not buying Appcelerator.</p>
<p>If you wait all your life looking for something that has a future than can be guaranteed - you will spend all your life doing nothing but waiting.  Same rule applies for buying a new computer, if you wait for the next one - you will never upgrade.</p>
<p>Life is uncertain, life is made up of risks, investigate the possible platforms - settle on one and go with it.  If things change then adapt, change is not always a bad thing either.</p>
<p>I have owned my own business for 20+ years, in the tech industry things move and move fast - once you come to terms with this you can move with the tides.</p>
<p>I assure you my business started long before the internet and used development languages that no longer exist - still in business and still loving it.</p>

										<p><p>Congrats Malcolm. Not many people can say that these days. :) I agree if you&#39;re business is tech consulting or app store apps. I owned my tech consulting company for 10 years, now own a telecom company. Much different when developing an enterprise application. Much more to consider. Appcelerator has been my choice for over 2 years now. Hopefully, they will continue to make good decisions.</p>
