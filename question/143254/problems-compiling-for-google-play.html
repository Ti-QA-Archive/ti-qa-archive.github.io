			<h1>Problems compiling for Google Play</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Android:</p>
<p>I just finished an app and I&#39;d like to submit it to google play.</p>
<p>The app runs fine in emulator and on device, but when I package it for deployment the app breaks.</p>
<p>Some actions causes immediate crashes, others give runtime errors. Strange thing is that even though a file and a linenumber is mentioned, the code shown as the source of the error is not mine.</p>
<p>I am compiling using TiSDK 2.1.1, &#39;cause 2.1.3 is regressing so bad that the app has errors no matter how I build it.</p>
<p>Does anyone experience the same, and does anyone have any tips?</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;m having similar problems with an app i&#39;m converting from ios. I get an &#39;invalid token in object literal&#39; error on a seemingly random line in the code. after doing ti.app.info(&quot;line XXX&quot;) checks. It goes beyond the line the error refers to. My current theory is that it has to do with a https connection. Oh, and the application runs fine once. Then crashes on every start up after, until i clear the local database.</p>

							<p>Hi Esben, cann&#39;t say for sure as information provided is limited and would require a code analysis but did you checked your .js for some special characters as i used to get such errors in Java programs while compiling them in linux.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>

										<p><p>Well to be quite honest, I refuse the notion that anything should be wrong with my source. It&#39;s written in Titanium Studio, uses \n for linebreaks and it works! It works in emulator and when compiled directly to device. It&#39;s only when packaging the problems arise :&#x2F;</p>

										<p><p>Well in that case i would suggest you log an issue in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org">Appcelerator Jira</a>.<br>I tried searching for similar issue there but there is sea of packaging issues and don&#39;t have time to dive in it. </p>
<p>I hope you get your issue resolved there.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you Perminder, however I don&#39;t think I will. I just lost my job because of &#39;failure to deliver&#39; … and I&#39;ve spent way to much time the past 12 months burning my fingers on Ti. </p>
<p>Hopefully it will mature in to a &#39;works as advertised&#39; project one day, but the constant regressions and weird bugs are just too much at this time, and submitting a ticket for a problem that should&#39;ve been caught on release-testing, just to have said ticket ignored, isn&#39;t such a thrilling prospect ….</p>

										<p><p>I am concerned how you feel about your job and its your decision about which tool you use for app development. But at least for the sake of other developers and for good, would suggest to raise a ticket and post on this thread.</p>
<p>At a personal note, Titanium is working a way too good for me and agree that there are issues in every tool but that should not stop us from using it.</p>

										<p><p>Don&#39;t be concerned about my job, I haven&#39;t got it any more :) I should&#39;ve jumped Ti a long time ago, but the prospect of ios&#x2F;android apps written in javascript and sharing codebase was just too tempting, so I went with the wrong decision …</p>
<p>You can see an app I built here:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=dk.miracleas.appchoir.buddyshop (it&#39;s in iOS appstore for approval)</p>
<p>If you select the button called &#39;Miracle Channel&#39; you get an overview over videos. In the iOS version, I simply go with the mobile website they have, but in Ti&#x2F;Android you cannot click a video-link in a webview without crashing the app. You could in TiSDK 1.3, but it does not work in the 2.x series.</p>
<p>So I had to build this custom listing of the videos. This is extra work that I really did not need, and it&#39;s all because of a simple little bug that escapes testing, bug submissions, complaints in this forum etc … for more than a year. Appcelerator does not seem to have time for menial tasks, they are busy conquering the world with investment dollars (which is fine by me, just too bad that they end up neglecting small things like: Does our product actually work?). Today I realized that my custom video-listing doesn&#39;t always show all of the images. It has nothing to do with the code or the images, because it&#39;s various images that won&#39;t work, and it differs from time to time. sigh ….</p>
<p>The client will be calling me and saying: Some of the images does not work?? And I&#39;ll have to do the whole thing again, only with custom HTML in a webview, which I should have done from the beginning - but who would think that the imageview can only load images some of the time? Well … double-stupid on me, my first experience with Ti was that imageviews on android couldn&#39;t show images at all … (BTW - that gives me an idea, I&#39;ll use labels and assign the images as backgroundImages - In titanium labels work better for images than imageviews does - but that requires you to know the dimensions of the image)</p>
<p>Now when I finally lost my job because of instability (first time that ever happened) and failure to deliver, I simply do not have it in me to continue in the Ti eco-system. Sorry …</p>
