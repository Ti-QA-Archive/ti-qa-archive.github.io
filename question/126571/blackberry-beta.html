										<p><p>Yes, because you download the kitchen sink source, not the compiled app.  Thus you need to be able to build the project, and that requires the SDK which in turn requires the subscription.  However, you should be able to use a trial subscription, AFAIK.</p>

										<p><p>See <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;plans-pricing&#x2F;">this</a> page.  I don&#39;t see anything on that landing page now about 30 day trials, but don&#39;t remember for sure where that was listed.  Maybe it was a limited time offer which expired.  I don&#39;t know.  I was already a subscriber before they started offering the trials, so I didn&#39;t pay lots of attention to the terms offered.</p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t use skype.  And it is better to keep discussions in the Q&amp;A where everyone can benefit from them.  For the record, if your questions pertain to the Blackberry beta, I won&#39;t be much benefit other than helping point you toward it.  I have never used it – or even downloaded it.  I just know where to find it.</p>
<p>All of my Blackberry work is done in native Java projects, not Titanium, but they all predate Titanium.  It is easier to leave them as native projects.</p>
