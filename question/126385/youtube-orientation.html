			<h1>YouTube Orientation</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m working on an app that has an embedded YouTube video on each page. the app is designed to work solely in Portrait, however I&#39;d like to have the YouTube video switch to Landscape when the user clicks the play button. Currently it just plays in a heavily letterboxed portrait mode.</p>
<p>Can anybody offer any assistance?</p>
<p>On another matter is it impossible to display&#x2F;play YouTube on Android? I&#39;m using a webview to embed the player, but from my understanding even this wont work on Android?</p>
<p>Many thanks for your help</p>

										<p><p>Not sure whether it is :(</p>
<p>So there&#39;s a tableview that list the pages that contain the embedded videos.  the video all plays fine as expected in landscape, but when the video is finished it boots back out to the tableview and wont let you click any of the rows to access any of the inidividual video pages anymore.</p>
<p>think it&#39;s going to be tough to debug considering it needs to be run on the device to check the video, so not sure where to go now :(</p>
<p>I guess the original problem is still solved, but as always it&#39;s led to a further issue.</p>

										<p><p>Looking at the Console logs in xCode Organiser, it seems as though clicking the row is loading the page (as the log statements associated to the inidividual video pages are displayed) but the view isnt being rendered onscreen - it&#39;s just sticking on the tableview…</p>

							<p>It should work fine if you have the YouTube app installed on Android. Using standard YouTube embed codes is all you should have to do for it to work on iOS and Android.</p>

							<p>Hi Kosso, it&#39;s playing fine the only problem seems to be that because I specify Portrait as the only orientation for the app it&#39;s only playing in a sandboxed portrait view. I was just wandering whether there&#39;s any way to let the YouTube video go outside of this restriction and play in Landscape?</p>
<p>Thanks for the input,</p>

							<p>I&#39;m still struggling with this and hope somebody might be able to provide some more assistance. Just to provide some further info, the page containing the YouTube video is viewed exclusively in Portrait, however when the user clicks the video I&#39;d like the video to switch to landscape - as it&#39;s currently playing in a sandboxed portrait mode.</p>
<p>The Youtube video is embedded in a webview - is there anywhere to detect the video has started playing and switch to landscape?</p>
<p>Any help would be very grateful…</p>

							<p>Hi Kosso - I think that&#39;s the version I&#39;m using, definitely not using iFrames.</p>
<p>I&#39;m presuming it&#39;s because the window that contains the video and everything else on the page is explicitly set to Ti.UI.Portrait as I dont want the user to switch the main page around. I&#39;d just like them to be able to view the video in its intended widescreen format.</p>
<p>Many thanks for all of your assistance on this matter…</p>

										<p><p>OK. I think you might have to do it differently for Android. </p>
<p>Try attaching this to a click event on the video thumbnail. (Which  you should be able to get from the video_id  &#39;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i2.ytimg.com&#x2F;vi&#x2F;&#39;+video_id+&#39;&#x2F;default.jpg&#39;  (or 0.jpg for the bigger one)</p>
<p>First time it should ask if you want to use the Browser or the YouTube app. I just did a test and the orientations changed OK.</p>
<p><code>Titanium.Platform.openURL(&amp;#39;http:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;www.youtube.com&amp;#x2F;watch?v=&amp;#39; + video_id);</code></p>

										<p><p>HmmOK. Well that seems to be in order. </p>
<p>If I were you, I wouldn&#39;t try to force the orientation issue, since really, the YouTube app takes over, which you have no control over. It&#39;s up to the user to change it if they want. </p>
<p>If you&#39;re not getting any orientation switching in the YouTube player while playing any video, then are you sure you don&#39;t have the orientation locked on your device? ;) </p>
<p>Does it work OK for normal videos, direct via the YouTube app?</p>

										<p><p>This is puzzling me. Just checked the YouTube app and that plays movies in landscape fine. Back onto my app, once the user clicks play it switches over to YouTube fine - but still loading in portrait and not even switching when you turn the device around.</p>
<p>I&#39;m just changing one other thing… in Tiapp.xml I&#39;m adding Landscape as an orientation mode - even though the window is explicitly set to Portrait, I&#39;m wandering whether this will change anything?</p>
<p>I do really appreciate your time spent helping me on this issue - it&#39;s driving me slowly insane :)</p>

										<p><p>Also, just noticed somebody posting a similar iossue on iphonesdk forums - obviously they&#39;re using Obj-C - but they suggest not to use the embed code, instead use this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// you have to make sure NOT to use the embed</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// code on the YouTube website, use this instead:</span>
NSString *youTubeVideoHTML = [[NSString alloc] initWithFormat:

     type=\<span class="hljs-string">"application/x-shockwave-flash\"</span> width=\<span class="hljs-string">"237\"</span> height=\<span class="hljs-string">"250\"</span>&gt;
     &lt;/embed&gt;<span class="hljs-string">"];</span>
</code></pre><p>The problem is whenever I try to use the direct &#39;watch&#39; url I end up with the movie title and YouTube icons all at the top of the embedded movie - plus it still didn&#39;t seem to play in landscape anyway :)</p>
