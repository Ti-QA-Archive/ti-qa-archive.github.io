			<p>I really need to release my iPhone app this weekend because it&#39;s featured in magazine.</p>
<p>And I need this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_mobile&#x2F;commit&#x2F;42a8c3893133671e0d98d55ab556ff24966d888f fix to select email-adresses from contacts. I got 1.7.0 using: &quot;git clone git:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_mobile.git&quot; It seems to work fine at first glance, would it be really stupid to use it for production? Or should I build 1.6.1 with these two fixed files?</p>

							<p>As Josh alludes, do you realize it can easily take over a week from the time you submit an application to iTunes Connect for it to get approved and available in the app store?  My last one took 9 1&#x2F;2 days, and a revision to it has been waiting for review for several days now.  If it is a new app, even after it becomes officially available, it can take up to a day for it to appear in app store searches for the application name or keywords, as the searches are applied against cached server databases.  If you have a link to the iTunes application ID you can download immediately once approved, but new applications have to propagate through the various servers before it will show up in search results – even for the application name itself.</p>

										<p><p>yep I know, it&#39;s gonna be close. About app store approval; using a Google api like this: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;ig&#x2F;calculator?json?hl=en&amp;q=1USD=?EUR without any Google API keys could that be a problem? hmm…</p>

										<p><p>Maybe I misinterpreted your original question.  I took you to mean the magazine was coming out this weekend and that is why you needed to release the app now.  But if you meant you needed to release now in order to give Apple time to go through the approval process before the magazine appears, then I hope you have at least 10 days or so before it comes out…</p>
