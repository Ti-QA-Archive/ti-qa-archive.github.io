		<section>
			<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>I&#39;m evaluating Ti for our cross platform app. I&#39;ve tried to research this but have been unsuccessful - would appreciate if someone experienced can shed some light:</p>
<p>The app will show camera feed (NOT the camera app) with an image overlaid. Autofocus should be available. On tapping the screen, the image within the overlay is uploaded to a server. The app has to work on BOTH iOS and Android.</p>
<p>From my research, these are the points I have been able to understand:</p>
<ol>
<li>Android does not support overlaying on the camera view</li>
<li>Uploading is possible through XHR</li>
</ol>
<p>We are a small studio developing this app and the licensing terms are confusing. This app will be create for a client who may or may not charge for it. Will using the Free SDK keep us in the clear?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<ul>
<li>Android does allow overlays on the camera</li>
<li>You can upload media (image, video, audio or any files) using XHR</li>
<li>You can create apps for yourself or your clients which are free or paid apps without paying Appcelerator</li>
</ul>
<p>Appcelerator only charge for extras like; Additional Support, Cloud services (outside the free allotments), custom modules (from the market place), Training and Certification.</p>
<p>You will like the platform - it is fast and flexible and always being updated.  Getting from nothing to app is very fast.</p>

										<p><p>Malcom, thank you for the link and the answer. My query was a little specific - while the camera feed is being shown, the image has to be taken (when screen is tapped) and the image has to be uploaded to the server. Any word on the performance? Or sample app&#x2F;code I can test?</p>
<p>The only reason why I&#39;m querying so much is because we are a small company and don&#39;t want to invest too much time into learning a technology that may not pan out few weeks down the line and we have to come back to square one anyways.</p>

										<p><p>Titanium is a wonderful tool to implement this. You can take photos or get photos from roll. Additionally you can crop&#x2F;cut the photo. The bottleneck is not Titanium. It is the transfer time to server.</p>

										<p><p>I agree with Rainer the bottleneck is the send and also a bit of the Android camera.</p>

<li>On Anfroid you have this limitation if you start the camera. This is also the reason why augmented reality doesn&#39;t work on Android.</li>
<li>You can send the image via every network protocol: http, smtp, ftp, mongoDB …</li>
<li>I am not a lawyer but you can gift or sell  the app.</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>I did not mean augmented reality type overlay. I meant overlay on the phone screen. Sort of like this: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.musicalgeometry.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2011&#x2F;04&#x2F;Screenshot-2009.12.10-18.46.38.png (please ignore the text, couldn&#39;t find a better image to illustrate)</p>
