			<h1>Strange problems since updating OSX and Titanium</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi everyone.  I&#39;ve been having some strange problems since updating to Mountain Lion and the newest version of Titanium a few weeks ago.  After figuring out a couple small iOS problems, I moved on to Android, and I&#39;m stumped.</p>
<p>Previously, when using Snow Leopard and Titanium SDK 2.1.4, all my density specific images were working correctly.  I&#39;ve read many ways to do it, but the way it worked for me was to build the folder structure like this:</p>
<p>Android</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    images

        <span class="hljs-keyword">res</span>-ldpi

        <span class="hljs-keyword">res</span>-mdpi

        <span class="hljs-keyword">res</span>-hdpi

        <span class="hljs-keyword">res</span>-xhdpi
</code></pre><p>In my code, I I didn&#39;t need to use &#39;dp&#39;.  Everything was working as it should, even though everything I had read said to use &#39;dp&#39;.  Here&#39;s an example of some image code:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var view1 = Ti.UI.createView({
    backgroundImage:<span class="hljs-string">'images/image1.jpg'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-variable">width</span>:<span class="hljs-number">174</span>,
    <span class="hljs-variable">height</span>:<span class="hljs-number">130</span>,
    left:<span class="hljs-number">10</span>
});
scrollView.<span class="hljs-built_in">add</span>(view1);
</code></pre><p>In my tiapp.xml file, I added the lines</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">android</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">xmlns:android</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"</span>&gt;</span>
        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">manifest</span>&gt;</span>
            <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">supports-screens</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">android:anyDensity</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"true"</span>/&gt;</span>
        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">manifest</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">android</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>Now, I&#39;m using SDK 3.2.0, and the screen density images aren&#39;t working. Actually, just the images within a scroll view aren&#39;t working.  So I thought screw it, I&#39;ll just build it using SDK 2.1.4.  Now here&#39;s where I&#39;m really confused.</p>
<p>When the SDK is set to 3.2.0, beside &#39;Run&#39; in the top left corner, the name of my device shows up.  I can click run, and although the images aren&#39;t working properly, the app installs to the device.</p>
<p>When the SDK is set to anything other than 3.2.0, the name of my device disappears.  And when I click &#39;Run&#39;, I get this strange error message:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[INFO] logfile = /Users/marc/Documents/Titanium Studio Workspace/SDK <span class="hljs-keyword">Test</span>/build.<span class="hljs-literal">log</span>
[<span class="hljs-keyword">ERROR</span>] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process <span class="hljs-keyword">exit</span> value was 1
</code></pre><p>Does anyone have any idea what&#39;s going on? Either to help me get SDK 2.1.4 working, or to get the image density working in SDK 3.2.0?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Seems you have a number of problems here - answers in no particular order;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Q: Why does the device name disappear when using SDKs lower than 3.2</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Because ONLY Ti SDK 3.2 supports compiling directly to devices.  Anything earlier will not show the options because they were not available.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Q: Should you be using Ti SDK 2.1.4?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>NO - this is very old and you would have to have a very good reason to stick with it.  For whatever minor pain you may have tweaking things for the latest Ti SDK 3.2 (at the time of writing) always stick with the latest stable version for each build (do not jump versions midway through a project unless you have to for a new feature or you have great backups - things can go wrong).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Q: Why are my images failing? (although not a greatly detailed question here of what is going wrong)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I set my <strong>tiapp.xml</strong> to include these options, see if they improve things;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">supports-screens</span>
    <span class="hljs-attribute">android:anyDensity</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"true"</span>
    <span class="hljs-attribute">android:largeScreens</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"true"</span>
    <span class="hljs-attribute">android:normalScreens</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"true"</span>
    <span class="hljs-attribute">android:smallScreens</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"false"</span>
/&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>I also set my <strong>ti.ui.defaultunit</strong> as follows.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">property</span> <span class="hljs-property">name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"ti.ui.defaultunit"</span> type=<span class="hljs-string">"string"</span>&gt;dp&lt;/<span class="hljs-keyword">property</span>&gt;
</code></pre><p>Make sure the android sdk versions are set to reasonable minimums;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">uses-sdk</span>
    <span class="hljs-attribute">android:minSdkVersion</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"10"</span>
    <span class="hljs-attribute">android:targetSdkVersion</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"14"</span>
/&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>These are examples and should be tweaked to match your own needs.  Keep in mind that Android 2.3.3 is no the lowest supported android version.</p>
<p>Make sure ALL of your images include a prefix forward slash so this;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-string">backgroundImage:</span><span class="hljs-string">'images/image1.jpg'</span>,
<span class="hljs-comment">// becomes</span>
<span class="hljs-string">backgroundImage:</span><span class="hljs-string">'/images/image1.jpg'</span>,
</code></pre><p>This helps to normalise the iOS and Android differences.  Your image folders appear fine.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the response.  Admittedly, I&#39;m not very good on the Android side of things.  Well actually, I&#39;m not good with iOS either, but I definitely have a better hold of it. I&#39;ll look into what you suggested, and hopefully get this worked out.</p>
<p>As for compiling directly to devices, from what I&#39;ve gathered, that was the case with iOS, since I always used to have to sync it to iTunes, then install to the device.  But with Android, I always installed directly to the device from Titanium, until now.</p>

										<p><p>Compiling directly to device - you are correct I read it the wrong way round - my mistake.</p>
<p>See how the other changes affect things and then come back to me on the device thing - with any luck it will snap into place.  Just make sure that the device is correctly plugged in (maybe disconnect and reconnect) and confirm this device is enabled for on device testing.</p>

										<p><p>I tried what you suggested, but it didn&#39;t make a difference.</p>
<p>I know you said I shouldn&#39;t go back to using 2.1.4, and I understand your reasons for saying that, but although this is a new project, it&#39;s based off an older one, and it all worked perfectly using 2.1.4.  At the very least, I&#39;d like to test building it with 2.1.4 and see if it works that way, but like I said before, I can&#39;t install any project to a device unless I&#39;m using 3.2.0.  If I set the Titanium SDK to anything other than 3.2.0 and try to run on a device I get this error message:</p>

										<p><p>This appears to be an issue with the Android SDK not being installed correctly.  Make sure you have downloaded EVERY single Android SDK and any associated tools if requested.</p>
<p>From the latest studio - select the Dashboard tab and then select &quot;getting started&quot; - down to Android and then choose &quot;update…&quot; after pressing the adroid sdk.  from here you should see a tick list of all SDKs - select them all and prepare to wait - it can take some time.</p>
<p>If you are using an older SDK or you are still having issue - go to the mac spotlight search and then type android - select the one with a black&#x2F;grey terminal style icon.  Wait for it to appear and then toggle everything you can - you may need to do this in more than one pass.  No need to go back any further than Android 2.2.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, Malcolm.  I&#39;m running the updates now.  I&#39;ll be leaving work soon, so I probably won&#39;t have a chance to see if it worked today, but that&#39;ll be the first thing I do in the morning.</p>
<p>The thing is though, from what I can gather, it&#39;s not the Android SDK that&#39;s giving me the problem, it&#39;s the Titanium SDK.</p>

										<p><p>Having reviewed a number of other issues with this final error message the consensus is that the SDK or lack of correctly configured SDKs is usually the culprit - so best to rule it out.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the tip Malcolm.</p>
<p>I figured out that when I updated Titanium, it came with its own copy of the Android SDK manager. So I opened that through terminal, and installed every package available. Now I&#39;m getting a different error.</p>
<p>[ERROR] Error generating R.java from manifest</p>
<p>I figured out the new problem, and everything seems to be working as it should again. I don&#39;t know why this would make a difference, but my app id was com.imageone.AndroidSDKTest. After doing some reading on the R.java error, I tried making it com.imageone.androidSDKTest. For some reason, the one letter being the wrong case was causing all these errors. Why? I have no idea. It wasn&#39;t a problem before. Oh well. Problem solved.</p>

							<p>Ok, I figured out the new problem, and everything seems to be working as it should again.  I don&#39;t know why this would make a difference, but my app id was com.imageone.AndroidSDKTest.  After doing some reading on the R.java error, I tried making it com.imageone.androidSDKTest.  For some reason, the one letter being the wrong case was causing all these errors.  Why? I have no idea.  It wasn&#39;t a problem before.  Oh well.  Problem solved.</p>

										<p><p>I have only just spotted these (was AFK) but great news, I would just say;</p>
<ul>
<li>You mentioned the comments section was becoming full - that is the point of it - if they do not go in the same thread then over time and especially if voting up and down occurs - it is not possible to work out in what order anything came.</li>
<li>Because you have added your own answer for this - which is cool - it means you cannot mark this question as answered as you cannot mark your own answers as the accepted one.  You might want to copy your final words as a comment to the original answer - obviously pointing out that you have resolved and why.  This way you can mark the question as answered.  It will turn green and those searching for a answer with the same problem an then find an &quot;answered&quot; question.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately this is how it has to be done as the system will not allow anything else - not ideal but the best solution for the greater community if they have the same issue.</p>
