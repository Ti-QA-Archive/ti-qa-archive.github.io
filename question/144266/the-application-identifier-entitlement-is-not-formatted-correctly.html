			<h1>The application-identifier entitlement is not formatted correctly</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Titanium SDK: 2.1.3<br>Platform &amp; version: iOS 6.0</p>
<p>When I distribute the apps in the step to valide the application in xcode. I get this errors:</p>
<p>This bundle is invalid. The application-identifier entitlement is not formatted correctly; it should contain your 10-character App ID Seed, followed by a dot, followed by your bundle identifier: com.companyname.appname (-19053) </p>
<p>And I google it. I found that I have to make sure the entitlement plist with the xxxxx.com.xxxx.appname. and yes all is there. but just cant passe the validation.</p>
<p>any one can help me? thank you so much</p>

							<div><p>ok something to try:</p>
<p>In xCode organizer, remove the profile in question, agree to remove from drive (export your dev prof if worried first)</p>
<p>Use the refresh icon lower right to pull down your certs and profiles (should be prompted to login to apple dev)</p>
<p>Then in Tistudio, clean the project, then try to push to iTunes again (will have to locate the profile again from the drop down most likely)</p>
<p>As an side, when was the last time you successfully pushed a build to apple?</p>

							<div><p>Hello Stephen, I try the tips you mention above, but unlucky I still get the same errors. So I decide to generate a new Distribution Provision with Xcode: iOS Wildcard AppID. and then change the application id in TI studio with just the application name (Application ID : appname), also I change the Bundle ID with the same name as the Application ID in iTunes connect. then I rebuild the application push to iTunes and guess what it pass the validation and I submit successfully. I dont know if Im dont the right way. but any way just for now, it works. I will keep you post if my apps cant pass the apple&#39;s reviewed.</p>
<p>Thank you so much</p>

							<p>We are getting the same error message when trying to submit a new version of an app that was successfully submitted in June to the app store.</p>
<p><code>This bundle is invalid. The application-identifier entitlement is not formatted correctly; it should contain your 10-character App ID Seed, followed by a dot, followed by your bundle identifier: xxxxxxxxxx.edu.umich.*</code></p>
<p>We are using a wild card ID and this time we are trying to submit using the &quot;Publish&quot; option built into the Titanium Studio eclipse app.</p>
<p>All submissions for apps from the University must be made through one office and so the entire project must be copied to a particular machine and built on it and then submitted from that machine. The challenge is that regular native xcode apps developed using Objective C are able to be submitted without getting this itunesconnect error message after uploading the binary - it appears that however Titanium Studio interacts with xcode to build the app is producing an xcode project that when built does not create an acceptable projec&#x2F;binary that will be accepted by itunesconnect.</p>
<p>Has anyone else experienced this issue recently?  </p>
<p>Any ideas what to try to fix this - I have read of two possible fixes:</p>
<ol>
<li>create an entitlements.plist file</li>
<li>use a unique provisioning profile, not a wild-card ID</li>
</ol>

										<p><p>No I have not tried the two ideas yet - as I need to go to a separate office in the University to submit the app, I want to be able to have as much information as possible before going there.<br>I would like to hear whether anyone has experienced this issue recently and what fix if any they came up with.</p>
<p>it is frustrating that other native ios app xcode projects build correctly and can be submitted without an issue and the binary uploaded from an appcelerator project  is not valid because of this &quot;Invalid bundle&quot; issue (see full error message in my post above)</p>
