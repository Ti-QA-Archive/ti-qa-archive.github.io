			<h1>Can&#39;t change Android emulator after 3.2.0/Studio update</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>After holding my breath and updating (and getting the relatively radical Studio changes), I can&#39;t seem to change the emulator type&#x2F;parameters for Android.  No matter what I do, I get an HVGA resolution emulator with (seemingly) a random API level.</p>
<p>Tried setting the default emulator in Preferences.  Nope.  Tried setting the emulator in Run Configuration.  Nope.  Tried deleting all AVDs and starting from scratch.  Nope.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been spending the whole damned afternoon doing the typical Post-Update Titanium Shuffle just trying to get things back remotely near working again, but this one is a particular irritation.</p>

							<div><p>I am experiencing the same issue.   It doesn&#39;t matter what AVD I select it always starts an HVGA version.   This is just since updating to 3.2 prior to that my custom AVDs were fine.</p>

							<p>With Titanium SDK 3.2, you can create and use your own Android Emulator. It doesn&#39;t have to be named anything special. You may need to reset Titanium Studio for it to show up, but you should be able to select your custom AVD from the list.</p>
<p>To see the list of AVDs, you first must select the project you want to build in the &quot;Project Explorer&quot;, then from the toolbar, make sure &quot;Run&quot; is selected from the first drop down menu, then under the second drop down menu should be &quot;Android Emulator&quot; that has a submenu of your AVDs. Are you able to see your AVD?</p>

										<p><p>Right: but when I select my own AVD, the emulator launches with a new AVD named something like titanium-2-HVGA.</p>

										<p><p>Although now that I&#39;m looking at it today again, having restarted Studio, my entries under &quot;Android Emulator&quot; are gone, i.e., there is no submenu of my AVDs.  Have to figure out where that&#39;s gone, now, before I can start looking at this again.</p>

							<p>Ah, okay, the disappearance of my AVD list was because I had to downgrade to 3.1.4 because TextArea is broken in 3.2.0.  So I lost AVD customization.  If 3.2.1 fixes TextArea I&#39;ll be taking another look at this.</p>

										<p><p>(But all the same, didn&#39;t one used to be able to launch at least different screen sizes in the emulator, to test tablet layout, etc.?  That seems to be gone for pre-3.2.)</p>
