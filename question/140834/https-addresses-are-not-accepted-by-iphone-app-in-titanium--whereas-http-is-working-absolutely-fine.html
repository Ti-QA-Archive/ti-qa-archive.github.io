							<div><p>Hi Anuj</p>
<p>I am not aware of any restrictions that would mean <strong>https</strong> urls are inaccessible.</p>
<p>In order to let people help you - can you please post an example <strong>https</strong> URL that we can try it out - as without it, there really is nothing we can do.</p>
<p>Also please check the URL works by pasting it into a browser first - and let us know if that worked or failed at the same time as providing the URL here.</p>

							<div><p>Malcolm, one more question..!!<br>Actually i&#39;m creating a test app, where i have a table view in a window with url&#39;s on it ( both http:&#x2F;&#x2F; and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;), as entered by the user of the app. </p>
<p>These urls &#39;d be opened up in a webView when user clicks on them. </p>
<p>Now, i want to know, with https:&#x2F;&#x2F; url&#39;s like : &quot;our own gmail account inbox&#39;s webpage url&quot;, how do we get the user to be redirected to his gmail account&#39;s inbox.</p>
<p> I&#39;m not getting how to use the username&#x2F;email and password of the user in the app itself,<br>such that at the tym of entering the url in the app, is there any option that user can enter his username and password and access the url to his inbox directly from the app..!!</p>
<p>Thanks for the help in advance…  :)</p>

							<p>OK  That was a bit complicated - but I think I have your general question.</p>
<p>You want to know IF you can ask the user for the security details (email, username, password) within the scope of the app and then open a web view sometime later (or straight away) and show the service already logged in as you have provided the login credentials at the same time as the URL.  If this is wrong let me know.</p>
<p>If it is right, then;</p>
<p>In most cases no - not with a website, part of this reason is that the site uses SSL encryption and other techniques so the password is NOT sent in plain text and in order for you to pass it that is how you would have to send it.</p>
<p>There are currently no additional properties on the webview to allow you to add the extra information -allow you can use this technique which will work with <em>some</em> websites, but not many of the ones you are likely to want to use this for.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-string">http:</span><span class="hljs-comment">//user:pass@secure.site.com</span>
</code></pre><p>This would be a website <code>secure.site.com</code>, username <code>user</code> and password <code>pass</code>.  As I say this is rarely the technique used though.</p>
<p>You can also call the web page view HTTPClient but you will then not be suitable to show the user in this scenario.</p>
<p>With all the main players moving to oauth or similiar solutions - you never actually get to use or interact with the credentials as they are kept from you (the programmer) for good security reasons (not you specifically of course).</p>
<p>Hope this gives you a better insight.</p>
