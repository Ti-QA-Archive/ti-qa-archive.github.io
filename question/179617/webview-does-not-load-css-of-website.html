			<h1>Webview does not load CSS of website</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve been building a css file for a webpage that&#39;s being loaded in by a webview in my app. I&#39;m using Chrome&#39;s &#39;device mode&#39; to view the webpage and how the CSS changes the layout when it&#39;s being viewed by an other device. In the device mode everything looks fine and at a certain point it also did in my webview. But I made one little change that apparently broke the css on my dev phone, removed (or is not able to find them) some images on my personal phone and my old back-up phone works perfectly.</p>
<p>So I have 4 devices and 3 different results! Clearing the apps cache did not help and reinstalling did not either. Does it matter that I load WordPress pages instead of static pages, because it worked fine until one small change. I dont think that WordPress has some update delay for mobile devices, my desktop responds automatically to the changes. Does titanium has some sort of uber caching system?</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;ve run some additional tests and for some reason the webview ignores the media queries for different screen sizes, though they work when opening the link on my phone&#39;s browser… So there must be something wrong in my app, right?</p>

							<p>It apparently was some sort of caching issue. I haven&#39;t figured out what the exact problem was, but it is resolved.</p>
