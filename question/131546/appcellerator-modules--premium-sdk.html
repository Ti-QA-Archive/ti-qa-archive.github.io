		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>can someone explain a couple of things about appcelerator modules and api&#39;s please:</p>
<p>1) what is included in the different mobile apis that come with the various appcelerator subscriptions? Depending on your subscription you can have either basic, premium or enterprise API&#39;s</p>
<p>2) When you buy appcelerator modules ( like the barcode scanner module ) the price apears to be $19.99 per month. Is this correct? If so is it for the development time of the app or is it payable for the entire life of the app once it is deployed?</p>
<p>Any help much appreciated</p>
<p>Bill</p>

<li>You don&#39;t get a different APIs. The difference is in the level of support and modules.<br>That means that the free edition will get you no module at all -  you will have to buy them from market place.<br>We are talking here about Appcelerator made modules. The modules done by 3rd parties you will pay it anyway.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>It means you can use it for a month to develop your app. Once the app is released in the wild you can cease the subscription. The only problem comes when you need to make an update - you will have to subscribe again.</li>
</ol>

										<p><p>Yep, pro accounts have disappeared only free, indie &amp; enterprise. I was asking an I&#39;m confused too Dan.  I used to have a Indie account &amp; it mentioned &#39;Titanium+ modules&#39; when I paid&#x2F;signed up &amp; its still on the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;plans-pricing&#x2F;">subscription</a> page stating:</p>
<p><em>Titanium+Plus Starter Modules includes 18 modules for rapid addition of commerce, communication, gaming, in-app advertising and utility functionality to apps. Popular modules integrate Paypal purchasing, barcode scanning, chart rendering and Urban Airship notifications. Premium modules include Omniture and Brightcove.</em></p>
<p>… I&#39;ve just re-read your answer, so you only have access to use the Appcelerator Titanium+ modules during development then you have to pay for them?  Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>Sharry, as Titan and Pro you should be able to have access to the starter pack and be able to use them  with no restrictions (develop and release apps). If it&#39;s not so maybe you should ask the Appc guys in a HD ticket.</p>
<p>When I said &quot;you will pay them anyway&quot; I was talking about the 3rd parties module in the marketplace, not the ones provided by Appc.</p>
<p>Makes more sense?</p>
<p>I&#39;m not an Appcelerator employee so this is only what I know and not an official reply :)</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Dan, I thought about this for a while now but I was too lazy to contact AppC &amp; kept forgetting about it until now.  Cheers.</p>
