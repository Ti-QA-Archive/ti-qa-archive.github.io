		</header>
		<section>
			<p>As of now, Android performance is still a bit shoddy in Titanium, so I thought I&#39;d share the results of developing a complicated app over the last several months.</p>
<ul>
<li>show() and hide() are slow, and add() and remove() are slower. open() and close() are even slower, although that shouldn&#39;t be a problem for most people. When designing your code, try to favor the fastest way to manipulate your views. If you write your app properly, it&#39;s easy to use only one window (and it&#39;s very important for performance that you only have one context in your app–app.js).</li>
<li>Going along with tip 1: if you can spare the memory, you can move views off-screen instead of hiding or removing them. Re-positioning a view that has already been rendered is much faster.</li>
<li>Re-use views whenever possible. I have a list of buttons on one side of my app that change what is displayed on other other side (i.e. a list pane and a details pane). Instead of deleting&#x2F;destroying a detail view when I&#39;m done with it and having it completely re-build a new view from scratch, I have just two that are pre-built when the app loads. When I need to change the details, I edit the children of the invisible (off-screen) details view and then animate it into place on top of the old one. That way your users won&#39;t see anything changing until your code has time to finish changing all the children. (Note that both views might need to have a background, depending on how you implement this).</li>
<li>Loading pictures is slow, even from flash memory on a device. There&#39;s nothing you can do about it, and it will most likely be the bottleneck for a lot of your performance issues. You can minimize the time cost by checking to see if pictures exist on the file system when your app loads, as opposed to doing it the &quot;lazy&quot; way (i.e. right before you load them into an ImageView). You might think that pre-loading the images into memory in some way (putting them into a Ti.Filesystem.File or perhaps ImageView) will make things faster, but it doesn&#39;t. For some reason, the app still seems to re-process the image file every time it appears on the screen.</li>
<li>Changing some of the default settings in the TiApp.xml file (e.g. setting analytics to false) can cause your app to instantly crash when you put it onto a device. The same goes for some of the window properties and other generic settings in TiApp.xml. Proceed cautiously by changing one setting at a time and seeing if it affects anything.</li>
<li>TableViews seem to be pretty buggy. It&#39;s easy to replicate the functionality using a ScrollView and adding children dynamically. I never got very far with TableView so I can&#39;t compare, but ScrollView performs flawlessly (no choppiness even with a ton of rows). You have to write your own sort&#x2F;filter methods, but this can be a plus if you know how to optimize these based on the data you&#39;re using.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;d be interested to hear anyone else&#39;s tips.</p>
