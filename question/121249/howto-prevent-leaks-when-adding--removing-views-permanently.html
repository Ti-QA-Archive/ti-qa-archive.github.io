			<h1>Howto prevent leaks when adding / removing views permanently</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,<br>in my current app i permanently add and remove views to a window. Unfortunately this produces memory leaks in XCode &#x2F; instruments.</p>
<p>The concept is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 main window</li>
<li>this window has a &quot;current_view&quot; and a &quot;last_view&quot; variable &#x2F; property</li>
<li>as soon as the user clicks, the &quot;last_view&quot; is animated out of screen and the new created &quot;current_view&quot; is animated into the screen from the right</li>
<li>the &quot;last_view&quot; is then removed and nullified</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem: I get constant memory leaks if I test this basic app with XCode &#x2F; Instruments in simulator and on device. If I don&#39;t add any image views to the views, no memory leaks occur.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a basic code demonstrating the problem:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pastie.org&#x2F;2085035">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pastie.org&#x2F;2085035</a></p>
<p>The probably most important functions are </p>
<ul>
<li>container.nextView</li>
<li>container.removeLastView</li>
</ul>
<p>in test.js</p>
<p>I also tried out removing every child (by looping through view.children) from the last_view before nullifying it, but that doesn&#39;t solve the problem.</p>
<p>Can you guys help me out what I&#39;m doing wrong? </p>
<p>Is the concept of having a &quot;current_view&quot; and &quot;last_view&quot; variable the wrong way of handling such a task?</p>

							<p>This solution provided for a similar issue might help. It uses a window to throw stuff you don&#39;t need in, which then has it&#39;s garbage correctly collected.</p>

							<p>Kosso, you made my night ;)<br>I already knew and used that solution in the past but didn&#39;t think it would be necessary with 1.7.0. With views containing images this works fine!</p>
<p>The funny thing is: there are still too much objects allocated when running the app in XCode &#x2F; instruments (Allocations). Even though the &quot;last_view&quot; was already removed and only 1 view is contained in the window, there are always 2 or 3 TiUIView objects allocated - but the memory leaks don&#39;t occur! </p>
<p>Now I&#39;ll have to find a solution for using this method with views containing video_players (cause the video players sometimes automatically restart playback after being added to the pool-window), but that&#39;s another story. Thanks Kosso!</p>

										<p><p>No worries ;)</p>
<p>Btw: I&#39;m getting that issue with video players too. Despite nullification and release and whatnot, they still seem to remember a bit of the last thing played when I try to use them again - even in a new window which had previously been closed.</p>

										<p><p>Hey Kosso, maybe this could useful for you. This is how I remove videos from the parent view before putting the view into the memory pool window:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">video_player.stop()<span class="hljs-comment">;    </span>
video_player.release()<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
video_player = null<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>In one of my previous apps I additionally fired the &quot;complete&quot; event on the video before removing it finally. But with the above code and 1.7.0 I don&#39;t get any &quot;video plays back again though it&#39;s already been removed&quot; problems.<br>I always create a fresh video player instance when adding a video to the view.</p>

										<p><p>Hi,<br>Yeah. I kind of do that anyway. In fact, my video player (and other things) all get &#39;nullified&#39; as the window closes. Also, since everything is actually in a window which gets closed, it should all get garbage collected anyway. (as the pool method does).  When someone views a new &#39;post&#39; (which might be a video post) the view etc get recreated as required - from scratch.</p>

										<p><p>One more thing about video players….the first time I add a video player object to a view, I get a memory leak in XCode &#x2F; instruments. After that I can remove &#x2F; add new video player instances as much as I want without any leak occuring. Do you experience a similar behaviour?</p>
