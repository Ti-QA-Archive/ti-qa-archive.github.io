			<h1>Best way to display more then 20 k table view rows in the table view.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Application Type : Mobile (iOS and android)<br>Titanium SDK : 3.0</p>
<p>We are getting performance issue on loading 20,000 table view rows in the table. Its taking too much time to display the table view rows in the table.</p>
<p>I have created the custom row which have title and its detail text of one line. Here is my code of row.</p>
<p>&lt;Alloy&gt;<br>&lt;TableViewRow id=&quot;row&quot; className=&quot;Custom&quot;&gt;<br>&lt;Label id=&quot;title&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;Label&gt;<br>&lt;Label id=&quot;desc&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;Label&gt;<br>&lt;&#x2F;TableViewRow&gt;<br>&lt;&#x2F;Alloy&gt;    </p>
<p>Its taking around 25 seconds to display these rows in the table.<br>We don&#39;t want the load more feature. We want to display all data in one go.</p>
<p>Any solution to improve performance ?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance !!</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The biggest performance improvement you can achieve is to stop showing 20,000 table rows on a single table.</p>
<p>There is reason to ever do this - ever.  Do you believe your user is going to read every single row?  I can only guess that you are doing this to run the search filter.  There are SO many better ways to filter results, provide listings.</p>
<p>I am sorry but this is just not smart; memory issues, performance issues, usability issues.</p>
<p>If you want to explain why you believe display 20,000 rows all at the same time is required, I will be happy to walk you through some alternatives.</p>
<p>If you have a solid reason for 20,000 rows I would love to hear it, but right now I simply cannot think of a single reasonable answer that could not and should not be done a different way.</p>

							<p>hi, </p>
<p>You can use className property of tableview row, this will do lazy loading of table view, means it will reuse the previous row, and this in turn will increase the performance of tableview.<br>There is a built in caching method you can invoke by using the property className when you define a row. This tells the OS that it can re-use this row style and just swap data. You should use this on all rows that you add any views to. Also if you have more than one style of presenting the row then have more than one className in the table.</p>
<p>Example</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in">var</span> row = Ti<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>UI<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>createTableViewRow({
<span class="hljs-attribute">...</span>
    className: <span class="hljs-string">'standard'</span>,
<span class="hljs-attribute">...</span>
});
</code></pre>

										<p><p>One more thing which you can do is on swipe event of table view you can create more rows. there are no other option other then this , because 20 k rows are very large in terms of memory.</p>

										<p><p>I have already used the class name property in table view row. But still getting big delay in creating the rows.<br>And the big problem is we don&#39;t have to add load more feature. We have to load alll record in one go.</p>
