										<p><p>One more question</p>
<p>What happens to the apps that are on the phones, will they still work? Or does the user gets a message its unavailible?</p>

										<p><p>Of course the apps the user&#39;s downloaded still work. The app only disappears from the AppStore, so the old user&#39;s can&#39;t get updates and new users can&#39;t download your app.</p>

										<p><p>Ad hoc profiles all have an expiration date.  You can see the expiration date of any installed profile using Settings &gt; Profiles.  The above comments refer to things from the App Store, not ad hoc installs.</p>

										<p><p>Sorry, did not see this.  AFAIK, yes, the app will no longer run when the profile expires.  That is the purpose of the expiration date.  To make it continue to run, you only need to send them a new provisioning profile though, and not the full app.</p>
<p>Or recompile the app with the profile included.</p>
<p>Note that this is entirely Apple&#39;s doing; it has nothing to do with Appcelerator restrictions.</p>

										<p><p>Rereading the thread, I see the concern is what happens if you do not renew an Apple annual license.  In that case, you would be unable to create a new provisioning profile, leading to devices no longer been able to run the ad hoc app after the profiles expire.</p>
<p>Apple&#39;s view of this is ad hoc is intended for limited testing prior to release through the App Store.  They don&#39;t WANT you distributing by other means, so put in the expiration.</p>
<p>For those cases where you are doing a proprietary app for a company who does not want it in the App Store, there is also the Apple Enterprise Distribution License.  Unlike ad hoc, enterprise profiles do NOT require inclusion of the authorized device UDID values, and can be installed on an unlimited number of devices.</p>
<p>However, there is still a provisioning profile and it has an expiration date.  I am not sure if the expiration date is one year from when the profile is created, or one year from when the company obtains the Enterprise license, which must be renewed annually.</p>
<p>Note that the company must apply to Apple for the license, and not an outside developer.  The good news is Apple lifted the 500 (or was it 1000?) employee minimum company size to apply, though the company still must have a D&amp;B number and pay a $299 annual fee.</p>
<p>However, for corporate installs this is WAY simpler distribution than needing to collect UDIDs and be limited to 100 devices.  I use it with one of my clients where we do not want the app in the store as it is proprietary.</p>

										<p><p>Tnx doug,</p>
<p>This Question did not have anything to do with appcelerator, since im always on the Q&amp;A here sum1 had to know something =)</p>
<p>We here use adhoc distribution since we are a small company with &lt; 20 employees. The enterprise distribution is a little bit of an overkill for us at least.</p>
<p>Much appreciate your info, i will notify the higher ups on this.</p>
<p>I really get the feeling that Apple hates programmers sometimes</p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t think it is so much they hate programmers, as they love control.  And using provisioning profiles (whether ad hoc or enterprise) with expiration dates keeps them in control of the distribution channel.  That is also why they hate jail breaking â they lose control.</p>

										<p><p>True that they want control, but that is something that will bite them in the ass at some point. In which Google or MS will run away with their customers.</p>
