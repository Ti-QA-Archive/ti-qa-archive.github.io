			<h1>Problem with Improper advertising identifier [IDFA] usage</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Is there anyone having problems with  Improper advertising identifier [IDFA] usage recently? I&#39;m trying to upload a binary to the App Store and I&#39;m getting this error (  Improper advertising identifier [IDFA] usage ), but the code for this binary is pretty much the same as one other app I already have in the store and never caused the error.</p>
<p>So I&#39;m not sure if this is something Apple just started to look for in apps, or if something was changed on titanium SDK 3.2.2… </p>
<p>Does anyone have any idea on what to do here?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot.<br>Eric</p>

							<p>As part of the Apple review process when submitting an application, you will be asked if your app uses the Advertising Identifier (IDFA). Please check &quot;<strong>Yes</strong>&quot;. You will then be asked how your app makes use of it. The question will take this form:</p>
<p>###This app uses the Advertising Identifier to (select all that apply)?</p>
<p>####- ?  Serve advertisements within the app <em>(depends if you do serve ads)</em></p>
<p>####- ? Attribute this app installation to a previously served advertisement</p>
<p>####- ? Attribute an action taken within this app to a previously served advertisement</p>
<p><strong>Select the second and third options.</strong></p>
<p>You will also be asked to check a box to confirm that your app honors a user&#39;s Limit Ad Tracking setting in iOS. The Facebook SDK honors the iOS Limited Ad Tracking Setting. When a person enables Limited Ad Tracking, Facebook only uses data obtained through the use of the Advertising Identifier for &quot;Limited Advertising Purposes&quot; as defined by the iOS Developer Program License Agreement. Please make sure to check this box when prompted.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Rajveer,<br>Thanks for the update. I&#39;ve managed to upload the app to the store at this point, I&#39;m still using the Facebook module… I&#39;ve removed the Test flight and Scandisk barcode modules I was using and all worked fine.<br>I&#39;m wondering now why the Facebook one didn&#39;t work for you and did to me. Are you using the native Titanium FB module or a third party?</p>

										<p><p>Hi Rajveer,</p>
<p>I&#39;m using SDK 3.2.2, the TestFlight and Scandisk were external 3rd party modules.<br>The FB module I&#39;m using is the one built in with TI ( http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Modules.Facebook ).</p>
<p>What I did when having the problem was to remove all modules and start adding one by one and trying to validate the app through Xcode, until I find the problematic one. </p>
<p>Both modules that were causing the problem were not been used, they were just there on the Modules folder… so if you have any modules that you are not using I suggest you remove from your project.</p>

										<p><p>I am using application loader for submit application. so applicaiton gets uploded but later it will rejected again by error like this: </p>
<p>Improper Advertising Identifier [IDFA] Usage. Your app contains the Advertising Identifier [IDFA] API but you have not indicated its usage on the Prepare for Upload page in iTunes Connect.</p>
<p>Once these issues have been corrected, go to the Version Details page and click &quot;Ready to Upload Binary.&quot; Continue through the submission process until the app status is &quot;Waiting for Upload.&quot; You can then deliver the corrected binary.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Mikhail, </p>
<p>Could you give me any direction on how to use the fix from the link you suggested, I&#39;m really stuck on how to use it, I tried to download the updated version of the FB module from there, but when I add to the modules folder, Ti won&#39;t compile… I&#39;d appreciate any help on this if you can.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Sergio,<br>What you can do is go to the Git link posted above and  download the files, you&#39;ll see a zip file called facebook-iphone-3.1.2.zip.</p>
<p>Just unzip that file and copy the folder 3.1.2 to your Titanium Modules folder.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve replaced the 3.1.1 with the unzipded 3.1.2, after that just test if all your facebook stuff is still working, re-compile the app to iTunes store and upload again.</p>
<p>That solved the problem to me.</p>

							<p>Since this hasn&#39;t been commented on in 6 months, I assume you guys have everything sorted. But for anyone coming across this experiencing the same problem, the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Modules.Facebook">Titanium docs tell you what to do</a></p>
<p>Under the &quot;Submitting an iOS Application to the iTunes Store&quot; section, it says to choose &quot;Yes&quot; for whether or not your app uses Advertising Identifier, and then select the second and third options for what it uses it for.</p>
