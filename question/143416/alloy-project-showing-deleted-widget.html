			<h1>Alloy project showing deleted widget</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,<br> I created a new alloy project following &quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;projects.appcelerator.com&#x2F;alloy&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Alloy-bootstrap&#x2F;index.html&quot; link. I was able to run it. Then i deleted this widget from my &quot;app&quot; folder, cleaned the project and did a build again. I can still see the widget in my app when i run iteven though its not there in the app folder. I do not see it in my app folder but its there in the resources folder. Do i need to manually delete widget from both app and resources folder?</p>
<p>Thanks<br>Amit</p>

							<p>Alloy is probably pulling it in automatically based on your dependencies in your <code>app&amp;#x2F;config.json</code> file. Delete the widget in there as well and you should be rid of it.</p>

										<p><p>OK, if you look at that log, you&#39;ll see these 2 important lines:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[WARN] <span class="hljs-string">"android"</span> folder found <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Resources"</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">but</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">not</span> <span class="hljs-string">"app/assets"</span>. Not cleaning <span class="hljs-string">"Resources"</span> folder...
[WARN] <span class="hljs-string">"mobileweb"</span> folder found <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Resources"</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">but</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">not</span> <span class="hljs-string">"app/assets"</span>. Not cleaning <span class="hljs-string">"Resources"</span> folder...
</code></pre><p>This means that you have platform-specific folders in your <strong>Resources</strong> folder (i.e., android, iphone, mobileweb) but you don&#39;t have them in your <strong>app&#x2F;assets</strong> folder. Alloy will not clean your <strong>Resources</strong> directory like it usually does on each build if this is the case, in an effort to prevent you from accidentally deleting critical platform-specific files. There&#39;s 2 ways to get around this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the folders (android, ios, mobileweb) from <strong>Resources</strong> to <strong>app&#x2F;assets</strong>. Alloy will then clean <strong>Resources</strong> out on your next build now that the platform-folders will then be in sync again.</li>
<li>If you don&#39;t plan on ever building an android or mobileweb app, you can just delete those folders from the <strong>Resources</strong> folder. Like option #1, this will sync up your platform-specific folders and <strong>Resources</strong> will get cleaned out on your next build.</li>
</ol>
<p>One thing to note is that this should never occur with new alloy apps. This situation really only occurred if you had an older alloy project and then tried to compile it with a newer version later. This was an old problem and should not ever occur anymore with new alloy apps built with 0.2.42… <em><strong>UNLESS</strong></em> you manually put them out of sync by moving around or deleting platofmr-specific folders from <strong>app&#x2F;assets</strong> on your own.</p>
