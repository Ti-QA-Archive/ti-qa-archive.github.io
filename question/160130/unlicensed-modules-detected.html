<p>Hey folks. I encountered this error in the middle of my debugging on the samsung device. I was debugging with no issues and suddenly I started getting this error:</p>
<p>License violation detected. Unlicensed module(s) detected. You must be a subscriber to use one or more of the modules included with this project.. Please contact Appcelerator Support.</p>
<p>All of the modules that are included are ones that are either free or that we have license to:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">module</span> platform=<span class="hljs-string">"android"</span>&gt;ti.<span class="hljs-typename">map</span>&lt;/<span class="hljs-keyword">module</span>&gt;

&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">module</span> platform=<span class="hljs-string">"iphone"</span>&gt;analytics.google&lt;/<span class="hljs-keyword">module</span>&gt;'
</code></pre><p>This fails to build for the Android device, but when we run this application for the iOS, it doesn&#39;t run into the Unlicensed module issue. This suddenly started occurring and i&#39;m a little unsure of how to resolve this problem. I&#39;ve even gone through and removed the modules that are not free and we still get this error.</p>

							<p>Apps have a GUID. Modules have a GUID. You have an account.</p>
<p>When you purchase a module, module is associated with your account. In theory, all the apps associated with your account should be able to use all the modules associated with your account. Unless, for whatever reason, the winds blew wrong, the moon was full, an app created before you &#39;bought&#39; a module doesnt get the permissions. So, you change the GUID of the app, appc sees it as a &#39;new&#39; app, and the module works.</p>
<p>Module is sold through the marketplace. Then it is pulled, author throws it on github. If he uses the same GUID as what was in the marketplace, then when TiVerify runs, it sees the module as the one from the marketplace, and you may or may not receive the warning.</p>
<p>If the author changes the guid of the module he releases, then TiVerify sees it as an unknown, and untracked module, you are not prevented from using it, and all works well.</p>
<p>If you have the source code to a module the author did not change the guid in, you can get the source code, change the guid, and build it out yourself, and all works well.</p>

										<p><p>Ti.Verify makes a call to a backend server to verify the licenses.  If the connection to that server is not available or the backend server is having an issue, well…thats a variable outside of your control.</p>

										<p><p>I am also getting this issue  when using the com.mirasense.scanditsdk module (community version). I have an app in the app store that using this module ( at the time the module version was at 1.2.2).</p>
<p>Now on a completely new project (and machine) I have downloaded the latest version of scandit (1.3.1) and when the app is compiled(adhoc for iOS) I get the licence violation screen (when running in emulator it does not do this  - I assume there is no verify check)??</p>
<p>I have seen another thread elsewhere that says either use the same module version or remove the module from  the my products and then re-add it. The problem here is that will the currently released app then start throwing the licence violation as my account version&#x2F;module has been upgraded.</p>
<p>At the moment I have no idea how to sort this as I cannot now create a new app with the updated version of the module (at least not without potentially screwing up what is already in the app store) ???</p>
<p>Is this because when a new version of a module is uploaded it is assigned a new GUID which messes up all the verify checks ?</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m having this issue with a FREE module….<br>This one, to be specific: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;5165</p>
<p>Why are those checks even enabled for free modules? …</p>
