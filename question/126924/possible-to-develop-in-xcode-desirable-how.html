										<p><p>Yes. You can write a native module (in Objective-C or Java) which you can use in Titanium app.</p>

							<p>If I understand the question correctly, it is whether or not you can use XCode as the IDE to develop Titanium apps.  Not how to extend Titanium using objective C.</p>
<p>While you could use any editor you want (including XCode or TextMate or DashEdit or whatever), what you lose is the integration with the debugger and build scripts.  If you want to go that route, you may want to consider Titanium Developer as the build mechanism after you edit your code in the editor of your choice.  Ti Developer was the precursor to Ti Studio, but Appcelerator end-of-life&#39;d it once Studio was complete so they could concentrate resources on Studio and the various SDKs, etc.  While it is no longer available from Appcelerator, it was an open source project so other users have taken it, made various enhancements, and it is available from the links in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;121270&#x2F;titanium-developer-130">this</a> thread.</p>
<p>IMHO, using Studio is &quot;better&quot; and XCode is less &quot;desirable&quot; just due to the integration features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code completion already knows about Titanium classes</li>
<li>Debugger integration with breakpoints, single-step, etc.</li>
<li>Easy to download new mobile SDKs when available</li>
<li>Built-in form editor for most common Tiapp.xml properties</li>
<li>Built-in script support for building projects</li>
</ul>
<p>PS - &quot;Modules&quot; are a way you can extend Titanium when you need a feature which does not exist in the Titanium SDK yet.  Modules are platform specific and written in the native language for that platform.  Thus for iOS you do use XCode and obj-C to write those.  Ivan supplied the link for more information on that.  But I don&#39;t think that is what you were asking here, if I interpret the question correctly.</p>
