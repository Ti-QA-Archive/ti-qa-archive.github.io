			<p>First: I know that a mac is needed to compile the xcode project!</p>
<p>But the latest Unity3d windows version allows the user to create the xcode project in windows:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Changelog:
...
Ability <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> build iOS target <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> Windows! It's still necessary <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> compile resulting Xcode project <span class="hljs-function_start"><span class="hljs-keyword">on</span></span> a Mac.
...
</code></pre><p>Of course you still need a mac to compile it but you could have a remote machine that will just compile the xcode projects (drop folder or web server with interface). </p>
<p>Would this be possible with Titanium,too? Or does the osx build process already need osx-system tools to create the xcode project?</p>

							<p>I&#39;m scratching my head trying to figure out what the value of an xcode project without xcode would be.</p>
<p>So, how are you going to test this build out? Every build would have to be adhoc to throw it on a device.</p>
<p>So the work flow is: add a label, build xcode project, upload to remote server, build, push binary to adhoc distro, download to device, run.  Change label color, …, run?</p>
<p>Using Tishadow, you should be able to push a classic project.<br>Unless something has changed, using TiShadow, you should be able to push an alloy project.</p>
<p>TiShadow only pushes js and assets, so no local compiling.  Just have to compile the TiShadow client app with the modules you will want to use in it.</p>

<p>If you are developing for iOS you need a Mac - simple as that.  There are many &quot;potential workarounds&quot; but they are either; pointless, dumb or simply unworkable in any real way.</p>
<p>Easiest entry point is MacMini - more than up to the task.</p>

										<p><p>In my scenario I have an old mac in my room without any keyboard or screen. I&#39;m using VNC to connect to the machine, copy my titanium project to the machine and compile it to my phone or store. I&#39;m testing it constantly on android so I don&#39;t have to compile it all the time on a mac if I make changes. I don&#39;t want to work on that machine cause its too slow and I need some windows&#x2F;linux tools anyway. </p>
<p>If I could create the whole xcode project on my linux machine I could just make a watch-folder on the mac, it will see that there is a new xcode project, will compile it and put the ipa on a local webserver. Then I can install it on the ipad (over the air distribution using enterprise account and a custom webpage).</p>
<p>And it could lead to a cloud build service (like phonegap cloud build?). You can create an xcode archive, upload it to a webpage and it will create the files for you. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried TiShadow a long time ago and it wasn&#39;t working with bigger projects (crashed or look completly different). But I&#39;ll try it again to see if its perfoming better now.</p>
<p>Its just an idea to create the xcode project on a none osx machine. Not sure where Unity3d is going with it</p>
