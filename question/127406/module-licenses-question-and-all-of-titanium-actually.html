			<h1>Module licenses question (and all of Titanium, actually)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am trying to use the Urban Airship modules for both iOS and Android in an app for work. We bought Indie licenses a few months ago. Getting push working on iOS was easy, on Android, after several days I don&#39;t have it working yet.</p>
<p>However this is not my current question. While watching the debug console on Android, I saw a message as the app starts, &quot;verifying module licenses&quot; which got me thinking.</p>
<p>If we deploy an app to the App Store that uses one of these modules, if we decide not to renew the Indie license next year, does that mean that the app will quit working for anyone who downloaded it in the meantime? Will the modules suddenly believe they are unlicensed?</p>
<p>And furthermore, will ANY apps built using Appcelerator suddenly cease to work, if we decide not to renew the Indie license? Is an Internet connection required for an app to run?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>This does <em>not</em> seem to be true.  We&#39;re having a problem running an app which <em>is</em> properly licensed, and the verification is occurring at <em>runtime</em>, not (just) build-time.  If someone on the Appcelerator team can verify this, please do.</p>

							<p>The way it has always been explained in the past is a current license is needed to BUILD a project.  Already deployed apps will continue to work if you do not renew a license from Appcelerator.  However, you would not be able to make any changes to the program and rebuild until you had a current license again.</p>
<p>AFAIK, this is still true even though the marketplace is now open.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Doug. Even though it is not my money invested in this license, I got concerned when I saw the app verify its license as it was running, and not during building.</p>
