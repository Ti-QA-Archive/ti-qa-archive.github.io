			<h1>Ti.storekit Verifying Auto Renewable Subscription</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am attempting to implement an in-app auto renewable subscription via the ti.storekit module. I am looking for the best way to verify that the user is still subscribed, without forcing them to verify their purchase every time. I looked through the Q&amp;A here and it seems no one has received any help, so I figured I&#39;d ask again now that the entire platform is a bit more mature with 1.8 out.</p>
<p>Right now, I&#39;m thinking of storing the transaction date and then asking the user to verify their purchase once a month. But that still seems sort of hackish and I am wondering if anyone knows of the way other non-titanium apps maintain a subscription without pestering their users?</p>
<p>Thanks a ton.</p>

							<div><p>I was thinking about exactly the same thing.  I&#39;m running into a similar issue in that when the purchase is made, or when the transactions are restored, I&#39;m not getting anything in the &#39;receipt&#39; field of the response.  Seems to be getting everything else, such as the productIdentifier, qty, date, etc, which might be a way around it.  As you were saying you can store the data on the device, and when a month has gone by, ask the user to re-enter their password to make sure they renewed.  Not a great solution, but better than nothing I suppose.</p>

							<p>If you save the receipt from the purchase, you can submit it to the store again and it will let you know if it is still valid.</p>
