							<p>A Mac is required for running the Apple SDKs, however, you can use a service called MacInCloud to basically use a Mac in the cloud. It comes pre-installed with Titanium Studio, so you just need to fire it up and start writing your apps.</p>

										<p><p>Appcelerator is not associated in any way with MacInCloud, they are just a service that happens to include our software with its offering. I believe that they offer you 2 free hours and after that you can pay hourly or monthly depending on your needs.</p>

<p>Maybe Appcelerator needs to buy you a mac to use their free software as well…</p>

							<p>You can use the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;foundry22.com">Foundry22</a> service. Basically, you upload your code to their service, they do the build, and issue an over the air update (like a TestFlightApp build) which you could install on your iDevice. You&#39;ll still need an Apple developer account.</p>
