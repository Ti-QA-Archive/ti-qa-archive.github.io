			<h1>Random Ti Dev Update?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>So today I opened up Titanium Developer (1.2.2) for the first time and it installed an update on my shitty 5 KB&#x2F;s connection. After like 30 minutes the update finished and Titanium Developer opened up, but the version was still the same: <strong>1.2.2</strong>.</p>
<p>Nothing seems different, except the fact that now to change projects and Build them right away, I have to re-click the &quot;Test &amp; Package&quot; tab or else it will build the project I was just on. It seems the update did nothing but screw over my quick-switching between projects?</p>
<p>Anybody else have this? There doesn&#39;t seem to be any post&#x2F;blog&#x2F;etc. about it and it&#39;s quite annoying.</p>

							<p>Titanium Developer is the Software.</p>
<p>Behind the software, there is the copiler, named Titanium SDK. When you do an update, the compiler changes, but not the software.</p>
<p>Look in your project settings, you&#39;ll see the SDK version.</p>
