			<p>Just driving me crazy… There must be something simple I am not doing, but everything looks like it is setup etc…</p>
<p>Installs on the device just fine, but when run – just hangs at the splash screen…</p>
<p>Of course, I don&#39;t have the device – I run it in the simulator and ship the .apk off to my client…</p>

							<p>Jay,</p>
<p>I ran several more tests and have some more clues but don&#39;t know how to find the underlying issue.</p>
<p>First the good news:</p>
<ul>
<li>The issue only seems to occur if I install the *.apk over the air.  If I install the application via USB directly to the device I do not hang on the initial launch.</li>
<li>The issue does not occur if I compile with the 1.4.3 SDK, but does with 1.5.x and 1.6.x (and install over the air)</li>
</ul>
<p>Secondly, it appears it is not strictly necessary to disable analytics.  What is necessary is to force a close after it has hung on the splash screen.  When analytics is true, you do not get a dialog message saying the application has stopped unexpectedly.  So you have to force the close manually via the Settings &gt; Applications &gt; Manage applications &gt; appname options.  Once the application has been force closed, it can be launched and run normally.</p>
<p>When analytics is set to false in tiapp.xml, the application puts up the &quot;stopped unexpectedly&quot; message which just makes the force close as simple as responding to the dialog then relaunching.  </p>
<p>So in review, my tests indicate steps to reproduce are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new project in SDK 1.5+ and build it (no changes needed)</li>
<li>Install the *.apk to the device over the air</li>
<li>Launch the application</li>
<li>Dialog appears saying the program must be restarted.  Close dialog.</li>
<li>If analytics is true (default), it will hang on the splash screen.  Go to Settings &gt; Applications &gt; Manage applications, select the app, and do a force close.  Relaunch the program and it will run normally.</li>
<li>If analytics is false, you will get a dialog saying the application has stopped unexpectedly.  Respond to the dialog and restart the program.</li>
</ul>
<p>When using the 1.4.3 SDK, a *.apk installed over the air still gives the dialog saying a restart is required on the initial launch.  But then it restarts fine.  When installed via USB no restart is required.</p>
<p>So something changed between 1.4.3 and 1.5.x in the initial launch of an application that was installed over the air (non-market).  And whether or not analytics is enabled changes whether or not you get a dialog saying the stopped unexpectedly.</p>
<p>But I have no idea how to debug it beyond this.  So hopefully someone else can contribute more ideas.</p>

							<p>Jay,</p>
<p>I can confirm I see the same thing here, compiling with SDK 1.6.0 under OSX.  This is with a new project, doing nothing but creating a new project and immediately building it to get the two tab screen default.  The following steps seem to work for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set analytics tag to false in tiapp.xml</li>
<li>Install to device (in my case Droid X running OS 2.2) and open it</li>
<li>Respond to dialog saying &quot;An application restart is required&quot;</li>
<li>Respond to dialog &quot;The application [name] (process com.domain.app) has stopped unexpectedly.  Please try again.&quot;</li>
<li>Relaunch program and it works as expected.</li>
</ul>
<p>I can kill the app and restart and everything still works.  So there is something that happens on the initial run.  Perhaps related to permissions?</p>
<p>I&#39;m not even 100% sure the analytics state has anything to do with it.</p>

							<p>Confirmed that I am having the exact same issue as documented (very nicely) by Doug. My app displays the error &quot;An application restart is required&quot;, after which the app hangs on the splash screen.</p>
<p>After force-closing, the app will run normally every time after that. The error can be replicated by uninstalling the app and doing another Market&#x2F;OTA install, but does not happen over USB or in debug.</p>
<p>App compiled with SDK 1.5.1 on Ubuntu; run on Droid X&#x2F;2.2.1. I haven&#39;t tested with&#x2F;without analytics enabled, but agree that it isn&#39;t a likely culprit.</p>

							<p>Summary:<br>I just launched an Android app with this same issue - 1.5.0 built on OSX. Just downloaded the 1.5.2 nightly, rebuilt and still get a &quot;restart is required&quot; message, but it not longer hangs the app.</p>
<p>Long Story:<br>In testing the initial 1.5.0 download from the Android Market, I was able to recreate this error by doing the following:</p>
<p>Installing app using Market<br>Clicking &quot;OPEN&quot; while in the Market<br>OR: by clicking the Notification that the app had been installed<br>However, opening the app from the Application list on the phone did not cause this issue.</p>
<p>After the rebuild, and &quot;Run on Device&quot;, the app still displays the &quot;Restart is required&quot; message after click-through from the Market &quot;Open&quot; button or the notification, but does not hang.</p>
<p>Haven&#39;t pushed this update up yet, so I haven&#39;t tested over-the-air yet.</p>

							<p>Ben,</p>
<p>Yes, that is the same behavior I now see with the fixes Don provided.  If you open directly from the install notification you still get the restart required message.  If you wait and open from the app launcher you do not.</p>
<p>However, it no longer hangs or crashes with a null pointer exception, which was my larger concern.  The app restart is perhaps annoying but IMHO appears to the user more like an application restart required after upgrading many desktop apps (e.g. Firefox).  I can live with it.</p>
<p>It was the hang &#x2F; NPE which had me more concerned.</p>

							<p>George,</p>
<p>This has been fixed, or at least the NPE error causing the hang on the splash screen.  Switch to using a more recent build.  I am using the continuous builds (thus 1.6.x) instead of a 1.5.x build because I also need some other fixes.  I am not sure how far back the fix was pushed, but you may want to first try a 1.5.x build as they are considered more stable than 1.6.x builds.</p>
<p>Information on how to install new builds is <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;doc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;get_continuous_builds">here</a> which then links to the actual downloads of the SDKs <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;index.html">here</a>.</p>

										<p><p>The fix was made Dec 27 as reported in this <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32238&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;2649-android-detecting-second-instance-causes-npe">ticket</a>.  I believe it only exists in 1.6.0 M03 or later, not in the 1.5.x builds.  You can read about how to download and install the latest stable (1.5.x) and continuous (1.6.x) builds <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;doc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;get_continuous_builds">here</a> and the actual builds are available <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;index.html">here</a>.  If you need this fix now, you will need to use a 1.6.x build newer than Dec 27.</p>

							<p>OK scratch that. Removing the analytics works <em>sometimes</em><br>Now whenever I download an app to my Android, it dies right after the splash-screen.</p>
<p>This is over USB-debug, not from Market.</p>
<p>Surely there must be a real fix for this? Seems like something pretty basic that ought to work reliably…</p>
