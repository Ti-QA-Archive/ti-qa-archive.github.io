			<h1>Android: How to pause background music when app goes to background?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a (heavyweight) window where I start a background music using:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> music = Ti.Media.createSound({
  url: <span class="hljs-string">'/snd/music.aac'</span>,
  allowBackground: <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
});
music.play();
</code></pre><p>The <code>allowBackground</code> property is <code>true</code>, because the music needs to keep playing when the app opens new (heavyweight) windows on top of it. Without it, the music will pause because its activity is paused.</p>
<p>But when the complete app (task) goes to the background I <strong>do</strong> want to pause the music. And so far I have not found a way to do so. The activities have a <code>pause</code> event, but not the app as a whole. I&#39;ve also found questions about this on Android naive, so I&#39;m afraid this is not just an easy thing to do.</p>
<p>The only &quot;solution&quot; found on Android forums is to keep track of activities in order to detect if pausing one would show another activity of the app itself or another app.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Short is; no - this is not possible when using heavyweight windows.</p>
<p>Longer answer;</p>
<p>I believe it should be, but it certainly does not - this appears to be an issue with the titanium implementation as the spec for the Android feature would have you believe that the audio should simply persist no matter what type of window is display afterwards - heavy or light weight.</p>

<p>Games would be a big user of this ability but I note that apps such as Angry birds change the background music when jumping from major game section to major game section.  The background music actually changes - so this would imply in actual usage either the background music for the game simply should not be the same or a technical limitation stops the persistence beyond new windows.</p>
<p>For music apps (I do not have a huge experience of Android ones) I assume the entire interface is a single window with views coming in and out - so there would be only only activity for the whole  app - although this is a guess - only observation of a couple of apps to go by.</p>
