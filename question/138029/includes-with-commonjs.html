			<h1>includes with CommonJS</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m making the move over to commonJS, which to start with, looks really nice. Although there are a few bits I&#39;m not quite sure about.</p>
<p>One thing, I haven&#39;t tried yet, but thought I would see the general thoughts first is using an include to only have to call the require&#39;s once? It seems that in all the example projects I look at, they all call requires over and over again?</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> uilabels = <span class="hljs-keyword">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'ui/labels'</span>);
    uiviews = <span class="hljs-keyword">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'ui/views'</span>);

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> myview = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> uiviews.view1();
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> mylabel = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> ui.label1();

myview.<span class="hljs-keyword">add</span>(mylabel);
</code></pre><p>I would then have to do that constantly if I create ui components within different files.</p>
<p>Will it not work to just call an include&#x2F;require for all my required files in the app.js file so I don&#39;t have to keep requiring all my ui files over and over?</p>
<p>If not, then what are some other real benefits of CommonJS as this would be quite a major down-side?</p>

<li>if doing android&#x2F;ios development with commonJS get in the habit of a leading forward slash in your path references <code>require(&amp;#39;&amp;#x2F;lib&amp;#x2F;mylibrary&amp;#39;)</code> instead of require(&#39;lib&#x2F;mylibrary&#39;). It will work on iOS but fail on android.  The forward slash breaks mobile web however.</li>
<li>include() will be disappearing down the road so don&#39;t rely on it now</li>
<li>on iOS doing your require() in your app.js will create global vars available throughout the app. This is a bug on the part of iOS as it breaks the design and intent of commonJS.  On android, the variables created in app.js (or in any commonJS module for that matter) have a limited scope and are not seen by other modules.  With that in mind, you would need to require your modules into each other module.</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>Thanks for those points Stephen! I&#39;ll get the forward slashes in! :) Is requiring ui components over and over again normal then? or am I not understanding the correct way of using CommonJS? I just seems a bit odd, it&#39;s almost like taking a step backwards moving away from a global set of all files to having to require them every time they&#39;re needed?</p>

										<p><p>Search for commonJS here in the Q&amp;A and you will find both good and bad discussions regarding commonJS.  Bluntly put, you are kind of stuck with commonJS, for better or worse, in Titanium.  It is the direction that Appcelerator chose.</p>
<p>I know that in our applications it has been for the better.  Our libraries are much more modular and application loading has been sped up a great deal but properly loading libraries as needed instead of enmass at launch.</p>
<p>When writing our apps, we need to remember the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 End user first</li>
<li>2 Refer to #1</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, it might be a pain in the tail as we are writing our code now to add a few lines of require() at the top of every file (for configs&#x2F;themes) but really, you shouldn&#39;t need to be including EVERY file into EVERY other file.  That runs afoul of all the reasons FOR commonJS.</p>
<p>Take a look through <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;search&#x2F;commonJS">number of the threads on commonJS</a> here before becoming totally frustrated withd what appears, on the surface, as more work for you. As you browse through, look for <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;devlink&#x2F;profile&#x2F;1125911&#x2F;ivan-kugor">Ivan Škugor</a>, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;devlink&#x2F;profile&#x2F;1231105&#x2F;trevor-ward">Trevor Ward</a> or names with the red Appcelerator icon.</p>

							<p>When using commonjs you will have to require your modules in the files in which you wish to use them. There is a slight difference between iOS and Android on this. On iOS, you could require your modules in app.js and depending on how they are written, modules could be available within other modules required previously in app.js </p>
<p>The upside of the commonjs require is that modules are still only required once. And changes to variables within a module will track so long as it is within the same context. Also, commonjs makes it easy to clean up after yourself, so memory leaks are much less common.</p>
<p>As a follow up to what Stephen said:</p>
<p>The leading slash on require statements should no longer be needed as is not the recommended way of requiring modules. Without the leading slash, it is implied that the module load from the Resources folder of your app and will work on mobile web. This is not the case for include() and I believe there is a parity bug filed for this, but as Stephen said, include() will be deprecated and removed in a future release.</p>

							<p>But the purpose of the <code>require</code> is to have your modules only where you need them, at the specific context If you wanted to <code>include</code> them globally then there would be no point to use them, stick to include instead, but it&#39;s really a very bad idea and anyway, will be soon deprecated as per rumors! </p>
<p>it&#39;s not a big deal to use the require function again and again. Think of it like creating an new view … what would you do? create a new object using the createView() method. You need to call the createView method again and again, no matter how many times you need it …! :-)</p>
