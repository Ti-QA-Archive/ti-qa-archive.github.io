			<h1>Titanium deletes the images while compiling.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi..</p>
<p>Titanium encounters a problem in adding images to default image folder in Resources. When I add new image to this folder, Titanium automatically deletes the image on compiling the app. Same problem is there when I tried to delete an image from the folder. when the app is compiled the folder is reverted to old state. Please help to solve the issue. I&#39;d tried updating the titanium. It had worked well with me before.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Easy one to not know this;</p>
<p>You need to place your images in the;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">{appname}<span class="hljs-regexp">/app/</span>assets
</code></pre><p>Folder and NOT the resources folder.  Each time you compile your app the resources folder is wiped (as you have found) and the new code created from your alloy app is compiled into the resources folder.  Any images are added to the folder above.</p>
<p>This is the note from the documentation;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Contains image assets and other files that need to be copied into the Resources directory. Reference these files in the code without the &#39;app&#x2F;assets&#39; path.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The Alloy documentation specific to this can be found in the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Alloy_Concepts-section-34636240_AlloyConcepts-ConventionoverConfiguration">Alloy - Convention over Configuration</a> section.</p>

										<p><p>I dont know if this is an Alloy issue or not, but this is not accurate.  The Resources folder is never &quot;wiped&quot;.  The only thing that ever gets wiped is the build&#x2F; folder, and only when you do a CLEAN.</p>

										<p><p>@Josh, it is very much an Alloy specific thing and it is very much wiped.</p>
<p>When you create an app using non-Alloy, you do all your code in the resource folder, build your app, it creates the build folder as you correctly point out.  You clean the job and the build folder is emptied, but re-built on demand each time.</p>
<p>In Alloy however the situation is VERY different, you put your code in the <strong>app</strong> folder, including the views, controllers, models, styles and views (plus assets).  You do NOT place anything in the resources folder.  You build the app, it pre-process the files from Alloy to normal code, all carefully considered for platform and mark-up.  This code is placed into the resources folder and then same build process is done as the non-alloy projects.</p>
<p>Please note the documentation on the subject;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Cleanup; The Resources folder is cleaned of any previous built files. If a platform-specific folder exists in the Resources folder, but not in the app&#x2F;assets folder, it and its contents are not removed.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>You can read more about the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Alloy_Concepts-section-34636240_AlloyConcepts-CompilationProcess">Compilation Process</a> in the documentation.</p>
<p>But I assure you the code is wiped from the resources folder in an Alloy project during build.  This was an Alloy question and the answer was given on that basis.</p>
