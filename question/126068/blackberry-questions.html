			<p>I have a couple questions regarding Appcelerator and BlackBerry:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does Appcelerator support BlackBerry, even a Beta? I&#39;ve heard that it does and it doesn&#39;t, but everything I&#39;ve heard about that it does says that it is in beta and requires a sign up&#x2F;Indie+ plan with Appcelerator. Is this true?</li>
<li>Does the BlackBerry emulator&#x2F;etc. work on Mac OS X?</li>
<li>If Appcelerator actually does support BlackBerry, what features are available, or unavailable?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks,<br>Colton</p>

							<p>I&#39;m a user, so these are just my personal opinions, not official answers.</p>
<p>1) Blackberry support:  I think you would have to define what you mean by &quot;support&quot;.  By definition, beta products should not be used for production applications, and IMHO &quot;support&quot; in a beta product suggests more accepting bug reports than any guaranteed response.  Moreoever, with Appcelerator&#39;s model I would say there is no &quot;support&quot; at all until you reach the Pro level of membership – even on products not in beta.  Even at the Indie level you have read-only access to the tickets but can&#39;t open a ticket with a guaranteed response time.</p>
<p>2) Blackberry development on OSX: While you can use Eclipse to write code, Research In Motion has only released simulators for Windows.  So to do testing, you must do so on either a real or virtual Windows machine.  I have not tried it, but suspect BootCamp or Parallels would let you do so on an Apple machine.</p>
<p>Note that this is the opposite case of Apple providing only OSX based simulators.  Neither are really a limitation imposed by Appcelerator.  They are just at the mercy of the tools available for native development.</p>
<p>3) Features available:  see next question.  Since it is in beta, I don&#39;t know if it is acceptable to discuss them here.</p>
<p>4) Where to find it:  You may need to log out and back in.  When you do, there should be a Helpdesk link in the top frame.  Under that there will be a Resources section with a link to Early Access Programs.  You will find the Blackberry beta listed there.</p>

							<p>It is in Beta and supported through the help desk if you have a subscription.</p>
<p>I have released an app using the platform.</p>
<p>There are some issues with the platform, that is why it is still beta, BUT it is functional and capable of providing BB Application support IF you MUST have it.</p>

										<p><p>Alright, that is great. I am developing an app for iOS and Android that is going out to a group of buyers through a colleague of mine, but only about 1&#x2F;3 of them actually have an iPhone&#x2F;Android phone, the other 2&#x2F;3 (Which is quite a large number) have BlackBerry&#39;s, and to only sell an app that only 1&#x2F;3 of them would use is not only not doing my job right - But missing out on a huge sale.</p>
<p>So yes, I believe that BlackBerry is a MUST in this case. Thanks Aaron.</p>

										<p><p>If you are just starting the app, review the Blackberry beta first as it does not (yet?) support everything that is common to both iOS and Android.  So you may want to take what is available in all platforms into account as you develop the application.</p>

										<p><p>The app is completed for both iOS and Android - It simply has to be ported over to BlackBerry. If it&#39;s not available, I guess I&#39;ll just have to jerry-rig what I can and leave out anything I can&#39;t for a later date.</p>

										<p><p>@Colton, that is the approach we used, there is a fair bit of support from a functional perspective; but there are not many examples beyond the kitchenSink so alot is trial and error and support tickets for assistance.</p>
