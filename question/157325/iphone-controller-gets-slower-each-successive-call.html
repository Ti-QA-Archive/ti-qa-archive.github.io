			<h1>iPhone Controller Gets Slower Each Successive Call</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Really hard to show the code as this is basically a finished app now..  but the problem is I have a controller which loads a TableView, and each time it gets called, it takes longer and longer each time to open.  (it has been closed prior to each successive call)</p>
<p>Does that point to any common problems that I should look into?  I&#39;ve ripped up the code many different ways now to try to figure out what piece of code is causing it, but I can&#39;t seem to find what&#39;s doing it.</p>
<p>Just looking for an advice on what this could mean and any links or tips that might help me get to the bottom of it!  Thanks!</p>

							<p>I&#39;m 80% sure you are not freeing the memory the right way, the table stays there even if you close the window.</p>
<p>however:</p>
<ul>
<li>are you loading the table based on an app-wide event? Do you remove the event or the table loads +1 times each time you load the window</li>
<li>are you altering the table data somehow? so each time you open the window you actually load a multiple of the initial number of rows?</li>
</ul>
<p>the best way to find what it is, is to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;29804284">open instruments</a> and see where it leaks :)</p>

										<p><p>I used Debug mode and definitely noticed an event listener for the controller was firing extra times each time I re-opened the controller.</p>
<p>From there I just realized I wasn&#39;t properly destroying this controller when it wasn&#39;t in use. :)  OF COURSE.  Don&#39;t know what I was thinking.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help!</p>
