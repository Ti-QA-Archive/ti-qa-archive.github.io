			<p>I have a project in Alloy that builds great and does what I need.  When I import the solution into Subversion I am able to get the project on multiple macs etc. It builds and runs fine. When I make a change to a file for example one of the controller.js files and simply add a Ti.API.info(&#39;test&#39;); the line is not output to the console and it&#39;s almost as if any change I make is not reflected locally. I did exclude the build directory, if anyone has a similar issue please let me know. Thanks</p>

							<div><p>I ran alloy compile, however I am still having the same issue. I can see where the problem is but not sure how to fix this. When it was a stand alone project (not checked into SVN, everything worked fine). After my initial check-in (import) to SVN, I  modify a controller.js file then build the project. What ahappens is if i open the controller.js file that is in the Resources directory I do not see the change I have made in the original app&#x2F;controllers&#x2F;controller.js. Could this be an internal problem with Alloy? Any help is much appreciated I&#39;m running out of options.</p>

							<p>I downloaded Alloy 3.0.0 and also installed the latest Studio update and it appears to be working now. Give that a try and see if it works.</p>
