			<p>Using Titanium Studio and I am unable to deploy via FastDev. My application simply starts and freezes on the loading screen. This works just fine in Titanium Developer w&#x2F;o FastDev. This is with the 1.7 SDK as well as the 1.7.1 continuous. Is there any property I can set to lengthen the timeouts?</p>

							<div><p>I am having the exact same issue, since 1.7 the android emulator has become so flaky as to be almost unusable.  Apps commonly fail to move beyond the splash screen showing &#39;Application xyz (in process com.domain.xyz) is not responding&#39;.</p>
<p>I have tried different variations on the type of device I am emulating and also delete all existing avds so it recreates and still the same.  </p>
<p>I have also tried updating to number 11 (from 10) of the Android SDK.</p>
<p>If it is the FastDev - can I turn it off and use the &#39;SlowDev&#39; at least it worked - plus the new FastDev takes ages to start anyway!</p>

							<div><p>This is just for my app. The default project appears to work just fine.</p>
<p>I will admit that my app does do a lot of pre-loading into the global context. But unless I can set the timeouts or disable FastDev, there is not much I can do with Titanium Studio. I really hope there is a solution.</p>

							<div><p>I have a desktop and a laptop (both are Macs) which I use to develop for Android. I&#39;m using <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2GBFreeStorage">dropbox</a> to share code between these two machines. Strangely fastdev works on the laptop but not on the desktop using the same codebase. Looks like it&#39;s a configuration issue on my side.</p>

							<p>Julian, I wish FastDev was my biggest issue. It&#39;s frustrating, but not nearly as frustrating as all of the crashes that 1.7.0 brought with its new memory model.</p>
<p>You can find some facts about <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Fastdev+Reference+for+Android">fast dev on the wiki</a>. This includes a property you can add to your Tiapp.xml to disable FastDev. Hopefully that gets you up &amp; running. Though, it doesn&#39;t really solve the problem.</p>

							<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I had the same problem and what I did was edit tiapp.xml file and changed this line:<br>From <strong>&lt;analytics&gt;true&lt;&#x2F;analytics&gt;</strong> To <strong>&lt;analytics&gt;false&lt;&#x2F;analytics&gt;</strong></p>

							<p>hi Mike,</p>
<p>add the following line into tiapp.xml file to disable fast dev process then fully rebuild your app.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">property</span> <span class="hljs-property">name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"ti.android.fastdev"</span> type=<span class="hljs-string">"bool"</span>&gt;<span class="hljs-constant">false</span>&lt;/<span class="hljs-keyword">property</span>&gt;
