			<h1>1.5 release is way too buggy</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have been a big fan of Ti until today. I had high hope of 1.5 to resolve some memory issues for me. Instead of helping, this 1.5 is like a bomb, blowed everything away. I  was trying to start my app and noticed a bunch of issues.</p>
<ol>
<li>HttpClient synchronous  mode breaks, return null back.  funny thing is it prints parsing error, to complain about<br>Entity: line 1: parser error : Start tag expected, &#39;&lt;&#39; not found<br>come on, all i need back is simple text</li>
<li>ImageView.image.replace(&#39;big&#39;, &#39;small&#39;) complains<br>this class is not key value coding-compliant for the key replace</li>
<li>other errors, I don&#39;t have time to list here.</li>
</ol>
<p>in a word, it totally breaks my application, </p>
<p>Please, Ti team, I really appreciate you guys invented this wonderful framework, but this release is just not professional enough.</p>

							<p>just to follow up.  Since I became the guinea pig anyway,  so I downloaded the nightly build for 1.5  Dec&#x2F;14 build, it worked better, it solved the httpclient issue.   the offical release from Ti is from 11&#x2F;11  build.  </p>
<p> there is one 1.6 build there as well, didn&#39;t dare to try.</p>

							<p>finally decided to roll back to 1.4.2..   this is just crazy. I have found at least 10 show stoppers for me. It crashes frequently with every version of device I have in hands.  </p>

<p>Try 1.6.0 (master on <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;index.html">continuous builds</a>). It is stable for me.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>I know this is not for faint of heart. I will give it a shot. I have 4 different iphone&#x2F;ipod devices in front me.</p>
<p>BTW, how do I submit bug report?  I have been using Ti for a while, shame on me, have not found a way to report bug yet.</p>
<p>I have found so many bugs with 1.5. I&#39;d like to call pest control.</p>

										<p><p>not much of a luck,  iphone 4 and ipod 3G have crashed on 1.6.0<br>I have a long running process to download large file, it seems the issue is with the disable idle time mechanism. the hardware reports  resume time error.</p>

										<p><p>i didn&#39;t have a build issue. did you clean up build&#x2F;iphone  dir?  I don&#39;t think 1.5.1 will help. It looks like 1.5 revamped a lot, so the bug list is loooong.</p>
