			<p>Hi all, can people please provide their rules-of-thumb for estimating effort to design, build, &amp; test mobile apps using Titanium ?  What is your best-guess-formula ?</p>

							<p>Hi </p>
<p>I am not that much in to time estimation stuff, its only 2 year of my experience but what i learned while estimating the app for titanium is I provide the estimation based on the number of screens. </p>
<p>First i divide the screen in to 3 category. </p>
<h2 id="normal-average-and-complex-">Normal, average and complex.</h2>
<h3 id="for-normal-below-screen-comes-in-it">For Normal below screen comes in it</h3>
<p>(Splash, Login, Forgetpassword, Homepage, Aboutus, Rssfeed, Twitter feed, youtube video feed, dashboard, custom tabmenu like wise etc) </p>
<h3 id="for-average">For Average</h3>
<p>If any of the above need the server API call or other advance changes.</p>
<h3 id="for-complex">For complex</h3>
<p>(Custom Table view, Camera implementation, Audio&#x2F;video recording, Third party API, Custom API call etc.., and other R&amp;D base stuff </p>
<p>I have finalized the hours for </p>
<h3 id="normal-as-4-hour">Normal as 4 hour</h3>
<h3 id="average-as-8-hour">Average as 8 hour</h3>
<h3 id="complex-as-16-hour">Complex as 16 hour</h3>
<p>Now by diving the screens in to category help me count the total hours. </p>
<p>This total hours can be adjusted in the later stage as some normal screen can be developed fast while other complex screen needs more time. </p>
<p>But over all my estimation always comes near some time due to some unknown error take more time. But for that i always add 8 hours of time for R&amp;D stuff. </p>
<p>If client wants the app in android too then i add total screen * 2 hours for managing the layout and testing it on all devices. </p>
<p>If this method of estimation you think not proper then do tell me as i want to follow the best method.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Nikunj</p>

										<p><p>This is great :)  Thanks so much.  I especially like how you documented the criteria for what makes a screen fit within a category.</p>
<p>If others have additional thoughts, different criteria, please post them :)</p>

										<p><p>Hi Steven </p>
<p>Thanks, Well i am not that expert but this what i do the best with and i can say that its help me to complete about 25 project before schedule and i still using the same method for estimation. And i will look forward for some good estimation criteria too.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

										<p><p>I know this is an old question (Titanium Classic &quot;Age&quot;) but do you still follow the same practice with Project Estimations using Alloy Framework?<br>If not, how do you define (on what basis) the efforts needed = hours needed?</p>

							<p>It really depends on the project at hand. Some screens are more complicated then others. Not all logic for all controls and how they interact is the same.</p>
<p>At the end - you really have to know yourself and your capabilities and how much time you spend on every aspect of your project.</p>
<p>What I do is take a project, break it to pieces, and for each piece I know how long it should take me (in hours). I also add some R&amp;D time. Sum it all up and add 10%.</p>

							<p>Thanks guys.  Based on the feedback so far in a few other forums, in my case, I think a list of tasks would be:</p>
<p>a) per view:</p>
<ul>
<li>create UI layout, </li>
<li>create UI event handlers, </li>
<li>support internationalization,</li>
<li>support skinning,</li>
<li>integrate with background communications service</li>
</ul>
<p>b) background communications service on mobile device</p>
<ul>
<li>accept incoming message from UI</li>
<li>store some data in local DB</li>
<li>forward message to App Server</li>
<li>accept incoming message from App Server</li>
<li>store some data in local DB</li>
<li>notify UI to retrieve updated info</li>
</ul>
<p>c) App Server</p>
<ul>
<li>accept incoming message from mobile device</li>
<li>validate &#x2F; store incoming data</li>
<li>retrieve data to be sent</li>
<li>generate outbound message&#x2F;response to mobile device</li>
</ul>
<p>For each of the tasks above, I do need to know how to estimate the ONE NOMINAL man-hours required.  </p>
<p>What criteria could be used to say that building the UI layout (or activity) for &#39;this&#39; screen&#x2F;tab&#x2F;view is worse than for &#39;that&#39; one ?  </p>
<p>Or, what&#39;s the base effort needed to build 1 tab and then how much extra effort is needed to add &#39;x&#39; feature ?</p>

							<p>I think that with Titanium that&#39;s almost impossible. :)</p>
<p>The thing is that here and there you&#39;ll find a bug that will need to be isolated (which can be extremely hard due to limited debugging tools) so you can understand it and so you can find a workaround (which can also be hard to find). Since developing is slow due to re-compilation time, estimation time be overdrawn easily, so it&#39;s better to not to estimate in the first place.</p>

										<p><p>This is true for any tool - but your manager&#x2F;client STILL wants to know WHEN it&#39;ll be available and HOW MUCH it&#39;ll cost.  So I guess this means you have a lot of stress at work :)</p>

										<p><p>No, it&#39;s not true for any tool. In other tools&#x2F;environments, things work (I worked with C, C++, C# and .Net, Java, PHP, JS in browser including various frameworks, PL&#x2F;SQL to name some). It&#39;s not perfect in those environments, but at least trivial things work. In Titanium, they don&#39;t (at least not on Android, check the bugs I reported in JIRA if you like). It takes a lot of effort to find why something don&#39;t work because sometimes error is not reported in Studio, but can be found in DDMS as Java exception - but with no information what JS line (or even file) caused that exception. Then, sometimes events are not removed, causing &quot;Exception on dead thread&quot; after several window opening and closing (what&#39;s causing that can easily become mystery). Sometimes there are random bugs that are sometimes being solved with computer restart(!). There is no debugger on device, so if you plan to develop on device, debugging will be very painful. You could try to use debugger on emulator, which is extremely slow and sometime unstable (that&#39;s not Titanium problem, but it&#39;s related). It will take you 10 minutes just to start it - on overclocked quad core machine with SSD. Then, installation of Titanium and Titanium Studio - no need for explanation how painful can it be, just search through Q&#x2F;A, there are tons of same topics describing problems with configurations. Then the documentation comes, which until recently was API map with basic explanations from which it is hard to know how particular part functions. Some things in documentation are wrong, some things are missing. KitchenSink is basically the best source of documentation, but sometimes it&#39;s not updated properly and doesn&#39;t work well with newest SDK versions. Also, there are no best practices decribed in documentation, not even from Appcelerator employees (well, there were&#x2F;are some attempts), KitchenSink has project layout that is not recommended to use. CommonJS is implemented partially, and makes no sense to use it that way.</p>
<p>So … the reasons are many as you can see. Sometimes I can do a thing in several hours if I don&#39;t encounter any bug. But sometimes, when things don&#39;t work, it takes me several days to get that work. That&#39;s magnitude grater. For any non-trivial project that takes more than a month to do, it&#39;s almost impossible to give precise timeline (it&#39;s not dependent on programming speed, but on encountered bug number, which can&#39;t be estimated). Guessing is not the game I want to play. I try to explain the situation to my manager, any reasonable man can understand the situation.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, this doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t like Titanium - I love it actually. But it&#39;s far from grown up platform and it need a lot of work to reach maturity. Relying on immature platform to give (precise) deadline is frivolous for me.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know for what platform do you plan to develop, but Android side of Titanium is the dark side, for every non-trivial application you&#39;ll find a lot of problems.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Ivan,</p>
<p>I don&#39;t question that some tools are more mature than others, and that the more mature the tool and more widely-used it is, that the more comfortable people feel about providing estimates.  I guess with Appcelerator, once we&#39;re all more aware of it&#39;s shortcomings, the more comfortable we&#39;ll be with estimating effort.</p>
