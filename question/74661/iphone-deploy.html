			<p>Hi,<br>I run a career website developed in java that I would like to make it available on iPhones.<br>I am confused as to how to do it.<br>1) Do I need to go throu App store? I guess not, because my app wont be a downloadable thing.<br>2) So do I just use Titanium Mobile to develop my mobile career app and deploy it on my server , then can I view it from iPhone?<br>3)I want the data in my online career website to sync up with the one shown on iPhone.Can I use the same database as used by my online site?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help</p>

							<p>you really can just build an HTML5 compatible set of HTML Pages to support your site and not build anything with Appcelerator since you are not going to really be building an app.</p>
<p>Take a look a jQueryMobile and jQTouch they might be of interest to you</p>
