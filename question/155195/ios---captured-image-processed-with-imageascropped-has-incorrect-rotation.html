			<h1>ios - captured image processed with imageAsCropped() has incorrect rotation</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I am completely stumped by this one.  Full sample code below but here is a quick description (tested on iPhone5).  </p>
<p>The problem: I take a picture using the camera and in the success callback apply directly on the media blobl a call to imageAsCropped(). Cropping occurs properly but <strong>the image ends up being rotate 90° to the left</strong>.</p>
<p>I do not understand where this rotation comes from.  It does NOT happen when using allowEditing: true.  But I want to do my own (non square) cropping.</p>
<p>The code shown here is a bit more complex: I put the captured media into an imageview then crop the image from it before displaying it in another imageview. Same result, of course, but I wanted to prove the capture itself was not the issue.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// test on device since camera is not supported on simulator</span>
var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
            backgroundColor: <span class="hljs-string">'white'</span>,
            layout: <span class="hljs-string">'composite'</span>
        }),
        btn = Ti.UI.createButton({
            top: <span class="hljs-number">20</span>,
            left: <span class="hljs-number">20</span>,
            title: <span class="hljs-string">'show camera'</span>
        }),
        img = Ti.UI.createImageView({
            top:<span class="hljs-number">80</span>,
            left: <span class="hljs-number">20</span>,
            <span class="hljs-variable">width</span>: <span class="hljs-number">200</span>,
            <span class="hljs-variable">height</span>: <span class="hljs-number">200</span>,
            autorotate: <span class="hljs-keyword">true</span>,
            borderColor: <span class="hljs-string">'red'</span>
        }),
        img2 = Ti.UI.createImageView({
            top:<span class="hljs-number">300</span>,
            left: <span class="hljs-number">20</span>,
            <span class="hljs-variable">width</span>: <span class="hljs-number">200</span>,
            <span class="hljs-variable">height</span>: <span class="hljs-number">200</span>,
            autorotate: <span class="hljs-keyword">true</span>,
            borderColor: <span class="hljs-string">'green'</span>
        });


btn.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, function(){ <span class="hljs-string">'use strict'</span>;
    Ti.Media.showCamera({
            success: function(data){
                img.setImage(data.media);
                img2.setImage(img.getImage().imageAsCropped( { 
                    x:<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,y:<span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-variable">width</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1550</span>, <span class="hljs-variable">height</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1550</span>
                }));
            }
    });
});

win.<span class="hljs-built_in">add</span>(btn);
win.<span class="hljs-built_in">add</span>(img);
win.<span class="hljs-built_in">add</span>(img2);

win.<span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>();
</code></pre><p>Anyone has met this kind of problem and&#x2F;or would be able to offer a reason&#x2F;fix&#x2F;workaround ?<br>I must admit being completely stumped.</p>
<p>To be complete, this also happens if you take images from the photo gallery but not always (it seems to depend on how the image was made, most image from the web look good, some from an old camera too but never when taken with the iphone).</p>
<p>What am I missing ?  It seems so obvious that it should work that I am sure I have missed something but I am damned if I know what.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help anyone can provide. Let me know if more details are needed, of course.</p>
<p>&#x2F;t</p>
<p>Nitty gritty details:</p>
<p><strong>Mac OS X 10.8.4<br>node.js 0.8.22<br>iOS SDK 6.1<br>CLI version 3.0.24<br>Titanium SDK version 3.1.1.GA</strong></p>
<p>Tested on iPhone5 but has been reported on iPhone4 too.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Malcom,</p>
<p>many thanks for the prompt answer.  </p>
<p>I have looked at what you sent but I am afraid I will have to re read it all tomorrow with a fresh mind … </p>
<p>I have followed this forum long enough to know not to discount your answers :) But I am not sure at all how to solve this is a general manner.  </p>
<p>Bear with me ,here.</p>
<p>When taking pictures with the camera, I guess that I can use the code in the second link to determine orientation and apply a + or - 90&#x2F;180° rotation depending on phone orientation.  It is painful but not a problem by itself.</p>
<p>But I swear I have seen it with <em>some</em> images from the photo library too.  I will have to test all look if the same &#39;heuristic&#39; would apply too.</p>
<p>And what flummoxes me the most, is that in both links you provide, there isn&#39;t anything about imageAsCropped at all.  And for my case, the problem happens only with it (in code in the question, image is always shown correctly in the img imageview and rotated in the img2 one.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks again.  I will experiment and come back to this post when I have a clearer understanding of your post and played with the suggested workarounds.</p>

										<p><p>The problem is related to the first link I provided for the <strong>autorotate</strong> property.  When iOS displays images it does so based on the EXIF information that is embedded inside each photo.  The EXIF information includes many things but in this case the important one is the orientation of how the camera was held when the photo was taken.</p>
<p>When iOS displays the image it will normally display the image adjusted for the orientation it was taken - which is good, however when you start playing with the image that extra info is discarded which means the image is no longer automatically adjusted.</p>
<p>The property <strong>autorotate</strong> turns this auto adjust behaviour off - using this means you see the photo as it is stored without the auto adjustment in-place. </p>
<p>So you are right it is a real pain, I feel this pain myself.  I have a few apps that need to process images and then transfer them to a server.  I normally determine the orientation and then pass that to the server and adjust the image on the server, which is where I slice and dice the image for my needs. as it is then feed to other services.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Malcom</p>
<p>I had missed the actual meaning of autorotate, indeed. I have read (again) your posts, looked around a bit on the web and tested some code.</p>
<p>I come to the conclusion that what we actually need is a method on Ti.Blob to get the EXIF information out of the image.  So far as I see, this is the only solution that will work for all sources of images (camera and photo gallery).<br>I haven&#39;t the faintest idea how to go about it and I do not know how to port the various js modules I found on the web to titanium (most seem to rely on node buffer or some other way to get at the raw data that I do not understand).</p>
<p>Fiddling around a bit, using your isPortrait and isLandscape idea, I can solve handle two basic cases when using the camera but that&#39;s all. But I don&#39;t see how to get the orientation of the iPhone <em>when</em> the image is taken (if you hold it portrait bottom up,  it should be rotated 180° not 90°).<br>Complains aside,  it is already better than what I had, though, and you explained it all, so I will mark your answer as best answer.</p>
<p>But I am really frustrated by this.  I wanted to use this to let users take a picture or pick from their gallery an image to use as an avatar and sending it to the server just to find out the orientation seems silly beyond measure (not to mention awfully slow).  No idea how to get out of this hole.</p>
<p>Anyway, many thanks for the help !</p>
