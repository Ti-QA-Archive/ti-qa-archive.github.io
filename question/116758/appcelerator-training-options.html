			<p>I have a question about the two training options available.</p>
<p>On the AppU Training page here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;training<br>the modules are $50 each and there is one for UI Fundamentals, one for Working with Local Data and one for Working with Remote Data (Total $150)</p>
<p>On the Custom Training page here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;training&#x2F;titanium-training&#x2F;<br>the Level200 course which covers (UI Fundamentals, Working with Local and<br>Remote Data) costs $200</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me if these both cover the same information or does the Level 200 cover something extra ?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

							<p>FYI: I went ahead and purchased the $50 working with remote data module. Personally I did not find it very useful, I have been having difficulty with JSON which it claims to cover.</p>
<p>In reality this is just a walk through of the code for the SnaPost app, the questions that are asked are hard to hear and the information doesn&#39;t really go into a lot of detailed explanation of whats happening or how you might adapt or alter the code or functions to serve other purposes.</p>
<p>I was hoping&#x2F;expecting that they would take things like xhr and JSON in isolation and then perhaps show them in action, but really, unless you are looking for a straight walkthrough of how Snapost works, I would probably give it a miss.</p>
