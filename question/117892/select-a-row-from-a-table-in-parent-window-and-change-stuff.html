			<h1>Select a row from a table in parent window, and change stuff</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, I have a table-view, which I can click on. When I click it a new window opens with other stuff inside. Here I have a button, and when I click it I want the row, at the table, to change an image to something else.</p>
<p>Eitherway, I cannot &quot;select&quot; that row properly, and change stuff.</p>
<p>I know the index of the row though. In the row, there&#39;s a image which background i&#39;m trying to change.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">        var likes = Ti.UI.createImageView({
            image: <span class="hljs-string">"../images/"</span> + likeBg,
            width: <span class="hljs-number">30</span>,
            height: <span class="hljs-number">30</span>,
            left: <span class="hljs-number">5</span>,
            top: <span class="hljs-number">6</span>
        });
</code></pre><p>inside the eventlistener for the button inside the new window:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">//trying to select the row</span>
var <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span><span class="hljs-number">_</span>row = tableView.row[item<span class="hljs-number">_</span>row];
<span class="hljs-keyword">this</span><span class="hljs-number">_</span>row.rowData.likes.image = <span class="hljs-string">"../images/likedBg.png"</span>;
</code></pre><p>I don&#39;t know if i&#39;m thinking right. Have searched here for a while now and can&#39;t figure it out.</p>
<p>Using the newest Titanium (1.6.1?) and iPhone.</p>

							<p>Tables are comprised of an array &quot;data&quot; with zero or more sections, with each section being an array of zero or more rows. Sections and rows are numbered from zero to x like other arrays. Very often, tables have just a single section so if that is true for your table and item_row is the index of the row you care about, the row is at:</p>
<p><code>var this_row = tableView.data[0].rows[item_row];</code></p>
<p>Now that you have this, you can directly get any property of the row itself, but objects within the row must be addressed through the array &quot;children&quot; where zero is the first object added to the row, one is the next object, and so forth.</p>
<p>For the sake of discussion, let&#39;s say the image view &quot;likes&quot; was the third object added to the row.  You can then use:</p>
<p><code>this_row.children[2].image = &amp;#39;..&amp;#x2F;images&amp;#x2F;likedBg.png&amp;#39;;</code></p>
<p>If your table has more than one section, you need to know the section index as well as the row index.</p>

							<p>The explanation by Doug is correct, but wouldn&#39;t just be easier to pass the row object to the new window so you dont have to go looking for it again?</p>

										<p><p>Aaron, yes by all means you are right.  I didn&#39;t read the original question close enough and was thinking he needed to be able to access any arbitrary table row.  If the child window is opened after clicking on the row to get updated from the child window then by all means just assign a property to the child window with a reference to the row object.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks guys, great answers! But I can&#39;t say that I&#39;m not intressed in the above statement, about storing the object. I don&#39;t really get what you mean, but I&#39;m guessing that I&#39;m supposed to store the object (the row) as a global variable, and use it inside the new window? (send the variable with the object instead of the index).</p>
<p>Could I have some code-example on how I could manage that? If I have the object, how do I change it (the way i&#39;d like) with changing &quot;likeBG.png&quot;?</p>
