		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I had generated cert.p12 and I am trying to upload this cert.p12 on ACS server for development with password and Server show message like <strong>&quot;Push certificate was successfully updated&quot;</strong>. But server is not displaying it in <strong>&quot;Apple iOS Push Certificates&quot;</strong> section and when I try to subscribe from the device, it shows <strong>Push Notification Certificate not configured</strong> error</p>
<p>Thanks<br>Vijay.</p>

							<p>We discovered a bug that would prevent update app settings including uploading p12 cert files from working after one performs  app data delete from admin console. While we are actively working on addressing this issue, the work around would be creating a new app  if you are impacted by this bug.</p>
