			<h1>authenticating user accounts to a website</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am building an app that will allow users to log into their account on a php&#x2F;mySQL news based website and view the various articles that they have subscribed to within the site, they will also have the option to post articles on a forum when logged in.</p>
<p>Has anyone built anything similar to this and can they offer any advice on the communication element of an app like this. It is my understanding that the site needs to generate a JSON feed for this to work, but how does authentication work to ensure that a user receives the correct information for their account, rather than just a generic feed ?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

							<p>the authentication should happen on the server, once they are authenticated you will have a user object associated with the session you have with the user.</p>
<p>if you maintain some sort of role or access information with the user object, you can check that on all requests and determine what information to provide as a response</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for this Aaron, would that be something like a cookie stored in the app (if thats possible) or something that is created on the server when a user connects from the app and just remembers their session?</p>
<p>As I am not responsible for developing the site, I am trying to figure out whether they will need to make many changes on their side for the app to be able to connect to it properly.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
