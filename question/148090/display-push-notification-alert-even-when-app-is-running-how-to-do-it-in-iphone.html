<p>My goal is displaying the alert that appears on top when you receive a push notification but you are out of the app but being inside the app.</p>

							<div><p>Maybe its just not possible and i have to display my own alert message inside the app. This was just to save space and show the message on the upper status bar of the mobile phone so all alerts of new events look similar even out or in the app.</p>

							<div><p>Thanks, i was afraid of that. The only thing are local notifications, but they only work when the app is not running. Pity… in android they work perfectly.</p>
