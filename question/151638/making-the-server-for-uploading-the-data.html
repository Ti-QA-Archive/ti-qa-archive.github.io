							<p>Hi</p>
<p>When you say &quot;make it yourself&quot;, do you mean;</p>
<ul>
<li>specify it and host the server yourself?</li>
<li>specify it and have someone else host it?</li>
<li>choose a server platform and have another company host it?</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless you have a lot of bandwidth - get someone else to host it and if there is budget pay for a managed server.</p>
<p>As to what sort of server software - this one will have lots of answers, there are loads and they all have advantages and disadvantages, ideally choose one you are comfortable with.</p>
<p>Personally I flip-flop between PHP and ASP.net, but it always project dependant and budget dependant as well.</p>
<p>If you are just hosting files then you might be better served simply doing that - use something like Amazon S3 and even a CDN to host the files as static objects, there is no server required and you only pay for what you are storing and retrieving.  The costs can be low - but constant access will increase those values.</p>
<p>You really need to work out how much data in what sort and how many times it will be uploaded and downloaded.</p>
<p>Does the server need scripts to be run to pass back data or even a database?  All factors.</p>

										<p><p>If your only needs are to upload files (does not matter what sort) and then have the app (or anything else) optionally download&#x2F;access them - then yes, no reason I can think of that would stop you.</p>
<p>The market place appears to have a free module to handle the Amazon wrapper commands if you have not sorted them yourself;</p>

										<p><p>Muhaamad,</p>
<p>If you want only storage of file, then I specifically recommend you to use Amazon s3 for it. There are simple api&#39;s for fetching and storing of files for amazon s3. here is the link for documentation about how to get object. </p>
