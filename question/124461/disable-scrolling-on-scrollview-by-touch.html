			<h1>Disable scrolling on scrollview by touch</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I had a problem where I was using a scrollableview and didn&#39;t want the user to be able to scroll it by touching it but wanted them to use some next&#x2F;back buttons.</p>
<p>If I disabled the touch then none of the controls on the view would work!</p>
<p>I found a solution by enhancing the SDK with a new &quot;scrollEnabled&quot; property in much the same way as touchEnabled. Note this is iOS only.</p>
<p>This is actually supported in iOS with a UIScrollView&#39;s &quot;scrollEnabled&quot; property.</p>
<p>Modify the SDK file TiUIScrollableView.m</p>
<p>add this</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">/* CSM: Provide ability to disable scrollviews scrolling when touched */</span>
-(<span class="hljs-typename">void</span>)<span class="hljs-string">setScrollEnabled_:</span>(id)args
{
    scrollingEnabled = [TiUtils <span class="hljs-string">boolValue:</span>args];
    [scrollview <span class="hljs-string">setScrollEnabled:</span>scrollingEnabled];
}
</code></pre><p>Down anywhere (I have it just after this)</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">-</span>(void)<span class="hljs-tag">setViews_</span>:(id)<span class="hljs-tag">args</span>
{
    <span class="hljs-tag">if</span> ((scrollview!=nil) &amp;&amp; ([scrollview subviews]&gt;<span class="hljs-number">0</span>))
    {
        <span class="hljs-attr_selector">[self refreshScrollView:[self bounds]</span> <span class="hljs-tag">readd</span><span class="hljs-pseudo">:YES</span>];
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Now you should also add the scrollingEnabled into your TiUIScrollableView.h. I put it at the bottom of the object definition.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    int cacheSize<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

    BOOL scrollingEnabled<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>Note. You don&#39;t need that variable, I just thought it&#39;d be nice to store it.. note I haven&#39;t done a gettor…</p>
<p>Then in you JS code you just do</p>
<p>yourscrollableview.scrollingEnabled = true&#x2F;false</p>
<p>And it now means you can programatically control the scrollable view without people moving them and yet controls on the views (in your array attached to the scrollable view if doing multiple) still respond.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>

							<div><p>I assume you&#39;ve done a clean build?</p>
<p>You can check that those changes over in the SDK directory are replicating to your actual build by looking in your projects</p>
<p>build&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;Classes&#x2F;TiUIScrollableView.m </p>
<p>Check that it has this modification</p>

    [[self scrollview] <span class="hljs-string">setScrollEnabled:</span>scrollingEnabled];
}
</code></pre><p>If its not there, and it is way back over in your SDK directory you&#39;ve either selected the wrong SDK file (easy if you&#39;ve got lots of SDK versions installed) or else you&#39;ve not done a clean build.</p>
<p>I&#39;m using this with 1.7.2 and have no problems with it working, but YMMV.</p>
<p>Note that the sequence is this</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    <span class="hljs-comment">/*
     * Create a scrollable view of all the signup screens 
     */</span>

    $.scroll = Titanium.UI.createScrollableView({
        scrollEnabled: <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>,
        views:[$.getmobile, $.getpassword, $.getconfirm]
    });


    $.winNav.add($.scroll);
</code></pre><p>then I open up the holding window afterwards.. ($.winNav is added to $.win (just a container window) and then $.win is .opened.. )</p>
<p>In case theres some sequencing.</p>

<p>It looks like the property that should be referenced in JS is scrollEnabled, not scrollingEnabled. Simply changing that in my code fixed it instantly. </p>

							<p>If anyone is still looking for help with this issue here, you should take note that as of Titanium SDK 2.0, you can use the property &quot;scrollingEnabled: false&quot; to disable user scrolling via swipe. You can then use on screen controls to programmatically scroll to the desired view.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, the property is scrollingEnabled, NOT scrollEnabled.</p>

							<p>Add the scrollableView to a parentView. Disable touchEnabled property of scrollableView.</p>
<p>Add the buttons to parentView (NOT to scrollableView), with an higher zIndex.</p>
<p>Capture clicks from buttons and slide the scrollableView whatever you want, using method scrollToView</p>

										<p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>The problem with this is that you then need to deal with placing controls on the parent view and knowing the positions relevant to scrolling of multiple front views. I had thought of this originally but since my needs are scrolling 3-4 different views it also broke up the logic&#x2F;code quite a bit too.</p>
<p>It would be nice if Appcelerator just added the attribute to the scrollable view as the code above shows as its all perfectly legal ios properties.</p>

							<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>I&#39;m having trouble getting this to work. I&#39;m using the latest 1.8 build but it just does not appear to want to work and I&#39;m unable to reference it. (Obviously, I&#39;ve tried clean builds and it appears within the classes the build is using)</p>

										<p><p>Make sure you read the comments as I had a typo in the original post.</p>
<p>Otherwise put in some NSLop(@&quot;We got here&quot;); sprinkled around those modifications to see if its getting called etc..</p>
<p>I&#39;ve not migrated up to 1.8 yet, but it should still work I&#39;d assume..</p>
