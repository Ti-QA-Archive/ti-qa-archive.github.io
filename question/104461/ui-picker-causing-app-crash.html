			<h1>ui picker causing app crash</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>i have a strange problem with the ui picker.  at one time i created a general picker successfully in my project and subsequently deleted it as it was not necessary.  with a new need for a date picker in the project, extracted the sample, modified it and used it in my source.  including that caused a crash, so subsequently removed pieces of the example until i had just 1 line relating to the picker.</p>
<p>var vendorPicker = Titanium.UI.createPicker();</p>
<p>which still gives</p>
<p>[WARN] attempted to load: TiUIPickerProxy<br>[ERROR] The application has crashed with an unhandled exception. Stack trace:</p>

							<p>have you tried clearing your build folder and forcing a full rebuild?</p>
<p>One thing I have recently been bitten by with Pickers is, it seems you must add the rows to the picker BEFORE adding the picker to the window. But, it sounds like you are crashing before even getting to that point.</p>
