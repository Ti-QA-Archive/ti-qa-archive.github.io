			<h1>Getting the app-icon in the status bar</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey there, </p>
<p>I was wondering if(and how) it&#39;s possible to get the icon of the app in the statusbar of the phone. So when you minimize the screen(Home button usually) the icon appears there making it easy to turn back to the app again. So not really a notification that something changed, just a heads up that it&#39;s still on and an easy to return to thing.</p>
<p>Android 2.2+, iOS 4.3+, Titanium SDK 3.0.0</p>

							<p>I&#39;m afraid you will have to rely on a local Notification to achieve that.</p>
<p>The main problem with this is not that it&#39;s technically feasible or not. But more to the fact that it goes against the Android good practices in terms of navigation. Thus increasing the chances of your application being rejected when submitting it to Google Play.</p>

										<p><p>I see, so you&#39;re basically advising against it?</p>
<p>But Google Play doesn&#39;t judge applications, right?</p>

										<p><p>Well, technically no.<br>But users can lodge complaints and after a certain number of those, they will look into it. </p>
<p>But if you think a little more about it. If all applications did this, there would be an overload of icons in the status area.</p>

										<p><p>The users you are trying to assist are not going to know what to do with your solution, those who know more - would know what to do anyway.</p>
<p>I am with Christian leave the app as it should be with the OS handling things - remember of course many Android implementations provide different solutions beyond the core - which you cannot account for.</p>
<p>Focus on the app - rather than this.</p>
