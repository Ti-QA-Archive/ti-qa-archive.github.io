			<h1>Facebook Logout does not log user out of facebook - iPad</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>[Using Ti SDK 1.6.2, iOs SDK 4.3]</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been struggling with a strange issue for over a week now. Searched everywhere and can&#39;t find an answer. </p>
<p>I&#39;m building an iPad app that allows a user to post a pre-canned message on their wall from the app. When they click the &quot;Post Status&quot; button in my app, they are taken to safari to log in to facebook and then authorize the app. Then they are brought back to the app at which point they get a confirmation message that their post was posted to their wall, and then i call Titanium.Facebook.logout() to automatically log the user out. This is necessary as another person will use that same iPad to do the same thing. I can&#39;t have the previous user still logged in. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, although all alerts i&#39;ve set confirm that the previous user is logged out, when the next user clicks &quot;Post Status&quot; and are brought to safari to log in, instead of the FB login screen, i get the &quot;You&#39;ve already authorized this app. Click Okay below to continue.&quot; along with the message at bottom that says &quot;You&#39;re logged in as John Doe. (Not You?)&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also tried placing a facebook login button on the page for testing. I get the same results. Even though when i click the FB logout button it switches to it&#39;s &quot;login&quot; state, indicating that i&#39;ve been logged out. When the next user clicks FB &quot;Login&quot;, same results as above. </p>
<p>One thing i&#39;ve noticed. In Titanium, if i run the simulator with iOS SDK 4.1, i get the old in-app facebook dialog window (instead of redirect to safari) and log in&#x2F;logout work perfectly. Unfortunately, even if i package for 4.1, if the physical iPad the app is running on has 4.2 or 4.3 installed, all of the above issues come back. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried the kitchen sink example, and I&#39;m having the same issues. So wondering if it has something to do with iOS 4.2&#x2F;4.3.</p>
<p>Help?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Michael</p>

							<p>I figured it out. It was an issue with Ti SDK 1.6.x. (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-3169) I upgraded to 1.7 and i&#39;m now able to pop up the FB dialog box within the app. This gives the app true control over the authentication, so when I log out, it actually fully logs me out of FB. Thanks everyone for the help!</p>

							<p>On the FB logout event I would also explicitly set Ti.Facebook.uid to null too. </p>
<p>Also, if you want to make sure the app doesn&#39;t have to keep re-authorizing, you need to also request the &#39;offline_access&#39; permission. This will provide your app user with an access token which ever expires.</p>

										<p><p>I tried adding Ti.Facebook.uid = null to the logout event handler and getting the same issue. Instead of logging the user out, it just keeps the same user logged in and says already authorized. </p>
<p>Regarding your second point, i do NOT want the access token to persist. Again, different people will be taking turns using the app in order to post the canned message on their individual walls. So I need the previous user completely logged out so that the next user can log in (without having to click the &quot;(Not you?)&quot; link to log out the previous user. The previous user should be cleared and the next user should be presented with the Facebook login screen.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help!</p>

							<p>OK. I see what you mean now:</p>
<p>To make sure the user is logged out then, how about using an App.Property to save the current user&#39;s access_token and login details&#x2F;name&#x2F;picture_url etc and then making sure that all your FB function calls use your saved version, rather than what the Ti FB login results provide?</p>
<p>eg: on the Ti.Facebook login event: </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Ti.App.<span class="hljs-keyword">Properties</span>.setString(<span class="hljs-string">'fb_access_token'</span>,Ti.Facebook.accessToken);
</code></pre><p>etc..</p>
<p>Then, when your user leaves the app &#x2F; logs out, simply clear the Property out</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Ti.App.Properties.setString(<span class="hljs-string">'fb_access_token'</span>,<span class="hljs-literal">null</span>);
</code></pre>

							<p>Yeah this is pretty much how it works. .logout() turns off the app&#39;s connection to facebook, but Safari is still logged in to facebook.</p>

										<p><p>Yep. Have that.  The app basically works fine. It posts the canned message to the logged in user&#39;s FB wall. It&#39;s just not logging out properly. In the app, when i click the FB logout button, my test alerts and the FB button state both indicate that the user is logged out. Then when i click login, safari still has the user logged in. I&#39;m not installing Ti Studio with the 1.7 sdk and see if that solves the issue. Thanks.</p>
