			<h1>phonegap 2.8x to Titanium 3.1.3</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>History:<br>We developed this app for internal use only and had it working under Phonegap 2.1.x. When mgt decided we needed to make the app public. Everyone upgraded their phones to Icecreame or later the app stopped working (mostly sqlite issues). We upgraded phonegap, tried various versions up and down, tried their Build product and 6 weeks later we have nothing that even resembles a working app and phonegap has been deemed useless and removed from all dev machines.</p>
<p>So, now we&#39;re looking at Titanium.  I have it installed, I&#39;ve been able to get Kitchen Sink to build, install and run. I&#39;ve created a few test projects that basically run.</p>
<p>Problem:<br>Problem is, I have no idea where to go from here. The getting started tuturial in the dashboard is out of date and doesn&#39;t even reflect the current UI if that&#39;s out of date, what else is out of date? (Personally, I have no desire to spend time chasing my tail because of bad info.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried creating an HTML application, copied the source files, .js files, jquery etc. in and that didn&#39;t work… didnt even load the index page but Eclipse gave lots of warnings because it didn&#39;t recognize the &lt;div&gt; ids.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t mind porting everything but honestly, the demos that you have don&#39;t resemble our UI at all and I&#39;m not seeing any tutorials on creating a UI (probably missing something).</p>
<p>This isnt a complex app… main screen has 4 icon-buttons, next screen has list of lists, other screens are simple forms (login, register etc.).</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure where to go from here…</p>

<p>Please go to the [marketplace](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com] and take a look into the videos. </p>
<p>In order to get any advantage in using Titanium, you will need to reimplement your app in a Titanium architecture. Otherwise, you won&#39;t get any advantage doing this port.</p>
<p>Best,</p>

							<p>Hello Phil,<br>I&#39;d suggest you to go the MVC way with Alloy, it&#39;s well enough <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Alloy_Quick_Start">documented</a> to let you fresh start your project. And here in this forum you&#39;ll find precious suggestions too, from a very collaborative comunity. Happy coding!</p>

										<p><p>Mauro&#39;s answer was kinda frightening… implication being that webview will not work! Yikes!!!</p>
<p>I looked at MVC&#x2F;Alloy… left more questions than answers (like is there an easy way to convert a css to tss)?</p>

										<p><p>WebViews do actually works, but I agree with Mauro when he says you will need to understand Titanium architecture and building patterns in order to take full advantage of its API.</p>
<p>You most likely will hav to recode your app from start, and probably wont even need to createWebView() to build your UI. The initial efforts in understanding Titanium (+Alloy!) will be surely rewarded. </p>
<p>Docs and fellow Ti users are your friends.</p>

										<p><p>I like the idea of Alloy.  The MVC architecture is pretty uncomplicated but there&#39;s still gaps in the information.  I think I need to find some tutorials and figure out how to transition from view to view (i.e. click on this, show that, back button does this, menu button pops up that). Lots of other questions like having a status bar at the top that can be updated, list controls etc.  I&#39;ll spend this afternoon rooting around and see what I can find.</p>

										<p><p>I guess what I was trying to say was that <em>mostly</em> people use Titanium to create <em>native</em> looking apps, not those wrapped in a Webview. It&#39;s not that it&#39;s impossible, and would be nice if the hybrid Web&#x2F;Native combination worked better - IMHO it just doesnt right now</p>

										<p><p>I have a full webview app developed under phonegap, runs under Chrome with no errors but won&#39;t even load under titanium webview… I&#39;m not opposed to learning something new, just hesitant when I hit a &quot;problem&quot; in my first step.</p>

										<p><p>The thing to remember is that Titanium android&#x2F;ios apps that use their respective WebViews are <em>not</em> using the Chrome&#x2F;Safari engines, they are the OS builtin versions. Also, earlier android devices (2.x versions) have known buggy implementations of them.</p>

										<p><p>The unfortunate task of frameworks (i.e. this, phonegap, jquery etc.) is to stablize functionality across releases and platforms… fail at that and I&#39;d think you failed your primary mission… Let me spend some time with the test code you sent me… see what I can figure out.</p>
