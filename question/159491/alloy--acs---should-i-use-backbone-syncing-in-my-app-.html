			<h1>Alloy + ACS - Should I use Backbone syncing in my app ?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Luckily (or not ?) I&#39;m getting some free time to work on a personal project, and as I get my head into it, I realise that the titanium backbone concept is not clear to me…</p>
<p>I would like to get some advice on the best practice in my case (Alloy + ACS):</p>
<ul>
<li>The app is supposed to use the ACS pictures system</li>
<li>A user is able to upload &#x2F; visualise &#x2F; delete a picture from his remote gallery</li>
<li>A general gallery with pictures from every users ordered by location can be viewed by everybody</li>
</ul>
<p>First I thought that the best scenario would be to maintain synchrozised the global gallery with the device… Then looking to the stars I imagined my project getting as big as Instagram… </p>
<p>Now it feels that backbone may not be the best solution because hopefully I would need to treat a huge number of pictures, am I right ?</p>
<p>Then I found the following widget that I could use https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FokkeZB&#x2F;nl.fokkezb.cachedImageView</p>
<p>To achieve my app I should use this widget and limit my ACS query to 20 for exemple. Every time I get to an end of the local gallery, a mechanism would jump to the next set of images from ACS and delete the current cached images.</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you think about the last scenario ?</li>
<li>Does anybody have better scenarios ?</li>
<li>Any exemple ?</li>
</ul>
<p>Best regards to all and long life to Alloy !<br>Clem</p>
