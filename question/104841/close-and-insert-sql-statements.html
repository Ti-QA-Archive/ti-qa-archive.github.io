			<h1>close() and Insert SQL statements</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>So I&#39;ve spent most of the afternoon trying to track this issue down.  I am having seriously weird SQL behavior that is causing my app to stop processing.  When I enable Trace as the filter in Ti Developer, I notice the following error:</p>
<p>[TRACE] W&#x2F;SQLiteCompiledSql( 1517): Releasing statement in a finalizer. Please ensure that you explicitly call close() on your cursor: INSERT INTO node (nid, vid, type, title, changed, data) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)<br>[TRACE] W&#x2F;SQLiteCompiledSql( 1517): android.database.sqlite.DatabaseObjectNotClosedException: Application did not close the cursor or database object that was opened here</p>
<p>Followed by a huge stack dump.</p>
<p>But that makes no sense whatsoever.</p>
<p>1) A select query should return a result set, and I can see the need to close() that result set but realistically it should self-close when the variable goes out of scope.  So far I have been unable to determine if that&#39;s even the case.</p>
<p>2) An insert statement does not return a result set, and I&#39;ve confirmed that the return value from execute() on an insert statement is null.  So there&#39;s nothing for me to close(), even if Ti would let me!</p>
<p>I am highly confused, but this is blocking further development on my app.  Any idea what is going on here?</p>
<p>If it matters, I&#39;m using Ti 1.5.1 in the Android emulator with Android API 2.2.</p>

<p>It seems as though the original poster has abandoned this thread.</p>
<p>During the time since his post, the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Using+TableViews">Using TableViews</a> guide has been published, which should answer these types of questions.</p>
<p>If, after reading that document, you continue to experience problems, please feel welcome to start a new thread, being mindful to include your platform, SDK versions, and your code so far.</p>
<p>If you post a link to your question here, I will take a look and try to help you.</p>
<p>Best of luck</p>
