			<h1>The design choice of disabling the inspector on titanium desktop</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Why was the decision made to disable the inspector on titanium desktop and have a complicated procedure to enable it again? </p>
<p>Using the inspector is the only way to debug on titanium desktop and disabling it seems to be an annoying decision. I also tried the instruction to put it back up but it is not working.</p>
<p>Can we have it there by default and only have it disabled in cloud builds? That seems like a much better way.</p>

										<p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Do you mean this link: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;119871&#x2F;osx-120rc1—show-inspector-disabled</p>
<p>Or something different. I would love to know a way to set this programmatically. Do you have a code snippet for this?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot</p>

										<p><p>Tried this on a new project in 1.2 and could not get the inspector to launch, I don&#39;t think it works unless the permission is set in the plist in the first place. </p>
<p>I think it is just a programmatically way of doing the same thing as the right click-&gt; show inspector.</p>

							<p>I have a simple application that does nothing more than Titanium.UI.GetMainWindow().showInspector(); When I run the app in titanium studio the app loads and inspector shows fine. However when I package my app for distribution and install the app, the inspector is not shown. </p>
<p>How can I enable inspector in my packaged app so that I can call on showInspector() and have it work? It is very difficult to debug the app on client machines if I can not see the inspector details.</p>

							<p>Jeremy,</p>
<p>This was enabled somewhere during the 1.2.0.RCx release candidates. I just tested packaging and app with 1.2.0.RC4 which is the latest on the packaging servers (will try to get 1.2.0.RC6d up in the next day or two), and it works fine after installing.</p>
<p>You could manually edit the Info.plist and add WebKitDeveloperExtras into it and set it for a boolean of true, or have your client execute this on the command line before running your app:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">$ defaults write app<span class="hljs-class">.id</span><span class="hljs-class">.from</span><span class="hljs-class">.your</span><span class="hljs-class">.app</span> WebKitDeveloperExtras -bool true
</code></pre><p>Let me know if that works for you. This is actually a problem with either the recent webkit or on Lion, I can&#39;t remember which. If your running on Lion you should not be using 1.1.0, it doesn&#39;t work properly and you should use 1.2.0.RC4. My guess is that your running on Snow Leopard???</p>

										<p><p>Alan, you are absolutely right, I am running snow leopard. Where can I get the 1.2.0RC4 SDK? Can you provide a download link?</p>

<p>You can get it from the blog post for the announcement:</p>

										<p><p>Alan, thanks for the link. I downloaded the SDK and re-packaged using 1.2.0.RC4 and installed the build and I am able to right click and pull up &#39;Inspect Element&#39; and get to inspector. However when I install the packaged app on windows I see no such option. How can I enable inspector for my windows users?</p>

<p>I thought it should work, it might need to be looked at on Windows. What version of Win are you running on?</p>

										<p><p>I am using win7 64-bit. Do I need to install titanium studio and the RC4 SDK on windows and try building it from there in order to get the inspector to show up in installed version of the app?</p>

										<p><p>Without looking at this, I&#39;m not sure. The SDK is only 32-bit, but that shouldn&#39;t matter, AFAIK. Best I can suggest is to file a helpdesk, and I&#39;ll look at it when I get a chance.</p>
