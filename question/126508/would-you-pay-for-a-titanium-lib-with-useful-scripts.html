			<h1>Would you pay for a Titanium Lib with useful scripts?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>A collegue and I are thinking about putting together a library of useful functions for Titanium Appcelerator and eventually sell it in the markeptplace. </p>
<p>We are both freelance developers and need to make a living, and since the code in question is purely Javascript there is no way for us to protect it.</p>
<p>If we would be to offer a lib which allows for colored badges on any view for instance, or additional hashing and crypto-methods, simplified database access, as well as debugging and profiling methods, would you be willing to pay for this? If so, how much would you be willing to pay? 5$ or even 10$?</p>
<p>The lib we have in mind is supposed to address common quirks and issues found when working with Titanium and could thus be a potential timesaver. </p>
<p>Please let us know what you think, even if you consider this to be a bad idea.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>multimedial.de</p>

							<div><p>Did you guys give any thinking about building a native module and distribute it? that was your code wouldn&#39;t be accessible - users will receive a compiled module.</p>
<p>As for paying 5-10 $ for a js script - sure. if it indeed save time writing stuff on my own. But it depends what kind of function it includes.</p>

							<div><p>Well, </p>
<p>what functions would you like to see that would make your life easier?</p>
<p>We got a hard time with the picker for instance, or with creating badges on any type of view (primarly buttons) incl. customizing of the color, gradient and font used…</p>
<p>We got a list of ideas, but if you got something that you miss… database results returned in JSON fashion for instance, or easier management of navigational groups … name it, we would like to hear what frustrates you when working with Titanium.</p>

										<p><p>This is iOS for the time being, sorry. </p>
<p>Plus, we could only offer solutions that could be solved with Javascript tricks alone, we wouldn&#39;t be publishing new modules (just yet maybe). </p>
<p>Which brings me to another issue:<br>the Titanium docs are incomplete and full of errors and missing pieces. Most of the interesting stuff is hidden in here, in the QA section. </p>
<p>It would be a nice idea to collect all these scripts, tricks and tips and roll them into a lib of its own, which (obviously) would probably have to be free. Some sort of toolbox or something. </p>
<p>Again, since I am a freelancer, I need to make my living and couldn&#39;t be offering this alone. I would find it quite worthwhile however to collect all the tidbits and pieces of knowledge so that dev work would be less frustrating for others…</p>

										<p><p>Our app (already selling in Apple App Store) uses a big pre-populated database (around 400MB). We&#39;ve been struggling on the installation of the database and trying to access it for a week now. We are trying to develop this app for Nook Color using Titanium.</p>

<p>can you post the structure of your databse? just the tables? I have done quite some work with SQlite, maybe there is room for optimization?</p>

										<p><p>Did you do &quot;vacuum&quot; on the database prior to distribute it in order to minize its size? Sorry if this sounds trivial, but SQlite has tendency to nlow up the initial size of its file after the import of data…</p>
<p>Would you be willing to share the db file so that I could have a look at it?</p>

										<p><p>Ricardo – I assume this 400MB db is downloaded once the app is installed, right?  Although the mobile android SDK does not have the &quot;file&quot; property of the httpclient that exists in iOS, there is a work around.  See <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;35041&#x2F;large-file-download-on-mobile.html#answer-197841">this</a> technique.  I have not tried 400MB, but I have done 30MB or so which is not possible using the f.write(xhr.responseData) technique.  </p>
<p>You may also want to consider downloading a compressed version of the file, then unzipping it on the device.  That could really reduce download time.  Since you have an Indie badge, you could use the Appcelerator compression module.  If you don&#39;t want to use a licensed module, you could look into <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;websiteburo&#x2F;androzip">androzip</a>.</p>

							<p>Do it and put it on the market :) Maybe it won&#39;t be a blowing sale, but I think in time will pay off, as more and more developers are approaching Titanium and many of them are not so experimented.</p>
<p>For iOs you can make a compiled module if you are afraid that people will steal your code.</p>

										<p><p>Ah, yes, it&#39;s not so simple. My library needs a rewrite because I found that some things could be better, some things are not done yet and so on. Also, currently I&#39;m targeting Android only, but I should target iOS also (I need to get appropriate Apple devices). </p>
<p>So, there is a lot of work to be done … Unfortunately, currently I&#39;m not freelancer so I can&#39;t focus only on that (and it might remain just my wish to implement all what I have in mind :( ).</p>
<p>If you need help and&#x2F;or ideas with your library, please don&#39;t mind asking, I would gladly help you. :)</p>
