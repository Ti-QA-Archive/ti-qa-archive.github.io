			<p>Hi, i&#39;m new on Titanium and thinking of the best way to show a large (&gt;1000 rows) table. The data should come via HTTP (JSON). As webdeveloper i would load the rows if he scrolls down, but what do you do in an app ?</p>

							<p>There are a few options here.</p>
<p>You can load the rows as they scroll down, which is a standard way, you can add paging so left and right, not quite so standard.</p>
<p>But the key is not to download 1000 rows at once, and not to have 1000 rows in memory so if you had 10 on the screen you could have the previous and next 10 in memory to scroll to then load the rest etc.</p>
<p>You only have limited resources on the phone and more than that could kill the app.</p>
<p>Also as per other posts use classname to skin each row so that performance is increased.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>T.</p>

										<p><p>thanks both for your answers. maybe i should improve my question ;)</p>
<p>of course i have to load the data only if its neccessary. but is there anything special ? a part of the api or something which will do this, or must i reinvent the wheel ?</p>
<p>i&#39;m a webdeveloper but realy at the beginning of mobile development. for webapplication i have my own scripts or mootools plugins ..</p>

										<p><p>There is no special component to this is automatically. if you want to detect when you&#39;re scrolling towards the end of the tableview, you should look at Dynamic Scrolling in the KitchenSink:</p>

							<p>I guess that if you limit the scrolling to 25 results, and detect scroll down to the bottom of the list, you could just add another 25 rows to the current one, so you have 50, 57, 100 etc. which means the users will actually have to scroll 40 pages to get 1000 rows, which most of them don&#39;t do. Also make sure you have className in the tableViewRow, to improve performance.</p>
