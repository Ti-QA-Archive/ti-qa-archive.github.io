			<h1>(Any) Alloy app hangs at splash screen on iOS device - wrong app.js used?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have posted a comment to a similar thread <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;153126&#x2F;install-app-on-ipad-stuck-on-splash-screen#comment-191656">here</a>, but seeing as that question is considered to be answered (with a solution that cuts no mustard in my setup) I am posting a fresh question:</p>
<h2 id="for-those-with-limited-attention-span-">For those with limited attention span:</h2>
<p>it appears that in my environment the platform-specific app.js file generated by Alloy is being ignored and the (empty) app.js file generated in Resources&#x2F;app.js is being used instead!</p>
<h2 id="for-those-interested-in-the-the-rest-of-the-whole-sad-saga-">For those interested in the the rest of the whole sad saga:</h2>
<p>When testing any alloy app in the iOS simulators on Xcode 5.0 (iOS SDK 7.0) all is well. When attempting to deploy those same apps to device (iPad and&#x2F;or iPhone 4) the app just hangs at the splash screen.<br>As shown in the linked comment, the Xcode console seems to report a successful app boot sequence with no errors.<br>However, I noted that it reports <code>&amp;lt;Warning&amp;gt;: [DEBUG] Loading: &amp;#x2F;var&amp;#x2F;mobile&amp;#x2F;Applications&amp;#x2F;...&amp;#x2F;Play Alloy 1.app&amp;#x2F;app.js, Resource: app_js</code> as the app.js file being loaded. This led me to believe that the iPhone-specific app.js located in Resources&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;app.js is not being loaded, but rather the empty on in Resources&#x2F;app.js!<br>This was further supported by the fact that a breakpoint in Resources&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;app.js never breaks, even though the debugger connects OK.</p>
<p>I was finally able to prove the point by replacing the code in Resources&#x2F;app.js (Ti Studio warnings about the locked &quot;derived&quot; file notwithstanding) with that from the generated Resources&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;app.js and <em>voila!</em>, the app started running on the device like it should…</p>
<p>I have tried to:</p>
<ul>
<li>install the basic Alloy Hello World project (from using default Alloy Project Template in Studio),</li>
<li>install the TestHarness project from the alloy.git repo with only a single view&#x2F;controller and one Picker control,</li>
<li>install my own Alloy project,</li>
<li>install an arbitrary &quot;ready-made&quot; Alloy project from GitHub.</li>
<li>clean the project before building</li>
<li>do <code>alloy compile</code> using the CLI</li>
<li>do <code>ti build ... -D development</code> (as suggested in one answer that got some votes in the linked thread)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m on the latest and greatest for all components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Titanium Studio 3.1.3</li>
<li>Xcode 5.0 with Simulators running iOS SDK 7.0</li>
<li>Latest iPad running iOS 7.0.2</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-question-therefore-">The question therefore:</h2>
<p>Is someone able to point out what I should be doing&#x2F;configuring so that the correct app.js is being used when running on an iOS device after a fresh compile&#x2F;build cycle? (I don&#39;t have an Android device, so don&#39;t know if this would happen for a different platform as well).</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Francois.</p>

							<p>This behavior was a bug in the TiSDK and depending on your specific symptoms, should have been covered by 1 of these 2 tickets, likely the first one:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-14884">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-14884</a></li>
<li><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-14683">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-14683</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I believe the latest CI builds have resolved it. You can install the latest TiSDK from github by issuing the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">titanium sdk install --branch <span class="hljs-keyword">master</span>
<span class="hljs-title">titanium</span> sdk select TISDK_VERSION_YOU_JUST_INSTALLED
</code></pre><p>After that completes, attempt to run your app with the new version, setting it in your app&#39;s tiapp.xml. This should resolve that issue. If it does not, please report it in the linked ticket(s) above.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the prompt response, Tony.</p>
<p>My workaround (copying the generated app.js to the empty one) is pretty painless at present so if I don&#39;t get around to testing the latest CI build I can probably live with it until the next GA release.<br>I&#39;ll mark your response as the best answer so long…</p>
