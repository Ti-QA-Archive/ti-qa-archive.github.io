			<h1>Does Titanium create native app for really?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi folks, just a simple question: if Titanium creates native app it means that, in the case of Android, Titanium generates a real APK file similar to what I can get using only the Google stuff. So, if it is correct why in the APK file created by Titanium Studio there is a javascript intepreter? (a very huge file that increases enormously the size of the APK) Why I need a js intepreter if the native app is in Java? So it is not true that Titanium creates native app because part of the program remains in Javascript… How this stuff works? Thanks to everyone who can clarify  this point.</p>

							<p>Hi,<br>In Titanium JS code is compiled almost one to one into the representative symbols in nativeland. There&#39;s still an interpreter running in interpreted mode otherwise things like dynamic code wouldn&#39;t work. However, its much faster, much more compact and it&#39;s about as close to pure native mapping as you can get.<br>For this reason the titanium compiled api is a bit larger than apk build using bogle stuff only.</p>

							<p>Ti generates a native app. Everything related  to the UI and other native capabilities (like gps, media, etc, well everything) is native.<br>However, the logic of the app is in JS ( like click that button it opens that window), so this is why you need the V8 JS engine behind.</p>

							<p>Hi Mario,<br>The code you write in Titanium get compiled into native code, to get this verified open your project and go into Desktop&#x2F;Projects&#x2F;project name&#x2F;build&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;–&gt; here you will find the .xcodeproj file for ios. You can open this file in xcode. This is actually the project extesion in xcode. For android similarly you can find android folder in build</p>

										<p><p>The fact that it has a &quot;.xcodeproj&quot; file doesn&#39;t mean is native, PhoneGap has is too and it is NOT native at all.</p>
