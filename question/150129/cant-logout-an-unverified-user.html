			<h1>Can&#39;t logout an unverified user.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>When trying to log out a user that was just created using ACS Users.create, but has not verified their account yet. I receive this error.</p>
<p>&quot;You have to confirm your account before continuing&quot;</p>
<p>Unless I&#39;m doing something wrong, I believe this to be a design flaw. What if a user entered an incorrect email and your app re initializes their session on app start and forces them to an awaiting verification window? The user is stuck.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure with some ingenuity I could work out a different work flow to work around this, but I&#39;d honestly rather not.</p>
<p>I&#39;m just looking to confirm this design was intentional and maybe a fix if anyone agrees with me.</p>

							<p>I found a workaround for my setup. I don&#39;t really like the way it works, but it works.</p>
<p>I changed my create user setup so it is now using an HTTPClient instead of the Cloud.Users.create method. Then if I need to log the user out, rather than making a call to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.cloud.appcelerator.com&#x2F;v1&#x2F;users&#x2F;logout.json or Cloud.Users.logout(). I used the HTTPClient.clearCookies() method instead.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">client</span>.clearCookies(<span class="hljs-string">"https://api.cloud.appcelerator.com"</span>);
</code></pre><p>I have a unique registration setup that allows the first user to register a second user at the same time. This is the main reason I discovered this problem.</p>
<p>My first user &quot;A&quot; was trying to create a new account for the second User &quot;B&quot;. After user &quot;B&quot; was created, I had the need to log user &quot;B&quot; out before I could continue with the app as user &quot;A&quot;. </p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if any of this made any sense. I spent a week figuring it out myself, but maybe this could help someone else along the way. Though I still think a user should be able to log out even if their account is unverified.</p>

							<p>I would be very interested to know if there was an outcome on this one?</p>
<p>The auto login of Create User makes the account verification feature unusable unless there is a way to also first force a logout. In addition no other account logins can work without restarting the app.</p>
<p>Until this is resolved I am going to give up on account verification and simply log newly registered users directly into the app.</p>
<p>Nice workaround though Justin ;)</p>
