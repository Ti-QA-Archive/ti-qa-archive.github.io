			<p>Right now I&#39;m alway from the Studio where I build my app, but I wold like to install the &quot;private&quot; build here to test. So I realised that I only have access to the public page for the build in the Studio I build the app. There is a way to find out the page? There is a link on the Q&amp;A Profile site or somewhere else to find out all the public pages for the apps I may have build?</p>

										<p><p>On Studio, on a project, you can click in the little cube icon and click the &quot;View Last Package Distribution&quot; to see the last builds. There you have the Public link at the bottom too, that looks like &quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.appcelerator.net&#x2F;p&#x2F;pages&#x2F;app_page?token=XXXXXX&quot;.</p>
<p>What if I&#39;m off this Studio? Like if I&#39;m at my friend&#39;s house and want to show him what I had done, but forgot to note the Public Link?<br>There is some place that I can find all my projects builds by my username (email)?</p>
<p>With that question came another doubt to me!</p>
<p>If I lost my Studio installation for some reason, I now I can import the sources backup to another Studio, but how cold I keep rebuilding new versions and get my users to Auto-Update with the &quot;Ti.UpdateManager&quot; (I&#39;m talking about the Desktop API)?<br>I believe that I wold like to know how to reuse the &quot;token&quot; that seems to be the ID, Appcelerator gives to an App I have created.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m speaking about Titanium Mobile, I don&#39;t know if desktop API is different.</p>
<p>As far as I know, your builds are not sent to appcelerator in any way. You can see a list of all your projects if you are logged in appcelerator wep page, clicking over your username on the top of the page and, after that, click on &quot;APPS&quot; on top menu. But is only a list of projects with access to analytics, no builds downloads at all.</p>
<p>You can access to your iOs builds in development from iTunes (right click the app and select &quot;reveal in finder&quot;). And your builds for distribution (those you would upload to iTunes connect) in xCode organizer.</p>

										<p><p>I just saw my.appcelerator.com (hehe never clicked over my name). Yeah, there I can see all my builds and on the details I see the &quot;App GUID&quot; that maybe is what ties my builds. But there is no link at all to the builds there. </p>
<p>Looks like the Desktop builds are really different from the mobile ones. The desktop builds are sent to Appcelerator, for 2 reasons. First I need to download the build from appcelerator if I want to install and test the installation, it is not on my machine. Second it needs to be there so the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;desktop&#x2F;latest&#x2F;Titanium.UpdateManager-module">Titanium.UpdateManager</a> can work.</p>
<p>I&#39;m still don&#39;t have idea of how to rebuild the same app from a different Studio installation. I need to check the guid inside the tiapp.xml but it did&#39;nt make any difference last time I checked. </p>
<p>Anyway I still can&#39;t find out the build links if not by noting it down from the Studio I built the App. Maybe it is just another thing &quot;forgot&quot; by Appcelerator because is not part of the TI Mobile SDK. I swear that I don&#39;t understand why the Desktop SDK is a second (third?) class passenger.</p>

							<p>Today it got me again. I lost the link to the package builds and was not able to find it. Now I need to wait for sunday so I can get to the Studio where I build the packages to get the link.</p>
<p> Everyday I got more afraid of lost this machine and Studio for any reason. If that heapens I believe that I&#39;ll need to start over the versioning of my app or something! I&#39;m really lost here without help about that issue.</p>
<p> I really am the only one with that problem?</p>
