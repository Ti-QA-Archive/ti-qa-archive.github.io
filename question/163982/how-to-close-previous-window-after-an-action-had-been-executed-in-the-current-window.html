							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Your question is either not very clear or is clear but what you want is not a good idea.  You have not said if the windows are opened modally, within a tabgroup or distinctly.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the new window is modal;</p>
<p>If you open a new modal window, you should not be closing a previous a window opened below this one</p>
</li>
<li><p>tabGroup</p>
<p>If you open a window as part of an iOS tabgroup nav stack then you should not close one previously added to this tab</p>
</li>
<li><p>You open a new distinct window</p>
<p>You should not close a window opened previously below this window</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You may have spotted a pattern here.  If you open a new window, actions on this window should not close a window you have already opened within this navigational path the user has be taken through.</p>

										<p><p>Hi thanks for your comments. This is what I want to do, I have two distinct windows A and B. B was opened after a button in A was clicked, Now I  want to close window A  after a button in window B is clicked.<br> The problem is, I know Window A is still in the stack of opened windows, I don&#39;t want it to appear when the back button is clicked for both android and IOS.<br>I hope what I have written is clear.</p>
