			<h1>Multiple XCODE releases - Howto?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Dear Appceleratorists:</p>
<p>Where do I begin? Well, 1st of all Merry Christmas! </p>
<p>Can someone kindly tell me how (what the method is) of installing multiple xcode releases. I have currently installed XCODE release 5 that produces target iOS 7.0.x apps. </p>
<p>I could continue using this, but I prefer to stick to iOS 6.0.x target release as:</p>
<p>a) First and foremost - the iOS simulator i was familiar with worked nicely. For some reason, I get this ridiculous large iPhone simulation window. I never had that before. </p>
<p>b) My apps that I coded in 2011 works well on iOS 7. </p>
<p>I did the silly thing of erasing my IDE and now I can&#39;t get the original settings that allowed me to produce the apps I did. </p>
<p>Many thanks gentlepeople,<br>EBK</p>

							<p>I currently have 3 different xcodes installed.</p>
<p>One is in &#x2F;Applications, this is the latest release through the app store.<br>On my desktop are 2 more (both 5.x gen).</p>
<p>I use <code>xcode-select</code> to bounce between them.  Since I don&#39;t use Studio, my switching is very quick.  Studio seems to require that you repoint to the xcode you want to use each time you change.</p>

<p>While that may be true, Apple will cut off (if they haven&#39;t already) accepting apps not build with 7.x</p>

<p>Try opening the simulator manually, set the scale, then closing it.  See if that allows ti to launch it at the size (and location) that you prefer</p>
