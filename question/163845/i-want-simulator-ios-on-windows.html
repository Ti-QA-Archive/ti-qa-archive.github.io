							<p>Hi</p>
<p>You said you asked before about this - you did, I answered you - and gave you the correct answer.  Just because you do not like the answer, it does not make it wrong.</p>
<p>The iOS simulator is part of xcode, xcode only works on a Mac - so you NEED a MAC.  This is not a limitation of Appcelerator Titanium - it is Apples&#39; decision and is unlikely to change.</p>
<p>If you still do not believe me read section <strong>2</strong> of the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;images.apple.com&#x2F;legal&#x2F;sla&#x2F;docs&#x2F;xcode.pdf">Mac SDK and XCODE agreement</a>.</p>
<p>This was your previous question as well as my answer;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;163334&#x2F;i-dont-know-get-ios-sdk">i don&#39;t know get IOS SDK</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So again - you may not like the answer but if you wish to develop for iOS you HAVE to use a Mac.</p>
<p>So go back to the first question and mark it as correct - there can be no different answer.  Then choose either of these answers and mark one correct - there can be no different answer.</p>

										<p><p>You did not make me mad.  I was just disappointed that I took the time to point out that what you were asking was not possible.  Having been told it was not possible you ask again and suggest that the first time you asked you were given information that did not help you.</p>
<p>The reason I ask that you mark questions as answered is so others who come afterwards and look for the same solution to the same problem will know it cannot be done.  Leaving them unmarked leaves people as confused as you were.</p>
<p>I hope you are not confused now.,</p>

							<p>This is what I&#39;m looking for today. &lt;sarcasm&gt;Nice to see such a friendly community.&lt;&#x2F;sarcasm&gt;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been doing a little bit of mobile development in Alpha Anywhere (AA). It&#39;s quite an impressive system in many ways, but I&#39;m not fond of its point-and-click interface (naturally, in modern interfaces there is a good deal of that for various things, but I feel entirely too separated from code in the case of AA). However, what I am used to with AA is their simulator for the app. You can simulate the app regardless of the final platform. I have no problem coding and testing my app in Windows and then deploying for iOS, Android, or Windows phone via AA&#39;s built-in support of PhoneGap Build. I actually have a Mac, but I&#39;d really like to centralize my development on one machine and not have to switch back and forth. I can do that with AA. Not that there might not ever be things that work in the simulator that don&#39;t work (or don&#39;t work the same) when run on the device, but that really hasn&#39;t been a problem for me. At the very least, I can do the great majority of simulation and testing in AA via their simulator and then build install on the iPhone and do further testing there. That works well for me and I don&#39;t see any reason Appcelerator can&#39;t do the same.</p>
<p>As an aside, what kind of crappy forum software is this? It does not word-wrap worth a crap. When the insertion point gets to the end of a line, it just wraps right in the middle of a line with part of the word at the end of the previous line and part of the word moved down to the beginning of the next line. I&#39;m not sure what this will look like when I post it. Pretty lame. My experience installing the product and getting registered today has been a PITA. I keep running into issues every time I turn around and so I&#39;m not gaining confidence in this product.</p>

							<p>Hi Hamad Almuhaysin, </p>
<p>It is not possible to develop iOS applications on a Windows machine (except for Adobe AIR for iOS applications). The SDK only works on a Mac.</p>
<p>f you are interested in Adobe AIR, see some examples here:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.adobe.com&#x2F;flashplayer&#x2F;2011&#x2F;06&#x2F;adobe-air-2-7-now-available-ios-apps-4x-faster.html">Adobe AIR</a></p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>One way you can do this on a Windows PC is by using VMWare and a copy of OSX to install Xcode and Titanium on. You&#39;d need a fairly powerful PC.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macincloud.com&#x2F;">Mac Cloud</a></p>
<p>But it is not preferable, you have to use a Mac PC for iOS simulator.</p>

										<p><p>@Md.Harish-Uz-Jaman Mridha; You can only use xcode on Apple computers as noted in their agreement (see link in my answer), so attempting to use xcode on any other type of computer breaches the agreement and may mean the Apple iOS developer account will be terminated and any apps in the store will be removed.  Not ideal, better not to risk it.</p>
<p>Additionally; whilst you have suggested Adobe Air as an alternative, keep in mind that it does not provide native UI and it is still not possible to upload the app to the Apple App store without a mac - as detailed in the Adobe Air documentation.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Important: Apple requires that you use the Apple Application Loader program in order to upload applications to the App Store. Apple only publishes Application Loader for Mac OS X. Thus, while you can develop an AIR application for the iPhone using a Windows computer, you must have access to a computer running OS X..</em></li>
</ul>
<p>So the answer remains the same - needs a mac to create iOS apps.</p>
