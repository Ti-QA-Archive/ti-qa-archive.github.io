		<section>
			<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>i&#39;m currently facing a problem when deleting items on iOS with &quot;swipe to delete&quot;. Once i swipe, the red deleteView is shown. In my case, i want to click the &quot;deleteView&quot;, display an alertDialog and if the user clicks OK, the row needs to be deleted. </p>
<p>Perfect example: Exiting WhatsApp groups from the chat-list.</p>
<p>Currently in Titanium, once i click the deleteView, the delete event is fired and the row is deleted automaticly. So my question: a) Is there a way to manage the whatsapp-like way? b) If not, can i open a jira ticket for that?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Short answer - no.</p>
<p>Longer anger answer;</p>
<p>From a user experience perspective, the aim is to make sure that any destructive actions are not performed accidentally.  By swiping the row and then pressing the button the expectation is that those two required staged actions make sure that the delete is not accidental.  This is also balanced with allowing the user the opportunity to perform the action quickly if the choose to perform it on many rows one after the other.</p>
<p>This is the idea of balance - enough protection from accidental usage combined with only enough steps so it does not become a pain for the user.</p>
<p>As to &quot;could you create a work around&quot; - technically yes.  But you will have to put the work in as the automatic delete option will have to go and you will be adding your own (chances are how whatsapp have achieved it).</p>
<ul>
<li>You remove the delete option from rows</li>
<li>you add a delete red view with a label inside and anchor it to the right of the row</li>
<li>create an internal row wrapper and fix the width to the device width NOT Ti.UI.FILL</li>
<li>add an event to that view for sliding action via touch start and touch end or swipe</li>
<li>on the event you move the wrapper to the left so part of it is not seen and it then reveals the red view</li>
<li>add you confirm action here </li>
</ul>
<p>HOWEVER you will find it hard to place your red view flush right, so it may not look identical to the ios7 version.</p>
<p>Should you create a jira? That one is up to you, no reason why not - there might be a hook we are currently not exposed to.</p>
