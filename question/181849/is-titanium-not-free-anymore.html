			<h1>Is Titanium not free anymore?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Well, today I saw the announcement about Platform 4.0. And I also saw that Appcelerator has changed their site. I wanted to log in and see if those changes that are being talked about are already avilable, but when trying to log in it says that I don&#39;t have an account (same account I&#39;m using to write this message) - even when I tried to log in to Q&amp;A it says the same this - the only reason I&#39;m able to write is because I managed to click a link inside the Titanium Studio that leads me to a logged in page.</p>
<p>Even if you are a new user and want to download Titanium - no longer available without an invite!</p>
<p>On the site there&#39;s a new &quot;Pricing&quot; page - nothing on it about the free usage. All I care about is the Studio and SDK - not ACS or Analytics at this point.</p>
<p>So before I continue on with my project I really need to know what&#39;s happening in Appcelerator right now - is the platform going to stay free? I need to know before I continue my work on a project I started working on because if I&#39;m to choose a different platform (even native is an option) then now is the time…</p>
<p>thanks</p>

										<p><p>@Francois can you be more specific?</p>
<ul>
<li>How did you update Titanium Studio? We didn&#39;t push an update for that.</li>
<li>How is Titanium Studio breaking related to needing to creating an account on the platform?</li>
<li>In what way does your old account not seem to be linked to the new one?</li>
</ul>
<p>To clarify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your Titanium account and Appcelerator account are 2 separate things.</li>
<li>When you create an Appcelerator account using the email address of an existing Titanium account we import your profile and assign you a free Indie seat.</li>
<li>You need to manually <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.appcelerator.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;migrate-app">migrate</a> your apps to the platform</li>
</ul>

<p>Why do you want to target 16? You can target 21 and still have 14 as the minimum.</p>
<p>Even so, I just did an Android build in Appcelerator Studio 4.0 and though you need Android 21 to be installed (I use 22) it will build a project that uses the 3.5.1 SDK and targets 16.</p>

										<p><p>@Robert, I understand your problem but I&#39;m not sure we can do anything about it. If your account was created with the company email address of your previous employer, then who are we to decide the free seat isn&#39;t theirs?</p>
<p>Anyway, send an email to support@appcelerator.com explaining your case.</p>

<p>You can decide that you are giving accounts to email addresses and not humans if you want.<br>That&#39;s your right.  But I have been in control of this account continuously since 2010, and the name on my driver&#39;s license is Robert Dupuy.</p>
<p>Do you get my drift?  Either you intend to reward developers who have been with you from the start or you don&#39;t.  But I have been continuously an Appcelerator developer since 2010.</p>
<p>And I haven&#39;t worked for that employer for 1 1&#x2F;2 years.  I&#39;m not saying, don&#39;t give them a free account - but one should realize that you have just created a glitch by not allowing people to change their email because you used it as an identifier.</p>
<p>I wrote them, they didn&#39;t write back.</p>

										<p><p>@Fokke, why are you restricting the new users, after March 31st, by forcing them to purchase the seat at $39 just to use Appcelerator framework?</p>
<p>Don&#39;t you think that there will be loss in interest for newly registered developers to work on this platform ?</p>
<p>&amp; please clarify this point &quot;6. if you wish to continue to use the OSS version you will have to build the SDK from source yourself&quot;, what does it mean by building the SDK from source &amp; how it is different than we used to update SDKs until now ?</p>

										<p><p>If by &quot;just to use the Appcelerator framework&quot; you mean the SDK, this will remain free. The only difference is that Appcelerator will no longer provide certified, fully tested builds. You will have to build the SDK yourself as described in the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Building_the_Titanium_SDK_From_Source">guides</a>.</p>
<p>If you mean the full Appcelerator Platform that until now was reserved for big enterprises with prices starting at several thousands of dollars per month… yes, we are now making available for everyone, starting at just $39&#x2F;seat&#x2F;month.</p>

							<p>With all the above discussion it seems that appcelerator is no longer free as it was earlier. Prashant raised exact question Why would a new user will come to appcelerator to build an app if its no longer free?</p>
<p>It there is no free ACS and push notification with minimum 5 or 1 million calls for new users then it means ACS and push are now completely paid. </p>
<p>For example if a small vendor wants to build an app for his business with all the features like ACS and push and he knows that he won&#39;t exceed 5 million api calls &amp; push, he is ready to choose appcelerator. Build his business app upload it, when business grows he gets ready to pay extra. Now any new customer has to pay $39&#x2F;monthly. I think with this move appcelerator will see decrease in new customers and app counts. Why not some one new think about phonegap or xamarin  ?<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phonegap.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;10&#x2F;13&#x2F;phonegap-build-pricing-plans-update&#x2F;<br>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.xamarin.com&#x2F;</p>

										<p><p>The facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Existing users get a free for life $39&#x2F;month Indie seat</li>
<li>New users can try&#x2F;develop for free, but yes; to publish he has to purchase the Indie seat</li>
</ul>
<p>You can keep running from vendor to vendor to not pay any money, but al of them in the end have to pay their bills. Maybe as developers we&#39;ve become a bit spoiled with free software? As an entrepreneur you have to make investments. Those who start a physical shop, pay rent before their first sell, those who start a digital venture invest in design, brand and yes… the software that forms the very core of their business.</p>

										<p><p>Fokke, Thanks for your comment. </p>
<p>I know $39&#x2F;month is not a big amount for push services, ACS etc. Correct me if I am wrong, for what you are charging $39 per month are (push, analytic, arrow), whereas similar services are already available for free up to some limits like parse, urban airship, Google analytics. </p>
<p>So my point here is why if something is initially free is now paid ? If you charge for additional services that is fine. Why would I develop if I cannot publish it free, which was possible earlier for new users.</p>
<p>Apple and Google are charging for app store publish (this is completely fine) and now appcelerator will charge for publishing so this will be additional cost (I again say its not big amount). If it was not free earlier, I would not have raised this point. So the change from free to paid is a concern.</p>
<p>If I have to develop a simple app without ACS and push, why would I choose to develop it on appcelelerator if I have to pay $39&#x2F;month to publish. I would choose to develop it native on Google or swift iOS. This way I will have to pay only yearly app store fees and be free from monthly appcelerator subscription. </p>
<p>There are many simple utility apps, knowledge apps, static content apps developed. These vendors simple use appcelerator to quickly develop and pay only for app store fees. Now if you guys will also charge then they will move to native development and be free from recurring expenses. Such apps do not make money but useful to end users.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestion to appcelerator</strong>, why not you keep the publish free and charge $39&#x2F;mon for ACS and push notification in Indie plan. This way if an app not using ACS, push, analytics will still be able to develop and publish. </p>
<p>I am a appcelerator fan and love to work on. But I am worried our new customers may think twice.</p>

							<p>Titanium will remain free as Jeff Haynie stated in the presentation he did a couple of days ago, he also added that the project will stay on Github.</p>
<p>From what I understand, and I might be wrong, sooner or later Titanium framework as we know it will become history: I am not talking about Titanium syntax and namespaces here but the way our Javascript code will be executed natively and the way we are going to extend the framework with native functionality later on.</p>
<p>If you want to see how the new platform will become you can take a look at the Window implementation at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_mobile_windows and specifically the new way Titanium is implemented at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_mobile_windows&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;Source&#x2F;TitaniumKit</p>
<p>In addition to that, the email Jeff sent said that the new Appcelerator subscription will give you access to &quot;certified releases&quot;, so if the whole new Ti is available on Github it means [And I hope that Appcelerator staff correct me if I am wrong] you can still compile your own version of the new versions of Titanium as well.</p>

<p>&gt; @supervill_dev82 Titanium Studio is still free, just no longer going to be upgraded. Isn’t #Appcelerator Studio starting at $39&#x2F;month?</p>
<p>so I&#39;m a bit confused - no more SDK updates?</p>

										<p><p>I am honestly so frustrated with this complete lack of information. I have watched the keynote, asked questions on the forums and I feel exactly the same? What is going on? Please just clarify this. Can I or can I not use titanium, should I run for the hills or bother learning this platform? I feel like appcelerator is trying to sell me a timeshare….</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m a Titanium developer, I&#39;m using Titanium Studio and developed an application using Titanium SDK. the current application in maintenance phase and need some functional updates. can I use the Titanium Studio in coming months beyond June 30th 2015? can I publish android and iOS updates in coming months?

<li>Titanium Studio will be discontinued after June 30. It might continue to work until we shut down the authentication back-end on Sep 1.</li>
<li>You can continue to use the OSS Titanium CLI, SDK and Alloy. However, we will only provide nightly builds of the SDK.</li>
<li>As an existing Titanium user you get a free Indie seat for life if you signup for the Appcelerator platform using the same email address.</li>

							<p><strong>Development on the new platform is free up to the point where you need to publish your first app</strong></p>
<p>why don&#39;t just compile the app for Android and iOS, get the ipa and apk, and then manually publish it to the relative app stores without using the Appcelerator Platform? In this way I will not have to pay anything. Am I missing something?</p>
