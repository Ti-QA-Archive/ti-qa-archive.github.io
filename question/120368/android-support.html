			<p>Hey,</p>
<p>I used Titanium recently to build an iPad app and was generally happy with it. I had some issues but nothing I couldn&#39;t circumvent using various workarounds. Besides that the app went live and the client was very happy with it.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been asked to evaluate doing another app this time it would be for iPhone and Android. I&#39;m pretty sure my experience with iPad will be the same with the iPhone so no worries there. Instead Android is more the unknown.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve read several tweets and posts mentioning that Titanium&#39;s Android support is quite buggy and not on par with its iOS support. The app itself wouldn&#39;t be too complicated, tabgroups, navigationgroups, geolocation&#x2F;maps and content stored in an sqlite db, with a process to update the db when online.</p>
<p>So just looking for some opinions? Is it worth taking the plunge? Are there features I <em>should</em> avoid or are quite buggy? Pitfalls to be avoided? Also what versions of Android does Titanium support as we may have to support all the way down to 1.6.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Pat</p>

							<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been working on Android for a long time. One of the larger problems I face with using Titanium is that the tableView UI for android is clearly broken. If you&#39;re thinking of using a simple table with simple rows, it works fine. But try anything else fancy and the table view stutters and jerks while scrolling. </p>
<p>So if your app is going to be table view intensive with lots of graphics and rich media, I suggest that you either use a scroll view (and end up having to rewrite all the table view functionality like what I did), or give up on Titanium.</p>
<p>Anyone else has any other opinions?</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ve also notices strange issues with table view. For example, if I create view, add two labels with some data to that view and then add that view to the table view rows, labels that are first in the table are not rendered. If I add labels directly to table view row (without view) everything works fine.</p>
<p>Also, I&#39;ve noticed strange issues with heavyweight and lightweight windows and events. I haven&#39;t yet figured out what&#39;s causing the issues (debugging is awful). :(</p>
<p>It seems to me that learning and programming in Java for Android would be much less painful process.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ve also seen random strange behaviour with the table views on Android. Thanks for the hint with scroll view, I&#39;ll try that!</p>

										<p><p>The new 1.7 Mobile SDK that will soon be released does a LOT to fix these issues, you can get the CI build of 1.7 here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;index.html</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the responses guys, they are good issues to be aware of. My app will have some table views with images so it looks like I&#39;m going to have to do a basic test app to see how it performs. Is there an ETA of the 1.7 SDK as it is currently a RC?</p>
