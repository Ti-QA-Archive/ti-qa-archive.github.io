		<section>
			<p>Hey Guys,</p>
<p>My app is currently available in the App store. It&#39;s a simple informational app with photos. It&#39;s filesize was 70mb, I got it down to 50mb.  </p>
<p>There are a lot of photos and it seems the only way to get it below that golden &#39;20mb&#39; is to remove all images from the app. Can someone help me out as to how I can get the lower file size with out removing images? Am I missing something? I&#39;ve gone through the entire resources folder x amount of times for files not being, yet nothing.</p>
<p>Thanks guys!</p>

<p>Have you considered not shipping any of these photo images with the app? Instead, for the very first time the image needs to be displayed, download and save it locally (for future use) if the file does not already exist on the device.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>you could download the photos, then save them to the &#39;Ti.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory&#39; and access them from there, once they are downloaded. There&#39;s no need to save them in the camera roll&#x2F;photo gallery.</p>

										<p><p>What about shipping your app with lo-res versions of all images (optimized using <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Third-party+Tools#Third-partyTools-Design">these tools</a>, but also giving the user the option to &quot;upgrade them for free&quot;, at which point the hi-res versions are downloaded and stored locally for subsequent use?  ;)</p>

										<p><p>Well having a lot of images in your resources (Especially @2x images) is probably the main reason your app is so big. JS files, in all honesty, don&#39;t get <em>that</em> big. I have a 3,000-or-so-lined code and it&#39;s only about 120kb, which barely accounts for anything of my app size.</p>

										<p><p>I only have 1 version of my images. Maybe this is bad practice but it brought my file size down to the 70mb! I do not have any @2x images in my folder.</p>

							<p>Take out anything you&#39;re not using in your resources folder.  On my first app I had my Photoshop PSD files there to keep it organized, they get compiled with it.</p>
