			<h1>Camera events don&#39;t fire on Android</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m building a mobile app and the platform I&#39;m testing now is Android (2.2 emulator, to be exact). SDK Version 1.7.5 Rhino. I add an event listener to a button and try to open the camera ( what I was trying to build actually is an image uploader for your profile picture ) but the success or cancel event don&#39;t fire. I tried alerting, chaning views and other stuff but the events just don&#39;t work. I copied the code from Kitchen Sink :</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">uploadButton.addEventListener( <span class="hljs-string">"click"</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
    Titanium.Media.showCamera({

    success:<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(event)</span>
    </span>{
        Titanium.UI.createAlertDialog({title:<span class="hljs-string">'Camera'</span>, message:<span class="hljs-string">'Check your Photo Gallery'</span>}).show();
    },
    cancel:<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span>
    </span>{

    },
    error:<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(error)</span>
    </span>{
        <span class="hljs-comment">// create alert</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> a = Titanium.UI.createAlertDialog({title:<span class="hljs-string">'Camera'</span>});

        <span class="hljs-comment">// set message</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (error.code == Titanium.Media.NO_CAMERA)
        {
            a.setMessage(<span class="hljs-string">'Device does not have video recording capabilities'</span>);
        }
        <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>
        {
            a.setMessage(<span class="hljs-string">'Unexpected error: '</span> + error.code);
        }

        <span class="hljs-comment">// show alert</span>
        a.show();
    },
    saveToPhotoGallery:<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>,
    allowEditing:<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>,
    showControls: <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>,
    animated : <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>
    });
});
</code></pre><p>I searched all over the internet but all I find is that Android got camera bugs like that etc. I also tried including all kind of properties in the showCamera method there are still some as you can see in the code.</p>
<p>Please somebody help me because I see apps that accomplished that using Titanium.</p>

							<div><p>I tried updating to 1.8.0.1 ( especially because of V8, I&#39;m a big fan ) but then some of the services provided by my appserver crashed so I decided to keep on waiting till a better shim-compatible release or whatsoever and I fell back to 1.7.5. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t use 1.8.0.1 right now.</p>

							<div><p>Hi, Mauro,</p>
<p>It was more stable with Rhino, but I believe there were problems with Ti.App.fireEvent especially when cross-view communication occurs ( from native view to webview and vice versa).</p>
<p>Anyone got something on the cam issues?</p>

							<div><p>Hello!</p>
<p>I tested the camera in 1.7.5 and works just fine, with emulator 2.2. </p>
<p>Would be nice if you can help us to know which issues you are having with fireEvent, so it can be fixed.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro</p>

							<div><p>Ok, I got around my 1.8.0.1 V8 problems ( with a lot of appservers code refactoring) and now my camera events are working ( although I noticed another problem when you send blob through HTTPClient, but I got around it as well by writing the HTTP Request myself).</p>
<p>The camera problems in 1.7.5 were because I was calling the showCamera in an eventHandler. I&#39;ve read before that if you don&#39;t register your eventHandlers in the beginning of your app some problems might occur and obviously that&#39;s the problem. I figured that out by checking out the KitchenSink code which worked and I saw that they just call showCamera from a separate js file without event handlers. </p>
<p>I am building you a testcase for the problems in 1.8.0.1 V8 which I had and I&#39;m gonna provide it to you after the weekend.</p>
<p>And 1.8.0.1 Rhino - the problems were not Titanium, I guess it has something to do with strict mode cause I don&#39;t write strict code.</p>
<p>That&#39;s it guys, I will keep you posted.</p>
