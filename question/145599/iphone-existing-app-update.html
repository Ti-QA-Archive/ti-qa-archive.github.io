							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I imagine the reason no-one has tried helping so far is the problem you have is not something most come up with on a daily basis - myself included, in fact I am lucky as I have not had to deal with the situation you are currently in.</p>
<p>I can give you general information only - partly because your information is not as full as may be required.</p>
<p>You say your clients app has a database in it that you are after.  Is there only one app out there or lots?</p>
<p>You need to do some preparation work;</p>
<p>Provided you still have access to the original xcode app and can run that in the simulator, I would suggest you compile that into the simulator use it so the database is changed.  Then compile your Titanium app and run it in the simulator.  Then locate the <strong>applicationData</strong> folder (using Titanium and nativepath function) in your local machine (your simulators folder structure).</p>
<p>Does the original database still exist?  If so is it accessible in the same folder structure?  If so add some test code to your Titanium app to locate and access that file.  If that works then great you have a way to handle or interact with the database.  If not - the no - you cannot.</p>
<p>It is possible that the data structures of both apps are different but provided the database is&#x2F;was installed into a system folder you MAY have access.</p>
<p>I do not envy you - good luck.</p>
