							<div><p>Hi Arvind Lamba,<br>I faced the same problem and got resolved using the below steps:<br>I had uninstalled Titanium SDK and remove all the registry entries which is found by searching Titanium keyword and delete those entries, delete the titanium installed files manually by open the file location in HDD, then i deleted the android installed path which is already installed on my Hard drive. Then reinstall titanium again </p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

							<div><p>Hello Deepan,</p>
<p>I uninstall the Titanium SDK and Node setup, and deleted the .titanium, .adnroid,.eclipse from my Users folder and again reinstall all the things and restart the system. </p>
<p>Strange thing is that When I am compiling the project from Studio it giving me this error </p>
<p>[ERROR] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 1. </p>
<p>But while compiling this by terminal it gives me the  &quot; time out error &quot;.</p>
<p>I am using below configuration:  </p>
<p>java sdk version : 1.8.0_25<br>npm version : 1.3.2<br>Titanium SDK : 3.4.1 GA<br>CLI version  3.4.1<br>Windows 7 64-bit. </p>
<p>I will try once more which you suggested. </p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Arvind Lamba</p>

							<p>Hi Arvind Lamba,</p>
<p>Try to use <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oracle.com&#x2F;technetwork&#x2F;java&#x2F;javase&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;index.html">oracle JDK6 or JDK7</a> and you can follow <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;doc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;mobile-build-windows">this guide</a> for setting JDK environment variable.  And one other thing open your studio terminal and type</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-title">ti</span> setup
</code></pre><p>Then press 2 and  post your red color error result for further investigation.</p>
<p>If you have any concern, then let me know.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
