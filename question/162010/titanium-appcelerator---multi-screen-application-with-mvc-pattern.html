			<h1>Titanium Appcelerator - Multi Screen Application with MVC pattern</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have some experience in BB app development. But, I&#39;m pretty much new to the Titanium Appcelerator Studio.</p>
<p>I did some googling on the appcelerator stuff and I know that there are many sample apps using tabs openly available and I was able to create one tab based app including some commonly used UI features such as list views,views, windows, and functionality such as camera feature, geo location etc.</p>
<p>Now what I&#39;m trying to accomplish is to create a multiple screen app (android &amp; ios) without the use of tabs in it. That being said, I&#39;m trying to create an MVC kind of framework in which I can split up the views and data models. I found some samples for this like Tweetanium. -https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator-titans&#x2F;tweetanium https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;smontgomerie&#x2F;Appcelerator-on-Rails</p>
<p>Other than those, Is there any simple sample project that I can use as a reference and build my application on top of it ?</p>
<p>Also, any links to some helpful sites like separation of logic and UI in titanium (javascript) or useful tips will be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance !!</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your response and will try alloy for sure !!</p>
<p>&gt;Thats not our fault<br>I mentioned about my exp only coz I juz wanted to let you ppl know that I&#39;m not completely new to the programming world.<br>I can&#39;t understand why you are after that statement !!</p>
<p>&gt;Then WHY would you think you should &quot;create an MVC kind of framework&quot;?<br>So according to you, new users of appcelerator shouldn&#39;t try to follow MVC !! </p>
<p>&gt;Why would you dismiss alloy for classic if you are &quot;new&quot;?<br>I didn&#39;t say I won&#39;t use alloy. I just wanted to confirm which one is best for ppl like me !!</p>

							<p>Krishna, I agree with Stephen. You would be crazy not to use Alloy if you are looking for a Titanium MVC. Honestly, unless you have a highly compelling reason not to, at this point in the game you would be crazy not to use Alloy period.</p>
