			<h1>Question from a newbie to start with Appcelerator</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I want to create an app with Appcelerator for my friends customers. It should be a Geofence app which sends notifications to registered customers when they come into the friend shop region, For this I want to use the plugin from [http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.plotprojects.com]. Now my questions:</p>
<p>. Is there a way to create, test and deploy the app without having to pay the yearly Apple fee of 99 USD when I don&#39;t want to use the Apple app store, i..e. offering the app at my friends site for download?</p>
<p>. Would there be a better solution then using the Plotproject plugin? For example using a free Appcelerator module?</p>
<p>It would be nice if you have time for an answer. Thank you in advance for your help.</p>
<p>Albert</p>

							<div><p>Now, that I downloaded and installed Titanium I recognized that I have on my Windows7 system NOT the possibility to install the IOS SDK. I read in the installation guide that I need for this a running Mac. I thought that I could create with my Windows7 system Android AND IOS apps. I don&#39;t have a Mac, so I can forget the whole app creation for IOS, which would lead in my case to forget about my wish to create apps. Please tell me that there is still some way for me.</p>

							<p>The only marketplace from which people can download apps for Apple devices is from the App Store, which requires you to submit your app for approval. To do this you need to pay the nominal fee to have a registered Apple iOS developer account.  To develop your app you do not need the developer account, however you can only test it on the emulator.</p>

							<p>You can also upload the app on the friend website using Enterprise  distribution profile.</p>
<p>iOS Developers enrolled in the Enterprise program have the opportunity to distribute their application outside of the App Store . Use the “Enterprise” provisioning profile created in the iOS Provisioning Portal to distribute a build of your publication internally.</p>
<p>From this profile you can share the app to infinite number of users. If you do not want to distribute app on app store, and only want to share from friends website then this is best option.</p>
<p>In this case you need to upload .ipa file to the friend website. </p>
<p>I  hope this will have answer your question.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Moiz! But the Enterprise program costs 299 USD&#x2F;year. It&#39;s too expensive for my friend.</p>

										<p><p>Ok, so you can go with 99$ &#x2F; year  plan for iOS, but with this plan you need to upload build to App Store , to make it available for users.</p>
<p>For Android there is one time payment of RS 25 $.</p>
<p>So you can go with this 2 options.</p>
