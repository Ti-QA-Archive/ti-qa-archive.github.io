			<p>Hi all, anyone has idea on how to find the documentation for JavaScript ACS sdk? I can&#39;t seem to find it in the new documentation. Only left with REST, iOS, Android or Titanium API. Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>Christian - I think he&#39;s asking for the ACS Javascript SDK that used to be available at one point. Javascript SDK, meaning the code examples that I remember seeing that you could incorporate in to a web client, e.g. browser-side. I could be wrong, but I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s what he is asking for and what I also remember seeing when ACS was first released. It was always along side in tab format with the other SDKs that he mentions in the original post.</p>
<p>I&#39;m guessing it has been left out due to security concerns since javascript code is visible browser-side. I&#39;ve been away from Titanium for close to a year and decided to jump back in recently, so I haven&#39;t heard what happened to it.</p>

										<p><p>The JavaScript has basically been replaced by the REST section and it hasn&#39;t changed that much since then. It&#39;s just that the new term is more accurate since you can call REST services using any language.</p>
<p>And since Appc acquired CocoaFish (the company that originally created ACS) it made much more sense to integrate this directly into the Titanium Framework.</p>

										<p><p>I see. It was quite a surprise to me as the documentation was still there and then suddenly it was gone after an update to the documentation. I am using the Javascript SDK for a project. Probably have to switch over to REST. Thanks for clarifying this.</p>
