			<h1>Android : &#34;An application restart is required&#34; - app in Market</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve seen this issue here and there in the Q&amp;A from posts going back quite some way and assumed this had been fixed, but I just completed and uploaded an Adroid app to the market and, to my dismay, after installing the app and clicking &#39;open&#39; immediately after, I am still shown a very worrying alert that an app restart is required.</p>
<p>(After clicking continue, I note that after a short spell on a blank screen, the app starts as normal.)</p>
<p>I have also seen some info that this is not a Titanium issue, but rather a Google issue. Sorry, but I just don&#39;t buy that : not every app in the Market throws up this alert after installing it. </p>
<p>So.. what&#39;s the issue? How can this be resolved? Why does this still even happen?</p>
<p>Sorry, but my client is not going to like this at all. It makes ME look crappy. It makes the app look shoddy. I&#39;ll be lucky to get paid if all installers see this. It&#39;s unacceptable in my book.</p>
<p>btw: I am using Ti SDK 1.8.0 (a continuous build from November). If there any suggestions as to a fix &#x2F; workaround or preferred SDK to use, then I&#39;m all ears.</p>

							<p>It&#39;s a Google issue. We give you the tools to work around it. You can choose to turn off the restart and allow your app to launch multiple copies. That&#39;s what happens if you do nothing. Google market install doesn&#39;t use the same Intent as the home launcher. If you launch from Market, download, or file browser after install, press home, then launch the app again, you&#39;ll get two instances of your application. It looks like they MAY have finally fixed it on Honeycomb devices, but we haven&#39;t tested a broad number of devices to verify it. However, when it is fixed the error condition that we&#39;re trying to help you handle is not detected and no restart will be requested.</p>
<p>You have all of the configuration options available you should need to handle this however you want. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-4941">TIMOB-4941</a></p>
