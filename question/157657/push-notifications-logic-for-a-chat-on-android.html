			<h1>Push Notifications logic for a chat on Android</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi everyone,<br>I&#39;m developing a simple chat application for Android just to study titanium.<br>You can think of it as a small clone of whatsapp. I won&#39;t add any detail about sdk or software versions,<br>since they are irrelevant for the kind of question I&#39;m posting.<br>I&#39;ve got some general questions about the logic that the app should use to manage notification of received messages. I know it&#39;s a long post, but I really think this could help a lot of people dealing with this very common scenario.</p>
<p>So basically this is how I was thinking to make it:</p>
<ul>
<li>I will use che ACS users and chat services</li>
<li>When a user sends a message to another user, an automatic push notification is sent to that user from ACS on a &#39;chat&#39; channel. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My goal is:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The user will see a list of users he can chat with (just like whatsapp)</li>
<li>When the user clicks on another user, a page allowing to chat with that user will open (just like whatsapp)</li>
<li>When a user enters a chat page, the history of the last N messages will be retrieved by the server</li>
<li><p>If User A receives a chat from User B:</p>
<ul>
<li>if user A is not running the app, A receives a notification in the tray that he can click to start the app.</li>
<li>if user A is running the app and he&#39;s not in the page showing the chat with user B, A receives a notification in the tray that he can click to open the page showing the chat with user B.</li>
<li>if user A is running the app and he&#39;s in the page showing the chat with user B, he just gets the message appended to the list of messages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Do you think my approach could stand? Does it make sense or is there any other standard approach?</li>
<li><p>Since a user must be subrscribed to receive push notifications, to get notifications when the app is not running I only see two ways, am I wrong?</p>
<ul>
<li>Having a service always running in the background even when the app is not running</li>
<li>Avoid unsubscribing the user when closing the application. (This looks really weird!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>About the <em>showTrayNotificationsWhenFocused</em> property…I thought the &quot;focused&quot; was referred to the whole application, meaning that at least 1 heavyweight window was on top of the stack, but from my tests it looks like it is somehow behaving differently depending on which window I&#39;m in.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>More precisely this is what I do:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>showTrayNotificationsWhenFocused</em> is left to the default false value, </li>
<li>in the users list page I enable the CloudPush and subscribe to the PushNotifications, </li>
<li>when in the chat page I register the notification callback. Strange thing is that while i&#39;m in the chat page I keep receiving notifications in the tray instead of getting the callback directly called. Then If I click the notification, the callback is correcly called. How is that <em>showTrayNotificationsWhenFocused</em> property supposed to work then?</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks a lot!<br>Daniele</p>
