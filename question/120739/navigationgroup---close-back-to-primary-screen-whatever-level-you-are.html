			<p>Hi guys have a NavigationGroup which is working out fine. Problem is that I have also been requested to add a custom style tab bar at the bottom of the page so need to pull the NavigationGroup to the primary window on interaction with this.</p>
<p>What&#39;s the best way to do so please..</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Dave</p>

							<p>I have coded this up before but cannot find it now… but the basic concept is that whenever you open a window; push it onto an array and when you close the window, pop it off the array.</p>
<p>If you ever want to go back home, then pop the window off the array and close it, repeat until array is empty</p>

										<p><p>if there are only 2 windows deep, then this would be a good solution, or you could set a variable as a flag and check that flag in each close event listener for if your closing to the home screen… this would use less memory then Aarons solution:</p>
<p>####app.js</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> tabGroup = Ti.UI.createTabGroup();

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> win1 = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
  title:<span class="hljs-string">'Window 1'</span>,
  backgroundColor:<span class="hljs-string">'blue'</span>
});

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> tab1 = Ti.UI.createTab({
    title: <span class="hljs-string">'test'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-built_in">window</span>: win1
});


win1.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{

    win2 = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
      title:<span class="hljs-string">'Window 2'</span>,
      backgroundColor:<span class="hljs-string">'green'</span>,
        url:<span class="hljs-string">'win2.js'</span>,
        tab: tab1
    });

    tab1.open(win2,{animated:<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>});
});

tabGroup.addTab(tab1);

tabGroup.open();
</code></pre><p>####win2.js</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">win2 = Ti.UI.currentWindow;

win2.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{

    win3 = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
      title:<span class="hljs-string">'Window 3'</span>,
      backgroundColor:<span class="hljs-string">'red'</span>,
        url:<span class="hljs-string">'win3.js'</span>
    });

    win3.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'close'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
        win2.close();
    });

    Titanium.UI.currentTab.open(win3,{animated:<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>});
});
</code></pre><p>####win3.js</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">win3 = Ti.UI.currentWindow;

<span class="hljs-built_in">close</span> = Ti.UI.createButton({
    title:<span class="hljs-string">'close'</span>
});

<span class="hljs-built_in">close</span>.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, function() {
    win3.<span class="hljs-built_in">close</span>();
})

win3.rightNavButton = <span class="hljs-built_in">close</span>;
</code></pre><p>This was just a quick and dirty example, but I hope you get my point…</p>

										<p><p>Actually there&#39;s lot&#39;s of routes but essentially is only 2 windows deep but I have a custom made tab bar rather than a real &quot;TabGroup&quot; and i&#39;m using &quot;NavigationGroup&quot; so would this still be possible? I will have a go and attempt but please let me know…</p>

										<p><p>Have taken this approach and have got the pages reversing to the home page fine roughly as per code below.. The problem I have now is that my code takes me back to the primary page &#39;home&#39; but the next navGroup open command to take me to the page on the custom nav doesn&#39;t seem to fire properly! I think the problem might be that the close doesn&#39;t finish before the open so the seriesPg stuff happens on&#x2F;over the home? Any pointers on this one - think I might need to put in something to stop the &#39;navGroup.open(seriesPg);&#39; from triggering until the close is finished??</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in">table</span>.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span></span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (currentPageString != <span class="hljs-string">'home'</span>){
        navGroup.close(currentPage);
    navGroup.open(seriesPg);
    }

    so on...

										<p><p>Of course. I have a custom nav at the bottom of each page. when someone clicks this Nav i want to take the NavigationGroup back to the bottom level if it isn&#39;t already. Then I want to open the page on the custom nav the user has clicked. If i don&#39;t take this approach back to root it allows the user to trigger duplicate pages if they use the nav which crashes the app.</p>

										<p><p>hmmm that is an interesting app structure, I dont think I know the answer to that, but i would try adding the open event to the root windows focus event of the root window… that being said, I would try and think up a better app flow, this seems rather… all over the place (no offense), and I worry about memory usage with all this switching windows and opening them like that</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the info I will try those out… </p>
<p>Originally I wanted to use tabGroup but the design wanted to have ipad popover windows added into the tabGroup too and I couldn&#39;t see a way of adding in these items and customizing.. Is there a way to do that I assumed not?</p>
<p>FYI I moved the .open() into the home windows focus and it worked!<br>Thanks for that quick thinking! </p>
<p>Finally on closing your example it slides elegantly shut whereas my Level2 page just seems to disappear on returning to &#39;home&#39; when on a Level3 page. Is this because you have the following setting when opening win2 and 3? The navigationGroup controls the majority of my opening how could I get this to replicate yours?</p>

										<p><p>For something like this? there is no best practice as this is an out of the ordinary layout for an app, but overall lookup tweetanium mobile in github, it is very good with showing how to layout code… we are working on getting some more example apps put together as we speak.</p>

										<p><p>Great it seems to be a pretty good platform so far! Looking forward to trying out the desktop apps too!</p>
<p>Regarding a couple of points above just to make sure:</p>
<p>1) Is there a way of customizing a TabGroup Bar in any way. Positioning tabs i.e. to the left and adding ipad popover windows &#39;on top&#39; or &#39;in&#39;? I assume this is not customizable via Ti. and needs to be custom built?</p>
<p>2) Regarding when i&#39;m rolling back to the home screen from Level3 and the Level2 window disappears rather than slides out. How can I make it slide transition out like your example does - any pointers??</p>
<p>Thanks ALLOT for all your help!<br>Dave</p>

										<p><p>I have a similar problem and I kinda got lost in the above comments. In one of my tabs a user can dig their way through maybe 5 windows, and I need to let the user navigate straight back to the &#39;home&#39; window in one click.</p>
<p>At the moment each window is assigned a unique ID and knows its parents IDand when that window opens another it adds an event e.g. </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Ti.App.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'closeWindow'</span> + windowID, closeWindow);
</code></pre><p>Therefore, any window can close itself and call its parent to close, which can then call its parent to close, etc, etc.</p>
<p>This method shouldn&#39;t use much memory and the event to close its parent is only fired on the window close event.</p>
<p>However if I&#39;m 5 windows deep and have been in and out a few windows using the back button. Then go back to the start, you see a few windows animate the close then on the last I get a black screen.</p>
<p>The app hasn&#39;t crashed and if I click the tab button it shows the correct &#39;home&#39; screen.</p>
<p>Is this a good way to implement this feature, or any ideas on how to fix the error? Maybe make the windows wait 200 on a timeout before closing?</p>
