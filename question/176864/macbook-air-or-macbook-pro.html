			<h1>Macbook Air? or Macbook Pro?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi people.</p>
<p>I have been developing mobile apps on Titanium for the past 6 months on a MacMini. However, as we all know that a MacMini has to be plugged into a screen which doesn&#39;t make it portable. I am currently looking to buy either a Macbook Air or a Macbook pro. I need some help in deciding which one to go for. I also do native android and xcode coding apart from titanium and now into Xamarin too. I am planning for a 13&quot; model. I have heard people suggesting that a pro would do good for programming, but $1000 budget being a concern, I&#39;d like to look at the MBA with 8GB RAM upgrade. Will it be a good performer or should I go for a MBP refurb? Let me know your thoughts.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>Hi Seb,<br>Deploying builds remotely sounds cool, are you familiar with this? What kind of tools, coding are you using for it?<br>Thanks,<br>Louis</p>

										<p><p>Hoi Louis, something as simple as a git-repository which is monitored for changes by the Mini, execute bash script to start emulator onFileChange in .&#x2F;build&#x2F;android and .&#x2F;build&#x2F;iphone - eventually a locally-available one available through a VPN like Hamachi.</p>
<p>Run a VNC session to the Mini, and swipe between your 2 environments with 3 finger swipe :-)<br>let the productivity begin…</p>

							<p>Hi Viraj - the MBA is fine for coding and building&#x2F;signing, but for serious emulation the low-power i5 in the MBA could fall short.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, all new Macbooks have the RAM fused to the motherboard - so you might wanna go back a few generations and pick up a used one with upgradeable ram!</p>
<p>Of course you could deploy builds remotely to your MacMini and stream the emulation back to your MBA ;-)<br>Good luck with picking your new computer!</p>

										<p><p>I have a late 2009 15 MBP, I maxed the RAM (it only handles 8G) and put  a SSD instead of the normal hdd, took out the dvd drive and put an adapter to keep the old hdd and I&#39;m very happy with. So you could find a refurb&#x2F;ebay one do the same. Crucial has some good prices right now for memory and ssd :)</p>

							<p>Hi Viraj</p>
<p>I take a different approach to the others, but it does depend on finances.</p>
<p>Firstly the MBA&#39;s are absolutely fine for developing Titanium apps, I have a 2013 i7 8mg 11&quot; MBA, which performs excellently. </p>
<p>However, it does not have a retina display.</p>
<p>The MBP&#39;s are also excellent, and although as said you can&#39;t upgrade the ram, you can buy them with 16mg and i7 retina display. Although portable they can be a bit heavy.</p>
<p>MY advise here, is to go into an Apple shop, and decide on the machine that suits you best, then go onto the Apple web site and order the highest spec version of that. i.e. MBA 13&quot; i7 etc … Hard drives, processors and ram are all customisable.( the stores do not have all options)</p>
<p>And again it depends on if you want a DVD Drive, I have an external, but haven&#39;t used it for over 12 months.</p>
<p>So rambling answer, but what suits you best … for Look and feel, portability, day to day usage.</p>
<p>All the MBA&#39;s and MBP&#39;s will perform and do the task of mobile development.. What else do you want it to do.</p>
<p>Also remember September is when Apple announce hardware upgrades ….. Rumour of a 12&quot; MBA with retina display…</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>T.</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve had a MBA for three years, dragged it around the world at least twice (and I&#39;m not gentle with computers), used it for development all that time and I&#39;ve only just recently upgraded to a newer MBA model. Best computer I have ever owend.</p>
