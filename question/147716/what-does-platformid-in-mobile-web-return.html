		<section>
			<p>What does <strong>Platform.id in Mobile Web</strong> return? Its some hash, that seems to be specific to the browser instance? What is that hash exactly? What&#39;s the DOM &#x2F; plain browser javacript which will get to the same hash within a webpage? Knowing the answer will help improve usability of that property.</p>

							<p>In Titanium Mobile Web, Ti.Platform.id is the &quot;mid&quot; or &quot;machine id&quot;. On native platforms, this used to be some sort of device guid before Android and iOS squashed that. Now on native, they generate a guid on install and for the life of the app on that device, the guid never changes until the app is uninstalled and re-installed.</p>
<p>Since on mobile web, there is no sense of &quot;installed&quot;, we simply set a cookie and a key in the browser&#39;s HTML5 local storage with a value of a guid. If the cookie gets deleted, we pull from local storage and redefine the cookie.</p>
<p>If someone clears their browser history and storage, then both the cookie and local storage values are wiped and a new guid is generated on the next page reload.</p>
<p>The machine id is used by <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;platform&#x2F;appcelerator-analytics&#x2F;">Appcelerator&#39;s Analytics</a> product to identify unique installs. If you don&#39;t use analytics, then you don&#39;t have much to lose. If you use analytics, then we&#39;ve done the best we can to try and uniquely identify an &quot;install&quot; in a mobile browser.</p>

							<p>Great answer.. As a follow on question, <strong>is it possible to share Titanium Mobile Web Platform.id with an app version (both made by the same vendor)</strong>? I&#39;ve heard a lot about no cookie sharing between webViews. So that suggests that the answer is NO. However, clearly, being able to share an id across the web and native on a device (or any information for that matter) would open up a world of possibility.</p>

										<p><p>Considering the app version is derived from the tiapp.xml and the Platform.id is a generated guid, I&#39;m not sure how they would be shared. On Titanium Mobile Web, you can share cookies with a WebView as long as they are the same domain. So, you could put your mobile web app on http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mysite.com&#x2F; and open a WebView to &quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mysite.com&#x2F;page.php?app_version=&quot;+Ti.App.version&quot; and page.php can see the &quot;ti:mid&quot; cookie that contains the platform id as well as the app_version from the query string. Is this what you&#39;re talking about?</p>

										<p><p>Trying to answer this question:<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;147717&#x2F;is-it-possible-to-have-device-persistence-between-the-mobile-web-and-app</p>
<p><strong>Is it possible to have device persistence between the mobile web and native app</strong></p>
<p>The user story - A user interacts with a mobile web version of our app and then downloads the titanium native version on the same device.  Without log-ins we would like to identify that its the same device across the native and mobile web versions so then we could build persistence.  So the user settings and information are saved from the mobile web interaction and then appear in the native interaction upon install. </p>
<p>Is this possible?</p>

										<p><p>Oh, I see what you&#39;re saying. I would say no, that&#39;s not possible. There&#39;s no where a mobile web app could persist some data that a native app could access that I know of. That would be a huge security hole. You&#39;re going to have to use a login mechanism.</p>

										<p><p>Chris, first of all, you&#39;ve been great, thank you so far for your help! </p>
<p>Second, at least on android, would using the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;reference&#x2F;android&#x2F;webkit&#x2F;CookieManager.html">cookiemanager</a> be a potential solution? A mobile web version writes a cookie to a webview and the app pulls up the same cookie through the webview (both cookies are &quot;set&quot; by the same domain).</p>

										<p><p>The problem is the cookie jar used by a WebView is separate from the one the actual Web Browser app uses. There&#39;s no way to share data between them that I know of. :(</p>
<p>You could have your native app do a Ti.Platform.openURL() with a token in the URL that either the server or the mobile web app could set in a cookie. Then use that same token in the native app&#39;s WebView to set a cookie there. But this only works going from native to mobile web, not the other way around.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the response. That&#39;s a bummer. I&#39;m surprised more people are not clamoring for this. It would enable seamless web app to native app persistence. Is there work being done in this area? How could we set up a feature request or even contribute to a potential solution (or at least deep research feasibility)</p>
