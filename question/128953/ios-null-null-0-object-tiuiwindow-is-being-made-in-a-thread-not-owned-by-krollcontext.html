			<p>iOS, Ti 1.7.5&#x2F;1.8</p>
<p>Does anyone have any idea what this means or what sort of thing I&#39;m doing that could be causing it?</p>
<p><em>(null)-&gt;(null) [0]-&gt;[object TiUIWindow] is being made in a thread not owned by &lt;KrollContext</em></p>
<p>At some point I experience a mysterious crash and I&#39;m trying to trace down any antecedents for it.  (It seems to me that more recent versions of the SDK provide much less in the way of helpful error messages.)</p>

							<p>Generally, this is caused when you create a new window with a file URL, and then call a function or property that was declared in a different window (execution context). Because of how our JS interpreter runs, this creates unsafe conditions sometimes, so tons of warnings are printed as a result of calls like this, and crashes can frequently occur.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, Matt.  I&#39;ll vet the code for anything like that and see if it fixes it.  Is there no way to incorporate enough debugging information to actually say what and where something is wrong?</p>

										<p><p>That seems to have fixed it.  (Either that or some of the other rearranging I did.)</p>
<p>It would be helpful if the error messages from Titanium actually contained some…information.  Otherwise it&#39;s a case of knowing that there&#39;s an error but not being told where, and going line-by-line through the source for something that <em>looks</em> wrong.  (Unless that&#39;s what people mean by visual debugging.)</p>
