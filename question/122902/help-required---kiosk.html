			<p>I need help! I don&#39;t usually give away a project but I am developing a kiosk software for a client and the web view component isn&#39;t working as documented. I need to be able to stop certain web addresses from working.</p>
<p>Method beforeload only contains the initial URL and is never updated.</p>
<p>And taking the HTML from one web view and putting it in another removes all styling and functionality!!! Pulling my hair out.</p>
<p>Any suggestions??</p>

							<div><p>Personally, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the browser&#39;s responsibility to <em>prevent</em> you from going to a certain page. The browser&#39;s job is to browse the web.</p>
<p>I would filter the traffic at the network level, it would work especially well if you&#39;re in a &quot;whitelist-domains-only&quot; scenario.</p>
<p>Of course, whether or not you have the ability to modify your client&#39;s network is a different story ;)</p>

							<p>Use Android for you kiosk.  In my experience, the beforeload event under Android gives you the expected URL of the page to be loaded while iOS does not.  I have not used the desktop, so can&#39;t comment on it.</p>
<p>You didn&#39;t mention what platform you are using.  If you can use Android, your existing code may work.  If you can&#39;t, I would suggest looking at the source for the webview class in whichever platform you are using and trying to fix it yourself.</p>

							<p>Web view has a base URL set at runtime that is on my clients website but only wants his certain affiliates websites browseable. I tried a before load but that keeps the initial URL constantly set.</p>
<p> I&#39;m now onto two webviews, one hidden, One visible and the hidden one does the processing and transfers the parsed HTML to the visible web view. Problem is that the parsed HTML doesn&#39;t load any CSS I am guessing because I am injecting HTML it&#39;s not going out onto the web??</p>
<p>I&#39;ve searched the QA but the work around of editing .m files is not really working as it should plus I&#39;m not an obj-c programmer so wading in the dark there!</p>
<p>Maybe a webview.evalJS to inject so code?? How does the webpage communicate with an app from a link?</p>

										<p><p>In the future I would encourage you to include the platform and preferably the SDK level too when submitting a question.  Or if the problem occurs on more than one platform, mention that too.</p>
<p>Back to the original question:  I have noticed that behavior myself, and also that android returns what I&#39;d expect.  In my case, I was just doing some experimenting so I didn&#39;t care to delve into what it would take to fix it.</p>
<p>The load event in iOS does provide the proper URL.  Of course, by that time it is already rendered but you could immediately change pages to an explanation the link is not allowed.</p>
<p>Otherwise I would suggest trying to fix the underlying code – that is the beauty of open source…</p>
