			<p>Hi All</p>
<p>I am pulling my hair out here. Why can&#39;t a project created from the local file system (using promote to project) be cleaned in Titanium Studio? The clean option is greyed out whenever I create project this way.</p>
<p>Any suggestions would be highly appreciated.</p>

							<p>I tried comparing a .project file from at project that had the clean option enabled with the .project file from one that didn&#39;t and apparently the difference was the content of the &lt;buildSpec&gt; tag, so I added the following to the &lt;buildSpec&gt; tag:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">buildCommand</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">name</span>&gt;</span>com.appcelerator.titanium.core.builder<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">name</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">arguments</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">arguments</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">buildCommand</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">buildCommand</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">name</span>&gt;</span>com.aptana.ide.core.unifiedBuilder<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">name</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">arguments</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">arguments</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">buildCommand</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>And the clean option is availiable again, and seems to be working even though I&#39;m not really sure what clean actually does.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Martin,<br>Glad you figured it out.<br>when you do a clean on your project, all your build files are deleted and the project is compiled from the start. it is like you are building it for the first time.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Ajeet, Well my little &quot;fix&quot; isn&#39;t without it&#39;s side effects, after I clean now the App Explorer points out an error in a js file (which is a minified version of underscore.js, and has no errors). If I close the project and open it again (in &quot;Project Explorer&quot;) the error goes away…not really sure how that is related to the &quot;.project&quot; file.</p>

							<p>I just had this problem using TS build: 3.1.4.201310290744</p>
<p>Project Clean… was grayed out. All the appropriate check marks were made in the: Project &gt; Properties &gt; Project Natures Window. </p>
<p> <strong>Solution was:</strong> Uncheck Mobile then click <strong>OK</strong> click <strong>YES</strong> at the &quot;Nature Change&quot; Popup. Then go back again and Recheck Mobile in   Project &gt; Properties &gt; Project Natures Window. Click <strong>YES</strong> again at the &quot;Nature Change&quot; Popup.  Cleaning functions again :)</p>

										<p><p>I can replicate it by the following steps: Navigate to my Titanium Studio Workspace &gt; Create a new folder, call it &quot;Test&quot;, leave it empty &gt; In Titanium Studio in &quot;Project Explorer&quot; I choose &quot;local filesystem&quot; &gt; navigate to the &quot;Test&quot; folder, right click, choose &quot;Promote to project&quot;, set primary and only nature to &quot;Titanium Mobile&quot; &gt; Go to &quot;App Explorer&quot; &gt; Project  menu &gt; &quot;Clean&quot; is grayed out.

										<p><p>My version is 2.1.2. And no availiable updates. I just managed to break &quot;clean&quot; in a project that was working by deleting the contents of the project folder entirely (including the &quot;.project&quot; file (that&#39;s hidden). This made my unable to open the project from the &quot;Project Explorer&quot;, I then copied the &quot;.project&quot; file from another working project (I modyfied the name in the &quot;.project&quot; file&quot;). And now clean is disabled.</p>
