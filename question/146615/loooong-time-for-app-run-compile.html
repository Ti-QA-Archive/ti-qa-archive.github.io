			<p>Win 7, Android SDK 2.2, Titanium 3.0.0.GA.<br>Using the Titanium tutorial and the sample apps in Dashboard, I imported then ran &quot;Kitchen Sink&quot;. I started the &quot;Run&quot; 25min ago and it is still running! Anyone know a way around this? Also, in the running log I notice many ERRORs in addition to INFO and WARN messages. How does a program continue to compile  with errors? Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

							<div><p>So you are saying that the program took 25 minutes to compile? Or that it never compiled. Also are you running on Android Emulator or on Device? Sometimes the AVD hangs up and doesn&#39;t quite finish the compilation for whatever reason if it takes more than 5 minutes (for android Emulator) then stop the process and restart it (re-run the app) or restart Titanium. See below for a recommended solution to your problem.</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;m running on Android simulator. At the time I posted, it had been 25min. Now its been 2 hrs, 20min. I don&#39;t think it is hung up since it continues to output WARN and ERROR messages. Typical examples are: [ERROR: (Strictmode 615)]at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java: 856) and [WARN: Trace277 Unexpected value from nativeGetEnableTags: 0, Unbound failed. And on and on it goes!!</p>

							<p>Running an app on the Android Emulator does indeed take a long time, but 25 minutes is way too long. At this point you should cancel the process and restart it.</p>
<p>If possible though, you should do all your android testing on device. It is much faster for Titanium to load your app onto an Android device and run it on there rather than on an emulator. The reason for this is that the Android emulator is a virtual process and does not directly use your computers CPU (unlike the iOS Simulator (note: simulator vs emulator) which does). So use an android device for testing whenever possible as it will drastically reduce your debugging time.</p>
<p>Oh and as for the errors, warnings, and infos in the logs, yes everyone sees them, they are usually not serious enough to affect your installation.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you all for your comments and advice.  I took Carter&#39;s advice and cancelled the project run. I then  connected my Galaxy S3 to my laptop and attempted to run on device. However, when prompted for where to run project, the three choices are: Android Emulator, Mobile Web Preview  in browser, and Mobile Web Preview in Emulator. No listing for  Android Device? For giggles, I tried the second option and got the Notepad error described below.  I then closed Titanium and reopened it. I first tried to run the myFirstApp on emulator as it worked before.It doesn&#39;t prompt for device to run on. I guess since the emulator is what I used before. But it would be nice to be given the choice each time. Now it just gives the Notepad error described below and quits. The I tried the Kitchen Sink project which prompted me for device. I selected emulator and ran it. I got a Notepad error window popup saying; &quot;The filename, directory or volume label  syntax is incorrect?!?!?! This Notepad error has never occurred before and nothing was changed obviously since it is a Ti sample project. Any help would be appreciated.</p>
