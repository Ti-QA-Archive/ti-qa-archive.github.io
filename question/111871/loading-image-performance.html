			<p>hi</p>
<p>i want to display loading (spinning, throbber) image while am i loading remote image.<br>everything is fine, i got this working, but i found different ways how to do this and i would like to know, which one is the best in terms of performance.<br>imagine that i got big table with plenty of images (f.e. 100+) and each row is loading remote image, so each row displays loading image first.</p>
<h2 id="my-questions-">my questions:</h2>
<h3 id="about-the-image-">about the image:</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>use imageView with array of images, OR</p>
</li>
<li><p>use 1 image and rotate it in the code</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>can i reuse one imageView multiple times (the same imageView on each row) ?</p>
<h3 id="about-hiding-loading-image-">about hiding loading image:</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>hide loading image and show remote image (keep 2 imageView for each row), OR</p>
</li>
<li><p>remove hiding image from the view when remote image is loaded, OR</p>
</li>
<li><p>replace loaded remote image in the loading imageView (i didn&#39;t found the way how to do this)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>my working code: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;824350</p>
<p>thanks  </p>

							<div><p>it is only going to load the remote image when the table row is visible so I would not be too concerned withe the number of rows impacting the performance</p>

							<div><p>i am not worry about remote images so much, but in my example each image got its own preload image (or array of images) and this is rendered for each row. so if i got 100 items in the row i assume that this preload image ll load 100x, but remote image ll load just when the row ll be visible (based on what you said). another thing is, ll this stay in the memore when you scroll down? apple suggest to free memory every single time its possible, does appcelerator handle this itself for table rows?</p>
