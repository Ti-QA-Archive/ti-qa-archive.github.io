							<p>Hi</p>
<p>If you mean the dark grey translucent bubble that appears when you click the annotation pin - then I am sorry but the answer is no.</p>

										<p><p>That was what I was referring to. Is there any way to customize it? Even if I have to write a module?</p>

										<p><p>No Titanium customisation - but I would be surprised if you could not do it in a custom module - but in this case it would not be a customisation.</p>
<p>You would hook into the click event of the Annotation pin and then discard the annotation bubble (make sure it does not display) and display your own view instead, with your own labels and UI.  There is no current way inside Titanium to stop the existing annotation bubble displaying or you could do it without a custom module.</p>
<p>I have not tried this in some time but you could stop the annotation appearing by not providing an default properties - the only problem was that the click event also did not fire.  This MAY have changed and worth checking.  So no; title, subtitle, left or right anything.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, I will see what I can do, I have never done a module before so this will take some time for me to figure out.</p>
