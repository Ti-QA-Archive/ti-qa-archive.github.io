							<div><p>I have no idea why it&#39;s crashing. I doubt anyone else does either. You&#39;ve given almost no details. We need a lot moer information</p>
<ul>
<li>Alloy version</li>
<li>Are you using Studio or CLI</li>
<li>Do you have the log level turned up to trace or debug?</li>
<li>What is the actual full output</li>
<li>Are you manually compiling alloy or doing it as part of a build.</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#39;s a ton of other questions as well. Just saying &quot;alloy crashes&quot; gets us no where.</p>

							<div><p>The reason why i dont give the details its because I dont have any or I dont know where to fetch them.</p>
<p>I gave you the alloy version 3.1.0 ga. I&#39;m Compiling through execution with Titanium IDE<br>Console -&gt; http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;AZGCJB8B</p>
<p>Thats why I came to ask for help. I have no feedback in console. And changing between<br>log types doesnt do anything for some reason(?) do I need to run in debug?</p>
<p>I went through directories trying to find some sort of log and I couldn&#39;t find anything.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve found out that I had was a mispeled the src field in the require tag on the XML.</p>
<p>but for future reference i would like to know how to &quot;debug&quot; these problems</p>
<p>Sorry if i caused any problem</p>

							<p>One note is that 3.1.0 is the Titanium SDK version. You can get the Alloy version by typing <code>alloy --version</code> at the command line. You can get the Studio version by going to its &quot;about&quot; menu.</p>
<p>If that is all you are seeing in your output then there&#39;s a problem with Studio&#39;s output. I have heard this mentioned on Windows systems before. Mentioning your OS is also helpful when trying to get help. Just to be clear that this is a studio error, can you do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>put your code back in the error state</li>
<li>run through studio again and confirm that you are not getting any output past the alloy logo</li>
<li>Go to the command line and go into your project&#39;s directory</li>
<li>execute this: <code>alloy compile --config platform=android</code>, assuming you are targeting android</li>
</ol>
<p>Do you get better output this way?</p>

										<p><p>Alloy version is 1.1.2<br>Titanium Studio, build: 3.1.0.201304151600<br>Windows 7<br>I&#39;m running in a physical device Android Huawei.</p>
<p>Thank you for your answer, it was very appreciated.<br>Compiling on command line finally gave me some feedback.<br>It&#39;s inconvenient but it solves it. </p>
<p>I guess the problem might have been the question topic. I should have written it to ask about the log rather than the problem itself.</p>
