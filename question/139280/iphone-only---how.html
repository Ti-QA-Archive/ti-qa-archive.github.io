			<h1>IPHONE ONLY - How?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m getting crazy over this. I have a working app ready for submit. It has to be an IPHONE ONLY app, thus I changed everything in app.xml and manifest accordingly. When I hit &quot;Distribute&quot; in Studio it nicely shows me the archive in XCode 4. It validates and submits without problems, but then iTunes Store asks me for a missing iPad screenshot!</p>
<p>Binary details say: your binary indicates support for iPad.</p>
<p>Then I recompile with Studio and open the proj with XCode4 and I do see THREE targets (iphone, ipad, universal). Ok, I build and archive the iphone version only (in my case I have to restate signatures, but ok). Everything succeeds. But there is NO WAY I can see the archive in XCode&#39;s organizer. I look into &#x2F;Library&#x2F;Developer&#x2F;XCode&#x2F;Archives and the archive is missing there too (or in some cases it&#39;s empty).</p>
<p>Please: is there a way to deploy an IPHONE ONLY app?</p>

							<p>Have you set it as an iPhone app in the tiapp.xml file ?….</p>
<p>Also all iPhone apps have to work on iPad, but are displayed as an iPhone sized app.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Trevor, of course I had configured the tiapp.xml accordingly. But a little update here: I opened a NEW project and set it for IPHONE ONLY from the very start (config wizard at new proj). Then I pasted my Resources inside. Well: iTunes hasn&#39;t asked me anything about iPads so far. Cross my fingers. At any rate, I noticed that Ti Studio keeps some initial configurations locked &quot;under the hood&quot; even if you change them on the run. Seems like a buggy behaviour. More on it later.</p>

										<p><p>Just checking. you never know in the forum how experienced people are. I tend to go into the xml itself and modify the code … Rather than the viewer…</p>

										<p><p>Yep, so do I, but as I said Ti Studio seems to hold back (or cache?) some starting config options, no matter what you change&#x2F;clean etc. In my case, it also happens with app&#39;s name. (BYW iTunes Connect hasn&#39;t complained yet).</p>
