			<p>I have some javascript files (.js) that I have in a Resources&#x2F;html&#x2F;js folder which are included by some html files in Resources&#x2F;html. All works well in the emulator and when testing on a device but when I create a distribution package (.apk) for the Android Market, the whole Resources&#x2F;html&#x2F;js folder has been omitted from the package. The Resources&#x2F;html folder is there along with some other subfolders (e.g. Resources&#x2F;html&#x2F;css).</p>

							<p>Yes, it is by design. By default, Titanium only compiles the javascript files in the distribution mode because it takes so long to do. With the number of times you have to deploy to the emulator or device during development, any little bit of time savings helps. With the long amount of time it takes to get the emulator up &amp; running, I am happy they went with this decision.</p>
<p>Anyways, if you would like to you can set a flag to enable compiling the javascript files, even while deploying to the emulator&#x2F;device. Simply add this to your TiApp.xml.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">property</span> <span class="hljs-property">name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"ti.android.compilejs"</span> type=<span class="hljs-string">"bool"</span>&gt;<span class="hljs-constant">true</span>&lt;/<span class="hljs-keyword">property</span>&gt;
</code></pre><p>With that enabled, you can get an idea of how long it takes to do and why it is not enabled by default.</p>
<p>Looking at the Titanium source it looks like setting this to false even overrides the distribution default of compiling, so you might be able to get away with that rather than changing your filenames. Though, that is discouraged as your application will be executing the javascript rather than the compiled byte code and it will be less efficient (though, it will probably run about as well as it does in when deployed to device). Also, I haven&#39;t exactly heard of anyone doing this so I cannot really tell you if it works.</p>

							<p>All .js files are compiled. You need to use a different extension (e.g. <code>.jsx</code>) to prevent them from being compiled in the final APK.</p>

							<p>Is that by design? That seems like a considerable oversight. Why does it work ok when deploying a test build to a device? Why isn&#39;t the behavior consistent whether you&#39;re developing, testing or deploying? I do see some .js files used by modules in my .apk so it doesn&#39;t appear to be some restriction enforced by the Droid SDK packaging tools. </p>
<p>Thankfully I discovered this when I deployed the Droid version of my app and the turnaround for the &#39;workaround&#39; is short. I feel really bad for anyone who didn&#39;t discover this until after submitting an iOS app to the App Store, only to wait a week to discover the problem and another to deploy the &#39;workaround&#39;.</p>
<p>More importantly, how many developers have wasted countless hours of time due to this inconsistency? Come on Appcelerator… this is the kind of thing that drives developers nuts!</p>
<p>P.S. … oh yeah.. don&#39;t forget to add .jsx to all of your .js file association preferences too.</p>
