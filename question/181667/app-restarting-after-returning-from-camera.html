			<h1>App restarting after returning from camera</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a camera button on my app that is used to take pictures and save those pictures in a custom gallery inside the app. After taking some pictures and save them, the app restarts when it returns from camera.<br>First, I thought that this could be Android killing my app due to low memory, because I was testing on a Galaxy Ace 2. But then this error starts to happen on some newer devices.<br>Does anyone have a clue about what could be happening?</p>

							<p>I a somewhat similar problem. I&#39;m showing 10 picture icons plus the current but larger. Had a optionDialog on Alloy that I reused for several onClick text boxes. If I first clicked on a text box and after on a picture it would work like a charm. But if I took a picture first and after clicked on a text box the app would crash. By creating new optionDialog controls in code the problem went away. I suspect the problem was caused by memory rearrangement by Android as it expanded the heap. Could your problem be similar?</p>

							<p>I think it&#39;s solved!<br>I was calling the camera using an Intent, now I&#39;m using the Ti.Media.showCamera function and, it seems that the error is not happening anymore.<br>Thank you for your answers!</p>
