			<p>Hi all …</p>
<p>I have a very uncool situation and i have no clue, why this is not working on one side, when its working on the other …</p>
<p>I wrote a HTML5 Application, that makes a remote ajax call to a website (Jquery based) - i use Titanium only for the webview not any more …</p>
<p>When i install this application over deploy to device, the app works like expected, but when i distribute the apk, place it to a website and download directly to the device, the application makes no Ajax Call&#39;s .. nothing happen … (i listen with tcpdump on the webserver, no call, not even 1 bit is coming in - deployed app directly to the device works, also visible in tcpdump what is expected)</p>
<p>Yes, i have the permission NETWORK_STATE, WIFI_STATE and INTERNET, or do i forget something but why is it working, when i deploy it directly (USB Debugging) to the device????</p>
<p>Thanks for your help … and sorry for my bad english …</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your reply, but this is logical .. i ask is there a difference between distribute and deploy in relation to my problem because my app works when i deploy to the client but not when i distribute it and install it over a website link (unknown sources is checked, etc. i can install the app, but the app does not use any communication (tcpdump) like when i deploy it to device directly over usb debugging)…</p>
