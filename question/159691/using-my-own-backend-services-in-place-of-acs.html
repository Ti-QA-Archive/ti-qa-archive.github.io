			<h1>Using my own backend services in place of ACS</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,<br>I‘m confused about this sentence:<br>“Eliminate the need to build your own private mobile back-end infrastructure and services to support your new apps”<br>and about terms&amp;conditions for the free version of Titanium Developer.</p>
<p>Let’s suppose I want to use the free version of Titanium to develop a mobile app for commercial purposes.<br>In this case can I use it completely for free if I respect this limitations: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;plans-pricing&#x2F;?</p>
<p>Can I continue to use my own backend services (so for free and without limitations of use), or I’m forced to use ACS? </p>
<p>Where can I find applicable licenses?</p>
<p>What about this Apple’s rule:<br>(iOS SDK states) applications may only use Documented APIs in the manner prescribed by Apple and must not use or call any private APIs. Applications must be originally written in Objective-C, C, C++, or JavaScript as executed by the iPhone OS WebKit engine, and only code written in C, C++, and Objective-C may compile and directly link against the Documented APIs (e.g., Applications that link to Documented APIs through an intermediary translation or compatibility layer or tool are prohibited)?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

										<p><p>Longer answer;</p>
<p>There are NO restrictions placed on you with what services you use or choose not to use with Appcelerator&#x2F;Titanium.</p>
<p>If you want to use one bit but not the others - feel free.  Want to use none - that is fine as well.  Want to provide your own back-end because;</p>
<ul>
<li>you already have one</li>
<li>just prefer to</li>
<li>do not want to learn ACS</li>
<li>do not need one</li>
<li>do not like the letters ACS</li>
</ul>
<p>You are free to choose.  </p>
<p>If you want to use someone else&#39;s back-end - go for it.  It &quot;may&quot; not be as closely linked together as ACS and Titanium are but that is also fine.</p>

										<p><p>I should also add - that you are actually misreading the line;</p>
<ul>
<li>Eliminate the need to build your own private mobile back-end infrastructure and services to support your new apps</li>
</ul>
<p>This says - you do not HAVE to spend any time creating these things yourself.</p>

										<p><p>Titanium ONLY uses documented APIs, all code is compiled through ObjectiveC and xcode in the background compile process - just you get the ability to code in JS which is much easier and faster.</p>
<p>You can even write your app - load xcode and run the app in xcode if you want, that is perfectly possible and many people do this to use the xcode advanced instruments to profile their apps and hunt for memory issues.  Or again - you do not have to if you do not want to.</p>
<p>ALL titanium apps will go in the iOS app store (and Android, Blackberry etc).  Provided YOU have met the rules and not done anything stupid.  But it will not be because of a private API or other offending issue that Titanium would have caused.</p>
<p>If you want to use Titanium for free, make and app, sell it and make a million - go for it - your choice.  Or as a free app - just as easy and your choice.</p>
<p>If you want to pay for Appcelerator (fully support contracts, SLA, advanced testing and monitoring tools - make full use of ACS and beyond - and put an app in the store - again - your choice.</p>

										<p><p>Sorry for any confusion - I did try really hard to point out you have no restrictions - but here I go again - it can be a bit confusing as there are lots of things to know and get asked.</p>
<ul>
<li>You do not have to pay Appcelerator anything to;<ul>
<li>You can create free apps</li>
<li>You can create paid apps</li>
<li>You can create free apps with in app purchases</li>
<li>You can create any mixture of payment in your apps </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can put your apps in these stores with no charges to Appcelerator<ul>
<li>Apple App Store</li>
<li>Google Play Store</li>
<li>Amazon App Store </li>
<li>Blackberry World (or whatever it is called)</li>
<li>Tizen app store (or whatever it is called)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You WILL have to pay Apple, Google, Tizen, Blackberry or whatever company a small annual fee to be in their store - this is paid directly to them not Appcelerator and is true of ALL development languages - this is their own fee.  These are small usually $100 or less each.</p>
<p>ONLY if you CHOOSE to use something that Appcelerator does charge for then you pay for that.  But they have even made that easy;</p>
<ul>
<li>The free version is called Titanium Studio</li>
<li>Paid version is called Appcelerator Studio</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have the free one then you only pay for things like custom modules - and then only from other third-parties - Appcelerator do not charge for their Titanium Modules</p>
<p>If you have the paid one - you will know about it - your support will be hands on, your app icon will be a bright red colour, your wallet will be dented - professional level hands on support with enterprise level additions to the framework cost real money - so you will be charged real money.</p>
<p>But again - if you are using Titanium Studio, create your app put it a store of your choice choose how or if to charge for the app and be happy.</p>

							<p>Thank you very much for your answers, but now I have another question:</p>
<p>can I put in the Play store and in the Apple store the app developed with titanium for free?<br>I ask because your third comment made me think that you can do this only if I pay for Appcelerator.</p>
