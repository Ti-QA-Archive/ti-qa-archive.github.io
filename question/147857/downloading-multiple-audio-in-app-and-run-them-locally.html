							<p>hi,</p>
<p>if you are going to download all the audios at once then it takes so much time to load so instead you can do one thing..</p>
<p>i think you show audio list in a table so when user clicks on table row to plat mp3 file then you should first check that if this file is available locally or not if not exists then download first and then play so when second time user wants to listen that file load that file locally and play.</p>

							<p>Maybe unrelated but if you want to PLAY the sounds simultaneously with nearly zero latency, you can try out Uri&#39;s ZLSound module in the marketplace.</p>
