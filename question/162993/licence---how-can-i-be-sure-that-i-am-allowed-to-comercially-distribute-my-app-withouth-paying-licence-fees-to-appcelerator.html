			<h1>Licence - How can I be sure, that I am allowed to comercially distribute my app withouth paying licence fees to appcelerator.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello, sorry, but the licence issue seems still unclear to me. Just to make sure - when I use the software Titanium Studio - and sell the apps commercially (e.g. Play&#x2F;App Store) - do I have to pay any licence fees to appcelerator?  At what level do I have to pay, and how is the pricing model?</p>

							<p>The short answer is No.  You do not have to pay Appcelerator a single penny.  The prices are for enterprise users who want enterprise level support.  They have a slightly improved product called Appcelerator Studio that has a few nice to have extra features but are not neccessary.  You can give away or sell your App in App Store and Play without any fees due to Appcelerator</p>
