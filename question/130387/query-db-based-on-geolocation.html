			<h1>query db based on geolocation</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I would like to do a &quot;Find nearest…&quot; in my app using geolocation. I have a database that has locations with a column that stores longitude and a column that stores latitude. I have looked at the kitchen sink example for geolocation to learn how to acquire the iphone user&#39;s location, but I still am not quite sure how I would query the database based on the current location. Is there an example that pulls locations from a database, comparing the current location to the locations in the database (say, for example, within a 20 mile radius).</p>
<p>Thanks for the help&#x2F;example…</p>

										<p><p>I have looked at all of the references above to see if I can figure out a way to have something that works cross platform (iOS and Android) and works with SQLite. I was able to get queries working on iOS using the information provided in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;125649&#x2F;defining-a-custom-sqlite-function.html#answer-227075">Defining a custom sqlite function</a>, but this does not work on Android. </p>
<p>The information provided in the link above labelled &#39;SQLite and Getting Records based upon radius) looks promising, except I don&#39;t really understand the math associated with the approach using 4 additional fields.</p>
<p>Does anyone have a cross platform example (code) or SQLite query with the extra fields (as shown in the mentioned link) that they could share? Or another cross-platform approach?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ray</p>

										<p><p>I have decided to make use of a mySQL database to facilitate this, and I am hoping the link above labeled &quot;Calculate Distance in MySQL with Lat&#x2F;Lon&quot; is my solution. I will be able to get the lat&#x2F;long from ios and use the select statement used on that page to get nearest results based on the provided whole number distance in miles.</p>
<p>However, I have not had the opportunity to test this, so I am simply hoping for now.</p>
<p>As for a cross platform version with SQLite, I would still be happy to see a working example for this or future projects.</p>

										<p><p>Well, as I mentioned a few hours ago, I wanted to try the SQL query in my DB using the link above labeled &quot;Calculate Distance in MySQL with Lat&#x2F;Lon&quot;. I just tried it and it worked! I have yet to integrate it with my app, but I feel that should not be much of a problem. Great collection of information here, thank you Stephen for the quality resources!</p>

							<p>Actually Vincenty formula is more accurate than Haversine. This is because Haversine considers the earth to be a great sphere while Vincenty consider that the earth is actually an oblate spheroid, thus much more accurate.</p>
<p>If you want, you can study Vincenty formula here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.movable-type.co.uk&#x2F;scripts&#x2F;latlong-vincenty.html</p>
<p>It has two variations where you can calculate the distance between two points, or given a point, bearing and distance, return the lat&#x2F;long of point 2.</p>
<p>There is a JS implementation that you can use on the page too.</p>
