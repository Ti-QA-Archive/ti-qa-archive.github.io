<p>There should be a blog article up on <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;">developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;</a> later today to explain what and when from Appcelerator - this is the normal way of things.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Some were having a discussion last wondering when the first iOS7 Q&amp;A question would come in.</p>
<p>Hopefully people can add their comments to this question, up vote the question to help it stay in focus.</p>
<p>First thing to note, the official support for a new OS is 1 month from release and usually in the form of compatibility.  New features come after this and are provided based on ease of provision and majority benefit. Some may come as modules which is the new way Appcelerator&#x2F;Titanium is now providing things, unless of course the &quot;new&quot; thing is system wide or an extension to the old thing.</p>
<p>Should you start testing your apps on iOS 7 (compile them), yes - start checking things out, but right now you will not know if any issues are your code, Titanium needing a tweak or the fact iOS7 is a beta.</p>
<p>This is a starting point, I and other will add more.</p>

										<p><p>From my own apps only one thing of note; (as I say, these may be me, Titanium or iOS7)</p>
<ul>
<li>TableView with headers have issues</li>
</ul>
<p>I suspect this is due to &quot;assuming&quot; a default position or dimension - not something I would do normally which is why most work very well.</p>
<p>My suggestion is if you are adding a view or any kind to something, set the width &amp; height to something, this does not need to be an actual value, Ti.UI.SIZE or Ti.UI.FILL is fine.  Something so the view knew what you wanted it to do.</p>

										<p><p>BarColor is now barTintColor and tintColor is now used for coloring the Labels (icons right&#x2F;leftNav button tints) everywhere on the Window, it&#39;s a new iOS7 design pattern where also the Tabs (if exists) also use the focused windows&#39; tintColor.</p>

										<p><p>@Joseph I would suggest (and ask) that you create a <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;">jira.appcelerator.org</a> for this as Appcelerator will need to expose this property as soon as possible and judging by your information it is an easy add to the SDK as it a simple property addition.</p>

							<p>If i am not mistaken, storing files in the &quot;Titanium.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory&quot; is currently not available atleast no files end up in my documents folder of the application. Or this could be an issue with the beta release of this xcode5??</p>

										<p><p>This seems to be a change in iOS7 that no longer includes &#39;localhost&#39; in the file path when referencing a locally stored file. I was able to resolve this issue for now by changing the <strong>pathFromComponents</strong> function in <strong>FilesystemModule.m</strong> to no longer check for &quot;<strong>file:&#x2F;&#x2F;localhost&#x2F;</strong>&quot; and instead just look for the prefix of &quot;<strong>file:&#x2F;&#x2F;</strong>&quot;.</p>

							<p>I also has an input to the Appcelerator team. I&#39;ve just updated my iPhone to iOS7 and in my app I save images to the applicationDataDirectory but the images are not saved. I do not know if this is a Appcelerator or Apple issue, but thought you like to know if you didn&#39;t already. Sending the same image to the photo gallery on the iPhone works as before.</p>

							<p>I think it will be a few things which not proper work anymore on iOS7, but these changes and &quot;problems&quot; should placed in another question or thread. The BIG question here is, WHEN the compatibility-update from Appcelerator comes and what for API-changes there are included (which new API&#39;s are added, …)</p>

										<p><p>Thank you. I&#39;ve not seen it above. But just to clarify again: iOS7-compatibility ensures 30 days after the official - public - release (in fall) or 30 days after the release for developers (in mid July) …?</p>

										<p><p>@Sirik 30 days after public release - not developers.  That does NOT mean it will not be sooner, it does not mean that every single new feature will be available.</p>
<p>It means that Studio and the SDK will be able to create apps that will work within iOS7 without an fundamental problems.</p>
<p>New features and changes will continue to be added (or not) depending on the popularity and the speed of implementation for each feature.  Some will be left to third-party developers to create modules available in the market place or in the public via services like github.</p>

							<p>My apps also have problems on iOS7… But I really trust that appcelerator team will make titanium ios7 compatible really soon. My problems seems related with network http requests doesn&#39;t getting content or doesn&#39;t firing events.</p>
<p>Regards<br>J</p>

							<p>I have several problems with iOS 7. One app is showing wrong colors in title bar, localization is not working and some windows are not opening too.<br>As those windows are generated by dynamic content from xml files, and the localization is also based on files,I think the problem has something todo with the paths, that are not working anymore?!<br>For example Ti.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory could root to a wrong directory.</p>
<p>Has anymore similar issues?</p>
