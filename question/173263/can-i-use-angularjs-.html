							<p>I read that unlike Phonegapp &#x2F; Cordova, Titanium was designed only in javascript, and I do not like too develop native javascript, I prefer to use my javascript framework to build applications (like AngularJS)</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>This is a strange question.  If you have a web page in a webView then you can use any js library that works on any other page.  If you are hoping that a js library will allow you to interact with the Ti framework then you are not going to get much satisfaction - the general rule is no.</p>
<p>I am not sure if your framework question relates to Alloy or a web page need.  You really to ask a fuller more descriptive question stating the actual problem you are trying to resolve, otherwise we have to guess your intent.</p>

										<p><p>Titanium uses javascript as it&#39;s language but you are mixing two things; titanium is not web pages so web page based javascript frameworks have no relevance.</p>
<p>You do have to learn real javascript and the titanium API.  This is normal; jquery,  angular or other web page based framework have no relevance here.</p>
<p>If you do not like javascript then you will not be developing using titanium, but if you spent some time trying you would find it is not hard.</p>

										<p><p>The project is proprietary so I don&#39;t have any source code to share.  However, if you take any of the sample projects out there for AngularJS and drop it into your TI mobile project you can see how it works.  The only issue we ran into was with the cookie directive and ended up using <a href="github.com&#x2F;ivpusic&#x2F;angular-cookie">ipCookie</a></p>

							<p>To put it simple AngularJS is designed to interact with HTML, while Titanium was designed to interact with the wrapper, which will interact with the native APIs. You can&#39;t use HTML in titanium, but you can use Alloy.</p>
<p>The only way you could use AngularJS is by using a webview inside titanium and embeding AngularJS in that webview, that would however give you the same experience as phonegap&#x2F;cordova. </p>
<p>I highly suggest watching some tutorials on YouTube, you can really get the feel of how titanium works.</p>
