			<h1>Anyone actually use &#34;masuidrive&#34; for In-App?</h1>

			<p>Title says it all.  The upgrade cost to get the &quot;official&quot; Appcelerator is way too expensive for me as an indie developer right now.  I&#39;m wanting to add in-app upgrading to my existing free version of an app (has about 13k downloads, 9k active users), and upgrading would just enable a few more features and remove the ads.  15k to me if everyone upgraded would be nice, all for just a few lines of code.</p>
<p>So, has anyone actually gotten the &quot;masuidrive&quot; to work?  It says its only in Alpha, and it doesnt look like the author is posting any documentation, updates, etc.</p>

							<p>I haven&#39;t used it, but it does appear to work OK. </p>
<p>You do need to build it yourself though. Also, I think you&#39;ll need to update a few values in the config and manifest files to your current SDK. Also, I couldn&#39;t get it to build without first opening the XCode project file and making sure I had a target SDK set correctly.</p>

										<p><p>Having said that, I&#39;m getting some errors trying to install on the device. </p>
<p>On the simulator, it appeared to pass all the example tests provided up until it tried to conenct to iTunes, which obviously the simulator can&#39;t do.</p>
