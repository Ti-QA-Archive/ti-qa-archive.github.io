			<h1>Well... I&#39;m back!</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Some of you will laugh. Some of you will shun or mock me. Some of you will welcome me back with open arms. Some will say who the hell are you.</p>
<p>But… I&#39;m back. After my two day affair with PhoneGap, I guess I&#39;m back in the Appcelerator camp. What I found is this… PhoneGap is an absolute thrill to develop in from a layout standpoint and making it responsive to different screen sizes and orientations. The HTML5 and CSS with media queries is just so great… and allows for quickly getting an app from zero to having all the basic function built out very very quickly.</p>
<p>Why am I back then? Because that&#39;s about the only thing that&#39;s quick. I ditched jQuery Mobile and got some significant speed gains with Zepto.JS and my own code. However, no matter what I did the touch events and swipe events in that WebView didn&#39;t cut it for my app. I needed to be able to rapid fire touches at it… and it just completely faltered.</p>
<p>I think both platforms are probably good to have in the back pocket for different jobs. If I had a basic content-driven app, I think I might just use PhoneGap again. But it became quickly obvious that if you need something mission critical performance wise… gotta stick with Appcelerator.</p>
<p>so…….. now………. back to trying to figure out why my app is blowing up. And dealing with the bugs. I hope things get better around here with the funding. The energy seems to be there in the marketing materials. I hope that we see that translate into the bug fixes, documentation, and support…. and not just for those paying customers. If you want to make me a paying customer you better make me fall in love first. Right now I&#39;m not in love with any of my options. And since I&#39;m not making a lot of money on apps (yet) then can&#39;t afford what the going rate is.</p>
<p>I would love to be a part of the community more and contribute… if I feel like I&#39;m being heard and supported by the company.</p>
<p>Lastly… think I&#39;m going to open source my framework. Anyone interested or is everyone already flooded with Ti MVC Frameworks?</p>

<p>Welcome back Jason!</p>
<p>As for open source codes… It&#39;s always good to have as many examples on an environment - it allows others to learn new stuff and get new ideas about the platform. I say - go for it!</p>

							<p>Welcome back!</p>
<p>Yes, please do open source you framework, I would love to see your ideas. Titanium has some frameworks, but to be honest, I don&#39;t like any one and none is all around solution. :)</p>

							<p>You were confused, we can understand this, don&#39;t worry… but you know that you&#39;ll have to work hard to be trusty and make the relationship work again, don&#39;t you ? Joking :)</p>
<p>PhoneGap is a great thing, but for small apps. Apps that require more computational power will fail because the webview is eating all the little device can give.</p>
<p>Put your framework on github, if people will find it interesting maybe will gain traction,but if not is always a good entry in the portfolio (that will bring you more money if you work as a freelancer). </p>
<p>About the community, don&#39;t expect something in return. Everybody is to busy with their problems so they don&#39;t want to &quot;loose&quot; time on QA. There are so few posts on the forum with people giving and not asking that almost don&#39;t matter.<br>The payback instead is when u really solve somebody&#39;s problem, and if you manage to go high enough in the that top in right, you will have another strong entry in your portfolio that will bring you more money.</p>
<p>So welcome back :)</p>

							<p>I think the key thing to remember is that announcing that you are leaving was a little over the top… You are an adult and you have the right to choose whatever platform meets your specific needs for your specific project. Like Dan said, everyone is busy here trying to get something done and make a living… reading about someone complaining about a platform really only reflects poorly on you.</p>
<p>Appcelerator is not perfect but it is a great platform and it is evolving and getting better everyday, it is just like every other relationship; <strong><em>you get out of it what you put into it.</em></strong></p>

										<p><p>Hmmm… well we can agree to disagree. I feel like I am left with three legitimate choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Native: Duplicate the effort and time to market.</li>
<li>Appcelerator: Buggy, spend effort working around bugs delaying time to market.</li>
<li>PhoneGap: Slow responsiveness and performance</li>
</ul>
<p>Of the three, I guess (at least for my current app that requires high responsiveness) have to choose Appcelerator. But basically I think none of the three are incredibly good options.</p>
<p>Long term I am a fan of HTML5 as a complete cross-platform and responsive platform and hope they can solve those speed issues. Short term though Appcelerator looks like the best option… and has lots of promise, but not well executed or supported.</p>
<p>Was my &quot;peace out&quot; premature? Yeah. Okay. I could have run a trial with PhoneGap first, but it was out of pure frustration. I think that Appcelerator as a company right now is not being very good to the community at all… in fact, I think they suck. They are not here giving answers… which is very different from the PhoneGap community where the PhoneGap people are actively involved in all of the discussions and Google Groups.</p>
<p>Questions here go unanswered, bugs go unfixed.</p>
<p>To my fundamental question I get about what would change between build and deploy to break it… crickets.</p>
<p>So guess what… I will still bitch about it until they do something to make it better… and so far all I see are unfulfilled promises. And I know I am saying the same thing that whole of people are thinking because I&#39;ve read it over and over again. Same complaints. Crickets.</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to release my framework soon and hopefully people will like it. That&#39;s my contribution to the community. I&#39;m going to put in… we&#39;ll see if it comes back to me.</p>
<p>My one regret in my &quot;peace out&quot; message was calling you guys, the community, out. That was frustration and wrong. I don&#39;t apologize for the rest.</p>

										<p><p>This will be my last comment to you because going back and forth with you will just continue to demonstrate your lack of professionalism, and I would hate to contribute to your continued public embarrassment; you have already done enough yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Appcelerator sucks… They are not here giving answers…</strong>  take a look at the top responders, they are mostly appcelerator employees, AND this is a <strong>&quot;community based forum&quot;</strong> so if you have anyone to complain to, it is the community… look in the mirror, how many questions have you answered? If everyone takes the same attitude as you, then yes, the community will suffer, it is easy to complain… just like it was easy to write the post that you were leaving and now you are back.</p>

										<p><p><strong><em>&quot;look in the mirror, how many questions have you answered?&quot;</em></strong></p>
<p>Well since you asked, I looked back at my Q&amp;A profile and I have answered more questions than I&#39;ve asked. So, yes, while I don&#39;t come here often (since mobile projects are only a small part of what I do) when I am here I do try to be a helpful and contributing member of the community.</p>
<p>I guess you won&#39;t reply. But like I said I think my same frustrations are echoed over and over on this board. So I&#39;m not inventing the issues. I believe it is something that the company would be wise to address and win us who are not yet loyal to the platform over for good.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s bad advice.</p>
