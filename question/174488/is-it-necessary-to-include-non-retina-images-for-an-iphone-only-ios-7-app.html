			<h1>Is it necessary to include non-retina images for an iPhone only, iOS 7+ app?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Sorry if this has been answered before. I could not find an answer with the search feature here.</p>
<p>I&#39;m working on an iPhone iOS 7+ only app. Am I required to include the non-retina versions of all the images? </p>
<p>I know I can exclude them and everything works fine during development, but I was wondering if there is an Apple review specific requirement for non-retina images, outside of the app icons for the store?</p>
<p>TIA</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>This one is a tricky one - one the surface the answer is easy - there are no supported iPhones or iPad Touches that are capable of running iOS7.  The earliest supported iPhone is the iPhone 4 and the earliest supported iPod Touch is the iPod Touch 5th generation - these as retina or retina tall devices. So no need for non-retina images.</p>
<p>So that suggests you do not require non-retina images. However…</p>
<p>If you check the guidelines &quot;App Store Review Guidelines&quot; 2.10 (not linked as document only available to approved iOS developers.  It points out that any iPhone app must perform correctly without modification on the iPad&#39;s compatibility mode and run in both x1 and x2.</p>
<p>Neither the iPad mini 1st generation or iPad 2nd generation have retina displays.  However both are capable of running iOS 7.  Which means your app does still require non-retina images if if the app is iOS 7 and iPhone only.</p>
<p>This is according to Apples own rules.  But keep in mind these are subject to human interpretation during review.  This can come down both heavy and light on perceived and real rule breaking.</p>
<p>If it was me - and it is of course as I do this for a living - provide both.</p>
<p>Note: the imminent launch of a new iPhone will undoubtedly mean a new resolution and density - so expect to have to manage three - at least for a while.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you Malcom! very helpful indeed. I will include both, I just wanted to get a feel whether other developers are omitting non-retina files or not and if Apple checked on that specifically.  Being this is my first app, I really don&#39;t want any issues with the approval, so I will include both.</p>
