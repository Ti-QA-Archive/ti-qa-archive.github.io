							<div><p>Hello Nazir,</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll agree, that your question doesn&#39;t gives us much to work with. I strongly suggest you have a look at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;ask">the guidelines to follow</a> when asking a question.</p>
<p>Also, please include some code detailing what you are trying to achieve. This will give everyone a better understanding of the problem you are facing.</p>
<p>Simply asking for an entire solution without having experienced it yourself seems counter-productive.</p>

<p>You are unlikely to find anyone who will give you an entire code solution without seeing something you have attempted so far.  Your request is not like &quot;I do not know how to get a lat&#x2F;lon&quot; you can already make a start on this.</p>

							<p>Nazir, As far I got you, You need to open a window having lack background with 0.5 opacity so that it will look like modal window and than add you all images in a scrollview to swipe them and add this scrollview to that modal win.<br>I hope it may help you.</p>
