							<p>OK if anyone else is interested JDK comes with OSX which explains why its not available on Oracle.</p>
<p>For new Mac users it might help to note that they dont need to get it in the getting started guide.</p>

							<p>Please provide something about the problem. Screenshots, Trace logs, error message dialog, installed android platforms, etc. No one can help you without information. </p>
<p>Make sure you have the Android 1.6 platform installed and SDK Tools v5 or better. You also need JDK 6 (aka 1.6). The ADK setting on your profile page in Developer must point to the root of the ADK and not into the platforms folder.</p>
<p>You might also read the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;doc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;mobile-build-windows">installation guide</a> You do not have to install the tools for building, but the steps at the beginning of the guide are relevant.</p>

							<p>Hi Im also trying to start Titanium, I dont have an error but I am unable to select anything for Project type. I assume its a static field and only selected to Desktop because I am missing SDKs for Mobile. However I do have the iOS SDK installed along with Developer&#x2F; on my iMac Snow Leopard.<br>Are you required to have all mobile SDKs for it to work? To begin with Im only interested in iPad&#x2F;iPhone development and will get the Android SDK later once I&#39;ve got a basic grip of things?</p>
<p>Do I need all the SDKs or is there a way to make Titanium aware that I do have the iOS SDK installed?</p>

<p>Take a look at this <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;troubleshooting_your_installation.html">Troubleshooting Your Installation</a> guide, that explains what Titanium Developer does behind the scenes and how to interpret from its output what is going wrong.</p>

							<p>Hi yeah I read the guide but to me it doesn&#39;t read as &quot;you must have both iOS and Android SDK installed first&quot; I had assumed that if you wanted only iOS that would do (I already had iOS SDK), perhaps it should be more specific to me it seems like either is an option, obviously not. It doesnt matter I guess since I downloaded android anyway but it weird that you need android at all to be able to choose iPad which is iOS.<br>Anyway i can now choose mobile and iPad :)</p>
<p>RE: you also need JDK 6 (aka 1.6) - do I need it for OSX?<br>I was able to instal Android without it.<br>Also the link you have to the JDK takes me to a chinese page (I am in Australia) and in addition to that when i switched to the english Oracle site there was no option for mac at all in the downloads under platforms dropdown only windows, linux and solaris(I think).</p>

<p>Sorry, where does it say that both android and iOS SDKs are required? If it really does say this somewhere, then it needs to be corrected. Please post the page&#x2F;section.</p>
<p>Yes, I believe that JDK 1.6 is mandatory. Where is the link to a chinese site?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>Hi Hal,</p>
<p>Sorry if I didn&#39;t make that clear. It doesn&#39;t say that both are required but I had iOS SDK on my machine before Titanium. After installing Titanium I was only able to create Desktop apps. I was only given the option for mobile and iPad. So the only thing I could think of trying is doing is install Android SDK.<br>After installing Android mobile and iPad was available. This is why I was confused by the fact that I couldn&#39;t create iPad projects until I installed Android. </p>
<p>If you don&#39;t have to have both installed to do this then I guess it was a bug you should be aware of because I already had latest iOS SDK yet could not choose iPad which is what I wanted.</p>
<p>The link to the Chinese oracle site is the link in the getting started that says &quot;Java SDK (JDK)&quot; the url is: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oracle.com&#x2F;technetwork&#x2F;java&#x2F;javase&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;index.html<br>Perhaps its a location thing but in Australia we actually speak English not Chinese lol<br>When I click the JDK link the download page have a dropdown option where you must choose your platform, there is no option for OSX only windows, linux and solaris. Neither is mac or OSX listed in their Supported System Configuration page: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oracle.com&#x2F;technetwork&#x2F;java&#x2F;javase&#x2F;system-configurations-135212.html<br>It makes no difference if you link to the JDK fron the English or chinese version there is no mac option.</p>
<p>If JDK 1.6 is mandatory how to you obtain it for mac OSX or is it not required for the OSX platform?</p>

							<p>Hello again.</p>
<p>Still confused about the JDK requirement can someone please confirm if you need it for Mac OSX or not?<br>Its not listed as a supported platform for JDK on the Oracle site.<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oracle.com&#x2F;technetwork&#x2F;java&#x2F;javase&#x2F;index-137561.html</p>
<p>If it isn&#39;t maybe the getting started should say Windows, Linux and Solaris users will need the JDK</p>
