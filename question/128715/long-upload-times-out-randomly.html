			<h1>Long upload times out randomly?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey,</p>
<p>We&#39;re testing our iPad applications upload feature using very slow 3G connections. </p>
<p>We&#39;re uploading around 1.5mb of JSON data to a web service, with the connection throttled to 2 KB&#x2F;sec to simulate the worst case 3G scenario. This takes around 10 minutes to send the request.</p>
<p>The upload was timing out randomly after around 8minutes according to Titanium, however our proxy monitor (Charles) showed the upload was still continuing and completes but the client has already timed out.</p>
<p>We have the HTTP client timeout set at 60 seconds, although this is for the response not for the request (which times out after 8minutes). I tried setting the timeout to 80 seconds, and we get to almost 9 minutes before the upload dies. Setting it to 1 hour meant the 10 minute upload successfully completed. </p>
<p>We obviously don&#39;t want to leave our timeout that high and the upload size could be anything, so its impossible to determine what it should be set at.</p>
<p>Can anyone tell us what the correlation between that timeout and the apparent upload timeout actually is? 60secs = 8 mins for upload timeout?</p>
<p>Some clarification would be great thanks!</p>

							<p>I&#39;m not sure if there is any correlation between this 2 times you have. Maybe you could take a look into the sources and see if you find something there.</p>
<p>Now 1.5M of data is pretty much, are you doing something to make it smaller?<br>Zipping it before sending the data may help a lot, or breaking it in few requests, or maybe even both :)</p>
