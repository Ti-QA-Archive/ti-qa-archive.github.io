			<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I am thinking to go for cross platform for my next project, but before this I am doing some research on different cross platform available in the market and their pros and cons. I have following concerns:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>As far as I got to know that Titanium is best cross platform for android &amp; IOS application. Does any one differ with this?</p>
</li>
<li><p>I read in different blogs and different user&#39;s experience that, Titanium is good for simple applications only. For complex applications story is different. As complexity increases, Titanium starts behaving weird and throws random errors and crashes, specially for Android.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Can you all please share your experience related to this with me, It will be very helpful for me.  </p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Sonam</p>

							<p>This question is undepending of framework. If you want to build a more complex app then it is a good idea to use software patterns like MVC and&#x2F;or commonJS.  We have build complex apps and the apps works performant .. It is only a question of software quality. </p>
<p>Hope this help in your decision.</p>

							<p>I agree with Rainer.  I think that Titanium may have gotten a bad reputation early on, probably due to a number of issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>immaturity of the platform</li>
<li>lack of guidance for application architecture</li>
<li>the misguided perception that if you&#39;ve ever written a few lines of Javascript in a crappy web page,  you could now build robust mobile apps because Titanium makes it that easy</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that these issues have been largely resolved.  Titanium has definitely matured and CommonJS and Alloy have emerged as two solid application architectures.</p>
<p>That is not to say that building a large, complicated mobile app with Titanium is painless.  You will certainly experience your share of frustration.  But if I had to guess, I would say that you could build a cross-platform (android + ios) app with about 120% of the effort of building one of them natively.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Jason.<br>I agree with your answer as whatever blogs I have read are all most a year old. I got worried as all have given really a bad review for android version and complex apps.</p>
<p>Please tell me one more thing. What I know that you have to make some changes to deploy your code to other platform. Like if you have developed for IOS using Titanium then to make it work on Android you have to make changes. Is these changes are lot or just little changes?</p>
<p>One more thing which platform you will vote for Android &amp; IOS app as a cross platform: Titanium OR PhoneGap.<br>I hope these questions are under the range of these thread.</p>
<p>Best Wishes,<br>Sonam</p>

										<p><p>If you want a cross platform app, you should build it cross platform from the very beginning, and you should test on both platforms daily.  Otherwise, it will be extremely difficult to take your iphone-only app and get it to run on android.  Not impossible, but painful.  I&#39;ve seen many developers bad-mouth Titanium because they built the entire app for iphone and <em>then</em> tried to port to android.</p>
<p>Building for android takes a whole different mindset, which iphone users aren&#39;t accustomed to – you have to accomodate all sizes of displays, which can be very tedious.  But this is something that native android developers are already used to doing.</p>
<p>Given a choice between phonegap and Titanium, I would choose Titanium.  Titanium uses true native UI elements.  Your application logic is in Javascript, but the UI is native.  This leads to a more natural experience for the end user, and likely better performance.</p>
<p>As I understand it, phonegap relies on other mobile JS frameworks for the UI.  I have found that such frameworks (like jquery mobile) are enticing, but ultimately disappointing.  I love the idea, but in reality, there are too many weird artifacts, like footer bars scrolling with content, flickering on transitions, etc.  I think it would be very hard to build an app that would really feel like a native app with such toolkits.</p>
