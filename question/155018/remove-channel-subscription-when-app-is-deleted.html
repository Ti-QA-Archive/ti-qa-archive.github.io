										<p><p>Here&#39;s a scenario for you…</p>
<p>User A downloads the app, and logs in. They are subscribed to the channel.</p>
<p>User A deletes the app WITHOUT logging out</p>
<p>User A sells phone to User B</p>
<p>User B downloads same app, and logs in. </p>
<p>There are now two users subscribed to that channel that have the same device token, which means that user B will receive notifications for user A</p>

										<p><p>Not going to happen.  User B will have reset the phone they bought to associate with their Apple ID. So contents will have been wiped and in any case if user B re-downloaded App all traces of the sign-in token will have been removed from device</p>
