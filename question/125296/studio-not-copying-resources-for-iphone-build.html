			<h1>Studio not copying resources for iPhone build</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m using Titanium Studio, with all the latest updates, and I&#39;ve found that while I can launch a test build in the iPhone simulator, if I try to build this project to the device, or load the xcode project and build it directly onto the device from there, none of my other resource files are available. None of them are in the folder at all if I look in Resources under build&#x2F;iPhone&#x2F;. </p>
<p>Am I missing something here? How does it install all the files into the simulator from Titanium Studio, but then they&#39;re nowhere to be found any other time when you want to build to the device?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>strange I also had this issue .. the strange thing is that the previous upgrade seems to have fixed it……</p>

							<p>Checking the logs, there were two files that were in a sub folder that were coming up missing. Even though I needed that folder structure intact, I moved the two of them out and into the root source folder. (sigh)</p>
<p>That fixed the build to device problem. I still have not figured out where the resources files are actually stored in the build directory. I&#39;m assuming they are referenced at their real location, up a few directories?</p>
