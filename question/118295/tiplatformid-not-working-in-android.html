<p>Unfortuantely, although <code>Ti.Platform.id</code> could have originally been used for your purpose, as it was supposed to be unique, there is no way of doing this now, since a bug was introduced in the Froyo Android release whereby the string &quot;DROID2&quot; is returned regardless of the device. See the countless discussions about it in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.co.uk&#x2F;search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=android+unique+%2Bdroid2">this Google search</a>.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>Update to my previous post, please be aware of ticket <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32238-titanium-mobile&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;2327">#2327</a>.</p>
<p>Please can you clarify what you mean by &quot;Ti.Platform.id not working in Android&quot; - what is not working? What exactly is the behavior? What is returned when you call the property?</p>
<p>What Titanium and Android versions are you using? You should <em>always</em> include these in your questions, and the question tags are the best place to put the information. In many cases, your question will simply be ignored by the community if you don&#39;t diligently provide sufficient information for people to work with.</p>

										<p><p>When you say you have tried APIs 1.6 and 2.2, do you mean you have tested this in an emulator? You have implied in your question that you have tested it on a device. Would you clarify which devices and emulators you have tested for this issue?  Thank you.</p>

										<p><p>I used HTC T-Mobile G1..and similar emulator versions like APis 1.6,1.6,APIs 2.2,2.2</p>
<p>What I did is that gave alert(&#39;Ti.Platform.id &#39;+Ti.Platform.id) in the app.js and also in the next screen.</p>
<p>I received the alert with the proper platform id in the IPHONE simulator.When I ran the Android emulator I received an empty alert.</p>
<p>Then I tried using alert dialogue and Ti.API.info…they worked in IPHONE simulator and not in Android Emulators.I received the empty alertDialogue.</p>
<p>This is my exact problem. To login to the server I need the device ID of the device.It need not be unique(for now at least).</p>
<p>So kindly help me with getting the device id or any other ID like IMEI (no other blog gave a solution for this IMEI) or is there any other ID of the device that we can access using Titanium.</p>

<p>There is no reliable way to determine the device ID, particularly due to a bug in Android 2.2 where the string &quot;DROID2&quot; is returned regardless of the device. See the countless discussions about it in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.co.uk&#x2F;search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=android+unique+%2Bdroid2">this Google search</a>. That said, this issue was somewhat mitigated by the Titanium core team, in ticket <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-2327">TIMOB-2327</a>.</p>
<p>However, the official Android Developers advice is to generate an installation ID on first boot. Read <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;android-developers.blogspot.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;03&#x2F;identifying-app-installations.html">this article</a> for a full explanation.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
