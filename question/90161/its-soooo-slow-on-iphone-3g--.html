							<p>I can also confirm that nearly every application on my iPhone 3G became unusable after I updated to iOS 4.x, including the Titanium ones.  Your Titanium app running on an iPhone 3G on 3.1.3 should be a better experience.</p>

										<p><p>Well, I know that firmware 4.01 was slow and 4.1 was also not really faster on that device…  I already downgraded my new bought iPhone 3G (testing purposes) to 3.1.3<br>That firmware seems to run faster…. also my app seem to run a little bit faster…. the animations of modal windows are now smoother again….<br>I could not believe I ever used such a slow phone…. :-)</p>

							<p>Have you read at all about 4.2.1 on the 3G?  The recommended action was NOT to update that phone, its way too slow and just cant handle it for whatever reason.</p>
<p>I&#39;d google around and look at how to downgrade if I were you.</p>
<p>On another note, I sold 2 3g phones on ebay for about $200 each last week, so if you&#39;re eligible for an upgrade, I would do that instead and just buy a new one.</p>
