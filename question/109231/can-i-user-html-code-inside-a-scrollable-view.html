			<p>edit: correct title -  Can I use HTML code inside a scrollable view?</p>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I am developing an ebook app. Its just a simple app that will let users read an ebook.</p>
<p>For that I am planning to use the scrollable view, but I can&#39;t find a way to insert HTML content inside each item.</p>
<p>Also, is there any way save the user position so if the app crashed it will start from there?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>AFAIK, HTML code must be used in a webview.  I have never tried placing a webview as a view page inside a scrollable view, but I suspect it should work.</p>

										<p><p>This might work but it will also make the app super slow… Just my 2 cents.</p>

										<p><p>That may be true, but still the request was to use HTML code and the only I know of to do that is a webview.  Emphasis on &quot;that I know of&quot;.</p>

										<p><p>Hello! thanks both for the answers. Maybe I am wrong with the approach. What I am trying to achieve is a similar functionality as the one on the Kindle App where the users can drag the page, thats why I though of using the scrollable view with HTML code inside. Do you think a different approach should work better? thanks again</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ve never used any kindle app (on a dedicated device or phone), nor any other ebook reader.  I was just trying to address the original question.  I&#39;ve never had occasion to drag anything in titanium, but a Q&amp;A search on drag shows things like <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;45081&#x2F;can-anyone-provide-a-good-way-to-drag-in-14">this</a>.</p>
