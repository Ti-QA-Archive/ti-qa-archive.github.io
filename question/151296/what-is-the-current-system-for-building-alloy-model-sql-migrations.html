			<h1>What is the current system for building Alloy Model SQL migrations?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Version One of my app is in the store from about a month ago. I need to add a few columns to my model and I haven&#39;t got an upgrade to work yet with this migration. If I install from the app store, then &quot;replace&quot; with this new compiled version, the missing database columns throw exceptions when accessed.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">migration.up = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(migrator)</span></span> {
    migrator.db.execute(<span class="hljs-string">'ALTER TABLE '</span> + migrator.<span class="hljs-built_in">table</span> + <span class="hljs-string">' ADD COLUMN directions TEXT;'</span>);
    migrator.db.execute(<span class="hljs-string">'ALTER TABLE '</span> + migrator.<span class="hljs-built_in">table</span> + <span class="hljs-string">' ADD COLUMN latitude REAL;'</span>);
    migrator.db.execute(<span class="hljs-string">'ALTER TABLE '</span> + migrator.<span class="hljs-built_in">table</span> + <span class="hljs-string">' ADD COLUMN longitude REAL;'</span>);
};
</code></pre><p>How to develop&#x2F;test migrations and how do I get one working that adds columns to my &quot;sql&quot; adapter Model? In the Alloy CHANGELOG.md, the process is a bit confusing. If we delete the migration file after running it locally, what effect is intended for those who already have the app installed?</p>
<p>What I need is a way to get from users&#39; existing installations to the new schema without throwing exceptions when they update.</p>

							<div><p>What you have looks like the appropriate way to add columns via migrations, so we need to know more. Can you list your alloy version (alloy –version), all your migrations and their filenames, your model, how you are accessing the new columns, and the exact error you&#39;re getting when you do.</p>

							<div><p>I reinstalled from App Store and updated with the migration and can not reproduce the problem. Looks like the migration is working now. Maybe there was an intermediate version problem while I was working on the migration. Thanks and I&#39;ll update if I find out what it was or can make it happen again.</p>

							<p>Found it: In version A, I saved a few models that obviously had no value for new column X. When I updated to version B which includes column X, I tried to run a String function on the value of column X, which was null in the case of previously saved model instances. Two possible solutions are to 1. fill in the database column for old rows during the migration …or… 2. make sure the column value isn&#39;t null before running a string function on it.</p>

										<p><p>So you are all squared away then? The migrations are working, they were just returning unaccounted for NULLs?</p>
