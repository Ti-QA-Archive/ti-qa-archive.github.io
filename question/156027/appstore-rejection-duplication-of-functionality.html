			<h1>AppStore Rejection Duplication of Functionality</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I received a Rejection while trying to submit my app. They said the reason is that my app Duplicated some preexisting functionality found in other apps. My app actually does not just duplicate other apps. My app has other features included that no other app has in its genre.</p>
<p>Does anyone know why they would do this, and how to get around this issue? I have spent months on this project and now they are just going to ask me to throw it away.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Next I did ask why, they are not answering.</p>

							<p>Write them back and ask them to be more specific. What do they consider a duplicate? then try to ask them what could you do to fix this, etc?<br>Sometimes the reviewer is more &quot;human&quot; than usually and he might help you.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>This &quot;may&quot; be existing functionality of something that is coming soon rather than available now.</p>
<p>Follow up and speak to someone.</p>

										<p><p>The answer is simple - they will NOT let any more fart apps in the store, Steve Jobs announced this a couple of years back.</p>
<p>This will never get in the store, sorry to be the bearer of bad news - but that one is really well known.</p>

										<p><p>Are you kidding me. I spent loads of time and money on this. Damn that makes me want to go Android. I understand the need for filter out bad apps, but that is not mine. Thank you</p>

										<p><p>Actually that is not fully correct. There are apps that have been submitted and accepted in 2013. So it is doable, but how? I think I will need to add something additional to it.</p>

										<p><p>I wish you all the best luck in the world but I would be very surprised if you could add something so special beyond the features you have stated that already set your fart app away from all the other fart apps.</p>
<p>You may not like this but part of creating apps is done long before you write any code - you research your market place and determine what you can add to the market that will convince your &quot;thing&quot; is better than everybody elses - or at least good enough that enough people will make you enough money for the development time.  Once you have determined the likelihood that your app will make you a lot of money, you make sure there are no obvious barriers to entry; enthusiastic competition, app store rules, time to market, potential OS changes and so on.</p>
<p>Then you make sure your app.</p>
