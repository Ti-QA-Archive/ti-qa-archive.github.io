			<p>Hey guys..</p>
<p>I have done one project in android using default android provide by developer.android.<br>Later I came to know about Titanium. So I tried to complete the same project in Titanium using Alloy. I realized that default android good because of its UI design part is much more simpler than Alloy. The logic part can also be integrated in it easily rather than controllers in Alloy. Why is such complexity in Alloy ???</p>
<p>The main part here is default android apk is 3-4 MB also consumes less memory in Running app. The opposite is Alloy with nearly 10-11MB app &amp; 20-21 MB memory consumption in Running services..</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>We all know the speed of the native development is much more faster than the titanium alloy as far as the size of apk is considered the titanium uses the v8 engine to enhance the performance therefore the size of apk is much larger the same is not true for ios ,now here are advantages of alloy over eclipse</p>
<p>1)Getting the app for ios at the same time which is not available in the eclipse</p>
<p>2)In alloy you make the app much faster than the native development</p>
<p>3)Titanium also take care of the memory management which coders like me are usually ignorant</p>
<p>And you would find many more.Here i am not saying the alloy is god of development,but it depends on your priory level and i know every person has to do cost benefit analysis.I think this would clear more of your concepts why to choose this</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>And one added advantage as titanium used javascript it has supported many web developers to shift to mobile development if u would see at top 100 experts list you would find they are many webdevelopers who dont know java or objective c at all but still rolling in the field of mobile development</p>

										<p><p>Muhammad&#39;s assessment is pretty good. As stated, the size and memory consumption difference is due t the v8 engine being packages with your android app. This is what allows you to use Javascript in the fastest way possible in your app. </p>
<p>You probably aren&#39;t going to see the big advantages of Alloy by basing your assessment on a small, basic app. Alloy&#39;s strengths come in its organization, conventions, and structure that allow you to scale and maintain apps much more easily than you would without a framework. That&#39;s not to say these things can&#39;t be achieved in Android native development, but with Alloy, Titanium&#39;s best practices have been encapsulated fo you. </p>
<p>Despite being the lead developer of Alloy and a former evangelist here at Appcelerator, I would still never tell you what framework or platform is right for you without knowing your specific goals. If the information you&#39;ve given here is the extent of it, it sounds like you want to create a basic app and have already done so in native Android development. If you don&#39;t need to take it any further action, then Alloy doesn&#39;t really sound like a fit for you. That said, if your app is meant to be, or inadvertently grows to be, more complex, I think advantages of Alloy will quickly becomes self-evident.</p>
<p>One picky side note: I don&#39;t personally find Android notation to be less complex than Alloy or even plain old Titanium in many cases. Or perhaps even the most basic case of accessing an element from a view.</p>

</code></pre><h3 id="alloy">alloy</h3>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable">$.</span>someElementId
</code></pre><p>That&#39;s obviously an oversimplification, but you can see where Alloy and its use of Javascript often strips away seemingly unneeded levels of complexity for simple behaviors.</p>

							<p>Hi Aniruddha,</p>
<p>Refer this link : <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;149865&#x2F;why-alloy">Why Alloy is important?</a>.</p>
<p>I think your app is definitely appropriate for alloy, the same things appropriate for Titanium in general work with Alloy. One of the key things to think about is that using Alloy will not necessarily speed up development time. That is not the goal, the goal is to separate the concerns (Model View Controller), and provide cross-platform and multiple form factor support. If you are interested purely in speed of development stick with regular Titanium.</p>
<p>However, where it can speed up dev time is in your persistence strategy, sql integration of models is built in with Alloy. So, if this flashcard app your thinking of creating has the users creating flashcards on their phone, then using them later, I would definitely go with Alloy to take advantage of the model stuff.</p>
<p>Take note that the documentation is kind of sparse, I ported an existing clients project to Alloy and really had to find my own way on a lot of things, but It was not a simple app.</p>
<p>Essentially, if you want to : </p>
<ul>
<li>Release to multiple platforms and form factors and not have migraines, </li>
<li>Have a built-in easy to use persistence strategy, </li>
<li>Be able to maintain your code at a later date, or have other people look at it and be able to tell whats going on, then I would definitely use Alloy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>hey thanks</p>
<p>But I am not comparing Titanium &amp; Alloy. I am asking about Alloy &amp;<br>normal android using Eclipse for coding( <code>http:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;developer.android.com&amp;#x2F;sdk&amp;#x2F;index.html</code> )</p>
