							<div><p>I have no idea why the text didn&#39;t wrap. If you cant read it :: </p>
<p>I released an app but it only works on about half the devices it should. it seems to miss 4.0+ but I do not yet have enough info to know for sure. It says &quot;Package file was not signed correctly.&quot; and fails to install.</p>
<p>To make the app I simply click distribute, give it all the keystore info it needs, then verify it with jarsigner and upload it. I have tried changing many things including rolling back to jre 1.6 and have even made a new project that I move all the files to. I have read about people who have had this error before me, but they had it when they update apps. Mine never worked 100%. </p>
<p>I have uploaded a plain test app to see if that works. I will comment on this question with the results as soon as it is listed on the market.</p>

							<div><p>The questions are only if relevant - you are right code in the case does not appear helpful.  Try the answer Stephen gave then report back to him either way.  We can move form there is require.  BTW 1.6 is as high as you should have java so the roll back is important.</p>

<li>always be sure you are using 1.6 (which you have done.)</li>
<li>You will get an error like this if the test build with the same appid is installed and you try to install from the market  (need to delete the other install first, will not overwrite)</li>

							<p>I fixed it. Even though I made the keystore back when I still used 1.6, after the rollback I replaced the keystore and it worked. It seems very strange, I guess moral of the story, never use java 1.7 on your development computer ever.</p>
