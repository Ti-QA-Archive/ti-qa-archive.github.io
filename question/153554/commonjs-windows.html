							<div><p>Hi Rich</p>
<p>Just to clarify you are asking for somebody to provide you with a complete solution to this.</p>
<p>Well firstly I will say you can&#39;t, you cannot develop for IOS on windows.</p>
<p>Secondly we will be happy to help you resolve issues, but we offer our time freely so we do expect that you have had a good go at it yourself first.</p>
<p>If you are struggling where to start go <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;">HERE</a> and follow getting started.</p>

							<div><p>wow,  First this is the third time i have asked the same question.  As far as I can see you cannot open more than 3 windows using accelerator.   I do see alot of people talking about commonjs, but cannot find any examples or tutorials to back this up.   Please check my previous 2 questions for example code.   That is why I am asking a simple question about commonjs.    Second I am on a mac not windows, i do not know were you got that idea from.   I have done a lot of searing on the net for this solution but nobody has the answer.   I am starting to think its a bug.   Thanks for carefully reading my question, and thanks for absolutely no help.</p>

							<div><p>Rich, </p>
<p>can you provide some test about what you want to do? </p>
<p>BTW, for your mobile app, you can use the same rule as in websites: if you need to click more than three times to get to anything useful, 90% of the users won&#39;t get there.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro</p>

<p>Basically asking me to go search through thebQ&amp;A to find other questions you have posted to find code. Is not really going to happen. Seeing that I as so many here give up my free time to answer questions.</p>
<p>It appears that you actually need to sit down and understand commonJS. No it&#39;s not a bug .. yes you can have more than 3 windows open at a time, but don&#39;t.</p>
<p>Now resources <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thewarpedcoder.net&#x2F;2012&#x2F;10&#x2F;titanium-commonjs-introduction&#x2F;">HERE</a> is an intro to commonJS if you also look on this site you will find a custom menu tutorial explaining how to setup and use a custom menu.</p>
<p>My advice would be to go and watch the videos on the appcelerator site, go to the documentation and their is a whole load of resources available</p>
