			<h1>Performance hit when putting labels in ListView</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello</p>
<p>I&#39;m currently testing out the new ListView, which appears to work much smoother than the TableView in a lot of cases. However, as I was testing I noticed that putting labels into the ListView quickly gave a performance hit on iPhone when having ~200 rows in a single ListView. Having just an image scrolls super smooth, but that was to be expected. Adding 1 label to each row is still fine, but having 2 or 3 labels you really start to see a performance hit. I tested on an iPhone 4 using version 3.1.0 of the SDK.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve done some testing on an older Android device (running version 2.3.5) as well, which doesn&#39;t seem to take the same performance hit when adding multiple labels in each row. Here the performance appears to be quite stable, whether I use 1 or 3 labels in each row - overall a great performance upgrade from the TableView in similar use cases for me.</p>
<p>I tested with the sample code from the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.UI.ListView">docs</a>, see &quot;List View with Custom Item Template&quot;. I simply added 60 extra rows to each dataset.</p>
<p>Do any of you guys have the same experience? And is there anything to do to optimize the performance of this scenario? I added a solid white background to the labels, which appears to have helped a bit but not by much - anything else you can think of?</p>

							<p>Hello,</p>
<p>how much rows do you see in your screen? 10? 20? The best practice says &quot;lazy load stuff&quot;. Please, try to load whatever you will be able to see in the screen, and then cache another two screens (next and previous).</p>
<p>In general, you can&#39;t expect to draw 200 or whatever number of rows without getting a performance impact. And think about that same app running on a cheap android. The UX will be horrible. </p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro</p>

										<p><p>Hello Mauro</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>How would you go about lazy loading the contents of the ListView? I&#39;m not asking for a complete code sample, but rather a general approach to lazy loading contents in the list. Would you add and remove rows as the user scrolls near the top &#x2F; bottom of the list, and thereby only have X active rows rendered at any given time, or would you only render the contents of the rows inside the visible scope leaving the rest of the rows empty? Or maybe something completely different.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your time.</p>
