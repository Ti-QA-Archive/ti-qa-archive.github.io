			<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I have an application named &quot;TestApp&quot; made for android mobile using titanium.<br>While testing the application, I have faced a typical issue with this app. While moving to next window I have closed the current window using the code. Now here is my test case.<br>Step1 : From starting I have navigated to first few pages.<br>Step2: Using device back button, moving back and minimized my app.<br>Step3: While repeating step1 and step2 for 8-9 times, An alert box appear with a message &quot;TestApp is not responding, would you like to close it?&quot; which is not a custom message written by me.</p>
<p>So, my question is, Is it real issue. If so how to fix it.<br>Please suggest</p>

							<div><p>Hi Raju…,</p>
<p>It&#39;s not the Problem with your code… the case is true for everybody if we using multiple  Windows…</p>
<p>Try to maintain a single window for entire application … create and manipulate multiple views inside that single Window….</p>
<p>Hope this Provides a solution for your Problem…..</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

							<div><p>Thanks Mony, for your quick reply. My application is too big and complex. At this situation I can&#39;t change the whole architecture. So is there any other solution for this…</p>

							<p>Without looking at code, it is difficult to say exactly what the issue is. However I suspect that you have an inbuilt navigation system which has back buttons to go to and load previous windows. Which is fine.</p>
<p>But the android hard back button will not know what this is so you will need to handle this within your code by adding the android:back event listener and processing it through you navigation system,</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>T.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, Trevor. You are correct. I have used back button to navigate inside the app. But for first few pages, I have not used back button as they related to user  registration. What I have done is, I have open a window and while moving to other window, I have close the last window. So I add android:back event listener it will only show the flash screen and then if we click device back button it will close the application.</p>
<p>Please point out me If I am wrong anywhere.<br>This is the scenario with my application :(</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Raju</p>

										<p><p>Well you just have to handle the back function on these windows .. To Do Nothing ….</p>
<p>If that makes sense. Then the app wont go back to the splash screen or close. Unless that is what you wish it to do.</p>
