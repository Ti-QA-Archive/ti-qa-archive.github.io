			<h1>Localisation build issue - UTF8 Characters gone bad</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I have been having some problems compiling an app that has localisation.<br>(Yes, i write it with an S since i am from uk - but don&#39;t worry i use a z when i have to).</p>
<p>On build i get a nasty python error - the kind that doesn&#39;t really give you many pointers to the issue.<br>In my case it came right after the &quot;compiling android file: [my strings file]&quot; so i guessed it must be that.</p>
<p>My strings files are EN, ES, DE so nothing to crazy, just a few accents and umlauts.</p>
<p>Titanium studio seems really bad at scrolling with HTML or XML files, so when i edit these types of files i use Komodo Edit (my text editor of choice).<br>At this point i must confirm that my machine is set up correctly with UTF8 so i go to the command line and type &quot;locale&quot; which gives me </p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-setting">LANG=<span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"en_GB.UTF-8"</span></span></span>
<span class="hljs-setting">LC_COLLATE=<span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"en_GB.UTF-8"</span></span></span>
<span class="hljs-setting">LC_CTYPE=<span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"en_GB.UTF-8"</span></span></span>
<span class="hljs-setting">LC_MESSAGES=<span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"en_GB.UTF-8"</span></span></span>
<span class="hljs-setting">LC_MONETARY=<span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"en_GB.UTF-8"</span></span></span>
<span class="hljs-setting">LC_NUMERIC=<span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"en_GB.UTF-8"</span></span></span>
<span class="hljs-setting">LC_TIME=<span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"en_GB.UTF-8"</span></span></span>
<span class="hljs-setting">LC_ALL=<span class="hljs-value"></span></span>
</code></pre><p>All utf8 right? </p>
<p>So again at the command line i go to my i18n folder and i want to see what the encoding on the file is so …</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-type">file</span> -I strings.xml
</code></pre><p>and i get </p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-attribute">strings.xml</span>: <span class="hljs-string">application/xml; charset=unknown-8bit</span>
</code></pre><p>This is not right, but after i open the file in Titanium studio and save again then do this check a second time i get </p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-attribute">strings.xml</span>: <span class="hljs-string">application/xml; charset=utf-8</span>
</code></pre><p>However in Titanium studio i get a ? for every non ascii character.<br>Because i have saved the file i have lost the correct character and i will have to go through all my language files and update them.</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me how i should correctly do localisation as it seems to be fairly ropey in Appcelerator, with no default language and very unclear handling of UTF8.</p>
<p>Ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

							<div><p>Hi</p>
<p>Firstly, try not to blame Titanium before the problem has been determined as you will get no love here as people do love titanium and are protective of it.</p>
<p>Internationalisation can be complicated - mostly due to encoding of file and characters.</p>
<p>Devmail me a link to a zip of one of your XML files that has issues and a word doc or equivalent for some of the phrases as they should be.  I will take a look and come back to you.</p>
<p>Also please detail here; Ti SDK Ver, dev os, primary android target platform version</p>

							<div><p>Apologies for blaming Titanium, i do take your point.</p>
<p>In this case, i have now managed to find a solution.</p>
<p>When searching about the charset for a file, i found in the Appecelerator docs, a paragraph that says that no matter what the encoding on the file, if it is XML then the encoding defined at the top overrides any file setting.</p>
<p>This does not appear to be the case in studio.</p>
<p>However, due to previous tests, studio does save the file with the correct encoding, so clearly something was wrong elsewhere.</p>
<p>Going back to Komodo edit which shows the characters correctly despite the encoding on the file being &quot;unknown&quot;, i simply copied the content of the file and pasted into the same file in studio.<br>Then saving in studio and closing without saving in Komodo and now the problem is fixed.</p>
<p>What have i learned?<br>If you are using studio stick with studio, although maybe it is my install, but html and xml are really hard to edit in studio. Other files, no problem, but i get slow screen updates when i move or scroll.</p>
<p>Thank you for you help.</p>
<p>Jez</p>
