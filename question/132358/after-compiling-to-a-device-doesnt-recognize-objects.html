			<h1>After compiling to a device, doesn&#39;t recognize objects</h1>

			<p>I have this very weird problem that has been happening for a while.</p>
<p>I have been testing my application on the iOS simulator all week. It seems to work just fine and dandy with no issues. Over the past couple of days I have been trying to get it onto my iPhone to test in the wild. The app compiles just fine with no issues, and syncs to my phone. The problem is that when I open my phone, I get this http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cl.ly&#x2F;EJqS</p>
<p>I don&#39;t understand. Titanium.Facebook is an object, is it not? And no, this isn&#39;t specific to facebook. It throws this error at whatever the first object is that it encounters. So if my first line of code contained <code>var win = Ti.UI.createWindow()</code> it would say that it THAT isn&#39;t an object. </p>
<p>Once I sync it to my phone, I then test it on the simulator. It throws the error, just like on the device. The only way for me to get rid of it is to perform a full rebuild. Is this a common issue that I don&#39;t know about?</p>

							<p>Do a clean build is always needed when you add new files (js&#x2F;css&#x2F;image…) to project. It&#39;s also needed when you attempt to deploy to device. Sometimes I have to deploy 2 times or above to avoid &#39;cache&#39; issue :)</p>

										<p><p>Thanks. I&#39;ve probably re-built it about 50 times. As soon as I rebuild, it is fixed and works fine. As soon as I deploy to my iPhone, it breaks without fail. It is a back-and-forth thing. Is there another way to avoid cacheing issues besides a rebuild? Obviously that isn&#39;t working…</p>

										<p><p>How about to run the generated project using xcode? </p>
<p>You can find it here <code>yourproject&amp;#x2F;build&amp;#x2F;iphone&amp;#x2F;yourproject.xcodeproj</code>.</p>
<p>You may find some clues when run the generated project.</p>

							<p>I suspect is has something to do with with the way your files are named or application is constructed. This is one of those bugs that you are going to have to narrow down a little bit with a code sample so others can reporduce</p>
