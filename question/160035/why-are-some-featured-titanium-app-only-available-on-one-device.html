		<section>
			<p>I thought that using Titanium was supposed to provide a way to be able to easily develop multi device native application.<br>So I&#39;m wondering why are a lot of them available only for one device ?</p>

							<p>Just because it enables the ability to write an app on both platforms doesn&#39;t mean that a company or person has the time, resources or desire to do so. My app for instance, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunes.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;pack-pal&#x2F;id570501590?mt=8">Pack Pal</a>, took many months to develop for the iPhone alone. Trying to port it to Android would be a ton of work, even with the ability to reuse a lot of code. The additional assets needed would be tremendous, especially considering the choice to use skeuomorphic design. The point is, that Titanium does make it easier and promotes the ability to leverage the same code base for multiple platforms, however, even when only wanting to work with a single platform, Titanium can drastically speed up development compared to native. If you&#39;ve ever used native, you&#39;ll find that native offers a lot more power, and the access to all platform features, but can take substantially more code to accomplish the same tasks sometimes. Anyways, do some more investigating and figure out what works best for your needs :)</p>
