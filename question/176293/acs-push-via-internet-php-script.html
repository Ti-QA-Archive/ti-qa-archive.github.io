			<h1>ACS Push via internet, php script</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>I use ACS to push, push works fine on my application.</p>
<p>For hours I tried a php which allows push sent from our ftp server script without going through the platform of titanium.</p>
<p>I found a lot of info on this forum, github<br>but none work</p>
<p>can you helped me to find a php script that sent push for ios &#x2F; android to remote?</p>
<p>Here my research, but it does not help me much</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>thank you</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I have had a good look around and there are not too many good examples out there.  However I have found this and the example code is clean, all in one file and easy to read.  You will likely wish to restructure the example into a single function - but that depends on how you work.</p>

										<p><p>Seriously - your PHP version was wrong.  Why did you add this as an answer of its own?  This should have been a comment on a previous answer - as those giving you help, walked you towards the solution and could never have guessed your PHP was so out of date it could not run simple scripts like these.</p>
