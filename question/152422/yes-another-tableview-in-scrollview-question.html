			<h1>Yes... another TableView in ScrollView question</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Are there any suggestions for getting a tableView to be scrollable within a scrollView?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried setting canCanelEvents on the parent scrollView but then that causes issues with not being able to scroll at all if you happened to try to scroll up while hitting a text field or some other element that is on the scrollView.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried setting listeners on the tableView that disables the scrolling of the parent scrollview until you hit the end of the table.</p>
<p>Is there nothing we can do here?</p>
<p>Time and time again whenever someone posts a question about wanting to be able to do this the standard response is…. Why do you want to do this?  A TableView <em>IS</em> a scrollview, rework your code.</p>
<p>I have two issues with this response:</p>
<p>1.)  Even though it is considered &quot;bad&quot; by the Appcelerator team I contend that it should function the same way that it does on Android as it does for iOS.  Saying it is &quot;bad&quot; design does not mean that it shouldn&#39;t function the same way on both platforms.</p>
<p>2.)  How in the world am I supposed to handle separation of concerns for a Titanium app?  We&#39;ve done a pretty good job setting up an MVC structure to separate our controls from our models from our UI.  In order for this to work I <em>need</em> a tableView to be scrollable within a scrollView because of how we&#39;ve separated these into individual controls and then are adding the ones we need to a base scrollView.  It seems the only way I&#39;d be able to rework all of this code would be to make large monolithic program files to wrap everything in a large tableView.  That seems like a terrible idea!</p>
<p>Any help here would be appreciated!</p>

							<p>I think it&#39;s common sense not to put a TableView inside a ScrollView, the controller will get confused on what to scroll or not.</p>
<p>Related to your point <strong>1.</strong> -  keep in mind that the platforms are very different so it&#39;s very difficult to normalize the behaviour.</p>
<p>Point <strong>2.</strong> Just because you have build your app around a (bad) approach doesn&#39;t mean is the only way.</p>
<p>If you really need big scrolling stuff, yes, the reply is a huge table, but that can be populated with sections instead of rows, and each section to be generated by other part of your logic.</p>
<p>This way you &quot;emulate&quot; the scrollview with a table and the tables inside your scrollview with sections.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t get upset, but you are forcing yourself in finding solutions in an (again) bad design, and you will loose more time because of this.</p>
<p>The issues go way deeper than a simple rewriting of the app, the way the proxies (the native ones) are build can lead to weird behaviours for complicated layouts just because they are not made in such a way - to be imbricated. The fact that in some cases it works it&#39;s almost just a mere coincidence.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been there, and I lost way more time trying to figure out how to do it than rewriting the stuff - which I did in the end.</p>

										<p><p>I would argue it is being called a &quot;bad&quot; approach merely because no effort wants to be spent on making the control behave the same way on both platforms.  The team really needs to stop messing around with Tizen and BlackBerry and get their Android code up to snuff.</p>
<p>There is no other way I can think of for trying to create a dashboard like page with multiple tables that are of interest to the user.  I can separate them into little buttons that you press to get the separate tables, but that kills the usefulness of having glance-able information.  If that&#39;s what we end up having to do because there&#39;s no support then so be it but its very frustrating as a developer to get something working the way that makes the most sense on iOS to then find out that you need to rewrite the thing for Android.</p>

<p>Are there any suggestions for getting a tableView to be scrollable within a scrollView?</p>
<p>Yes DONT DO IT ….</p>
<p>A table view is a scrollview … thus which one do you want to scroll….</p>
<p>If you need controls at the end of a tableview.. ADD them as the last row …</p>
<p>I understand your points but, if you ask the same question in multiple different ways and you get the same answer, then maybe that is the answer…</p>

										<p><p>Well I didn&#39;t ask the original question… just saw the old questions.</p>
<p>I want the tableView to scroll when you touch the tableView and the scrollView to scroll when you are outside of the tableView.  It&#39;s really not that confusing.  I basically want exactly what happens on iOS to happen in Android.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s my problem.  Our app is basically a glorified reporting app.  We have a dashboard with a bunch of tables of information that are interesting to the user.  We have these multiple tables all on the same page but there is no way to fit all of the information on the same page.  You need to scroll down to see the other tables of information.  That is why I want it to be consistent!</p>

										<p><p>I understand your problem. But Android just doesn&#39;t work the same as IOS.</p>
<p>Can you not just put the tableviews onto a window instead of inside a scrollview, or use sections as Dan suggests.</p>
<p>This is just one of the issues faced in developing mobile applications.</p>
<p>I also note that you haven&#39;t asked the other questions. But when using a framework their will be limitations as to its usage. This is one of them.</p>
<p>It is perfectly understandable that this may not be the answer your after, but really it is the answer.</p>
