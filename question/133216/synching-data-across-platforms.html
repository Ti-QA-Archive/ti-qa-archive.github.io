			<p>My app stores photos on the file system and has a simple SQLLite db.  I&#39;m trying to design a solution to allow changes on one device to &quot;sync&quot; with changes on other devices.  Similar to iCloud but across platforms.  Before reinventing the wheel I was hoping someone could push me towards the right direction.<br>Thanks</p>

							<p>I&#39;m the author of the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pegli&#x2F;couchbase_ti">Couchbase Mobile for Titanium</a> module, and from your description it sounds like you could potentially use that module for your data storage and synchronization.  <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;couchdb.apache.org&#x2F;">CouchDB</a> is a schema-free database that allows you to store, index, and retrieve JSON documents and binary document attachments via an <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.apache.org&#x2F;couchdb&#x2F;Complete_HTTP_API_Reference">HTTP interface</a>.  My module wraps the Android and iOS builds of the database provided by <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.couchbase.com&#x2F;">CouchBase</a> and exposes the HTTP interface to your Titanium app.  I&#39;ve also written a <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pegli&#x2F;couchdb_client">client module</a> for accessing local and remote CouchDB instances via JavaScript calls.</p>
<p>The best argument for using CouchDB for mobile synchronization is its excellent <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.apache.org&#x2F;couchdb&#x2F;Replication">replication system</a>.  Replication synchronizes two copies of the same database, allowing for changes to be made in either copy.  CouchDB will report conflicting changes to a document, giving the app the chance to resolve changes either automatically or with user interaction.  See the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.apache.org&#x2F;couchdb&#x2F;Replication_and_conflicts">Replication and Conflicts</a> page on the CouchDB wiki for more information about how replication works.  For mobile projects, it is generally easier to use a central CouchDB server as a hub for replication as opposed to peer-to-peer replication between devices.  When a mobile device is able to replicate, it pulls changes from the central server, resolves any conflicts, then pushes its changes back to the central server.  Several companies offer cheap or free CouchDB hosting; <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloudant.com&#x2F;">Cloudant</a> and <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iriscouch.com&#x2F;">IrisCouch</a> are well-established and active in the CouchDB community.</p>
<p>The main advantages of using CouchDB in Titanium are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Database documents are stored and retrieved as JSON, which is very easy to work with in Titanium.</li>
<li>Replication as described above.</li>
<li>CouchDB databases can also host web applications, called <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;couchapp.org&#x2F;page&#x2F;index">CouchApps</a>, so your central server could offer web-based access to your users&#39; photos and data.</li>
<li>CouchDB is a mature database technology that has been shown to scale to many millions of documents.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages include:</p>
<ul>
<li>CouchDB uses pre-generated indexes to fetch documents by their properties.  Ad-hoc querying is expensive and not recommended.</li>
<li>The current packaging of CouchDB for mobile devices is quite large, adding about 60 Mb of code to the app.  This is because the library needs an Erlang interpreter to run the CouchDB code.  A group at Couchbase is working on an alternative implementation called <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;couchbaselabs&#x2F;TouchDB-iOS">TouchDB</a> which is much smaller, but it is not even in beta stage yet.</li>
<li>Database startup and resume times can be up to one to two seconds.  Along with library size, this is another problem that TouchDB is designed to address.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a somewhat brief overview, so I&#39;d recommend reading the posts in the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;groups.google.com&#x2F;forum&#x2F;#!forum&#x2F;mobile-couchbase">Mobile Couchbase Google Group</a> and reviewing the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.apache.org&#x2F;couchdb">CouchDB wiki</a>to get a better feel for CouchDB in general and the state of CouchDB on mobile devices.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ve just pushed a pre-alpha version of my <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pegli&#x2F;ti_touchdb">TiTouchDB module</a>, a wrapper for <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;couchbaselabs&#x2F;TouchDB-iOS">TouchDB-iOS</a>.  TouchDB is a mobile database that is small, fast, and speaks the CouchDB replication protocol.  Many of the disadvantages of Mobile CouchDB listed above are addressed by TouchDB, so it might be worth looking at as well.</p>

										<p><p>Yea, that&#39;s interesting since CouchDB was removed from my consideration b&#x2F;c of the size.  Is your touchdb just for ios?</p>

							<p>I have just done the same thing. My solution was to send the local data (on the device) to an online website (I used Rails and Mysql to make the backend). I then made functions in the app to download content from the online website. I used XML to get the data from the website.</p>
<p>To keep record of what was uploaded from the app to the website I made a simple record in each of the rows in the database of the content uploaded.</p>
<p>I used the online ID&#39;s in the database as the master to keep track of what that was synced down to the device.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, I guess I was looking to see if any cloud services provided something like what you did.  I&#39;m trying to research the new appcelerator acquisition in Cocoafish to see if it would help me.</p>

							<p>We are wondering to add custom module to Titanium, which provide simple way to using our platform to syncing data. Before we will develop custom module, You can try our solution www.mobeelizer.com.</p>
