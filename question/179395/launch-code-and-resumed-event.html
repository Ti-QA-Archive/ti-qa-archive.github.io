			<h1>Launch code and &#39;resumed&#39; event</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m having trouble understanding under what circumstances the &#39;resumed&#39; event fires when the app launches cold on iOS. Near as I can tell, it will fire every time, <em>except</em> the first time it&#39;s run, when the app is first installed.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve created a Default Alloy Project and just added one line to alloy.js:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Ti.App.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'resumed'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{ alert(<span class="hljs-string">'resumed!'</span>); });
</code></pre><p>When I first install the app and run it, I won&#39;t see the alert. From there anything I do short of reinstalling the app causes the alert to appear, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hitting Home and then opening the app again, </li>
<li>Double-clicking Home, flicking the app away to force it to close, and reopening it, and </li>
<li>In the case of another app, launching it with a dedicated URL scheme from the browser. </li>
</ol>
<p>In the simulator, hitting Run from Titanium Studio, targeting an emulator where it&#39;s already installed will sometimes - but not always - trigger the alert. Uninstalling it in the emulator and then running it again from Titanium Studio seems to always skip the alert.</p>
<p>I have some code that I want to run whenever the app opens, whether it&#39;s launched cold, resuming, or starting for the first time. I don&#39;t want it to run twice. I believe I can get around this by setting a variable in the startup code and checking for it in the &#39;resumed&#39; handler, but I&#39;d feel better if I understood what was going on under the hood. For example, if I know definitively that it&#39;s a first-launch-only thing, then I could just have a Property set to see if this is the first time the app is launched, and never worry about it again.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the idea but it doesn&#39;t seem to change anything. Either the resumed event doesn&#39;t fire on that first launch, or something weird is going on with the timing of when the event handler is registered. The Apple documentation implies that the event should fire on startup as well as when returning from pause. But maybe I&#39;m misreading.</p>
