			<h1>Android FC error when running on device</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>This issue has already been raised here http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;121466&#x2F;immediate-yahoomodule-fc-on-android-devices-but-works-on-emulator but seeing as no one has commented on it, I&#39;m re-raising it.</p>
<p>I have a titanium project built using Titanium Developer on 1.6.3. I recently upgraded to Titanium Studio and started to do a round of bug fixing. This all went fine until I ran the app on an Android device when I received an NPE on app start. You can see the error clearly in http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;pastes&#x2F;2131118 and http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;2109661. This is quite urgent as there is a critical bug that needs releasing for the live app and I cannot run my app on the device. I even tried running the old app, pre bug fixes, on the device using Titanium Studio and no joy.  Please can someone tell me how to fix this urgently!</p>

							<div><p>Hey Emily,</p>
<p>You didn&#39;t mention it, so I have to ask, did you run a clean on your project after your last round of changes and before pushing to your device?</p>
<p>Also, are you still building the app on 1.6.3 or have you tried building on any other versions of the mobile sdk?</p>
<p>Lastly, are you installing over the air or usb?</p>

							<p>Any progress on this? I&#39;m running into the same force close issue on my Android device due to the YahooModule. Same code works perfectly on the simulator.</p>
