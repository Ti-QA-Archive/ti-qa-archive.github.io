			<h1>app crashes when image are loaded from local files</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>im displaying about 137 images..<br>in first time, im loading them from server and display them in scrollView, i have pagination. for each 20 images, i make a request and display..all is fine and im displaying all the photos finally.</p>
<p>the problem is when i make them offline (button &quot;make offline&quot;)..i load them from local (photo&#39;s info from database and image in file) and with pagination (each 20 photos), it works only until the 80 image and it crashes after…in simulator it works fine, it crashes only on phone…</p>
<p>it seems like i have memory leak but only when images are local even if i load the same number of photos, it works good when they are remote and crashes when local !!</p>
<p>can anyone help ?</p>
<p>thank you.</p>

							<div><p>Be nice, you were given feedback, it explained the error you made by posting an essentially similar question, despite others trying to point you in the right direction in your previous.  Demanding others help you is no way to get help even if your problem is frustrating you.  You know better.</p>
