		<section>
			<p>Hi!</p>
<p>   I have a question about titanium sdk 3.2:</p>
<p>   I want to develop only Android apps and I&#39;ve got a Mac Os Lion 10.7.3 machine, I can&#39;t upgrade it because it is not supported. But, I want to use Titanium SDK 3.2, is it possible to do this? </p>
<p>Thanks </p>
<p>Ivan</p>

							<p>Titanium SDK 3.2.0.GA had a bug (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-16130">TIMOB-16130</a>) where Xcode was required even if you just wanted to do Android or Mobile Web development. We fixed it and it&#39;ll be available in the upcoming Titanium SDK 3.2.1.</p>
<p>As far as Mac OS X 10.7 Lion support, we no longer support Lion with 3.2.0 and newer. While Titanium 3.2 may work on older OS X versions, we do not actively test new releases on older versions.</p>

							<p>Hello Ivan,</p>
<p>the limits for the MacOS X version on the Ti Studio is usually related to the needed Xcode for running iOS code (i.e., Titanium SDK 3.2. supports iOS 7, therefore you need Xcode 5.x in order to compile for iOS 7, and Xcode 5.x is only supported on 10.8.5+). </p>
<p>But, if you are going to develop only for Android, sounds like you won&#39;t get any issue, as long as the Android Developer Tools are supported in your MacOSX version. </p>
<p>From the Android Developer Toolkit page, you will need at least: Mac OS X 10.5.8 or later (x86 only).  (so, likely you are ok). </p>
<p>You will need JDK 6 in order to run Ti Studio, but looks like your MacOSX version includes JDK6. </p>
<p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro</p>

										<p><p>Hi, Mauro!</p>
<p>  Thanks for your fast and good response.</p>
<p>  I installed sdk 3.2, lion 10.7.5 java 1.7 and I have tried to build a test app with CLI version 3.3.0:</p>
<p>  <code>titanium build -p android -T device</code></p>
<p>And I received this message:</p>
<hr>
<p>There are no Xcode installations found that are supported by Titanium SDK 3.2.0</p>
<hr>
<p>But i don&#39;t know how get to build without Xcode 5</p>
<p>Would you provide me some help or information in order to build with this configuration?</p>

										<p><p>Hello Ivan,</p>
<p>Do you have any Xcode installed? Try to install the newest one and install the command line tools and try again. </p>
<p>Best,</p>

										<p><p>Hi!</p>
<p> Yes, I have Xcode 4.6.3 installed. </p>
<p> Now I am uninstalling all titanium folders and sdk&#39;s and I will reinstall it after this.</p>
<p>May I uninstall xcode?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Cheers<br>Iván</p>

										<p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>not really sure, in theory you can do android theory without xcode (as you would do from windows), but Ti Studio will use some of the developer tools from xcode for the build (in MacOSX). </p>
<p>Get Titanium Studio and see if you are able to build. </p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro</p>
