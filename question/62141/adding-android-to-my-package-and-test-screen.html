			<p>I have an application running in the iPhone simulator, but I don&#39;t seem to have a tab for android.  How do I set that up?  Also, when I ran the Kitchen Sink app I couldn&#39;t get it to find the iphone or android sdk on the test and package screen.  I fixed this for iphone by applying a patch that I found which fixes titanium to work with itunes 10.  I was never able to get android to work though.  Is there a similar patch for android?</p>
<p>UPDATE:  My android sdk path was wrong.  So I got the sdk, etc. showing up for the kitchen sink now.  Just need that android tab on my other projects.</p>
<p>UPDATE:  I have an android tab in the Run On Device Section and it says my project is not configured to run for android.  How do I configure it?</p>
<p>UPDATE:  I found the new android.py and loaded that up.  I now have an android tab for the emulator test &amp; package section.  However, when I click launch, the only thing that happens is the stop button is disabled.  Any thoughts?</p>
<p>UPDATE:  I swapped out the new android.py for the old one and now I can build for the android and run it in the emulator.  But since then I can no longer launch the iphone simulator.  It builds it for the iphone but doesn&#39;t go any further.  What the hell is going on?  </p>
