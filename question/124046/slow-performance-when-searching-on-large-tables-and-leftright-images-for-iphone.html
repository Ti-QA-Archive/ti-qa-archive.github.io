			<h1>Slow performance when searching on large tables and left/right images for iPhone</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi</p>
<p>I am having a problem when searching, using searchBar, on large table rows (rows greater than 100) and each row having a left and right image. For example, when you start typing letter &quot;h&quot; in a searchBar field, there is about a 5 second freeze on the phone.  As soon as icons are removed from the tableRows, searching is much faster.  The filtered results of typing &quot;h&quot; appear almost immediately.  I am using mobile version 1.6.2.  I have already tried setting className on the row, but this did not help. Has anyone else experienced this problem on the iPhone?  Is there a suggested work around?</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;m inclined to agree with Aaron that having a left and right image on each row in a large table is always going to cause some performance issues. I&#39;m currently working on an app that has 200+ rows of data defined in complex rows consisting 8 different views, without performance issues.</p>
<p>Maybe if you explain the purpose of the buttons with respect to the functionality of your list we can help come up with a design that is more conducive to smooth performance.</p>

							<div><p>Hey Toni, does it mean, the search works smoothly on a table with more than 200 rows that have icons on the actual device (not the emulator)?<br>In my app the icons are not clickable, just layout. The left one is more individual, there is a pool of 10 different icons to select from, and one of them is the left icon. The right one is always the same (for all rows).</p>

							<div><p>Thanks Tony :)  That worked. After I thought more about this, I realized what you meant.  I removed the left and right image, and then added these images as views on the row.  Performance is much better now.  I notified the Applcelerator team, and they listed it as a Jira http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-4978</p>

							<p>the problem usually is the caused by the complexity of the rows you are rendering. My first guess is that the images you are rendering are probably being scaled by the CPU which is causing the delay.</p>
<p>Try removing the images from the row and see if that addresses the problem. If it does, create thumbnails of the images on the server and use them when rendering the table rows.</p>
<p>Also always remember to use a classname on the rows, it increases the performance.</p>

							<p>Thanks for the fast answer. I tried that but now the icons don&#39;t appear anymore. I guess that the table row does not accept the thumbnail I created, or the conversion does not work as expected.</p>
<p>Here is the code:<br>row.rightImage = ((Titanium.UI.createImageView({image:&#39;..&#x2F;path&#x2F;to&#x2F;image&#39;})).toImage()).imageAsThumbnail(64);</p>
<p>before it was:<br>row.rightImage = &#39;..&#x2F;path&#x2F;to&#x2F;image&#39;;</p>
<p>Do you know what is missing or could you send an example (not really sure what &quot;on the server&quot; means in this context)?</p>

										<p><p>it is a good practice to post your responses as comments and not answers; it makes it easier to follow the thread.</p>
<p>what i was suggesting was converting the images outside of the application not in the application because you will still be slowing down the app as it attempts to convert the image as the row is rendered</p>
