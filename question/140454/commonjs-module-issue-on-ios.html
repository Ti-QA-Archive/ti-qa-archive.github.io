			<h1>CommonJS Module Issue on IOS</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I sorta have a strange issue with commonjs and duplicating a project on IOS and I wonder if anyone has experienced anything similar before.</p>
<p>I have a project that is working fine using the commonjs&#x2F;module style. I create a second brand new project and copy the entire resources directory from the first (working project) to the second (new empty project). When I run the second project only the main window loads. I have a login view that is supposed to load from a (separate js file) and add it to the main window. This works perfectly on in the first project. I have verified the folder structure of the second project and it is identical to the first project.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">- There are also no errors when I run <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">second</span> project.
- I have also step through <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">second</span> project <span class="hljs-operator">in</span> debug <span class="hljs-operator">and</span> <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> modules that are being required <span class="hljs-constant">return</span> <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> correct objects
- I have also done <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> Clean <span class="hljs-operator">and</span> deleted <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> Build Folder many times
</code></pre><p>I am not sure what to check next?</p>
<p>I am currently using the following:<br>Titanium Version:<br> 2.0.1.201204132053</p>
<p>SDK Version<br>2.0.1. GA2</p>
<p>If anyone has seen anything similar or any suggestion would be greatly appreciated. I know its hard without any source code. :)</p>
<p>Thank You</p>

							<div><p>Hi Aaron,</p>
<p>Yea I know , but I am positive it has nothing to do with the code. I works perfect in one project and and not in the second one.</p>
<p>I went back to the first project and changed the GUID by 1 number in the xml and manifest at the end. Saved and reran the first project and now the first project is not working. I then put the guid  back to the the way it was and the first project is still broken…</p>
<p>Is there something that I am missing?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>Here is the solution—- </p>
<p>I upgraded to the latest version of studio 2.1.1.2 and GA SDK 2.1.1 and it solved my issue with the projects not loading.</p>

							<p>Hi Sean, in that case you can always delete the build folder fron the project directory and and in the next build titanium will create it again, in most cases it solves the problem.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Ashish,</p>
<p>I did deleted the build folder everytime on the the 2.0.1 version i was using. As soon as I upgraded to 2.1.1 and try to run the project, I got a warning about the xml version from the system folder was different and do I want to use it. When I did this the app worked perfect. I never received that warning in the 2.0.1 version no matter how many times I deleted the build folder.</p>
<p>So there is something definantly different between the 2 versions.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
