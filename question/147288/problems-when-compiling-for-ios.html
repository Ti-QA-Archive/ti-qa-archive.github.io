			<h1>Problems when compiling for IOS...</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hi all.<br>I am having a hard time compiling my work to test on iPhone. Somehow it is only every second or third time that it compiles the newest code, and even when it does so it seems that it &quot;remembers&quot; old error messages. For instance it kept returning the error that Ti.Media.vibrate was &#39;undefined&#39;. Now I have changed the code to be Titanium.Media.vibrate and it still returns the same error of Ti.Media.vibrate object being &#39;undefined&#39;. And now there is no call for Ti.Media.vibrate in the code anymore …. After replacing the Ti.Media.vibrate with Titanium.Media.vibrate I tried to change the color on the label to verify the update. When testing on device the color is updated but the error message remains…. I have tried to delete the build folder several times and perform project cleanup from the project - clean command. But without luck - the error message remains… Anyone having the same problems? I am using Titanium SDK the latest version (3.?? just updated today) and xcode 4.5. I have been struggling with these bugs and missing code update for a week now, and I am getting a bit annoyed because it is taking up an immensely amount of time. So any help or other suggestions would be of greatest help. Best, Louise</p>

							<div><p>Yeah - here is the line where I call the vibrate method <code>Titanium.Media.vibrate(0, 1000);</code> If I comment out this line it compiles fine. Still the code is only updated every second or third time, but I have 800 lines of code, so I guess it is to much to provide here. I have debugged all the rest of the code and it works fine- The problem occurs with this little piece of code… which I find a little strange, or? Thanks for help!! ;-)</p>

							<p>Your <code>Ti.Media.vibrate</code> function expects an array as it is explained in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Media-method-vibrate">the documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Your code should look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">Titanium</span><span class="hljs-class">.Media</span><span class="hljs-class">.vibrate</span>(<span class="hljs-attr_selector">[ 0, 1000 ]</span>);
</code></pre>

										<p><p>Hi. I have changed the code to yours above <code>Titanium.Media.vibrate([ 0, 1000 ]);</code> but I still get the error message &#39;undefined&#39; is not an object (Ti.Media.vibrate)…. And also the code doesn&#39;t update every time when testing on device. I know because I change the color of the text every time to be sure. Is it normal?</p>

							<p>Well, now I have tried all combinations (even the plain <code>Ti.Media.vibrate();</code> - which is in the KitchenSink example) and none of it works. Still getting the error that the object Ti.Media.vibrate is &#39;undefined&#39;. The thing is that my initial code was working fine previously but I had it commented out because I was concentrating on other parts of the code. Just before uncommenting it out I updated the Titanium SDK and now I cannot seem to get that code snippet to work when I bring it back in. My best guess is that there is a bug in the newest update of the Titanium SDK. I can find no other reason as to why a code that used to work fine suddenly doesn&#39;t work precisely after an update. So if anyone from Titanium is reading this, I think there might be a bug in the newest update which I downloaded January the 23rd 2013. But if anyone has other suggestions I am all ears ;-)<br>Best - and thanks!<br>Louise</p>
