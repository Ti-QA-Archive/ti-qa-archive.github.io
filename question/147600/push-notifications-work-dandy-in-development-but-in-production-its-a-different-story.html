			<h1>Push Notifications work dandy in Development. But in Production it&#39;s  a different story.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey there, I&#39;m pretty new at Appcelerator and Titanium Studio and might I add i really enjoy making apps with it. But because I&#39;m new, I seem to be amiss about getting push notifications to work in production mode.</p>
<p>I&#39;m using this app.js almost verbatim: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;2909981">github link</a></p>
<p>and in development it works like a charm. But in production mode, no dice. I get the device token, the logs show a 200 Status (POST &#x2F;v1&#x2F;users&#x2F;login.json) but no log shows for POST &#x2F;v1&#x2F;push_notification&#x2F;subscribe.json.</p>
<p>I&#39;m probably doing something funky with the code causing it to now subscribe but I can&#39;t figure it out or find anything regarding my issue.</p>
<p>Please and an advanced Thank You,</p>

							<p>Hi<br>Production would be working when you would make the app to sell for market.</p>
<p>1)For Android you have to make a signed apk<br>2)For Iphone you have to make an ipa with distribution license </p>
<p>Have you done that</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>Yes Muhammad I have, It&#39;s even published in the android market. I am doing an adb install on it now onto an emulator and running some other tests via emulator. But anything further would be great. Thanks for the quick response.</p>
