			<h1>httpclient memory leak</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>All,</p>
<p>I have code similar to this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> downloader = Ti.Network.createHTTPClient({timeout:<span class="hljs-number">10000</span>});
downloader.onload = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span>{
    <span class="hljs-comment">//Save my file</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">//Handle errors first, this is only a sample code</span>
    saveFile(<span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.folderName, <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.fileName, <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.responseData);
}
</code></pre><p>Basically this code exists in a .js file by itself and is included on all other .js files that need the client response.</p>
<p>The code below is basically what i have in the individual .js files to use the downloader&#x2F;xhr</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">//custom properties you can access using this.<span class="hljs-label">xxx</span></span>
<span class="hljs-comment">//inside you onload event manager</span>
downloader.fileName = <span class="hljs-string">'foo.jpg'</span>;
downloader.folderName = <span class="hljs-string">'images'</span>;
<span class="hljs-comment">//open &amp; send </span>
downloader.<span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'GET'</span>, fileURL);
downloader.send();
</code></pre><p>The issue that is happening is whenever i issue the &quot;downloader.send()&quot; function I get a memory leak in the Instruments tool, and its always related the the NSURL or other other http&#x2F;url related items (away from the system now so I can&#39;t be much more specific).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve determined it is directly related to the httpclient because in my code if I read the response data, that I would normally get from the httpclient, from a file I don&#39;t have any memory leaks and all is happy, but as soon as I introduce the httpclient I start leaking and the leaks build as the data is refreshed.</p>
<p>I have tried with timeouts of different lengths, tried using .onload and .onreadystatechange, tried synchronous connections, tried setTimeout in the onload and onreadystatechange functions and a few other things that aren&#39;t coming to mind right now.</p>
<p>Note: I always get the data(json) so that&#39;s not the issue, I am just trying to get rid of the memory leak.</p>
<p>Can anyone shed any light on this or provide any other thoughts or ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I&#39;m getting the same issue, which seems pretty big to me, I hope Appcelerator team will get some sort of solution, a .close() method would be great…</p>
<p>I would add that I think the memory leak happens on eventHandler because in some cases I call the method &#39;createHTTPClient&#39; from the root of the js file, and no memory leak happens… Could you test that scenario ? </p>
<p>Anyway I may have some kind of workaround to make the memory leak smaller :<br>xhr2.onload = function(){<br>   try{<br>      if(this.status==200) {<br>         xhr2.abort();<br>         Ti.API.info(&quot;test&quot;);<br>         …</p>
<p>This way i have less memory leak (By memory leak I mean that in the onload method, the &quot;test&quot; only display once instead of many times, but after several tests it begin again to loop). Could you try this scenario as well and tell me how it goes ?</p>
<p>Good luck,<br>Clem</p>
