			<p>Question…<br>I have a client that wants an app created for their company field reps. They want to obtain the $99 Apple license so they own the app.</p>
<p>How do I go about setting up Titanium to build THEIR app under THEIR Apple license? The dev and distribution profiles would be different. Is it possible to work on both my apps and theirs under a single Titanium mobile environment?</p>
<p>If so, what is the best way to do this?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

							<p>I haven&#39;t actually done this, though my workflow is pretty close… </p>
<p>You should be able to add their certificates&#x2F;profiles to your keychain and have both yours and theirs on your machine. Then, build their app once using Titanium with your cert. That will create an Xcode project file (look in the build&#x2F;iphone directory for the pch file). Double-click the project file to open it in Xcode. From there, you can associate their cert &amp; profile and build the project with Xcode. (In the Activity window, expand Library on the left to find the project, double-click it. You&#39;ll find fields in the Build property list with which you can specify the developer cert and distribution profile to use.)</p>
<p>This way, you build your own apps in Titanium and theirs via Xcode. Titanium is just calling xcode in the background so you&#39;re not really doing that much different this way. In fact, xcode has been more reliable for me than Titanium at doing the actual device build so this is how I&#39;ve been doing it – using just my own cert&#x2F;profile not a client&#39;s.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Tim but I&#39;m concerned also with the Bundle ID issue that will occur using my cert and profiles to build their app. Then switching the app over to their certs and profiles.</p>
<p>You said you haven&#39;t actually tried to do this yourself and I&#39;m likely to hose up my Ti setup messing with multiple certs and bundle ID&#39;s. Every time I mess with the certificates and profiles, I end up working for days getting Ti working again. </p>
<p>Would really like a tried and true step-by-step method to do this. I can&#39;t be the only iPhone&#x2F;Ti developer wanting to develop my own apps and my clients apps on the same machine?</p>
