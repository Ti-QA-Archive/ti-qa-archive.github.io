							<div><p>Yes it wil. But as no other native solution for this problem other than adding custom label so for your password fields you can workaround by changing the passwordMask property at run time. Mean to say you have a focus event listener on that field and when the event fires you can change its passwordMask property to true which was initially false when you added your custom label in it.</p>
