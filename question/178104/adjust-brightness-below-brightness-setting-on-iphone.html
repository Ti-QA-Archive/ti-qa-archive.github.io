			<h1>Adjust brightness below brightness setting on iPhone</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, I was wondering if there is a way to bring iPhone device brightness even below the brightness settings. I tried the free brightness module available in Marketplace but I need the brightness to go even lower the available settings on iPhone. If this is not possible, it is possible to apply some dark color&#x2F;tint layer to screen, preferably not just for the current app but for entire device settings. When the application is killed the brightness can go back to original setting. The lowest brightness settings is sometimes too bright in night and causes glare to eyes. Some book reading application do that but I was wondering it can be done for all Windows as long as application is running in foreground or background. </p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>You would not be able to do this for all applications on a standard iOS device as apple does not allow apps to interact with the device in that way. To do this within a single app however the best approach would probably be to apply opacity to all views shown or to add a view on top that dims the display with a dark view and a lower opacity set.</p>
