			<h1>Run on iOS device doesn&#39;t work</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I went through all the steps with the certificate, the profile, etc. Now I&#39;m trying to run my iPad app on the iPad itself (works great in the simulator). After clicking Finish in this window:</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;skitch.com&#x2F;sweatcoder&#x2F;884f3&#x2F;device</p>
<p>…nothing happens. I tried several times, nothing. What SHOULD happen? Should I see the app launch in my iPad? Should I see a new icon on my iPad? I got nothing. Help. The iPad is connected to the Mac.</p>

							<div><p>Good grief, I just found my app suddenly isn&#39;t working in the simulator. It was working yesterday and I changed nothing. I DID upgrade Titanium version yesterday, when prompted. Could this have broken my app? I&#39;m now getting &quot;Invalid method (createButton) passed to UIModule.&quot;</p>

							<div><p>OK, Titanium is buggy, I&#39;ve got my app running in Simulator again. And now I see this error when targeting iOS device: &quot;The identity (blah blah) doesn&#39;t match any valid certificate&#x2F;private key pair&quot;. I&#39;m sure I did everything correctly…but how can I fix this?</p>

							<p>I had issues when i first did mine. I found eventually that you have to use the distibution certificate you created. And the development provisioning profile. I had assumed you would either use both distribution or both development but eventually found it was a combination of the two that worked</p>
