Where i need to develop the code to use the Credit card payment from the App. i am done with paypal integration as it is available in Tianium as MPL.But I could not find any possibility of using the Credit card payment through the App as well as there is no module is available in Titanium so far as. is there anybody had any experience such kind of Commerce app kindly share the Terms with me.I have very short Timelines for the Project. I have seen an app PHOTOEXPRESS where we can use the Credit card payment processing. As I think this might be done by using WebView. But I dont understand How to make the Connection with URL related to Credit card API.If anybody have any idea about this alternate way to go Kindly share.Any kind of help would be Appreciated.</p>

							<p>Hi Suresh,<br>On one of my apps, I needed to implement a shopping cart and then provide options for payment at checkout (payPal or other payment processes).<br>Since I was heavily into web services in my app I simply posted all the checkout information over https as a web service call to my server, where I cached the data into a temporary db table and generated a unique identifier (Actually I used a session variable) which I passed back in my web service response to the app.  When I wanted to checkout I called the web page, passing the session variable as a query string parameter.  On the server side I used that as the key to retrieve the data I had posted earlier using the web service, checking that the time was not more that 10 minutes ago, so that I could make sure the data was still current.</p>
<p>Storing the data in the db is a requirement anyway as you will need, once you make the payment call to either payPal or the payment provider, to consider what happens if your server fails at this point.  Most all payment providers have an independent back-office post mechanism that will post the response directly to your server and you can then marry up the response with the transaction in the db table.  I pass the session id as a custom parameter to both payPal and other payment providers, so in the post response I can use that as the key to identify the correct record in the database.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you so much for this solution ! As i heard Apple may reject such kind of Application. i am not sure your method is under this Restriction or not.Are You sure you are not Using your own Payment Gateway because Apple doesn&#39;t allow the payment Gateway Creation in the Application.<br>Second thing –&gt; you mean to say The DB table will exist on web Server &amp; will return an unique identifier which is valid upto 10 mins.If is it being invalidated during login to card then what happens? is it not part of the programming you done like isolated from our code.<br>kindly provide some lines of Code if you can ? you mechanism was rocking !!!</p>
