			<h1>Release network memory for remote imageview</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m creating an app that uses a few ImageView inside a ScrollView to produce a grid-like interface. When scrolling to bottom of the ScrollView, it will autoload the next set of images (sort of jquery waypoint). The images for ImageView is located at remote server.</p>
<p>Now the problem arise when I try to load more and more images, as I notice, ImageView with remote image seems like doesn&#39;t release the network memory it consume, and my app end up with java.lang.OutOfMemoryException error. Is there any way to release the network memory used by ImageView? I tried to set imageview object to null but to no avail.</p>
<p>Application type: mobile<br>Titanium SDK: 1.7.5<br>Platform &amp; version: Android 2.x<br>Device: Android emulator and HTC Legend<br>Host Operating System: Windows 7<br>Titanium Studio: 1.0.4</p>

							<p>I can&#39;t speak to Android, but I know with iOS an imageView stores its path to the image and waits for the imageView to become &quot;in view&quot; on the screen, therefor only loading the image when the imageView is &quot;in view&quot;.</p>
<p>So I ask, why break up the network calls? why not load in all the imageViews and when the user scrolls let the device handle the loading, if Android works that way.</p>
<p>To do your cool &quot;loading more&quot; feature, I would set a height on my scrollView and detect when it reached the bottom via the event listener &#39;scroll&#39;. Then adjust the contentHeight of the scrollView (scrollView.contentHeight) to allow more images to be seen. You could even scroll for the user via the scrollTo() method.</p>
<p>I know its not a direct answer, but hope it helps.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m sorry but that&#39;s not the answer I&#39;m looking for</p>
<p>1 - the &#39;loading more&#39; feature is not the main problem - I had to hack my way to make it working on Android since no contentHeight &amp; contentOffset value on ScrollView</p>
<p>2 - Android load all ImageView after it&#39;s being called, no matter its &quot;in view&quot; or not. Also this is not the problem</p>
<p>3 - Why break up the network calls? To do pagination.</p>
<p>The main concern here is, as I load more and more ImageView into the ScrollView, the memory consumption is increasing until the app crash with java.lang.OutOfMemoryException when trying to use the internet connection. So I suspect that ImageView remote image loading that make the HTTP request to remote server that consume the memory and not releasing it after image has been loaded. The main question is, how can I release this memory consumption used by ImageView?</p>

										<p><p>Humm. How about: max buffer size? ti.android.httpclient.maxbuffersize<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;tiapp.xml+and+timodule.xml+Reference</p>
<p>This presentation helped some people with memory leaks: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.slideshare.net&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;rick-blalock-your-apps-are-leaking-controlling-memory-leaks</p>
<p>Finally, what is the size of the images you are downloading? Are you truly downloading thumbnails? Or full size images that are larger and scaling down to look like a thumbnail? </p>
<p>Maybe the simple answer is to download smaller files, like physically smaller not size smaller. 3 bytes for RGB and 1 for alpha for a 100px x 100px image is 30-40k. Times the number of thumbnails you have and you can see how the memory can drain quickly. </p>
<p>Also I&#39;ve noticed that even after the onLoad listener is fired for HTTP requests it still takes some time to finish downloading items. Maybe the lag of the download compiled with the next HTTP request is a trouble spot.</p>
<p>Trying to blindly help you out. - Corey</p>

<li><p>ti.android.httpclient.maxbuffersize = 65536</p>
</li>
<li><p>I&#39;ve read the slides, however could find what really cause this problem. One thing I dont understand is &#39;local variables referenced inside a global event will cause a memory leak every time&#39;. If so, what&#39;s the correct way?</p>
</li>
<li><p>My thumbnail is around 3-5 Kb. (90px width JPG).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Lag of download &amp; next HTTP request - thanks for pointing that out. I&#39;ll take a look at that and maybe implement other way to queue downloading the thumbnail.</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s look good, I&#39;m gonna try to implement it. Thanks Corey. Here&#39;s a blog post with similar idea on HTTPClient (for others to refer) - <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.idapted.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;09&#x2F;01&#x2F;development-tips-on-titanium&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.idapted.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;09&#x2F;01&#x2F;development-tips-on-titanium&#x2F;</a></p>
