			<p>Hi Fellow Ti.Users</p>
<p>I am currently looking at the Facebook API and have just used the kitchen sink code to interface with my created app. Everything works on the phone as expected and when I post all is well I get a success message and it would appear that everything has sent.</p>
<p>However when I go to Facebook nothing shows up on my wall. Now this could be that I have set the Application up incorrectly on Facebook but I cannot find any useful tutorials on how I should set one up. Has anyone done one and could help me out!. I have got it working before on a previous app but I have since been removed as a developer and am not allowed access to that setup so I cant replicate it.</p>
<p>Using Ti SDK 1.7 and IOS 4.3 and just running the publish stream kitchen sink code,</p>
<p>Any help here would be spot on</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Steve</p>
