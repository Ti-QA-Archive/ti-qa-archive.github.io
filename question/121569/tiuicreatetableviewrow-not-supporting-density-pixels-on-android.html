			<h1>Ti.UI.createTableViewRow not supporting density pixels on Android</h1>

		<section>
			<p>On Android, you can specify density pixels to allow support for multiple screens. However, when trying to support density pixels for a table row, it blows up. Has anyone figured out how to support: </p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> row</span> = Ti.UI.createTableViewRow({
  height:<span class="hljs-string">"80dp"</span>,
  width:<span class="hljs-string">"320dp"</span>
});

							<p>OK glad I ran across this after I figured out that actually in SDK 1.8.2 for Android there is a possible bug(have not checked if reported or not) regarding heights specified with pecentages&#39;20%&#39;. Running V8. minSdk=4, targetSdk=10, maxSdk=15. As far as manifest settings tried all combos of anydensity so that did not change the behavior I noticed and taking time to point out here. </p>
<p>The row consistently ignored heights specified with %&#39;s.<br>The createTableViewRow behavior acts like it ignores this set value and defaults to behavior similar to &#39;auto&#39;.  not sure if this is an issue between Table View layout handler or the row layout handler?  &#39;auto&#39; works - OK. </p>
<p>Another behavior I noticed is the createTableViewRow ignores child objects with specified heights also especially if Row height is set to &#39;auto&#39;. So had two labels with heights specified one with 20% and one 10%.  the layout being used was default. The Row would would over lay the text on top of the lower label text and use a small height value.  You would think if row is &#39;auto&#39; then the height of row maybe ought consider or take into account child heights. So in my case thought height should be atleast 30%. I am aware and understand the &quot;scope&quot; here and layouts…  seems like be nice property to have available to set - useChildObjectHeights = True or False. IDK ? ust a thought :)  Anyway …<br>Finally worked around issue by specifying createTableViewRow in dp value.  I then specified top = 5% for upper label and bottom = 5% for the lower label this gave me desired readability and ensured for the most part a gap remained between two labels text on each row.   </p>
<p>I have had pretty good results with using heights and widths as well as all positional properties (left, right, top, bottom) specified with percentages %.<br>my user interfaces stayed useable and pretty consistent (and with in recommended guide lines for &quot;tappable&quot;&#x2F;touchable UI objects sizes.  (Without getting to the style settings etc. as recommended for Android apps.)<br>Now a detail I did notice too with using percentages is Views seem to add padding between buttons. be nice to control that finite detail.  layout managers should not add padding or gaps with out means to control that?  Anyway for those that want to see what I am talking about try to create button bar for Android. say use a view set height to something like 15%, layout to horizontal, set it to bottom = 0%. Add say six(6) buttons to it.  Now for displays with width of 320 for example set the buttons width property to 17%. then see how it looks. now add left or right positions and see how that affects how the buttons are laid out and good luck with the fonts too if have buttons with text instead of images.  play around with increasing decreasing width size you will see what I mean…  there are other ways to do this but had this in some earlier code. :|    </p>
<p>Now The Android guide lines have been updated recently and recommend that you DO use dp (and sp for fonts).   </p>
<p>Final detail to share is Appcelerator teams recommend &quot;you can use the Platform API to check the device before setting your attributes (see the API docs here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;latest&#x2F;Titanium.Platform.DisplayCaps-object.html&quot; – Well something you need to know.  </p>
<p>There is an issue in using this.  I have notice testing apps on various devices from 320DP to 1280DP. in other words I have tested apps on all screen sizes from phones to tablets.  Now a lot of users use their mobile devices while it is laying flat on a desk or table. I now include this test while testing.  And on many devices I have tested on the Titanium.Platform.DisplayCaps for width actually returns the wrong value because the height&#x2F;width changes for portrait or landscape orientation - the wrong value can be returned while device is laying on flat surface.  I had a app where some of the windows(modal)(no tabgroups) were set and designed for portrait orientation and to be used only in portrait.<br>I changed my app to use recommended Platform.DisplayCaps.Width&#x2F;Height. when upgraded to sdk 1.8.0.1<br>I ended up after testing changing all the platform calls that dealt with layouts to just use 100% for example if I wanted the object to take up entire width of screen for example. This removed the problem of getting wrong width as when device is laying flat hard to tell is it being viewed landscaped or portrait.<br>Not all devices did this in every case but most did that I tested on.  May not show up first or second time but it eventually will – so hope you all code for this when necessary.  I kinda have to thank my Galaxy S for being the worst offender. :) It has a flaky accelerometer anyway so that problem of that device really help flush this out.  Tablets also helped flush this out too. </p>
<p>Hope some of this information helps and saves some of you the hours I have spent testing and coding around some unforeseen issues…</p>
<p>Cheers and happy coding. —- Adrian.</p>

							<p>The properties for height and width can only be expressed as a number ie: <code>20</code>, or strings like <code>&amp;#39;20px&amp;#39;</code> or <code>&amp;#39;20%&amp;#39;</code>. Any number is assumed to be in pixels. The device screen is measured in its size, not how many pixels make up its display, so 80 pixels on one device, will scale to the proper 80 pixels on another device. If you have a case where this is not the intended action, you can use the Platform API to check the device before setting you attributes (see the API docs here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;latest&#x2F;Titanium.Platform.DisplayCaps-object.html)</p>

										<p><p>&quot;20dp&quot; does, in fact, work when you have &quot;anydensity=true&quot; in the Android Manifest. And, is necessary to have if you want to have high vs medium sets of graphics for different devices. It resizes my buttons and views and chooses the correct image assets(ie. background images) from the Resources&#x2F;android&#x2F;images&#x2F;high folder vs Resources&#x2F;android&#x2F;images&#x2F;medium folder. </p>
<p>I may need to have my manifest file set up differently, but the documentation for an actual app with Android high&#x2F;medium&#x2F;low densities AND different screen sizes is very fragmented. </p>
<p>I&#39;m just wondering why specifying that you want to use density pixels works for most of the heights&#x2F;widths but not for the same property on a table row.</p>
