			<p>I have just installed Titanium Studio and have rebooted the machine. When I try to run Titanium, it loads the icon in the Dock but the application hangs for about 30 seconds, and then the MBA fan starts ramping up and continues to do so. It&#39;s been about 5 minutes now and the only additional thing that has happened is the loading screen has finally appeared. Other than the fan still going full tilt, not much else is going on. Obviously this is not normal. Has anyone experienced this also?</p>

							<p>Hi Stephen.</p>
<p>Thanks for your response. I&#39;m running a MacBookAir i7 (13&quot;) with 4Gb DDR3 RAM.</p>
<p>After leaving my MBA on all night, I woke up to find it had loaded. All seemed fine for a day, and now I am frustratingly back to square one again. Ive rebooted about 10 minutes ago, loaded Titanium up as the first app, and even though it is in my dock, I havent even got to the loading screen yet. Very frustrating.</p>
<p>This thread has 90 views but no answers yet.</p>

							<p>I have the exact same problem.  This has occurred for me since the first time I tried downloading Ti Studio when it was first released last year.  Happens every single time I download&#x2F;install it (have tried 4 times).  Happened on previous MBP and current one, on both Snow Leopard and Lion.  My current MBP 17&quot; has 16GB ram.  Imported an existing folder as an app, et it sit (not running an app) for 30 minutes, and cpu usage is 200% or higher with fan running full blast.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Just found another post that suggests turning off Titanium Studio -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Team -&gt; Git -&gt; [X] Automatically attach our git support to projects …</p>
<p>(see http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;130542&#x2F;titanium-studio-freezes-on-mac-osx)</p>
<p>That seems to have worked!</p>
