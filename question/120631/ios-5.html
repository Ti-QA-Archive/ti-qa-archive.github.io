							<p>We will eventually support iOS 5 certainly. We just got it late yesterday like everyone else so we need some time. By the time iOS 5 is properly releases (not a beta) we will support it.</p>

<p>Another note, I noticed that coverFlowView scrolling functionality performs differently on OS 5.0. The whole thing seems to move left&#x2F;right before flipping covers, at first you think its a scrollView.</p>

										<p><p>After building for iOS 4.2, then trying 4.3 the app will launch in simulator… typical Ti inconsistency. Unfortunately the app still crashes, with the splash screen error.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I successfully deployed my app to my iPhone (iOS 4.3.3) using the new iOS 5.0 SDK and it works perfectly (apart from the errors I know about of corse).</p>

<ul>
<li>To completely remove Xcode : sudo &#x2F;Developer&#x2F;Library&#x2F;uninstall-devtools –mode=all</li>
<li>Install Xcode 4.0.2 ios 4.3</li>

<p>When I tried to install Xcode 4.0.2 over 4.2 (ios 5), it wasn&#39;t ok. I had to completely remove Xcode.</p>

							<p>I got iOS5 installed on my iPhone 4. 1 of my Appcelerator apps works perfectly. The other one crashes right after the loading screen. Any way you all know I can debug&#x2F;test to see what&#39;s going on? Hopefully someone has some advice. Thanks in advance!</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s one of the errors I was getting.<br>I have the &quot;Xcode 4.2 and iOS 5 SDK beta 5 (Snow Leopard)&quot; installed.<br>I got it working by targeting 5.0. </p>
<p>Before all that, I&#39;d tried completely uninstalling XCode, trying the &#39;current&#39; version (which just wouldn&#39;t even run at all) and also the beta 4. Same error.</p>
<p>If you need to uninstall your Xocde, you need to do that via the command line (see the pdf in the Xcode Developer install folder) and also restart your machine. </p>
<p>I spent all day trying countless times ti fix this yesterday. Only today did I get it working again using the setup above.</p>
<p>This is the last time I ever touch an iOS or XCdoe beta. Grr</p>

							<p>Ouch. I actually just submitted my app so I can wait this out for a bit and hope the smoke clears. I really have no idea why I installed the beta, even at 5 its pretty rough around the edges. Guess I can&#39;t resist the smell of new software, even if its not fully baked ;-)</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve started developing an app in iOS 5 &amp; Titanium 1.7.2, Its all working fine in simulator and on the device iPad2. The only problems are layout issues ie with iPad.Popover, any size parameters seem to get ignored.  I am looking forward to the stable Titanium release that supports iOS 5.</p>

										<p><p>Tinkered about a bit and found that if I dont use setPassthroughViews method then the popover dimensions are honoured (as of 1.8.x CI build today) and it also looks like the best build to date that covers some of the random 1.7.x crashes I was experiencing. Result :-)</p>

							<p>Just updated my device to IOS5 and the coverflow view looks pretty bad on the app that was built in 4.3.  I haven&#39;t done a rebuild yet, but thought I would mention it.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>I wouldn&#39;t say the coverflow looks bad, it just isn&#39;t right. </p>
<p>It still shocks me that Appcelerator took the half arsed approach and didn&#39;t create a cross platform coverflow, as it was obviously going to be a popular component.</p>

							<p>Is there anything special you had to do to get your app to compile in xcode, I&#39;m getting two errors in xcode, one is the stylesheet.plist no such file and debugger.plist no such file, and </p>
<p>have you had to massage the xcode project file ?  I&#39;m using titanium builder 1.0.4.201108101535</p>

							<p>Is anyone else seeing an odd behavior on iOS 5.1 where 1) the application appears to be locked (cannot interact with any on screen elements) when bringing the app back from being backgrounded and 2) explicitly quitting the application does not cause the application to stop running? The first issue is more troublesome – it takes 3-5 seconds before the screen starts to respond.</p>
