			<p>I&#39;ve set Ti.Geolocation.accuracy = Titanium.Geolocation.ACCURACY_BEST; </p>
<p>When I use my Titanium app to put a marker on the map at my current location, it misses my location by let&#39;s say 50 meters easily, while when I start google maps it will show my current location spot on.</p>
<p>What am I missing?</p>

							<p>What are you using ? getCurrentPosition or the &quot;location&quot; event ?<br>getCurrentPosition doesn&#39;t start the gps hardware, only gets the latest value the device has cached.</p>

										<p><p>I call a function with getCurrentPosition() in it. Then I have an eventListerner for &quot;location&quot; which launches the getCurrentPosition() method again. Do you have a code sample on how to launch&#x2F;use the GPS hardware?</p>

										<p><p>I do like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// app starts</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// but this is the first thing I do, no window opening, nothing.</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// this way until the app opens, we have better  chances to have a gps signal.</span>


Titanium.Geolocation.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'location'</span>, do_the_stuff); 

getCurrentPosition()  <span class="hljs-comment">//get the cached position and do_the_stuff until the first location event triggers.</span>
</code></pre><p>You might want to set <strong>accuracy</strong> to <strong>best</strong> and <strong>distanceFilter</strong> to <strong>0</strong> to force the device trigger as fast as possible. After the first location event you can change the distanceFilter to a bigger value to save some battery.</p>

										<p><p>Unfortunately this doesn&#39;t affect the accuracy in my case. Google maps app is accurate, TI app with the above code isn&#39;t.</p>

							<p>You cannot influence the accuracy directly. The ACCURACY_BEST constant will Tell the GPS Sensor to work more precise (needs more Power) but in fact it will Take some time until the GPS Sensor established the Connection with satelites. More of them means better results, at the very start youll get the estimated coords through the cell Towers (triangle). </p>
<p>You could out a loading indicator and Tell the User that the los is bring aquired and internally you listen to the lication Event and check the acciracy of the location Events.</p>

										<p><p>thanks Alexander, but why doés is work in google maps or any other app using geolocation. Those apps show my location right on the spot, while my titanium apps don&#39;t.</p>

										<p><p>Did you performed your tests outside on the street ? GPS will not work within a building.<br>Probably the other apps had cached the GPS value last time you were outside.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, I tested on the street. Today I went around the city to see if GPS coordinates were accurate, but they aren&#39;t at all. I guess offset is about 50 to 100 meters easily</p>
