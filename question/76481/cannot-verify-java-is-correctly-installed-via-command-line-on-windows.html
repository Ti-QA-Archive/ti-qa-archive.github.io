			<p>Hi everyone I am new to Appcelerator and thought I would report an issue I was having following the official PDF setup guide for windows on the appcelerator guide.</p>
<p>There is a major typo in the setup PDF which made me think I had not installed Java correctly when indeed I had.</p>
<p>On page 8 of the PDF it asks you to check your java version with &quot;javac -version&quot;, this is incorrect and should read &quot;java -version&quot;.</p>
<p>Just thought I would post this here just in case others were pulling their hair out wondering why javac -version command was not working for them.</p>

							<p>Well I did a bit more research and discovered that this is not a typo, if the command &quot;javac -version&quot; is not working for you then try this workaround which I found worked for me.</p>
<p>go to start then right click on mycomputer and choose properties from the context menu, open the advanced tab and press environment variables button. Then press the new button and create a new variable called &quot;PATH&quot; and for the value insert the path to your jdk bin folder, for example mine was &quot;C:\Java\jdkl.6.0_21\bin&quot;.</p>
<p>Now open up your command console and try &quot;javac -version&quot; command again to ensure everything is fine. This works fine on XP SP3, if you are on windows 7 you will most probably have to run as administrator.</p>
