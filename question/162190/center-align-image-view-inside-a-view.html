			<h1>Center align Image view inside a View</h1>

		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m trying to create a header banner in a screen with some color and to add an image to that banner horizontally centre aligned. </p>
<p>I&#39;m getting the image left aligned, Is there any option for aligning it to the center of the banner without using left, right properties so that it will be in the center in all devices with different resolutions.</p>
<p>In xml file, </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">&lt;View <span class="hljs-property">id</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"headerBanner"</span> <span class="hljs-type">class</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"header"</span>&gt;
            &lt;ImageView <span class="hljs-property">id</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"headerImage"</span> image=<span class="hljs-string">"/android/images/bannerImage.png"</span> /&gt;
        &lt;/View&gt;
</code></pre><p>and in tss file,</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">"<span class="hljs-class">.header</span>": <span class="hljs-rules">{
    <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">layout</span>:<span class="hljs-value"> <span class="hljs-string">'horizontal'</span>,

    height: Ti.UI.SIZE,
    width: Titanium.Platform.displayCaps.platformWidth,
    top : <span class="hljs-number">0</span>
</span></span></span>},

"<span class="hljs-id">#headerImage</span>": <span class="hljs-rules">{

}</span>,
</code></pre><p>which property of headerImage can make it center aligned. Thanks!</p>

										<p><p>No left or right property, along w&#x2F; Kris&#39;s suggestion or removing layout: &quot;horizontal&quot; will center the ImageView.  </p>
<p>Absolutely ridiculous solution, but that&#39;s Titanium for you…</p>

										<p><p>@Mihal you clearly have a chip on your shoulder to be trolling a 10 month old question and providing a flippant comment.</p>
<p>Given the &quot;solution&quot; here is the same way that the vast majority of desktop and mobile development systems control positioning - what exactly do you think is ridiculous about the solution?</p>
<p>Maybe you come from a web world - if so the confusion you are suffering might be understandable - but this is native mobile&#x2F;desktop rules now.</p>
<p>Given the default position for any child view without layout is centred, adding and anchor point like; left, right, top or bottom would lock the child view in that direction against that value.  The solution here is not a workaround it is simply to explain that point to the author of the question and the anchors that were affecting the default behaviour would be released - giving the default behaviour which in the case was the desired outcome.</p>
<p>So in your world how would you tell Apple, Google and the other platform providers to change their non-anchored positioning - which of course means you need a solution for anchored and layout types?</p>
<p>Well done Stephen and well done Kris for your question, answer and comments as appropriate.</p>

										<p><p>My issue is that my expectations are too high.  You&#39;re right - coming from a web world, having limited CSS powers with TSS is a bit frustrating.  I appreciate Titanium trying to cater to the visual designers, I simply wish that 10 months down the line there was a more explicit solution.</p>

										<p><p>I am still very confused as to why you think there is a problem.  There never was an issue in placing something in the centre - it was a very short term misunderstanding on the part of question author.  I am guessing from that moment on he never looked back and has done great things.</p>
<p>Titanium is not trying to cater for visual designers, it caters for developers of apps.  It adheres to the mobile OS requirements for each platform.  Those platforms (including actual desktop applications) have a way of doing things and this is how you do them.  </p>
<p>Titanium does not limit anything you need to be able to achieve - everything a xcode or java (andriod) app can achieve in placing objects in any way can be done here.</p>
<p>There are many ways to lay things out, to place one thing in relation to another, there are two different main layout schemes (think absolute and relative) that afford any UI needs.</p>
<p>I have built many apps for many businesses of all sorts.  EVERYTHING is possible and nothing is limited but your ability to see that.  I started in desktop development and it is the same there.</p>
<p>It does sound like you only understand how web works and think this is how everything else should.  That is partly true as some things are related but it is the same as thinking that bitmap images and vectors must do everything the same way when they are very different.  Some things are the same - but others are not because they are different.</p>
<p>Do you think DTP is bad because it does not work the exact same way as the web does?  Even though much of the logic and layout principles are the same.</p>
<p>It sounds like you do not understand how things can work as you have a strong belief that you cannot do whatever it is you are trying to achieve as because you cannot figure it out - things must be broken.</p>
<p>If you only knew about horses then cars must be scary, if you only knew about cars horses must be weird.  However that does not mean either are wrong, right or otherwise.</p>
<p>What problem do you think needs resolving that you are unable to achieve?</p>
