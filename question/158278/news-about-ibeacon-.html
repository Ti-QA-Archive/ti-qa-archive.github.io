							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Having just received my Estimote Beacons I have been looking for a module - found this one;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jbeuckm&#x2F;TiBeacons">jbeuckm  - TiBeacons</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I have not tried it for suitability yet (this weekend project) but it obviously looks hopeful.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Malcom, our BLE module mentioned in my post here on this thread that is available in the marketplace was updated this week to include a working demo with Estimote Beacons. It now includes two beacon demos actually and they have have been tested.  Here is the link https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;3834?373512247 - you can start a free trial and use the example app to test it with your Estimote Beacons.</p>

										<p><p>Yes I saw the link - but for those who only want the iBeacon support $350 is very steep, I am sure your product is very worthwhile and does lots of things but way too much for just a single feature requirement.</p>
<p>I would suggest you create an iBeacon only version and sell that for $10 - would be nice to know someone is treating this need as a commercial proposition but I do not see the value of $350 even if I do get lots of others things I will never use.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Malcolm,</p>
<p>We&#39;ve just secured some UK arts funding for a project using Estimote iBeacons (just one part). I just wondered if you had any joy with your weekend project yet, if so, I&#39;d be interested to hear any of your findings.</p>

							<p>Hey all, I wrapped <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.radiusnetworks.com&#x2F;ibeacon&#x2F;android&#x2F;">Radius Networks&#39; excellent iBeacons library</a> into a Titanium module.. you can get the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jamesfalkner&#x2F;liferay-android-beacons">source code</a> or the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jamesfalkner&#x2F;liferay-android-beacons&#x2F;raw&#x2F;master&#x2F;dist&#x2F;com.liferay.beacons-android-0.1.zip">binary module for use in your projects</a>, if you can test it and let me know what you think that&#39;s be greeeeeeeat. The API was modeled after <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jbeuckm&#x2F;TiBeacons">this iOS library</a>, so if you&#39;re using that, you can probably do a drop-in addition (but there are a few additional APIs for you if you want to use them).</p>

<h2 id="an-android-beacon-module">An Android beacon module</h2>
<p>Thanks James, this is excellent, not many modules consider Android and modelling after one of the most popular iOS libraries (from Joe Beuckman) is a good idea.</p>
<p>I will check it out today.  Thanks</p>

										<p><p>All agree here! Yes thanks James, much appreciated. We&#39;ve been using Joe Beuckmans module successfully in a few PoCs but it was only a matter of time before an Android one was needed and yours is the right price ;-)</p>

							<p>There is a ticket in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org">Jira</a> to add iBeacon support. Unfortunately, the ticket is marked internal only (not sure why). So I won&#39;t bother sharing the link as you won&#39;t be able to view it. There&#39;s no information in the ticket to indicate if it&#39;s being worked on or when it might be released.</p>

							<p>Hope so too. We ordered a bunch of estimotes and hope to use Titanium to prototype a proof of concept app using the technology.</p>

										<p><p>Wouter, our estimotes arrive this week as well. Our iOS BT LE module already includes support for beacons: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;3834?373512247 We will test our module with the estimotes to confirm they all work the same as the regular iBeacon implementation.</p>

							<p>Our Bluetooth iOS LE module was updated over the weekend to include support for beacons &#x2F; iBeacons. You can check it out with a free trial before buying and it includes a working demo.</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;3834?373512247 </p>
<p>We also have plans for an update for our Android BT LE module to include support for beacons. Stay tuned or email us for more info titanium @ logicallabs.com</p>

										<p><p><strong>Update:</strong> Since this posting we have released a few updates to both of our BLE modules and they both now include full support for beacons. We have also just released a brand new Beacons Module for both IOS &amp; Android combined in one product.</p>
<p>At this time the following modules from Logical Labs provide full support for beacons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>BLE iOS Module (includes support for beacons) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;3834</p>
</li>
<li><p>BLE Android Module (includes support for beacons) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;6611</p>
</li>
<li><p>Beacons Module (iOS &amp; Android) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;7619 </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these modules are well documented, tested, include working demos for immediate ramp up, and are fully supported by Logical Labs.</p>

										<p><p>I can only assume these are perfect modules that do everything for you as at the prices they fall into the premium end of the modules available on any subject.</p>
<p>I will provide your links so people can click them - least that can be done for the potential purchaser;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;3834">BLE iOS Module</a> - includes support for beacons - $350</li>

<li><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;7619">Beacons Module - iOS &amp; Android</a> - $500</li>
</ul>
<p>I looked at this updated comment to this answer and thought &quot;cool, I can review these on the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tidev.io">tidev.io</a> site&quot;, but at those prices certainly not - whilst there are free trials for each of them - they are so far out of the main stream that there would be so few people interest in this community - clearly enterprise only offerings.</p>

										<p><p>This looks great John it&#39;s a pity it&#39;s so expensive, I&#39;d have jumped at the Beacons Module for iOS and Android but $500 is just way way out of the budget for the proof of concept project I&#39;m working on.</p>
<p>You should keep in mind that a lot of iBeacon projects at the moment are proof of concept types where there is little or no budget allocated (like mine).</p>
<p>John, you should consider an alternative pricing structure.  Keep the current &#39;Enterprise&#39; level and add an alternative for indie devs&#x2F;projects.</p>
<p>Perhaps have a &#39;small independent&#39; option for companies with less than 3 employees or a turnover below $150,000.  I&#39;d have happily paid somewhere between $50 - $80 for the module even though I&#39;m not developing anything to take to an App Store at the moment.</p>
