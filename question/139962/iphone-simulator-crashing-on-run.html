			<h1>iPhone Simulator Crashing on run</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have been working on this app for the last few months (It&#39;s live in the stores but I have been adding on to it and updating it) and the last few day I have been unable to build in for the iPhone simulator. Even if I clean then build; it will launch the simulator and the crash immediately before showing anything (not even a splash screen). </p>
<p>I have been building to TI SDK 1.8.2 because from the 2.0 release on I have had massive problems which would require a re-write to deal with. I tried building to ever other SDK I have ever installed in Ti Studio but they all have the exact same problem. I have tried a different (hello-world-ish app) app and it works in the simulator.</p>
<p>I also tried building one of my native apps in xcode for the simulator and it works fine as well.</p>
<p>I am very confused to as how it would just randomly stop working.</p>
<p>OS X Lion 1.7.4</p>
<p>iPhone simulator 5.1</p>
<p>Ti Studio 2.1.0.201206251749</p>
<p>Ti SDK&#39;s 1.8.1, 1.8.2, 2.0.1, 2.0.2, 2.1.0</p>
