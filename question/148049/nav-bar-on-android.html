			<h1>Nav bar on Android</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve developed an app for iPhone and are now making sure it works on Android as well, but i&#39;ve run in to a small issue. The nav bar holds two buttons and a background image. On Android, those two buttons doesn&#39;t render. I understand that it doesn&#39;t exists any navigation buttons in the nav bar on Android, but i still want them. Sure i could just create a view and present it, but i thought &quot;what would be the best solution that works on both Android and iPhone with the same code and renders the same&quot;. And that is my question :)</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The answer to this one is not easy as there is no &quot;one solution fits all&quot;.</p>
<p>Android and iOS interfaces are different and users expect to use apps they are comfortable with.  So if you introduce interface elements that are predominately iOS to Android and vice-versa then users will not be as comfortable with the app on their chosen platform.</p>
<p>One of the main differences between the two platforms is the way in which main navigation is handled.</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS uses a navigation bar and tabs</li>
<li>Android<ul>
<li>Older apps; tabs</li>
<li>Newer apps; Action Bars</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For Android the Action Bar is by far the most common (in my opinion) interface element now being used to provide navigation for apps.  It was introduced in Android 3.0 and has become a main stay ever since.</p>
<p>As it was introduced in 3.0 you cannot use it to solve navigation problems for earlier editions.  If you are targeting 4.x then no problem, but if you still aim to provide support for 2.2.x and 2.3.x then the Action Bar will not work.</p>
<p>You can make your own action bar with views, labels and imageViews if your needs are simple.  It can end up looking the same but will not have the flexibility of the native control (unless you dedicate lots of time to your own solution).  But if all you are after is the basic look then this approach will work for you.</p>
<p>Android does not slide windows in, each one is brought in or just appears over the top, so a new ActionBar (native or fake) is simple added to each window.</p>
<p>Check out the documentation for <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Android.ActionBar">ActionBar</a>.</p>

										<p><p>So, is there a way or &#39;best practice&#39; what allows you to use the Acitonbar in v3+ but the old menu in older versions, but keep one source?</p>

										<p><p>Will have to let you know on that one currently working through the same question myself. Current plan is a faux ActionBar, but really depends on the number and level of features needed. Also Titanium does not currently support the whole ActionBar feature set. So the faux version may be sufficent. By faux I mean one I create with images, labels and views that provides a near identical visual and similar feature set.</p>
