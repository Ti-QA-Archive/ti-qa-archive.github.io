			<h1>Android app stops receiving input</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have recently created a very simple flash-card type app. There is a single tab with 1 large and 4 small imageViews. Clicking on image views plays sounds, and changes the image shown in the respective image views. </p>
<p>The problem is that after a seemingly random number of clicks (usually between 5 and 10), clicking on the imageViews no longer gets any response. The app is not frozen, as I added a second tab which contains a button with an identical click event listener to one of the imageViews and it still works and updates the imageVeiws on the main tab. But returning to the main tab, the imageViews still will not accept input.</p>
<p>Is this a common problem with a common solution? I did not think it necessary to provide my code, but am happy to do so.</p>
<p>Cheers<br> AP</p>

<p>No, it&#39;s not a common problem.</p>
<p>In order for someone to help you with this, you need to create a usecase. A usecase is a self-contained piece of code that demonstrates your issue in the <strong>least possible</strong> number of lines that also runs <strong>without modification</strong> when pasted into an empty <code>app.js</code>. Some advantages of providing a usecase are:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is much kinder to those wishing to help you, because they won&#39;t have to spend considerable time replicating your issue on their systems</li>
<li>you will likely receive more accurate answers, as people will be running exactly the same code as you</li>
<li>you will gain a much greater knowledge of how Titanium works</li>
<li>the process of creating a usecase can often simplify the problem and consequently reveal the answer</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read more about this subject in the official documentation, under the section <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Contributing+to+Titanium#ContributingtoTitanium-CreatingGoodUsecases">Creating Good Use-cases</a>.</p>
<p>Note that, if the code is long, you may want to create a <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;">Git Gist</a> or <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;">pastebin</a> rather than paste the code here directly.</p>
