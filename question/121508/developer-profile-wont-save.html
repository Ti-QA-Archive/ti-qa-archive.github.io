			<h1>Developer Profile won&#39;t save</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>When you go to your developer profile and try to enter in additional info like which technologies you use, when you go to save a javascript alert box pops up saying State is required. If you have State filled in it still shows this, so it makes it impossible to save your profile.</p>
<p>Also relating to the profile, it would be nice if there was a text area for putting information that shows up at the bottom of each of your posts in the q&amp;a forum. That would allow developers to specify their operating system, ti sdk version, if they are using iphone or android, etc…</p>

							<p>Justin: Well I lived in Indian Head MD and I admit I didn&#39;t like it. We just pushed a fix, tested it through impersonation and it looks as though you&#39;re now good to go.</p>

										<p><p>Sadly it still doesn&#39;t work except for a different reason now. When you click Save, it doesn&#39;t give the State required error, however it doesn&#39;t do anything at all. I refresh the page and the values I had entered are gone, so it&#39;s not saving at all. </p>
<p>I don&#39;t really need to save my profile, I just wanted you guys to know about the issue, and honestly this has turned into more time than I wanted to put into it. I&#39;ll let your QA team do what it&#39;s good at and will update my profile when everything is fixed.</p>

							<p>Hey Justin,</p>
<p>The issue looks like its been fixed, if you still have issues, it might be an odd chrome bug. Try a different browser and let me know if you were able to update.</p>

										<p><p>It&#39;s definitely not fixed. I tried in Chrome on Mac and on Windows 7. Also tried in Firefox on Windows 7. &quot;State is required&quot; pops up every time, even after clearing cache.</p>

										<p><p>Clearing cache didn&#39;t help, it&#39;s actually not a 404, it&#39;s a 500 internal error would be my guess. If you go to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;my.appcelerator.com&#x2F;profile2 then you&#39;ll see a special page just for 404&#39;s. A total guess would be that it now is assuming users have certain info already entered and it errors if they don&#39;t. I can give you my login so you can reproduce if that helps.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, I can go to the profile page again now, however I still get &quot;State is required&quot; in both Chrome and FF with cache cleared. I guess it doesn&#39;t like people from Maryland!</p>
