			<h1>Xcode Organizer Archive missing for AppStore Build</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>after building my app for the AppStore, I was looking into the Xcode Organizer and did not found the new archive there.</p>
<p>Well, I could successfully upload the ipa file using the Application Loader. But I am curious why the archive is missing? This was about 100 MB that was uploaded to Apple, while the uploaded ipa file is just 10 MB in size.</p>
<p>Has something changed about how Titanium Studio is building for AppStore release?</p>
<p>Best<br>Danny</p>
