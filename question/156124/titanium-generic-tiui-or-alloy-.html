			<h1>Titanium Generic (Ti.UI....) or Alloy ?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Guys,</p>
<p>Please let me know the which one will be more effective and time saving way of mobile app development, by using titanium generic way (Ti.UI.create…….) or by using alloy framework (XML Ui design)?</p>
<p>Since we have completed almost more than 50% of development using generic (ti.ui.create….) but our organization wants to move on alloy framework. Since we have ample development time so no need to worry for time..We are looking for this from future development perspective and will be also applying same to all upcoming projects. ** We also need to implement on all type of devices (iPhone, Andriod +tablet, ipod) etc… Quick response will be appreciated…..ThnX!</p>
<p>-Rgds, Sarvesh</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Quick response will be appreciated&quot;</strong> &lt; you said you had plenty of time ;-)</p>
<p>The smartest move in any development is to separate the code from the mark-up and styling, use pre-defined business rules, create re-usable functions and never write the same code twice (very hard - make this an aim not a rule).</p>
<p>Alloy &quot;helps&quot; you to do this as it provides the framework - that does not mean everything is done for you, a good coder can do great things but a bad coder is still a bad coder.  I am not suggesting you are - but it is easy to take short-cuts, if you go the route of Alloy - stick with it, no shortcuts.</p>
<p>On a big project Alloy can really improve things, especially if you think small and modular about the design.  Global styles really save time and make it very easy to tweak something when the bosses have a &quot;great idea&quot;.</p>
<p>Also it means you can split up the work into teams or individuals by creating modules that perform the main functions, then they are pieced together into a single app.</p>
<p>When you come to make changes - you make them in the single location that should then filter round the rest of the app (provided you planned).  Re-using elements on other projects becomes very easy - making the next new thing much faster and more reliable as you have one set of code to solve one problem but used more than once.</p>
<p>But the overriding thing is plan - if yo fail to plan nothing will save you, plan features, plan testing, plan betas, plan for things working and plan for things failing.  Never assume something will always be there - plan for it not being there.  If you plan you can make great things from anything - Alloy just helps - it  does not solve.</p>
<p>If you genuinely do have lots of time available but are 50% of the way into a project then the answer is not very simple;</p>
<ul>
<li>You can stop and refractor into Alloy, but would you be better and faster getting your app to market and then working out if the app has the correct feature set - adding new things as you go along, this way you focus on getting a good product and making it great sooner rather than later</li>
<li>If you believe the development is stalling and needs a better framework to hang it on - then use your gut-feeling, the structure of a framework might make the process easier to manage the project in the long run.</li>
</ul>
<p>But trust me when I say &quot;the only thing important is having a working app for the users&quot;, they do not care how it was made - only that it works.  If you truly believe that Alloy will solve your problems use it now.  However I would caution you to consider this; you could finish the app using non-alloy, test the market with the app - if it proves popular, then use that opportunity to create the Alloy version - you will have the time to make the routines you created better and more reliable as you will have a working prototype in the market.  You can add any tweaks as you go - you will know which features to next focus on.</p>
<p>If you were 25% into the project I would say strongly consider it.  The decision is yours and that of the business plan to market.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Malcolm,</p>
<p>Sorry I forgot to update on your answer but believe me this is the input on which our team decided to move ahead for alloy implementation. Since we have many running projects using titanium (mobile apps) and this answer helped us to select the project(s) for alloy impl.</p>
<p>You are like our mentor on alloy…!! Appreciable Answer :-)</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Regards,<br>-Sarvesh</p>
