			<p>Hi Guys</p>
<p>I&#39;m attempting to install my app into the default emulator, but I get the following error message:</p>
<p>[INFO] Installing application on emulator<br>[ERROR] Failed installing remunerator.com.au:     pkg: &#x2F;data&#x2F;local&#x2F;tmp&#x2F;app.apk</p>
<p>INSTALL_FAILED_CONTAINER_ERROR</p>
<p>I&#39;m using the latest Titanium (3.0.1), deploying against Google APIs Android 4.1.2 (armeabi-v7) Screen HVGA, using the default settings (which I think gives it a 512mb memory)</p>
<p>The generated app.apk is 41.2 MB</p>
<p>I&#39;m using &lt;manifest android:installLocation=&quot;preferExternal&quot;&gt; to try to use the sd card.</p>
<p>According to the settings, I have 42 mb free (I presume that&#39;s the onboard memory?). From the settings I think I have 62 mb on the sd card.</p>
<p>Is there a way of setting my SD card to have more memory? Would that solve it anyway? I can&#39;t see a way to change it in the file which Titanium creates and supplies to the emulator.</p>

							<p>Run in a terminal cd &lt;sdk directory&gt;&#x2F;tools and execute .&#x2F;android avd</p>
<p>Select the AVD your using and click on Edit, then set the SD Card size to 512 MiB, click on Edit AVD and you are done.</p>

<p>Settings show that the emulator has 68.55 mb free, and &quot;USB Storage&quot; (which I assume is the SD card) seems to be stuck at 62mg, even though in the AVD manager I have set it to 512mb.</p>
<p>I have shrunk my application down (removed a lot of graphics) and it is now 17.4 mb.</p>
<p>Anyone have any other thoughts?</p>

<p>According to the AVD the sd card is 1024 mb. According to the settings in the emulator the &quot;USB storage&quot; (which I assume is the sd card?) is 62.86 mb, with internal storage of 154 total &#x2F; 68.62 available.</p>
<p>The apk for the application is 17.4 mb.</p>
<p>It is as though titanium is using a different sd card to the one started by the AVD? I will check that.</p>

										<p><p>Just ran the emulator directly from the avd manager, and it has 1gb of usb memory.  </p>
<p>When I try to deploy to the running emulator from Titanium, it opens a 2nd emulator, and deploys to that. </p>
<p>How do I persuade the system to deploy to the running emulator instead of starting its own?</p>

										<p><p>I have stripped the application right down to bare bones, and have changed the tiapp.xml to &lt;manifest android:installLocation=&quot;auto&quot;&gt; (it was previously preferExternal), and it seems to be behaving a bit better.</p>

							<p>My first problem was when having &lt;manifest android:installLocation=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;. I had this error</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Failure 
<span class="hljs-string">[INSTALL_FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE]</span>
</code></pre><p>the problem is signaled <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;64161&#x2F;ongoing-issue----installfailedinsufficientstorage#comment-189214">here</a> </p>
<p>One of the suggestions there was to use &lt;manifest android:installLocation=&quot;preferExternal&quot;&gt; which led me here to this problem :). Now I reverted back to &lt;manifest android:installLocation=&quot;auto&quot;&gt; and solved the first problem by increasing the emulator internal storage.</p>
