			<h1>HTC Droid DNA will not launch application, possible problem with all newer HTC phones.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I would like to know if anyone is having problems with their Titanium apps that are in the play store launching on HTC devices. I recently tested out app on the Droid DNA and the app when launched from the Launcher, app drawer, or the play store will kick the user to the play store after showing the bug2373 dialog that restarts the application. As a test, I replaced the bug 2373 values with the finishfalseroot flag, rebuilt the app for the device and while it no longer shows the restart dialog, it still kicks the user back to the play store everytime I try to launch the app. I have encountered a problem previously on a One X where the icon created on the home screen after installing the app exhibited similar behavior but launching from the app drawer still worked. I have tried installing another launcher like Nova Launcher and the app still will not launch.</p>
<p>Has anyone else experienced this and is there any workaround for this?</p>

							<div><p>I can confirm that the finishfalseroot flag works as expected on the HTC One X so this problem I&#39;ve only been able to produce on the HTC Droid DNA.</p>

							<div><p>Killing the app and then launching it again got it to work properly, that being said I still see this as a problem as we can&#39;t be telling our users to kill the app and relaunch it just to get it to work properly. I&#39;d still like to come up with a work around.</p>

							<div><p>I am unfortunately unable to reproduce the error anymore. Killing the application in memory and then relaunching it caused it to behave as expected and now I am unable to reproduce this bug at all. I am reluctant to lock this though because I can see a user running into this getting very frustrated. I tested a Samsung Galaxy S3, Note 2, Galaxy Nexus, and HTC One X and they all worked as expected, and now the DNA is working as expected as well. I do not know how to reproduce this but would like some more insight.</p>

							<div><p>One thing I think about in order to narrow down the problem, it&#39;s to have stack trace before getting the bug. I mean, is desirable to have the whole thing to diagnose through the console output (the more logs the better). Also, please post your tiapp.xml and if created, AndroidManifest.xml.</p>
<p>Both DDMS or adb command should enable you to get stack traces directly from already <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Native_Android_Debugging_and_Testing_Tools-section-29004938_NativeAndroidDebuggingandTestingTools-Examininglogoutputwithadb">connected devices</a>.</p>
