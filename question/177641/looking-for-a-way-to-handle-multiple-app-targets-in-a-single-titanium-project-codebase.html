			<h1>Looking for a way to handle multiple app targets in a single Titanium project codebase</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>In Xcode we use &quot;Targets&quot; to create multiple app output destinations from a single code base.  For example, an Magazine eReader type app that contains defined targets for a dozen different publications.  This allows us to make changes to a single code base, and then change the selected target to distribute updates to each of the application.  We use header files to flex various UI changes and text between the different targets.</p>
<p>How would we do the same thing in a Titanium project?  We have ported one of our magazine eReader projects to Titanium, but I can&#39;t find a way to specify multiple output targets.  I know I can just duplicate the project once for each published app, but I&#39;d rather not have to manage updating multiple project code bases as we tweak ongoing versions of the platform.  Any suggestions?</p>

							<p>Ryan,</p>
<p>There is a pretty good article on tidev by Fokke Zandbergen <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tidev.io&#x2F;2014&#x2F;02&#x2F;24&#x2F;building-an-app-factory&#x2F;">here</a>. It talks about one approach and gives some ideas on how he does that. Might be worth a read.</p>
<p>Ray</p>

										<p><p>BTW, his approach is to make a copy… but there are some ideas there that might work for you, depending on how many&#x2F;type of  customizations you need.</p>

										<p><p>Theming of i18n &amp; platform folders is not yet done (tickets linked to in that article), and since then there&#39;s been a request to theme the tiapp.xml file as well. Once those are implemented, you should be able to use themes to accomplish your goal. These changes are not trivial and have lots of potential ramifications (like, we could break lots of apps if we do it wrong). So, we are taking our time implementing the changes to be sure we get it right.</p>
<p>Fokke&#39;s article doesn&#39;t mention is using Alloy jmk (make-like) files to do the pre-processing. These files are nodejs scripts that are executed before (or after) the Alloy compilation process. You could use these in place of the sort of scripts that Fokke mentions to achieve the same goals. So, his overall technique, just implemented differently. See the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Build_Configuration_File_(alloy.jmk">Alloy build configuration files</a>) page in the docs.</p>

										<p><p>The Alloy build config files look to be a good option.  I think I can automate most of the process using this method, and remain on a single codebase.  Thanks both for the quick replies.</p>
