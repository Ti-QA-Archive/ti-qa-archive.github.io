										<p><p>One thing you can do is create the new project with titanium 3.1.3 GA, and copy all your files in the new project. But if your project doesn&#39;t support alloy then remember to generate simple project.</p>
<p>This may solve your problem.</p>

										<p><p>You need at least xcode 5 to run build on iOS 7.</p>
<p>In Xcode 5 7.0 simulator comes as by default, but you can go to preferences —&gt; download —&gt; from there you can download simulator for 6.0 and 5.0.</p>
<p>So upgrade your xcode version.</p>
