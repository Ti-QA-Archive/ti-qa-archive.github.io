			<h1>Map doesn&#39;t work in the US on Android</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>We have integrated a map component in our application for Android and iOS.<br>It works in France and in the other countries, but it doesn&#39;t work in the US. The map is blurred and nonfunctional all the time.</p>
<p>The application was tested on the Samsung Galaxy S5 in the US. After some research in the internet, we didn&#39;t find any particular reason for this failure, related to the device model or the access to the Google Maps in the US.<br>Do you know what may cause this behavior and how to fix it? </p>
<p>Thank you very much for your help.</p>
<p>Anna</p>

							<div><p>What map component are you using? Can you post the relevant section of code? Is it just the S5 that&#39;s failing, or is it any device within the US?</p>

							<div><p>We tested the application within the US on the local devices - Samsung Galaxy S5 and HTC.<br>The error wasn&#39;t reproduced.</p>
<p>Is it possible that the failure occured because of the use of French smartphone in the USA?<br>However, there were no problems with the Google Map application on the same device.</p>
