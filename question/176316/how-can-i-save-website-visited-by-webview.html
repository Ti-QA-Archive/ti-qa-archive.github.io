			<p>How can i save the whole webpage (I mean all css, images, e.g.) to access when the device goes offline?</p>
<p>I have been searching for all morning but i found something i thought it would be helpful.</p>
<ul>
<li>someone told to use the HTML5 manifest &#x2F;&#x2F; yes, but it can only store the text, not images.</li>
<li>some told to use the SQLite database, but i don&#39;t know how, and don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the best way to do this.</li>
<li>some told to use the Ti.App.Properties. but i don&#39;t have any example.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anybody has ever dealt with the same problem as me???<br>Thanks.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>If you are trying to create an off-line cache of your locally visited website then you have to do some leg work yourself.  The API does not have an option for this built in as it is neither a standard feature&#x2F;need or something provided in the OS level web view either (from IOS or Android).  I am not aware of any third-party modules that would do this either.</p>
<p>So you will need to use httpClient to download the html and then parse the HTML to locate all images, scripts and css files.  You will have to translate all local path references are very few paths have full URLs - usually just relative.  Then loop those files and download them.  Finally go through the CSS file to find any more image references and download those as well.  It is unlikely you will be able to determine images from the JS files as depending on how they are created it would be very difficult to resolve the full name.</p>
<p>You then have to store all of this in a file system structure that you hold locally in a way that you do not duplicate files and cater for the external libraries.</p>
<p>This is not considered a simple task and is only normally feasible in a live browser as it can tell all the files that were asked of it.</p>
<p>Good luck, I am sorry to say you will need it.</p>

										<p><p>BTW whoever told you to use sqlite or Ti.App.Properties clearly did not understand the question.  Both of these are storage methods not retrieving html methods.  Also neither is a suitable storage for the many files you will need to cater for.  This is something you use the file system for.</p>

							<p>Hy, Thank you for your Query, the content of the webView can be saves as a pdf file in titanium. You can&#39;t directly convert the webView data in pdf though. First you have to parse html and then use the js pdf to create the pdf.Here is the code with example.</p>

<p>Hope it helps. if you have any question please comment.</p>

<li><em>&quot;How can i save the whole webpage (I mean all css, images, e.g.) to access when the device goes offline?&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I read the question as;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;I need to take the on-line files - off-line so they can be reviewed later when there is no connection or for other indexing needs.&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The PDF solution simply makes a picture of the web page and allows no further html access. It would also not allow any form to work or interaction to function or animation to work.</p>
