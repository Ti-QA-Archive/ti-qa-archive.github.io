			<p>I use a dedicated testing device (iPhone) that is associated with my development itunes account and all is good.</p>
<p>My problems begin when using personal iPhones (mine, wife&#39;s and daughter&#39;s) that are associated with other iTunes accounts. iTunes always wants to move all existings apps on these devices into my development account, when synching, and when I say NO it wipes out all existing apps.</p>
<p>My process has turned into backing up each device with it&#39;s iTunes account first, then installing my app (wiping out existing apps), then re-synching with the real itunes account to bring back other apps.</p>
<p>Am I missing something?  Thanks ….</p>

							<p>Had the same issue, so I just switched to using Testflight. I&#39;ve been all over the web to find a solution, but multiple idevices connected to the same computer is a b*tch. When using testflight(free) you can sync the application over wi-fi.</p>

										<p><p>anyone at testflight has the same potential of reverse engineering your compiled application as anyone who downloads your app from the App store.</p>

							<p>I use TestFlight… great way to get builds onto devices without messing with syncing… plus its all OTA, so that makes it easier. Plus it&#39;s free :)</p>

							<p>On the web:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a <a href="testflightapp.com">testflightapp.com</a> account</li>
<li>Invite your wife&#x2F;daughter to testflight where their UUIDs will be collected (will need this on the apple site)</li>
</ol>
<p>On the Apple Dev Site:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an AdHoc profile for your app.</li>
<li>Add your other devices to that profile</li>
<li>Download and install the profile to xCode and Studio</li>
</ol>
<p>On your system:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build for &#39;Distribute - App Store&#39; but sign with your AdHoc profile</li>
<li>In xCode&#39;s  Organizer find your app on the left side, select, then highlight the latest build that was just created by TiStudio. </li>
<li>Choose &#39;Share&#39;, iOS App Store Package, resign with AdHoc, save.</li>
<li>Upload to testflight.</li>
</ol>
<p>The devices will be notified of the new versions, install, test.</p>
<p>I would suggest that if you go this route, using test flight, that you purchase the test flight module from the Appcelerator Market.  It will allow you to access crash information on the remote devices.</p>

										<p><p>You don&#39;t need the module. The module is used for debugging, so if you only want an easier way of deploying apps to multiple idevices, you dont need it. Just signup on Testflight&#39;s website, register your devices by inviting them using testflights interface and upload your IPA. You dont even need to make an Ah-Hoc profile, just add your devices in the provisioning profile. Then hit &quot;Run -&gt; iOS Device&quot;, open ~&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;Music&#x2F;iTunes&#x2F;iTunes Media&#x2F;Mobile applications and find your IPA. Upload it to testflight, and you are good to go.</p>
