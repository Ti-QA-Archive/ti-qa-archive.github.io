			<h1>Cannot load app into android emulator [OS X] [Ti mobile 1.8.1] [Ti Studio]</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Pretty much exactly what the title says, I am on OS X and I went to build our app for android and the emulator took forever to boot up and when it was all booted up nothing happened. I looked in the app drawer and it wasn&#39;t there. I thought that maybe our full app was just too much to handle so I created a new Ti mobile project and tried with that. Same issue. I don&#39;t get any error messages, all I get is a steady stream of worthless debug info coming from the emulator (Not TI debug info but just android) I have kept my android sdks all updated and the emulators &quot;work&quot; albeit very slow and choppy, the problem is I cannot get my app on the emulator and if I try to load the app directly to an android device it crashes on launch. I want to run it in the emulator so that I can figure out WHY it is crashing and fix it</p>

<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro</p>
<p>Ps. How much memory do you have? Android emulator is a full virtual machine that emulates arm and the android os, will requiere TONS of memory&#x2F;cpu. An Android thing, not Appc.</p>

							<p>Hey Josh,</p>
<p>Android emulator needs more memory than iOS simulator. Which emulator are you trying on (I mean 2.2 HVGA, 2.3 HVGA, QVGA etc etc) ? </p>
<p>And if you want to debug your application from device than also you can do that. You can start DDMS and check your application log in DDMS while you are running application in device.</p>
<p>If you are having less memory for your android emulators, it will take time to get started and in the mean time titanium application launcher will through time out error. So you can do one thing. Start emulator from AVD manager. Once it get started fully than you can press RUN button to run your application from Ti Studio.</p>
<p>Basically I want to say is, it&#39;s issue with less memory.</p>
