							<p>Without an API on the windows machine, this cant be done. The issue being that you would need a SAMBA service running on the iPhone, the only way you could do that if via a jailbreak hack.</p>

										<p><p>thanks for the reply, i understand, it hink what i will do is try to build a service inside my program on windows that listens for a socket and make the program do stuff depending on messages it receives.</p>

										<p><p>Matt,</p>
<p>SAMBA would not be appropriate here.  It provides file and print services, but not executing commands.  The normal way to do that via TCP&#x2F;IP is with a rexecd (Remote Execution Daemon) on the server and a rexec (Remote Execution) client on the device.  Accept of course in Titanium you&#39;d just mimic the rexec logic in your project using a socket.</p>
<p>However, very few Windows machines will have rexecd running, as it is not enabled by default.</p>

							<p>You would need something running on the Windows machine to listen for requests then run the command.  The &quot;standard&quot; way of doing this is what is known as the Remote Execution (rexec) protocol in TCP&#x2F;IP.  Typically you have a rexec client on the side issuing the commands, and a rexec daemon (rexecd) on the server side listening for and executing the commands.</p>
<p>Microsoft included a rexecd (i.e. server side component) in all versions of Windows XP, though it was not enabled by default.  In Vista they removed it from all but the Ultimate and Enterprise versions.  </p>
<p>If you already have a Windows program and the commands can &#x2F; should run under the authority of the logged in user, then by all means just bind a socket to some port of your choice and listen for messages you send using a TCP socket in titanium.</p>
<p>That way you won&#39;t need to make sure the user installs&#x2F;enables a rexecd daemon.  If you want some ideas on how the TCP&#x2F;IP standard for this works though, so a web search on rexec and rexecd.</p>
