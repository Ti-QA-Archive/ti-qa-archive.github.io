							<p>Have a look at this tutorial <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.teemusk.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;05&#x2F;building-server-push-notifications-with-appcelerator-titanium-cloud&#x2F;comment-page-1">here</a>. It is really simple to use Appcelerator Cloud Services. Once you have your device registered, you can log into ACS Admin and send Push notifications to your devices.</p>
<p>Just go through that tutorial step by step. If you still have problems let me know and I will try to help :)</p>

							<p>Juan, I recently decided to use Easy APNS and it didn&#39;t seem to work with my hosting service but I managed to get my own server up and running with PHP and MySQL. I then sent some sample push notifications to my device, worked like a charm! If you don&#39;t have the luxury of setting something up on your own you could always do a search on which hosts support this kind of service. All the examples that would need are included in the easyAPN download.</p>

										<p><p>Juan, besides the mysql and php what other information are you looking for? You would essentially need a domain(dedicated IP) in which to host the easyAPN service which you would reference in your code.</p>

										<p><p>Sweeeet, just let me know if you need any other hints. Really the only snag I ran into was with the .pem cert(but just regenerated it without a password and everything worked, development of course).  I have yet to experiment with the android platform but one step at a time. ;P</p>
