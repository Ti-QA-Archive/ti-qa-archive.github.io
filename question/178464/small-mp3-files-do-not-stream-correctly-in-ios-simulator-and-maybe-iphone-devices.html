			<h1>Small mp3 files do not stream correctly in iOS Simulator (and maybe iPhone devices)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m using Ti SDK 3.4.0, iOS Simulator 8.0, and XCode 6.0.1. I have an app that attempts to play remote mp3 files by streaming over url. Here&#39;s the code:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> audioPlayer</span> = Ti.Media.createAudioPlayer({ 
    url: 'http:<span class="hljs-comment">//www.myserver.com/mp3/fun.mp3',</span>
    allowBackground: <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>
});

audioPlayer.start();
</code></pre><p>This works perfectly for all mp3 files over 40Kb. But any files under 40Kb won&#39;t work. I can hear the mp3 start to play for just a split second, then stops. The audioPlayer reports a state of &quot;unknown (9)&quot;, then quits, immediately after starting to play.</p>
<p>You may be tempted to think that size has nothing to do with this, but rather CBR vs VBR, mp3 headers, version, layers, channels, sampling rate, khz…etc. But I have been down all those roads on another audio forum, and I can prove that the only delta that makes any difference is simply file size, as mentioned above. I have analyzed many different mp3 files, compared baselines and various attributes, and everything points back to file size, every time. It&#39;s a provable thing.</p>
<p>Anyway, WHY is my iOS simulator audioplayer choking on streamed files under 40Kb? And what can I do about it? </p>
<p>Here&#39;s an <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zerogravpro.com&#x2F;temp&#x2F;unfixable.mp3">actual example</a> of an mp3 file that&#39;s too small to work when streamed&#x2F;played. Thanks in advance for any ideas.</p>

							<div><p>We had similar issues with short mp3s and ended up downloading them to the device and playing with Titanium.Media.Sound rather than stream them with Titanium.Media.AudioPlayer. A bit of a hassle but it works quite well now, although it&#39;s a good idea to leave a very slight gap before the audio to give it a chance to load.</p>

							<div><p>We had observed the same problem, we have tested with both device and simulator, it seems the audio about to play but it didn&#39;t. We think it&#39;s a bug.</p>
