			<h1>Kill an app through some code on both android and iphone.??</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>My Question is straight..</p>
<p>In Android you have back button to close the activity and navigate back to the previews activity where as in I phone there&#39;s no concept like this , so we have been forced to use back button on every activity(on navigation bar)…..</p>
<p>In android you have plenty of option to kill a app via emulator(back button,menu,home button..i guess) , however , what about I phone , How to kill an app explicitly???</p>
<p>I &#39;m looking for some sort of code to kill my app when ever some exception&#x2F;error is thrown…(android as well as I phone)??</p>
<p>I &#39;m also interested to know how&#39;d  you deal with  working on both android&#39;s emulator and phone&#39;s one.(while debugging)??  any best practice or some tips which i should know ??<br>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

							<p>IOS does not havee any automatic terminate functionality. You cant kill-off an App through code, only through the task list shown by double-clicking the front button.  You <em>can</em> however tell the app not to go to background when the app is closed through a single click of the front button</p>
