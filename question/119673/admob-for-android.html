							<p>For anyone who is interested in being a beta tester for this module you can find it here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bkurzius&#x2F;Titanium-Android-AdMob-Module. </p>
<p>I should say that this is my first Titanium module so it may not be done very well – but it does seem to work. It only provides the most basic function –which is to display a preset ad from admob – it also throws events for the ad being received or not (see the example). I do not have it set up for testing, and you cannot set the background colors and so on – like you can with the iOS module. Anyone who would like to make it better please fork away :-)</p>

										<p><p>This looks great, are there instructions on how to add it to a project and what Titanium SDK it needs. </p>
<p>I have tried adding the module zip file com.studioclassics.admob-android-0.1.zip to my project directory. Using Titanium Developer it extracted the zip into the modules&#x2F;android&#x2F;com.studioclassics.admob&#x2F;… etc. </p>
<p>When running an example test app it throws a FileNotFoundException: Resources&#x2F;com.studioclassics.admob.js</p>
<p>I am also running the example app.js included with the project on Titanium SDK 1.7.0</p>

							<p>They updated the ticket today that they won&#39;t be releasing Admob for Android very soon, it isn&#39;t high on their priority list. I think they don&#39;t understand that this is very important and that if they supply Admob for Android the developers will make more money and will also invest more into appcelerator.</p>
<p>Appcelerator should invest far more resources into ways to make money with apps. Then they give the developers a good basis to earn money and that will result in more developers buying a more expensive subscription.</p>

							<p>Hi Kosso, </p>
<p>I had a discussion with Appcelerator sales about this yesterday. They plan on doing something but there is no word on a release date.  I was hoping someone else has heard of a third party one.</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve had discussions with different people at Appcelerator for almost 2 years now and the answer is always the same - &quot;It is on the top of our to do list and we will have something in the coming months.&quot; </p>
<p>I think it is safe to assume that AdMob for Android will never come to developers from Appcelerator and that their main focus is on iPhone, and anything Android is just an afterthought, which is sad because if they did support Android more I would happily buy a min of 3 licenses for Ti Mobile+. I just don&#39;t feel compelled to spend that much money every month for products that won&#39;t work on the platform I need them to work on. If we ever want a working Android AdMob module, we will have to create it ourselves.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Rocco, Check out the top answer. I wound up creating one (which you can get from GitHub) and then enhanced the code and gave it to Appcelerator. I&#39;m not sure why it wasn&#39;t included on the new marketplace but was planning on following up on this when CodeStrong was over…</p>

							<p>@brian-kurzius Hi, I am having trouble installing it on 1.7.2, getting error &quot;Wrapped java.lang.NullPointerException (file:&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;android_asset&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;app.js#7&quot;</p>
<p>Here is the way I do it on windows 7.</p>
<ol>
<li>Placed module inside C:\Users\OLEGICH\AppData\Roaming\Titanium\mobilesdk\win32\1.7.2\module\android\bkurzius-Titanium-Android-AdMob-Module-cdf87db</li>
<li>Created new mobile project, copied your example app.js and changed the publisher id. </li>
</ol>
<p>Tested on device and getting the following error:</p>
<p>Any idea what it could be?</p>

										<p><p>Hi Oleg,<br>The module needs to be placed in the root of the Titanium install. So on a Mac that would typically be: &#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;modules&#x2F;android&#x2F; . And the only thing you place there is the unzipped contents of this file from the GitHub distro: &#x2F;dist&#x2F;com.studioclassics.admob-android-0.1.zip</p>

										<p><p>It seems like it did help, no errors appear but no ads as well. Maybe there simply no ads to serve. But one question.. Admob provides a publisher code GoogleAdMobAdsSdk-4.1.1.jar. Is it ok to copy into your lib folder, i see it contains GoogleAdMobAdsSdk-4.1.0.jar. I am not sure if i have to copy my publisher code there.?</p>

										<p><p>you can set your admob account to send test ads and you should also be able to call the method for test ads: setTesting(Boolean testing); (check the the documentation folder for details). You don&#39;t need to add that google sdk to your project as it is already embedded in the module..</p>
