			<p>Hello, I am starting a new mobile project using the &#39;Master&#x2F;Detail Application&#39; template. There are two views: master and detail. I don&#39;t really need the detail view, and I have removed every reference to the detail view. The results are as expected in the emulator. Trying to run the exact same code directly on 2 android test devices gets 2 different results: one that matches the emulator, and one with code that is an hour or two old (at least). Despite running &#39;clean&#39;, and manually checking the build folder (always is empty after a clean). I am convinced the device is holding on to an older image. Is there any other explanation? I have tried removing the app and re-installing twice, but that does not help either. I&#39;ve tried upping the version string (out of desperation). How to really, really uninstall an android app or force a new version?</p>

<p>Missing from your question are a number of important pieces of information. I suggest you take a look at the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Using+Questions+and+Answers">Using Questions and Answers</a> article, specifically the Q&amp;A Question Checklist.  The missing information is critical to reproducing problems in a test environment and often indicates other factors that cause the undesirable outcome you are experiencing.</p>

							<p>add the following to your tiapp.xml and see if the problem disappears:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">property</span> <span class="hljs-property">name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"ti.android.fastdev"</span> type=<span class="hljs-string">"bool"</span>&gt;<span class="hljs-constant">false</span>&lt;/<span class="hljs-keyword">property</span>&gt;
</code></pre><p>If this works,  your build times will be slower.</p>

										<p><p>oh, you said on device, ignore that than.<br>When testing, always delete the file on the device and install.</p>
<p>On android, version numbers form tiapp.xml do not effect the build number in the androidmanifest.xml which is what Android uses to compare builds.</p>

										<p><p>That did indeed seem to work! Thanks. If you know, <em>why</em>, I am certainly curious. For the record, the problem device is a Droid Razr Maxx.</p>

										<p><p>Haven&#39;t played with a Maxx.  I&#39;ll search around see if I can find someone with one.</p>
<p>For the emulator, fastdev only pushes files that change to the emulator, so you dont have to do a complete build of the java binary code each time.  Much faster dev.  However, as all hacks, it has issues from time to time.</p>
<p>Consider looking at TiShadow from David Bankier.</p>
