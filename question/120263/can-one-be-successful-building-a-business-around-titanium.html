			<h1>Can one be successful building a business around Titanium</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I wanted to put out the question hopefully for a good discussion:</p>
<p>Are there people or businesses out there that have built a thriving business around the Titanium platforms? </p>
<p>or put another way</p>
<p>Can one be successful solely riding the Titanium train?</p>
<p>I have had decent success using the mobile tools with a couple of apps for customers up on the app store but am thinking about jumping in with both feet and starting a development business going full blast with Titanium.</p>
<p>I&#39;d love to here success stories from the group.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Gary</p>

							<p>Yes, I did it :)</p>
<p>I switched from web to mobile completely and only &quot;because&quot; of Titanium.</p>
<p>Now my life companion and co-worker is making the change too. </p>
<p>Actually she already does the native UI for the projects we have and I take care of the backend and the more complicated parts until she learns enough.</p>

							<p>Sure! Look at Matt Apperson, Kevin Whinnery  or Jeff Hayne! They created..</p>
<p>err.. never mind… :)</p>
<p>Jokes aside i would advise you to learn a little bit of objective-c at least. Sometimes you really need a fix or some implementation that titanium doenst have or it is buggy. </p>
<p>And, if you plan to develop games, i would look for some complementary alternatives (obj-c, or other game frameworks like corona or unity)</p>
<p>cheers </p>

							<p>It depends…</p>
<p>You&#39;re never going to develop an Angry Birds type of game.  If thats something you&#39;re striving for, you might want to branch out a little.</p>
<p>That said, I&#39;ve used Titanium for all of my needs, I have about 4 apps in the store of my own, and 4 for other clients I&#39;ve developed for.</p>

							<p>It depends on the nature of your business. A few things Titanium still can&#39;t deliver on its own: magazine readers, fast tableviews, complex games. With that said, for pretty much anything else you&#39;re good to go. Watch out for the &quot;cross-platform&quot; part, however, because a lot of features don&#39;t translate very well from iOS to Android and viceversa.</p>

							<p>The other answers are all correct, but I must interject, that to those saying that games, magazine reader, and such… can not be made, this is not 100% true, but also not 100% false.</p>
<p>Titanium allows for modules to be added to the system to extend it, there are already open source modules for flipbook style magazine readers, and you could, and I am sure someone will make a module to help in the creation of games.</p>
<p>That is the beauty of Titanium, it can forever be expanded to do new things, and add new functionality.</p>

							<p>Bevore I startet with Tit I worked with TYPO3&#x2F;jQuery … Today I know that I escaped from a (web-)hell. My last webapp was build with jqmobile and phonegap. The app is very slow and unsexy. Now with Tit I can see my clients in his eyes.</p>
