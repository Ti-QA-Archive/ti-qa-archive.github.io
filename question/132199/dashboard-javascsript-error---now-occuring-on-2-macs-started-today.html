			<p>I&#39;m unable to access the Dashboard from 2 different macs that I use to do development.  Yesterday it was working fine.  PC access is fine but I&#39;m building for iPhone right now so that doesn&#39;t help much :)</p>
<p>Error Message: An exception occurred in the script. Error name: TypeError. Error description: undefined. Error number: undefined. Error message: &#39;undefined&#39; is not a function</p>
<p>?OSX 10.6.8<br>Please advise</p>

							<div><p>Also happening here as of yesterday (launching Mac Titanium Studio). Soon as I launch and the Dashboard starts to draw, boom! Same error. Can still work on my mobile apps fine however. Doesn&#39;t seem to have affected anything except the Dashboard render since only the banner at the top is showing.</p>

							<p>It&#39;s actually an upgrade of a script by a third party that broke the dashboard. we&#39;re working on a fix. See https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TISTUD-1188 for details.</p>

							<p>Hi,<br>  This actually isn&#39;t a build issue.  I am able to build by using the build button.  But when I click the red button to take me to the dashboard it gives me that error - so I can&#39;t, for instance, access the place to configure android.  This is on Titanium Studio and the target platform isn&#39;t relevant in this case.</p>
<p>Hope that helps - thanks for answering so quickly!</p>

										<p><p>I had the same issue when I was accessing the dashboard. It was displaying only the banner for appcelerator powers nbc… only.<br>So what i did is, once it opened the web page for the dashboard, i right clicked the dashboard webpage and on the pop up menu, i clicked on refresh and it really worked for me like heaven!!<br>Hope this will help</p>
