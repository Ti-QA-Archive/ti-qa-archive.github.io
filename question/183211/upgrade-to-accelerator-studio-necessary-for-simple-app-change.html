			<h1>Upgrade to Accelerator Studio Necessary for simple App Change?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I know questions about continued development on Titanium Studio have been asked and I do have a free indie account but I haven&#39;t found a definitive answer to my question.  I have an app that I haven&#39;t touched in a year and I need to make one small change to an image.  The app is very simple and I don&#39;t use any cloud services for this app.  I just opened up Titanium Studio and the app boots up with SDK 4.0 in the simulator and works perfectly with iPhone 6.  I also tested building a package for iOS with Xcode 6.  I plan to set up Appcelerator Studio in the coming weeks, but if I can make this small change in Titanium Studio now, it would save me a bunch of time and take the pressure off. </p>
<p>So is it possible to make a small tweak using the old Titanium Studio and if so, are there any gotchas I should be aware of?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>David</p>
