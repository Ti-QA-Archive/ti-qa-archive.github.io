			<h1>Menu button and orientation not working after upgrade to 3.2.3</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have an app that used to work perfectly before i updated to 3.2.3 from 2.1.4 on OSX.<br>when i click the menu button on the phone nothing shows up, i used to lock the orientation of the app to portrait only using a custom manifest file, now everything seems broken. I&#39;m really starting to hate titanium because of how it breaks something with every update.</p>
<p>if i compile using 2.1.4 i get</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in">ERROR</span>] Exception occured <span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> building Android project:
[<span class="hljs-built_in">ERROR</span>] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process <span class="hljs-keyword">exit</span> value was <span class="hljs-number">143</span>
</code></pre><p>and when i compile using the latest version it compiles but it breaks the menu and the orientation.</p>
<p>please help.</p>

</code></pre><p>I&#39;m sorry, but you want to feel all validated  about &#39;every update&#39; yet 2.1.4 was released in <strong>NOVEMBER OF 2012</strong> which is over a <strong>YEAR AND A HALF AGO</strong>.  </p>
<p>In waiting to move from 2.1.4 to 3.2.3 you pretty much lose any right to bitz about the platform.  Its not Titanium&#39;s fault that you failed to keep up with changes, changes that in most cases were caused by the native tooling, the native OS, the native vendors (apple&#x2F;google).</p>
<p>Maybe the title of the post should be &quot;I&#39;m not professional enough to keep up with the industry so I will blame the tooling.&quot;</p>
<p>That all being said, how about you post a question, with details (you are missing a lot of details in your micro rant) and MAYBE someone will ignore your attitude and offer a solution.</p>
<p>Missing from your question are a number of important pieces of information. I suggest you take a look at the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Using+Questions+and+Answers">Using Questions and Answers</a> article, specifically the Q&amp;A Question Checklist.  The missing information is critical to reproducing problems in a test environment and often indicates other factors that cause the undesirable outcome you are experiencing.</p>
