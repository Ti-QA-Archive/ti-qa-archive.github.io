			<h1>Apple rejected my app tonight due to iOS 6 Crash</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I make custom apps for companies and many of them have the exact same code, just different graphics.  In fact, I have over 25 apps in the App Store that work perfectly.  I had two in the approval queue today.  The first was reviewed and approved this morning before the iOS 6 GM was released.  The second went into review this evening after the iOS 6 GM release and was rejected because the app crashed during startup on an iOS 6 device.  They have the exact same code.</p>
<p>I figured I&#39;d test it out tonight to see what was going on so I installed the 4.5 SDK on a backup iMac and installed iOS 6 on my iPad.  I installed the app that they rejected on my iOS 6 iPad using TestFlight and it crashed on startup as well.  I then downloaded the app that they approved this morning to my iOS 5 iPhone and it worked just fine.  However, when I download and run that approved app on my iOS 6 iPad, it crashes just like the one they rejected.</p>
<p>Does this mean that every single Titanium app is going to crash when people start installing iOS 6 next Friday??  That would be a huge deal.  I know Appcelerator normally doesn&#39;t support new iOS releases until after they&#39;re released, but this seems like a major problem.</p>
<p>Has anyone else upgraded their device to iOS 6 and tried to run a Titanium app on it?  Maybe it&#39;s a module (haven&#39;t tried removing those yet).  My apps use the Urban Airship and Store Kit modules.</p>
<p>Any and all help would be appreciated as I need these apps approved as soon as possible.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Sergey, I had a similar problem on a tableview on selecting a item the app would crash, your fix seems to work on this too. Does that mean my app is going to crash when the user updates to ios6?</p>
<p>If I make this change and submit to the app store will the fix be included or will it be overwritten on build.</p>

							<p>Hmmm, my first guess is it&#39;s something simple that&#39;s not being caught. :&#x2F;</p>
<p>I have an app currently awaiting review myself. I <em>just</em> ran it on the 6.0 Simulator, and it went without any crashes, though I honestly don&#39;t know how much that really means. I did have to add a 640x1136 image called &#39;Default-568h@2x.png&#39; to get rid of a warning, but I&#39;m assuming that was only for iPad&#39;s sake.</p>
<p>I really don&#39;t know how much I&#39;m helping, but for anyone else that may be wondering, while not tested on an actual device with 6.0, my app containing navigation groups, tab groups, web views - local and remote, remote twitter feeds (HTTPRequests), multiple types of views, ACS photo uploads, and Apple&#39;s new maps system, actually worked well on the simulator, so I&#39;m hoping that&#39;s good news for at least some fellow Ti developers.</p>
<p>In any case, I really wish you (and all of us) the best with 6.0, especially in these early stages.</p>
