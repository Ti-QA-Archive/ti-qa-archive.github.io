			<h1>Changes in 1.8</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Have you tested your application with 1.8?</p>
<p>1.8 seems very cool at the moment and I&#39;m looking forward to final release. Nevertheless, I&#39;ve seen some changes, so I would like to post here changes that I noticed, you can also post your own observations, so we can all prepare for future full release.</p>
<p>I noticed:</p>
<ul>
<li>SVN files are finally ignored correctly. No need for workaround anymore :)</li>
<li>Splash screen functionality seems to be different now, in 1.7.3 I have my own picture, in 1.8 there is Appcelerator&#39;s default pic</li>
<li>numeric keyboard in Android shows numbers only. Finally!! But it seems that it&#39;s not functional yet as it, IMHO, should be. I can enter non-numeric values, there is no key to minimize keyboard.</li>
<li>more stable in general</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to add you observations.</p>

							<p>We will post a full change log when 1.8 is released, also you can view the git commits in github to know what has changed. As for the splash screen, delete the contents of your platform build directories, and re compile.</p>

										<p><p>Git commit logs are not very useful and change log is sometimes incomplete. This way we could have important changes in one place and do some testing (and bug reporting) before release is out.</p>
<p>Splash screen advice doesn&#39;t work (when changing SDK version, full rebuilt is made anyway, right? ).</p>
