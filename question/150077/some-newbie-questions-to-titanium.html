			<h1>Some Newbie Questions to Titanium</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>So, I&#39;m planning to develop my first own app for IOS. I am now considering which platform or concept to use.<br>As I&#39;m pretty good in Javascript and HTML and have no idea of Objective C - I tend to start using Phonegap or Titanium.<br>When looking closer the concept of Titanium looks somehow smarter as it is compiled to &quot;real&quot; Native App instead and not only running as local website and in the webview widget.</p>
<p>However I have some questions where I need to get help:</p>
<p><strong>First: Using external JS libraries with Tianium:</strong><br>I want to use Javascript Libraries. One is used to draw charts and graphs. There are several options out there, e.g. Highchart.js. The other is a library to collect transaction data for German bank accounts. There is a protocol called HBCI &#x2F; FINTS which is mainly used from all German &#x2F; Austrian banks and there exists a JS library that enables the communication to the banks.<br>Is it possible to use these libraries? How will Titanium integrate them when compiling. Didn&#39;t really see an example that makes use of external libraries.</p>
<p><strong>Second: Storing SQL, respectively database files as not readable objects</strong><br>The data in the app should be stored on the device. For the beginning I am not planning an online connection. However, I would appreciate that the files are encrypted, so that nobody - not even the user is able to view them in an editor as soon as he get file access to it.<br>Does Titanium provide features to realize this? (I couldn&#39;t find hints in the documentation guides.)</p>
<p><strong>Third: SQL or NOSQL</strong><br>As NOSQL databases provide some very nice features, I am also considering of using a NOSQL database like Couchbase Lite. I found a Git Hub repository for TouchDB (aka Couchbase Lite) using Alloy.<br>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pegli&#x2F;ti_touchdb&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Alloy-and-TouchDB-Tutorial. But it&#39;s not clear to me how to use that code. Do I have to first compile it in XCode?</p>
<p>So these are the most important questions to me. Thanks for anybody giving me some hints to make the correct decision. </p>
<p>Best regards, Bernd</p>

							<p>Hello,</p>
<p>First: Using external JS libraries with Tianium - Yes, you can use them. Just one thing: remember that Titanium doesn&#39;t have a DOM or similar. You will have to adjust some of them.<br>Second: Storing SQL - Go to the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com">marketplace</a> you will find alternatives to store your db encrypted.<br>Third: SQL or NOSQL - As you mention, there are alternatives nowdays. The link you provided looks quite interesting, you only need to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Configuring+Apps+to+Use+Modules">learn how to add modules</a> to your titanium app. </p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro</p>
