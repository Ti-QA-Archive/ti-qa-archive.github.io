			<h1>Touchmove on device not working correctly</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>First of all I would like to express my disappointment in the way the Appcelerator team releases the updates of Titanium Mobile. Ever since working with 0.8 I have been rewriting my code with every update, often with many workarounds. Finally at 1.0 I had my app working correctly and was ready to submit it to the appstore when I had the (crazy) idea to wait for IOS 4.0 and Titanium mobile SDK 1.4 to be able to test and launch my app for the iphone4 as well. Huge mistake!!!</p>
<p>Now, simple things like dragging stuff on the screen don&#39;t work anymore. And the new code (from Kitchen sink 1.4) provides a working solution only on the SIMULATOR!! They probably &#39;forgot&#39; to test it on an actual device where dragging results in a horrendous animation eventually throwing your imageview or label out of the screen. WHY do these WORK in previous versions but not in the newer ones?</p>
<p>Also opening the photogallery seems to work fine when using the code provided by Kitchen Sink 1.0 to 1.4. UNLESS you need to focus back on the main window after the Modal window for the gallery closes (which should be a normal procedure and worked in 1.0!). </p>
<p>I could give youguys a code snippet as an example but you can use the code from Kitchen Sink 1.4 to test it! It is really frustrating that example code is not properly tested and previous working code is not working anymore in newer versions. </p>
<p>Being able to create mobile applications using javascript and so many APIs make appcelerator a fantastic platform, but please FIX current problems and KEEP them fixed!</p>

							<div><p>Sorry to not have an answer for you, and being that you wrote this 10 months ago you might have moved on, but I just (within the last 10 minutes) found this happens because when you click on an object, the e.x and e.y are recorded with respect to where you clicked <em>on the object</em>, not with respect to where you clicked on the window, which is 100% useless. If you found a solution by now, I would absolutely love to hear it.</p>

							<div><p>Hi both.  Seems this is an ongoing issue, even 10 months later, see <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;122007&#x2F;touchmove--drag-and-drop-not-working-on-device---17#comment-90105">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;122007&#x2F;touchmove–drag-and-drop-not-working-on-device—17#comment-90105</a>.  FYI. I have tried this with the latest continuous build 1.7.2 as well as the latest stable version 1.7.1 and both exhibit the same problem when dragging the circle on the Kitchen Sink example.  Shocking for Appcelerator really.  Has anyone got a work around for this?</p>

							<p>I have solved this issue by not using the Kitchen Sink drag and drop technique. It&#39;s madness that they have not provided a working solution.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve posted my solution in another question on this site at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;45081&#x2F;can-anyone-provide-a-good-way-to-drag-in-14#212646">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;45081&#x2F;can-anyone-provide-a-good-way-to-drag-in-14#212646</a>.</p>
<p>You can also look at the code on my Gist which you can fork at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;1073811">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;1073811</a></p>
