			<h1>Stumped on iPad crash - Too many images in scrollview?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>I&#39;m completely stumped on this one as I&#39;ve tried for days to figure out what&#39;s wrong. I have an iPad application that&#39;s comprised of a large image (2x width&#x2F;height of ipad screen) that&#39;s scrollable and zoomable as a &quot;map&quot; (inside a scrollview). This scrollview also has various &quot;icons&quot; placed on it (20 total) which users can click to gain points.</p>
<p>Now everything works in the simulator - the only issue I see is the scrolling speed on the scrollview seems to be a little choppy. Other than that it works fine. The thing is - it crashes on the actual device. I&#39;ve looked everywhere (at least I think I have) and can&#39;t find a similar case.</p>
<p>The code is here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;1780675</p>
<p>Can anyone figure out what&#39;s wrong with it? Is this a Titanium issue? Or have I just completely missed something?</p>
<p>Any suggestions are very much appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<div><p>the resolution of the image is 2048?×?1536, but I&#39;ve also tried running the app without the image to the same result. So it might be in the icons. But I tried running the app without those as well and am getting the same thing. As for the debugger, do you mean running the xcode debugger while the iPad is running the app?</p>
