			<h1>Why develop with Titanium Appcelerator</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,<br>I&#39;m using Titanium Appcelerator since one month.<br>First I&#39;ve installed it on a pc for developing for Android.<br>After solving some problems (like &quot;where is the adb?&quot;, include the xml resource, where to locate files in the device) I started write my app.<br>Somethings written in the API references doesn&#39;t work, sometimes clicking on the &quot;launch&quot; button doesn&#39;t work, sometimes you have to force the rebuild of the project…a lot of problems (ex: using words with accent -also in the comments- makes crash the compile process!). I&#39;ve continued develop my app and after a lot of problems it works ( a little bit slowly but it works ).<br>Sometimes I asked help on the Q&amp;A…nobody answered to me…<br>For all the time I&#39;ve written only things work both with Android and iOS (in the API reference on the top-right of the page there were always both symbols of Android and iOS).<br>I&#39;ve installed it on a Mac and I&#39;ve copied my App on it, after solving the same starting problems I&#39;ve tryed to test the App on the iOS simulator…it doesn&#39;t work!!!<br>After one day trying to understand the reason of this disaster (believe me, a disaster!) I&#39;ve decided to rewrite completly my App with the Mac. My hope was that if you write all the code with a Mac you will be able to observe difference between the results in Android and in iOS (you can&#39;t compile on iOS with a pc running windows).<br>I started rewrite my App and after some simple code I tryed to run it both on Android and iOS: results are completly different!<br>I thinked &quot;Ok, let&#39;s start again from the begining…&quot;<br>Always on the mac I created a new project, I went to</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Using+TableViews</p>
<p>I&#39;ve copied the code in the example (I think written from the Appcelerator staff) and I&#39;ve tryed to run it both on Android and iOS…the results are completely different! It doesn&#39;t work (especially on iOS).<br>I&#39;ve smiled, I closed my pc and I had a coffe.<br>Now I turned on my pc. I don&#39;t want to take the decision now between continue or not to continue developping with Appcelerator Titanium because before I hope somebody lets me change my opinion on it.<br>Someone will answer me this time? I think no, but I want to try for the last time…</p>

							<p>Just stick with it.. It is painful, very painful, when you&#39;re first starting out. I think those of us who have stuck with it are those who love pain. But each time something goes wrong, and soo many things do go wrong, you learn a lot more than if things had gone right. The end result is definitely worth it, because who really wants to learn both objective-C and Java when they can just write in Javascript instead? </p>

										<p><p>Thank you for your answer…I approached to Titanium only for writing only one code…I&#39;m able to write in Java and Objective-C, but for company reason I&#39;ve have to write try multiplatforms SDKs (one code is more fast to write if it works :-) )<br>What is your experience? Did you find good with Titanium? You wrote complicated Apps that finally works good both Android and iOS?</p>

							<p>Please use enters in your text next time, it is unreadable atm.</p>
<p>Do note, an Android is NOT and iPhone and vice versa!</p>
<p>I like you, have created an Android app, without using Android specific code it was chrashing on iPhone.</p>
<p>It took me only 2 days to get the same app working on iPhone, find the bugs why and how they occur. Use the if(Android) if(iPhone OS) statements so it&#39;ll work on both phones.</p>
<p>After only 2 weeks of development on Mac, i dont wat to return to Android, the emulator is shit compared to the iPhone one.</p>
<p>You need to make specific code for iPhone and Android, especially for the UI. Make classes where you use the same methods etc. you can use alot of the same code for Android and iPhone.</p>
<p>I do agree that the Q&amp;A is not the most effective source for your problems, youll have to bear that.</p>
<p>But developping on Titanium gives you the best opportunity to develop for bot iOS and Android. There will be differences. But more importantly after i learned the ropes on Android, ive had 10x more progress on the iPhone in 6 weeks then in 3 months for the Android. </p>
<p>Meaning, you dont have to learn 2 different languages, and coding titanium is pretty easy.</p>
<p>If you&#39;ve read this entire thing i do have a suggestion for you.<br>Although you prolly wont prefer it, but try all over for iPhone, fresh project but use code segments from your Android project. This helped me alot really.</p>
<p>Owhyea apple sux for not letting us compile on PC &gt;.&gt; really was a burden on my progress &gt;.&lt;</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;After only 2 weeks of development on Mac, i dont wat to return to Android, the emulator is shit compared to the iPhone one.&gt;&gt;</p>

										<p><p>That i was developing for Android, and that this code that was not completly written for Android did not work for iPhone. </p>
<p>I was developing for Android since you need a Mac and i dint have one at that time, so for the time being i was developing for Android.</p>
<p>After i got the Mac my app was not working on iPhone, i had to make a new project and reuse code to make the app again, which costed me 2 days.</p>
<p>And i am not developing for Android anymore, its takes to much time and braindamage to code for android. So im sticking with iPhone</p>
<p>But when the app is done and needs to be converted to Android, i just have to reuse the code and in a week time ill have the same app for Android. This is something that cannot be done without titanium.</p>
