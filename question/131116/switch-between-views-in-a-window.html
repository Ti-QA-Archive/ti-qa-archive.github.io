		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I currently have a set of tabs in my app each referring to some .js file. I would like to change one of these tabs to have a toolbar at the top with two buttons Option A and Option B. When the user clicks Option A then option_a.js should be displayed on the screen and similar for Option B.</p>
<p>Is there any way to do this?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Yannis</p>

							<p>I would check out the view_hide_show.js example in the Kitchen Sink demo. To see it in action, run the demo and look for it under Base UI &gt; Views &gt; Hide&#x2F;Show.</p>

										<p><p>right - so at the moment i m doing win.add(mylabel). are you saying that iit makes sense to re-write it such that i do win.add(myView) and myView.add(mylabel)? i.e. add contents in a view rather than the current window? thanks</p>

							<p>Yes… why not. I haven&#39;t tried with two windows but I have done it with views for 3 tabbed buttons. </p>
<ul>
<li>I created 3 main views which contains content for 3 different tabbed button. And I was handling views visibility in a functions by hiding 2 other view and displaying clicked tabbed buttons view.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope this will help you. If you want any more help you can comment again.</p>

										<p><p>In the .js file of each content view don&#39;t create a new window just use the view which you have created in main window to add the content view of each tabbed button. And than include all 3 .js files to your main window instead of opening as windows url parameter.</p>

										<p><p>Check that above Eugene Gibson&#39;s response. You have to include content view of option a and b as he suggested and main logic to switch between view should be on your main window which contains your tabbed button and main views to contain content view of each each tabbed button.</p>
