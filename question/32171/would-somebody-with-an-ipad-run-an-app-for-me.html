			<h1>Would somebody with an iPad run an app for me?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I know the whole ad hoc process is tedious but I can&#39;t afford the real thing.</p>
<p>I have an iPad app just arrived in the app store, it works perfectly in the simulator but my first customer says it does not work on his iPad.</p>
<p>Basically I have tried to crudely reproduce the original Ti Contact Picker because the current one is broken and they don&#39;t seem in any hurry to fix it.</p>
<p>The customer says absolutely nothing happens when he presses the button which should bring up a Contact List.</p>
<p>There is no point in me posting code here because it works every time for me in the simulator.</p>
<p>(I have withdrawn the app from sale pending a fix, but of course it will have to go through the whole lengthy review process again)</p>
<p>regards,</p>
<p>JH</p>

							<div><p>Hi man, i think i might figured out your problem. If the contact obj has blank field (in your code you have c.lastName or c.firstname), tableview will not load. So i trapped those fields and assign them to some value if blank or null and it&#39;s now working on iPad simulator and device. </p>
<p>You can duplicate the problem on the iPad simulator, try create a contact with just last name, leave the first name empty for example. </p>
<p>good luck.</p>

							<div><p>Hi Daniel, thanks a lot for spending  time on this.  Unfortunately when I do this everything continues to work just fine on both the iPad and iPod simulators AND my real iPod Touch.  Contact just shows up as &quot;null noName 1234567&#39; in the expected index position.  I just rebuilt and reinstalled afresh on the Touch as well.</p>
<p>Thanks again!<br>Regards,</p>

							<p>Actually it was just dumb of me to upload a whole 13 megabyte partial project.  </p>
<p>Here is the whole source code and images in 560 KB - you just need to make a new project and put these files in the Resources folder (and the Resources&#x2F;iphone folder for the  splash screen and icons.)</p>
<p>holman.id.au&#x2F;bugs&#x2F;BuggySMS.zip</p>
<p>You will need the account:</p>
<p>username:  reviewer<br>password: review</p>
<p>All the watchers are welcome to this code too, bearing in mind that I get my Javascript skills from Google…</p>

							<p>Your user is correct. Nothing happens when I click on contacts. But the same happens in the simulator. While testing ur &quot;Test Contact&quot; prj that you sent me, I did get an error on this line: &quot;contacts = contacts.sort(sortNames);&quot; stating that sort is not a function, so I&#39;m guessing this is where your problem lies. I&#39;m currently short on time, else I would have tested more but let me know if you want me to test anything else.   </p>
<p>Which mobile sdk are you using btw? </p>

										<p><p>I am using the 1.3 sdk and can run both this test app and the full app without issues in the simulator.  Have you applied the 4.0 patch as advised?  I wonder if that could be causing a problem?  I am going to try and revert back to the unpatched sdk and see what happens.  Thanks for the prompt help,<br>regards,<br>JH</p>

										<p><p>Update: the unpatched Titanium 1.3.0 sdk also works perfectly well for me.  I am using the simulator that comes with iPhone OS 3.2 final.  I don&#39;t understand why the same code would work in my simulator but not yours?</p>
<p>The sort function seems to be standard Javascript available all over the place, and my Contacts sort alphabetically just fine.</p>

							<p>I have tested that sort function and watched every step of it using info, and Titanium seems to support it with no problems.</p>
<p>The same code installs and runs without any problems on my iPod Touch.</p>
<p>Is there nobody except me who can get this code working?</p>

							<p>Hey Daniel I&#39;m an idiot.  I was leaving the first name field blank, of course I&#39;m sorting on the last name field.  When I leave out the last name, I get the dead-button syndrome too.</p>
<p>Now I&#39;m embarrassed at sounding off against Titanium, but I guess they&#39;ll get over it.</p>
<p>Although I tested it with a large Contact list, I just happen to be one of those people who always puts in the full name.</p>
<p>And for what it&#39;s worth, Apple&#39;s tests aren&#39;t as draconian as people think :)</p>
<p>Regards and thanks again,</p>
<p>JH</p>
