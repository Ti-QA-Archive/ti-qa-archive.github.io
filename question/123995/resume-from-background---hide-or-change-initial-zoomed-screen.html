			<h1>Resume from Background - Hide or change initial zoomed screen</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>That title may not explain this well…so here&#39;s the details of what i&#39;m trying to do. </p>
<p>I want to lock my app on &quot;pause&quot; and have the user enter password on &quot;resume&quot;. The problem is that the last screen that was visible on &quot;pause&quot; appears every so briefly as the iPhone zooms the screen in from center on &quot;resume&quot;. I think I remember reading that the iPhone actually uses a screenshot of that last screen she it was paused and uses it on resume when it scales the screen up from center. However that may not be the case. </p>
<p>Regardless, I want to try and HIDE the content on that screen for that brief second as the screen builds. Right now my LOCK screen appears but only after that image scales&#x2F;zooms in when the app resumes. My users won&#39;t want that so I&#39;m wondering if its possible to prevent that somehow. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried showing the lock screen on &quot;pause&quot; (after home button is clicked) but I guess we only have a brief second to make that happen as the app goes into background mode. </p>
<p>Anyone have any ideas? </p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Fish</p>

							<p>This issue you are seeing is related to a small bug in the TiPassword example app that I believe you are using, and should now be fixed.</p>

										<p><p>Hey Matt. Thanks for the response… and for the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator-titans&#x2F;TiPassword">TiPassword</a> lock script. </p>
<p>I tried the latest example project you have and still see the RED or BLUE screen as the lock screen builds on resume. I tried removing the modal transition and having the window just open(), but there is a brief second that users can see the screen that was present on pause of the app. That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to prevent, if possible. I don&#39;t think its an issue with your script but rather a limitation of the framework. Still playing around with it though. </p>
<p>Thanks for the response. I&#39;ll post back my findings.</p>
