			<h1>XMLHTTPRequest Library</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey all,</p>
<p>I made myself a nice library to make HTTPClients much easier to use. It takes way fewer lines of code to get a request up and running. It only uses one instance of a HTTPClient, so it queues the requests in the order that they come in and executes them when the recourses become available. This way, multiple requests don&#39;t run each other over. It also keeps track of when it is initialized, so its init() function can be called multiple times without harm. It also includes a little helper function that takes an associative array and parses it into url parameters.</p>
<p>Take a look here: </p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-string">https:</span><span class="hljs-comment">//github.com/justimagin/XMLHTTPRequest-Library</span>
</code></pre><p>Any suggestions or comments are welcome. I&#39;ve only tested this on ios, but there is no platform specific code. If anyone could confirm it working on Android, that would be great.</p>

							<div><p>looks interesting, do you have code to show example usage?</p>
<p>i&#39;ve written a library as well which is a little bit hard-wired for my own app, but it is a similar function that actually caches the results in a local sqlite database and when you call it, the onload fires twice - once when the local cache is returned and then a 2nd time when the live server data is returned.  it is really useful for increasing the responsiveness of an app and make it usable offline.  The UI doesn&#39;t even have to know when it is dealing with online&#x2F;offline data.  maybe it could be something to integrate into your lib?</p>
