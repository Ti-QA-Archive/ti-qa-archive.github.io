			<h1>News on Ti.Next?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve been searching for months for any indication of a potential release date on Ti.Next, with no concrete answers other than &quot;soon&quot;, or &quot;eventually&quot;</p>
<p>Over the past 6 months, I&#39;ve had a few big projects where Titanium has come to the forefront as a likely candidate for the platform of choice and the key question is always &quot;What platforms are supported?&quot;, and the answer is always &quot;And they&#39;ll be supporting Windows native… sometime… hopefully before the project is done&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also been pretty anxious about the support for the long awaited Bluetooth 4.0, which was apparently held off until Ti.Next</p>
<p>Does anyone have any news on this? What is it with all the secrecy?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Concrete information on timings is difficult due to the complexity of the work involved.  However there has been lots of information shared about Ti.Next with Jeff Haynie providing public updates every once in a while.</p>
<p>You can already start playing with the Hyperloop (Ti.Next is where things are going - hyperloop is the new engine - not perfect example but close) compilers as they are currently in early beta;</p>

</ul>
<p>There is no secrecy, very large project, very ambitious goals (achievable though).</p>

										<p><p>Previous Window support for Titanium has not worked out as well as hoped as far I know.</p>
<p>Whilst there were ambitions to add support during 2013 and then Q1-Q2 2014 - the task has not been as simple as hoped, partly (guessing some of this) distinct differences on some core navigational elements and beyond.</p>
<p>However given the new way of thinking about the core engine (which is hyperloop) and how it can now work with SDK APIs much more easily - logically including it into the HL is the smartest plan.</p>
<p>As I guess you know currently each platform supported has 90% unique and 10% shared effort to include it.  HL turns that on its head to more like 95% shared and 5% unique effort.  Thus adding platforms &#39;should&#39; be much easier.</p>
<p>Obviously the transition will take the existing platforms first and then the new ones.  Windows being a new one.  But as you can see the beta allows you to build Windows Mobile apps AND windows metro style apps.</p>
<p>It is also hoped that the iOS version will allow desktop apps in the future as well.</p>

										<p><p>As to what to tell clients; this is what I say;</p>
<p>  <em>&quot;We support iOS and Android right now as they are the two major platforms.  We are experimenting with Windows Mobile but we will not be giving out firm information on what support we will be offering with Windows until the latter part of this year.&quot;</em></p>

										<p><p>Great answer, as always, Malcolm</p>
<p>I have to admit I am a little worried. Mid-2013, their target date seemed to be end of Q4 2013, then there was a shift to end of Q2 2014, and now there is… soon (no specific date)</p>
<p>A strong supporter and dare I say evangelist of Titanium, I am worried it is becoming increasingly difficult task to sell my clients as W8 mobile increases in popularity</p>
<p>I guess I would be elated with more frequent announcements and perhaps a somewhat more than tentative commitment to a date, whichever it may be</p>

										<p><p>You are welcome.</p>
<p>Keep in mind you can now go and create some apps using the win mobile beta version right now as well as the others.  You have to keep i mind though that those betas use ONLY HL code and do not yet have the Titanium API wrapper as well.  But that is coming.  </p>
<p>The take away here should be that had Appcelerator had originally delivered the Win Phone support then it would be Win Phone 7 based and Win Phone 8 is not compatible with Win Phone 7.</p>
<p>But the best thing about waiting it out is when this does all come together you get everything you have now, plus extra platform support but most importantly for those who want more - you can go beyond the Ti API and build OS specific functionality not available in the Ti API.</p>
<p>I forgot to mention earlier there are a number of BlueTooth modules already out there including Beacon BLE specific ones.</p>

										<p><p>Malcolm,</p>
<p>I&#39;m looking into Jeff Haynie&#39;s most recent presentation on Hyperloop and, if possible, I&#39;d like to pick your brain a bit.</p>
<p>It seems Hyperloop is a significant departure from Ti&#39;s current approach. From what I&#39;m gathering, they&#39;re going back to a JavaScript-to-native conversion, rather than a JavaScript Runtime&#x2F;Bridge&#x2F;Native approach.</p>
<p>I have been very fond of the current JavaScript runtime since it supports all the features of the JavaScript language (closures, anonymous functions, etc), and there is no guess-work as far as how my code is going to be translated.</p>
<p>I am also gathering that one of Hyperloop&#39;s goal is to drastically reduce the app size (I&#39;m guessing the removal of the JS runtime has a lot to do with that).</p>
<p>Am I completely misinterpreting these slides?</p>
<p>On another note, I like the different development options they present:</p>
<ul>
<li>Native in Titanium</li>
<li>Titanium in Native</li>
<li>Titanium in PhoneGap and Xamarin</li>
<li>Pure Native</li>
</ul>
</p>

										<p><p>This is very difficult to explain exactly how these layers work now and will work in the future as I need hands gesticulating all over the place ;-)</p>
<p>In short the words you are saying are close to correct but the meanings are not quite right.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>JavaScript-to-native conversion, rather than a JavaScript Runtime&#x2F;Bridge&#x2F;Native</em></p>
<p>This actually means the bottleneck in the middle is removed - this does not change how your side of things works.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence; You will use Ti 4.0 in almost exactly the same way as you use it right now, same JavaScript, same APIs (some tiny changes where absolutely required).  Things like studio will change; because things get better.</p>
<p>You will not lose any of the things you currently have with the JavaScript you use right now.  You do not have to think ahead to wonder what might happen during translation&#x2F;compiling - this is not anything you will ever be part of.</p>
<p>There are many goals of Hyperloop, app size reduction is one, but not top of the first stage priorities - but average app size will decrease and more so as 4.1, 4.2 etc are rolled out.  </p>
<p>Some of the many goals;</p>
<ul>
<li>Massively reduced amount of platform specific effort required by Appcelerator</li>
<li>Significantly increased core code re-use</li>
<li>Adding new platforms no longer adds another 90% of the time, often around 10% is the hope</li>
<li>App performance - will be much faster</li>
<li>For pros, the ability to use platform specific APIs but with the JavaScript syntax in-line with all other code</li>
</ul>
<p>So in short, when Ti 4.0 comes out your coding life will barely change, same JS, same Ti.  However your apps, will be faster, app size will reduce and more over time.  You will gain new platforms - win phone being one of them.  Also you code beyond Ti and still be in Ti.</p>
