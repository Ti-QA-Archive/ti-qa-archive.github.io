			<h1>Android Errors Only on Deploy</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have been developing and an app for Android.  It runs perfectly on the Android Emulator and runs perfectly when testing on a device.  However this is not the case when deploying the application for the android market.  I have gone through all the steps of generating the certs and building the app for the market, it builds fine.  Before submitting it to market I tried installing it on my device.  The app begins to load and then I get coding errors.</p>
<p>I am not looking for answers to specific coding errors, but rather wondering why the errors would show up only when building for the android market and then running on my device?</p>
<p>Can anyone give me some clues as to why this would happen?</p>
<p>SDK 1.8.1<br>App already deployed for iPhone and works perfectly.</p>

<p>Doctor: Ok, sir, where does it hurt?</p>
<p>Patient: Doctor, I&#39;m not interested in the specific pain, just want to know whats wrong.</p>
<p>How about you give us some clues about the coding errors (gee, they MIGHT be relevant!) and then maybe we can help.</p>

							<div><p>You get anywhere with this?  There are definitely differences between &quot;build for device&quot; and market distribution.  One that I found was that you can&#39;t have a variable and not use it.  </p>
<p>Now I am having another issue with a webView that does a Ti.App.fireEvent.  Works on the device but not once it&#39;s in the market.</p>
