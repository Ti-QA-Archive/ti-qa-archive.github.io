							<p>Hi</p>
<p>If yo mean developing for desktop apps rather than mobile apps - then no - whilst there was support for desktop in early versions of Titanium, the direction focussed on mobile and the desktop dev splintered off to a community project - <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tidesdk.org&#x2F;">tidesdk.org</a>.</p>
<p>There are no current public plans for any form of desktop development, although mobile web development provides a certain level of support but not true desktop support.</p>

										<p><p>@Manuel, I decided to leave that part out as I am concious that it &quot;may&quot; and there is no fixed date and may not even be this year.  But you are correct and may be I should have included it.</p>
<p>But for now and the foreseeable future desktop is not part of the Titanium near future - although that may change - as do all things.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Malcolm,</p>
<p>Thanks for your quick response. </p>
<p>Our client requirement is purely a desktop app, where they want to store the data offline.<br>You were saying that the earlier version of Titanium SDK supported the desktop application development. Can you please let me know the final version that supported the desktop.<br>Also, is it possible to get that older version of SDK to develop the desktop app.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>Ravi</p>

										<p><p>The last version of Titanium that supported desktop is not something you want, it is very old (in version terms) and had very few features.</p>
<p>The splinter to Tidesdk.org (link above) and the link @Stephen gave for TideKit (link above) they are much newer versions with many more features.  The core logic is still based on Titanium so should be familiar but keep in mind the point at which they splintered means that each has gone down their own path - so the code is not going to be cross compatible between Titanium and the splinters.</p>
<p>The versions that would have supported the desktop with Titanium are now simply too old to be able to be run these days as everything else moved on without them - which is why there are so many version upgrades each year - to keep up to date with it all.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Malcolm,</p>
<p>I just gone through the TideSDK API. Looks like the APIs are similar with Titanium. May I know is it purely a open source or any license required for commercial use. </p>
<p>Best Regards,<br>Ravi</p>

										<p><p>Yes, on the home page it explains;</p>
