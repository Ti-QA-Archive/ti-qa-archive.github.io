			<h1>Using WebView similar to the Quora app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi guys - was reading about the Quora App&#39;s use of WebView and would love to get your thoughts on what they mean in certain passages.</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;0B_U6HwUpLkE7ZTIwYzhlOTQtMjE5Ny00YWMwLWFjZTMtYmZkODgwNjcyOTVl&#x2F;edit?hl=en_US</p>
<ol>
<li>Do your own networking</li>
</ol>
<p>I assume this means that all links clicked really just trigger events inside the App which then goes and populates the content back into the WebView?</p>
<ol>
<li>Call out to Cocoa to invoke Native UI</li>
</ol>
<p>Inside the Quora app, when you click a link, it does the Navigation thing of animating everything to the left.  I&#39;m assuming the Webview is triggering something inside the application to do that, and the application is either hiding the first webview and replacing it with a second webview on the right or shifting it over.  Any thoughts on how this would work?</p>
<ol>
<li>Native JS&#x2F;Cocoa bridge</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#39;m guessing evalJS is that they&#39;re talking about here (and a local WebView&#39;s access fire app events inside the application?</p>
<p>Would love to get any feedback&#x2F;thoughts.</p>

<p>Now, more &quot;2c&quot;… :)</p>
<p>While the guy has his point ( just like the guys on phonegap ) I really really don&#39;t suggest you to go that path. For small apps this might be optimal, but for more complex apps the app will go painful to use.<br>The webview is way to slow, and loads a lot of stuff you don&#39;t really need it. Have a look at the FB app -  don&#39;t tell me the guys at FB don&#39;t know to optimize the html&#x2F;css&#x2F;js. Is just slow, and this because it uses one or more webviews.</p>

										<p><p>Sorry what do you mean more &quot;2c&quot;?</p>
<p>You don&#39;t suggest going down the path of using WebView for significant portions of the UI?  What&#39;s the best way to lay out significant amounts of text without constantly using labels etc.</p>

										<p><p>by &quot;More 2c&quot; was trying to say &quot;more on what I think, what opinion I have&quot;, like &quot;my 2c (2 cents)&quot; meaning &quot;my opinion&quot;, nevermind :)</p>
<p>I don&#39;t suggest going with webview in any case (due the performance issues).</p>
<p>The only reason I&#39;d use it would be for big amount if texts that need to be formatted somehow (bold, links etc) due the lack of a native rich text component in both platforms.<br>If you have small text you can use a module from the market place named &quot;styledlabel&quot; that does a good job for small mounts of text.</p>
