			<p>I now get the following errors when trying to run the Kitchen Sink sample:</p>
<p>[ERROR] JDK version &#39;javac&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command,<br>operable program or batch file. detected, but at least 1.6.0 is required<br>[ERROR] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 1</p>
<p>I am running Windows 7 with the latest Titanium SDK 2.1.4.GA, JDK 1.0.7.0_09, Android SDK 2.2 api 8 as well as the latest Android SDK 4.2 API 17.</p>
<p>I have tried running the project with all android sdk&#x2F;api combinations. I have tried cleaning the project. Nothing is working. When I first started I was just getting miles of warnings and errors in the console.</p>
<p>I have seen a thousand people on the internet with the same issue, and all the solutions have not been working (reinstalled latest JDK, tried adding system variables with paths). I am having trouble believing anyone would use a product that can&#39;t run its own sample application. Did anyone test this thing on Windows 7? What the heck is wrong with this thing?</p>

							<p>Hi Dustin,</p>
<p>Were you able to run an Android app before? Are you experiencing this issue just trying to run Kitchen Sink or any app?</p>
<p>From a first glance it seems you might have issues with your Android PATH and&#x2F;or the JAVA_HOME.<br>Here is another similar Q&amp;A post you might find useful: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;144906&#x2F;editing-javahome-under-systems-advance-settings-still-getting-errors</p>
<p>If you need, those are the guides for installing Android SDK under Windows: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Installing_and_Updating_Android_SDK-section-29004851_InstallingandUpdatingAndroidSDK-Windows (you need the Oracle JDK to install Android SDK: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Installing_Oracle_JDK )</p>
