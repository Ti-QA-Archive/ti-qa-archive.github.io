			<h1>Returning model instance on Backbone save</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am successfully creating a model and persisting it to my remote API using <code>model.save();</code>. I want to keep this instance of this model and proceed with further edits (like a multi-step form), so I need to hang on to the JSON object that is returned by my server. I have implemented a REST sync adapter similar to the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator-developer-relations&#x2F;BookClient">BookClient example</a>. By reading the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;backbonejs.org&#x2F;#Model-save">Backbone documentation for the save method</a>, it appears that I should pass in <code>success</code> and <code>error</code> callbacks as options when I call <code>model.save()</code> and retrieve the new object from the response. Is this the appropriate way to achieve this?</p>

							<div><p>I found <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;viezel&#x2F;napp.alloy.adapter.restapi">this other REST adapter</a>, which I like much better than the BookClient example. This sync file handles retrieving the ID attribute from the response, which is the main thing that I needed from the response. Other attributes are available, but are nested under model.attributes. This response is also asynchronous, so I still have to retrieve the new model from the <code>success</code> callback in the <code>save()</code> method. Any other way to go about this?</p>

							<div><p>I don&#39;t understand why you need to &quot;hold on&quot; to a JSON object returned by the server. If you have a model and it is persisting to your remote storage, why can&#39;t you just continue to make edits to that model using the <code>set()</code> and then just <code>save()</code> again when you need to persist the changes? I must be missing something because it doesn&#39;t really seem like the success and error handlers are necessary.</p>

							<div><p>Thanks Tony. Forgive me, I am new to Backbone.</p>
<p>When I call save on a new model from the client, it has not yet been given an ID by the server. If I proceed with edits before waiting on the xhr response, will it know that this is the same model? Does that depend on the fact that the xhr responds successfully before I save an edit? I understand that Backbone is just updating the same model in memory, but I was expecting the server to create a duplicate on save if no ID was included.</p>
