							<p>You&#39;ll probably want to use a passive mode, for which you&#39;ll need two sockets. Example:</p>
<p>First Socket:<br>USER {username},<br>PASS {password},<br>TYPE I,<br>PASV,<br>STOR myfile.ext</p>
<p>That should then give you the details for a new connection (you&#39;ll have to parse them yourself). Use the details to connect a new socket, then send the file as binary data over the socket (you can read straight from a FileStream).</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m afraid not. First try sending the USER command with the username. It should send back a password request in plain text. If it doesn&#39;t then it is likely something is wrong with the part of your code that forms the connection.</p>

							<p>You need to get a better understanding of how FTP works.  The socket you are doing now is just for the &quot;control&quot; connection.  This is used to send commands such as the login plus things which affect your connections like a change of directory.  It is also used to send the command to start a file transfer in either direction.  But the actual data transfer does NOT flow on that socket.</p>
<p>Everything you need to know to implement this is beyond the scope of a Q&amp;A reply, so I suggest you do a web search on FTP protocol and read up on how it really works.  One site that gives a less technical description but which may be easy to follow is <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncftp.com&#x2F;libncftp&#x2F;doc&#x2F;ftp_overview.html">here</a>.</p>

										<p><p>I think he&#39;s saying that the TYPE I and PASV commands on the original socket aren&#39;t returning any data (which they should), and so he never reaches the point at which the second socket needs to be opened with the details provided by PASV (i.e. following the STOR command).</p>

										<p><p>My take was that he was trying to send those three commands (Type&#x2F;Pasv&#x2F;Stor) as written without parsing the response.  But re-reading it, maybe you are right.</p>
<p>Ahh, I see the problem.  He is not terminating the commands so the FTP server is not responding.</p>
<p>Walter, try this instead:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">socket.<span class="hljs-keyword">write</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'TYPE I\n'</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">event</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">from</span>);
socket.<span class="hljs-keyword">write</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'PASV\n'</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">event</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">from</span>);
socket.<span class="hljs-keyword">write</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'STOR myfile.ext\n'</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">event</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">from</span>);
</code></pre><p>But also note you must look at what the server returns for the PASV command.  This tells you the IP address and port number you need to use to open a new socket for sending the actual file contents.  You do NOT send the file using the socket you already opened.</p>

										<p><p>Glad to hear it!  At least you are on the right road now and making progress again.</p>
<p>Be aware that in some cases, the PASV response can be misleading.  If the server is behind a NAT&#39;d firewall, it may be sending you a local, private IP which is not routable publicly.  So if the FTP server is not on your own local network, you MAY need to ignore the IP values in the PASV and use the same IP as your first socket but the port number from the PASV command.  </p>
<p>Realize too the port number is sent as two octets (ie bytes) which you must convert to a single 16-bit integer port value.  That should be covered in the FTP docs you have been studying.</p>
<p>Doing a proper FTP implementation is not as trivial as you may have assumed.  Fortunately you really don&#39;t have to implement the whole protocol if you are aiming to use only certain features.</p>
<p>Have fun!  :)</p>
<p>And if you get to the point you consider the question answered, marking an answer as correct helps ranking of future Q&amp;A searches by users.</p>

										<p><p>I am familiar with the process because I have coded FTP clients in other languages and platforms.  However, I have never had a need to do it from Titanium, so I don&#39;t have any example code.</p>
<p>If you post your non-working code to pastebin or similar along with a description of where&#x2F;how it fails, some of us may be able to spot what is a possible problem.</p>
<p>If you aren&#39;t using passive mode, I suggest you try that because being behind a firewall can make active mode (the default) fail.</p>

										<p><p>Also note I never said this was a simple task.  On the contrary, I said doing a proper FTP implementation is <em>not</em> trivial.  It may only seem like it should be simple because entering FTP commands or scripting a FTP session in a full FTP client program is simple.  What you don&#39;t see is what the program is doing for you behind the scenes.</p>

							<p>If the task were so simple then example code would not be unnecessary. This task is not simple, nor common. I think you may be confusing the simplicity of the steps involved with the relative complexity of the task itself.</p>
<p>If you have the time and inclination you could attempt to port the node.js FTP client available from the node modules git: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mscdex&#x2F;node-ftp</p>

										<p><p>No, I&#39;m suggesting you port the module itself. It uses Node&#39;s built-in TCP socket and File I&#x2F;O libs. Titanium also has these.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve done this before on other platforms so I know it is possible.</p>
