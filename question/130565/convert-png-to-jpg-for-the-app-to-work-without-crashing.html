		<section>
			<p>Hello</p>
<p>I created a few images as png and whenever I try to use them in my app, my app crashes. However, if I use the same as a jpg it works fine? Any reason why this happens and how can i get around this? I lose transparency if I use jpg images. I read something about 9 patch images but does that mean I have to create all my images as 9 patch for them to show up in my app? I even copied some images from kitchensink to my app directory and my app crashes as usual except if I use jpg.</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<div><p>Ashar,</p>
<p>There was a discussion here someplace about 4 months ago about bad PNGs.  A user experienced what you are describing.  I don&#39;t remember what app he was using to save them.  He made a change and the problem went away.</p>
<p>I use PNGs all the time.  Straight out of photoshops save for web without problems.  The 9-patch is strictly for Android devices to allow for controlled stretching.</p>
<p>Tell us a little bit about your environment.</p>

							<p>I solved this problem by saving my images for the web. you do this in photoshop by going to file and clicking on Save for Web &amp; Devices. Alternatively you can do a control+alt+shift+s. Save the file as a png or you will lose all your transparency.<br>Good Luck!</p>
