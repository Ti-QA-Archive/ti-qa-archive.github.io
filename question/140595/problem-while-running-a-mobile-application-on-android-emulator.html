</ol>
<p>2.Many times the installer time out.</p>
<p>[ERROR] Timed out waiting for emulator to be ready, you may need to close the emulator and try again<br>[ERROR] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 1</p>
<p>3.Some application sample examples  like ToDo List is able to run but many times it stop running in the emulator.</p>
<p>Titanium SDK 2.0.2<br>Android SDK 2.2<br>jdk 6<br>wndow 7 (32 bit)</p>
<p>Also while launching the Titanium Studio, it is asking to login. Is there any way to work offline  without loggin agin n agin.</p>

							<p>For starters update your titanium SDK to 2.1.1 GA or whatever is the latest.</p>
<p>When you want to run it in an Android emulator, by default it chooses the wrong android sdk. Well thats the case for me.</p>
<p>This is however easy to solve,</p>
<ul>
<li>Open your project</li>
<li>Press the play icon with the arrow poiting downwards</li>
<li>A menu pops up &gt; press Run Configurations</li>
<li>Press Titanium Android Emulator or double click</li>
<li>Create a new emulator, give it a name, for instance Your_app_name Android 2.3.3</li>
<li>When creating a new emulator for me the <code>Android API</code> is set on <code>Real3D Add-On Android 2.3.3</code> this does NOT work! You must choose <code>Google&amp;#39;s API 2.3.3 or 2.2</code></li>
<li>When set press <code>Apply</code> and then choose <code>Run</code></li>
</ul>
<p>With this method you can create several emulators to try and see the result in all Android versions and more importantly all android screen resolutions.</p>
<p>For all i know you have to login to develop with titanium studio.</p>

										<p><p>One thing to point out - I&#39;m doing the tutorials right now and I found that you have to create a new run configuration for each project that you want to run in the emulator.  Just FYI!</p>

<li><p>This happens quite often with apps on android, but do note that once the emulator is up and running, it only takes a few seconds to launch your app a second time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Maby you have a wrong version of the kitchensink try getting the latest, import it and let see how that works. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;KitchenSink">Latest kitchensink</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>I am not familiar with this error.</p>

										<p><p>One more thing u can try ,this is to clean and build the project build folder. The error you are getting  while extracting zip file, because that path may not exist in your computer.</p>
