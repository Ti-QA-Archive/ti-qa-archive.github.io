			<h1>Windows or Views Navigation</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi</p>
<p>Developing a app which has a set of buttons in the header that will act as the main navigation.</p>
<p>The way it works now is: app.js opens a new main window that is fullscreen, I then add views for the header logo and buttons.</p>
<p>When you click the first button I open a new window underneath the header.</p>
<p>I now want to be able to click another button on the bar to close the win.</p>
<p>Here is the code: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;1284625</p>
<p>I will eventually set the current window to a global variable so that no matter which button is clicked the current win&#x2F;view will be known.</p>
<p>Should I be using a view instead?</p>

<p>Note that using fullscreen is bad practice in most cases, because it hides the default status bar. Unnecessarily hiding it may get your app marked down in reviews, and possibly rejected from the marketplace(s).</p>

							<div><p>By status bar, I mean <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;yfrog.com&#x2F;f&#x2F;48screenshot099p&#x2F;">this</a>.  Try using navBarHidden: true instead</p>

<p>Just to get this question to its conclusion:</p>
<ol>
<li>I should be using windows.</li>
<li>I should have a &#39;close&#39; event on all windows that closes them and have this event on any &quot;back&quot; buttons I put in myself.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#39;m using fullscreen as the target device will be a tablet and It will be a multimedia presentation so screen real estate is important for me. Possibly a later version will keep the status bar for phone users.</p>

<p>This is what I would do, Kevin.  Use Ti.include() to achieve it.</p>

										<p><p>OK, if this answer has been helpful, then you should close the question. Alternatively, if you still need some help (staying on the topic set in the question) then post your latest code so that someone can suggest something.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
