							<div><p>Hi Seth,</p>
<p>did you manage to make it work on Windows 8</p>
<p>Did you find some secret sauce to solve this dreaded &quot;No Android SDKs were found under the specified SDK location&quot; error?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<div><p>Yes. I did. The problem was that the SDK i was trying to use was downloaded from the Android website. You can&#39;t use any android SDK. You have to use the  SDK manager provided by Appcelerator to download and install the SDK. If that doesn&#39;t make sense, let me know.</p>
