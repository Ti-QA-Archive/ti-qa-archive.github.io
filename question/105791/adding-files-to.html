		<section>
			<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Is it possible to add files to &quot;Titanium.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory&quot; before building the App?</p>
<p>I wan&#39;t to have a dynamic image folder, which will contain a lot of images which a distributed with the app. But I also need to be able to add more images to the directory later on, when people use the app.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve searched a lot, but can&#39;t find out where to put the images during the build.</p>
<p>Kind Regards<br>Daniel</p>

<p>&quot;Is it possible to add files to Titanium.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory before building the App?&quot;</p>
<p>The short answer: no! ;)</p>
<p>The detailed answer:</p>
<p>You can only add files to <code>applicationDataDirectory</code> at runtime, either by copying them from <code>resourcesDirectory</code> (in which case they will be duplicated on your device) or downloading them from a remote resource.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that each file in the Resources folder at build time obviously increases the size of the app package when it ships, meaning that the app will take longer for the user to download and install. As the files in the Resources folder are stored on a read-only portion of the device (in <code>resourcesDirectory</code>), the storage space that those files consume cannot be recovered until a new version of the app is installed.</p>
<p>It all depends on your circumstances which approach is best. If those initial images are static and will always exist unaltered while the app is installed on a device, then it&#39;s probably ok to ship them with the app. In particular, this is appropriate for your application UI assets or default skin.</p>
<p>If those images change during the life of the application on a user&#39;s device, then it&#39;s probably best to download them on first launch after install.</p>

							<p>No, during the build you can only place files in the Resources folder or its children.  On the device, these folders will be read-only.  You have two choices:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>When the app starts, check applicationDataDirectory to see if it contains any image and if not, copy the files from Resources to applicationDataDirectory.  Dynamic images would get added to the same spot, and all images served from the single folder.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Only put the dynamic images in applicationDataDirectory, and just load the static images from Resources.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The kitchen sink <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;KitchenSink&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;KitchenSink&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;examples&#x2F;filesystem.js">filesystem</a> example shows how you can check a folder contents and perform basic file operations.  If you need more help for how to do either of the above, let us know and we can be more specific.</p>
