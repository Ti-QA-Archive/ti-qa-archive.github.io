			<h1>Automatic push notification on event</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,<br>I&#39;m going to develop an app which need to <strong>automatically send push notification when conditions are satisfied</strong>. I like to know if it could be possible to run a routine in ACS or if I have to setup my own backend (With Django for example).</p>
<p><strong>Here is a case</strong>:<br>In my app, there is a form for user. When they fill this form they are saying : &quot;I&#39;ll be in this place between 8 PM to 10 PM&quot;. Of course they have choose the place in a limited list of predefined places. I like a push notification to be send when at leat 4 users have said they will be there at the right time.</p>
<p>I like to do the same when users have Check-in using acs check-in tangram.</p>
<p>Then I need to setup a routine which count etc …. and then decide to send a push notification.</p>
<p><strong>I like to know which kind of &quot;architecture&quot; I have to setup to accomplish this task. Only use of ACS or setup a third party webserver ?</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>(I apologize for my english - Feel free to ask any question if my explanations are not enough clear).</p>

							<p>Short answer, <strong>you will have to develop your own thing</strong>.<br>ACS does not provide any Business Rules Management tools in order to determine when to send a push notification or not. You will have to setup your won server (it could be using any tech inside or any language it doesn&#39;t matter.)</p>
<p>Your server will then be able to determine when to send push notifications and, from there, your server can contact the ACS servers using REST calls. (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.appcelerator.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;api&#x2F;v1&#x2F;push_notifications&#x2F;notify">here is an example</a> on how to send a notification using REST)</p>
