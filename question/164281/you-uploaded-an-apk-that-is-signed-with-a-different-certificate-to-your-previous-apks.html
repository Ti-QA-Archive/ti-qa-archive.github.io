							<p>Hello James,</p>
<p>Please make sure you are using same android keystore file when you generate new Android APK. </p>
<p>I hope it should work if you use same android keystore then.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>Ok, so the answer was that I wasn&#39;t using the correct keystore to sign it (Just like it said)  But the problem was that the first original keystore was signed with java 7 and therefore invalid. I am now in the process of creating a brand new app in Google Play and uploading the j6 apk.<br>Thanks for the help.</p>

										<p><p>HI Rama, </p>
<p>Sorry to say, NO options available to upload your apps. You need to upload your apps with new app key.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
