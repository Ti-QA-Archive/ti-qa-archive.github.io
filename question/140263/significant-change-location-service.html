			<h1>Significant-Change Location Service</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>So my app was rejected by Apple for trying to use the background location setting (in info.plist).  They recommended using the Significant-Change Location Service - is this available with Ti?</p>
<p>As a side note - my app has had the background location setting for many versions and was never rejected - so now I&#39;m stuck with functionality that users have already paid for being rejected and if I cant use Significant-Change Location Service with Ti I&#39;m going to be stuck.</p>

							<div><p>It&#39;s really annoying, I know your feeling.. in the past I had app got approved, then reject after a &quot;further look&quot;.. or after 20 updates, receiving an email saying that there was something missing..</p>
<p>Did you point that out to them?</p>

							<div><p>I just had the EXACT same problem.  Got in touch with someone on the review board and they said that UIBackgroundModes is really only allowed for apps that involve turn-by-turn navigation.  Can someone from Appcelerator please respond?</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;m stuck here… my options seem to be:</p>
<p>a) Remove features that thousands of users have paid for already.<br>b) Stop upgrading my app.<br>c) Completely change my applications architecture (e.g. not use Appcelerator)<br>d) Try to build some type of module to allow support for the Change Location service.</p>
<p>All of these options STINK!</p>

							<div><p>I took the .plist value out and re-submitted, still waiting to hear back from Apple. This sucks because without that value the background location drops out after 20 minutes or so. I&#39;m watching the TIMOB-10041 now, really hoping Appcelerator addresses this ASAP.</p>

							<p>Hi frank, you can go ahead with Module development to get this functionality, or can look for the code implemented at this <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;benbahrenburg&#x2F;benCoding.BasicGeo">link</a>.</p>
