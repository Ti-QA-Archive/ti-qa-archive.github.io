			<h1>Webview override loading new page display</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>How on a webview do I make it so when I&#39;m currently going to a new URL, the webview doesn&#39;t stop displaying the page?</p>
<p>Basically on iOS when I go to a new URL, my entire web view goes white (this doesn&#39;t happen on Android), which causes stuff that I want to be seen at all times like my navbar and footer on the page to disappear until the new page loads.</p>
<p>Is there a way I can make it so when I go to a new URL, it doesn&#39;t get rid of the content in the webview until the new content&#x2F;URL is loaded?</p>
<p>Another reason for this is so when I go to a new page, it may take a while so I was thinking of showing an indicator that a new page is loading while still showing the previous content.</p>

							<p>My first inclination would be to tell you to make your navbar and footer be Titanium Views instead of part of the web page.</p>
<p>If you really can&#39;t do that, you may have to employ some serious hacks to pull this off.  </p>
<p>You could use two webviews – when the user clicks in the first webview, listen the <code>beforeload</code> event and then call <code>webview.stopLoading()</code>.  Use the url you receive in the <code>beforeload</code> event to load the next page into a second, hidden webview (a webview that either is not added to the parent view, or is added, but has <code>visible</code> set to false).  Once you get the <code>onload</code> event from the second webview, make it visible, and hide or destroy the first one.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t tried this exact scenario, so it&#39;s possible that you might get the <code>onload</code> event before everything is rendered, which would still lead to a flash of white.</p>
<p>It would be quite tricky to manage multiple webviews like this, especially if you want to provide forward&#x2F;back navigation.  I would only use a technique like this as a last resort.</p>

										<p><p>Well I did have a custom view before for the navbar and footer, however there is some data from the remote webpage I need to be displayed on it.</p>
<p>I tried using evalJS but it only works on an Android Webview. On an iOS webview evalJS unfortunately does not work:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable">$.</span>webview.evalJS(<span class="hljs-string">"document"</span>);
</code></pre><p>Prints out as an object in android, prints out nothing on iOS, so I can&#39;t get any data from my remote webpage to be displayed on these views so I just made the navbar and footer in the webpage itself rather than in titanium.</p>
<p>Though this evalJS is a separate issue so I may have to ask another question related to it.</p>

										<p><p>evalJS() works just fine on both platforms.  But you can&#39;t pass objects across that boundary.  You can pass strings.  Of course, you could pass a serialized object, but you can&#39;t serialize the document object, nor would that be a good idea if you could.</p>
<p>Ideally, you would have a function in the remote web page that would get the information you need and pass it back to you as a simple string.  You would put that function into the document&#39;s javascript via your server side code.  Then in Titanium, you would use evalJS() to call that function.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can do some pretty elaborate things in your evalJS() code.</p>
<p>In this example, <code>_wv</code> is a webview.  I&#39;m getting the text of the first &lt;h1&gt; tag:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var h1text = _wv.evalJS("document.getElementsByTagName('h1')[<span class="hljs-link_label">0</span>][<span class="hljs-link_reference">'textContent'</span>];");
</code></pre></p>

										<p><p>The weird thing is on Android I was actually able to get the document object back.<br>Just not on iOS.</p>
<p>Anyways yes passing strings is the way to go. Thanks!</p>
