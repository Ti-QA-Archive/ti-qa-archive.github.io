			<h1>Stalled- cannot run Hello World after installation</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve installed Titanium along with the Android SDK. I&#39;ve created the Hello World app as per the quickstart guide. However, I&#39;m unable to run the app:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-string">'Launching Titanium Android Device - Hello'</span> has encountered <span class="hljs-tag">a</span> problem.

There are no Android devices connected
</code></pre><p>Indeed, the &#39;Titanium Android Device - Hello&#39; settings in <strong>Run Configurations</strong> lists no Devices in the dropdown.</p>
<hr>
<p>A lot of old (&gt;3 years) threads pointed to the problem being the java configuration; and it looks to be the case… </p>
<p>Despite <code>JAVA_HOME</code> pointing to <em>C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_45</em>, when I launch a diagnostic test, the log says <em>JRE Home: D:\Program Files\Java\jre7</em></p>
<p>Note that my <code>PATH</code> only includes the <em>jdk1.6.0_45\bin</em> directory and contains no reference to the previously installed (and required) jre.</p>
<p>Is there another setting I am missing, within Titanium or Java?</p>

							<div><p>Even after uninstalling the JRE (at which point Titanium now points to the 32-bit v1.6 install), no devices are displayed in Run Configurations. So, while I still don&#39;t have an answer as to why JAVA_HOME is not redirecting properly, I also still don&#39;t have a functioning emulator.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Stop using the android emulators - they are just bad. Use the GenyMotion emulator instead it is VERY fast, very easy - and you will not think about self harm.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Seriously everybody does this now.</p>

										<p><p>I fear that the fact that Titanium is pointing to the wrong JRE installation will lead to a whole host of other problems that circumventing the emulator issue will not solve.</p>

										<p><p>My question is; &quot;If your problem appears to be Emulator based - and a much better solution exists - why are you not trying it?&quot;</p>
<p>If you have Java version 7 installed uninstall it.  Deal with the thing you know is a problem first.  BTW this is not circumventing problems - this changes up your emulators, think of it as going from a rust bucket to a decent car.</p>

										<p><p>I appreciate the guidance on using Genymotion. However, my issue is more fundamental. I would like to know why no devices are present on a clean installation and how to make Titanium select the correct JRE. This question is not about what the best emulator is.</p>
