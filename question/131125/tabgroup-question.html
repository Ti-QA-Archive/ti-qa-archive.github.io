			<h1>Tabgroup Question</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a question for tabs that I need for iPhone but will also need an android solution later on. </p>
<p>Right now my structure is<br>Tab &gt; opens main window</p>
<p>Action in window &gt; opens sub window (which has a back button at the top that the tab group creates)</p>
<p>An action in this window &gt; opens another sub window but this one is not in the tab group. It shows up onto of the current window.</p>
<p>Right now when this window that is open onto is done doing what it needs to it closes and shows the sub window that opened it.</p>
<p>My question is how do i with code fire the back button or bring it back the the main window.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>fire and event to the parent window in the tabGroup. that event handler will have access to the currentTab and the tabGroup so you can set the currentTab back to the first one.</p>

							<p>To close a child window, just do:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">Ti</span><span class="hljs-class">.UI</span><span class="hljs-class">.currentWindow</span><span class="hljs-class">.close</span>();
</code></pre><p>It will then focus the window behind it.</p>

										<p><p>That would not work because It is running from the third window so it would close that since it is the current window. I have it closing the current window but i also need it to close the second window at the same time. I figured out a workaround though I&#39;m not sure its the best option.</p>
<p>In the function for the second window i created an app event that closes that window. In my third window i close it and fire the app even which closes window 2.</p>
<p>It seems to be working but if there is a better option i would like to know.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help</p>

										<p><p>What I generally do is have a class dedicated to navigation. When I open a window, I call a function within this to not just open the new window, but also to store it in an array (of windows). Then you can have a closeAllChildren function, which loops through the array and closes all of the windows in there (except the top level one.)</p>

							<p>Hi Chris</p>
<p>Try the custom Events, when you close the subwindow fire the custom event whose listener is set at the parent window and in the listener you can set the close code for the parent window which directly shows the main window with the tab.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Nikunj</p>

										<p><p>Hi Aaron</p>
<p>yeah its the same just the way of describing is little different, i found that you haven&#39;t mentioned it as custom event so i tried to add that and with some detail explanation. </p>
<p>But the solution is the same.. </p>
<p>Cheers @Aaron</p>
<p>Regards</p>

										<p><p>ken, i think you might have something there… but honestly it is just too difficult to follow and make sense of what is right and wrong with the code you posted.</p>
<p>Plus i dont think he can just do what you have suggested without completely re- architecting his application</p>
