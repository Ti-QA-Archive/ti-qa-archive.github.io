			<p>So, I installed the version I was told when I first installed Titanium on my Mac. If I want to put&#x2F;test my app on iOS 6, is the only thing we have to do is register the device and upgrade to the latest xcode?</p>

							<p>Since we don&#39;t know when you first installed Titanium on your Mac, no one can really answer that question accurately. Some basic apps already in the App Store work without issue on the new iOS 6 despite being built with an older Titanium SDK and&#x2F;or iOS sdk.</p>
<p>You will require Titanium Mobile SDK 2.1.3 or greater at minimal + the version of xCode (4.5+) that supports iOS 6.0 from this point forward</p>
<p>Additionally, you will require a Default-586@2x.png splash screen so that your app will not display &#39;letterboxed&#39; on the new iPhone 5.</p>
<p>In the future:</p>
<p>I suggest you take a look at the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Using+Questions+and+Answers">Using Questions and Answers</a> article, specifically the Q&amp;A Question Checklist.  The missing information is critical to reproducing problems in a test environment and often indicates other factors that cause the undesirable outcome you are experiencing.</p>

										<p><p>You answered exactly what I needed. My apologies for not including my sdk&#x2F;number etc. I just downloaded it on my mac two weeks ago, but when I try and deploy it to a iOS6 device, it says that my xcode doesn&#39;t support it. Since Titanium tells you to download an earlier version, I wasn&#39;t sure if it would be compatible anymore with older devices.</p>
