			<h1>Ti.Android is undefined after upgrade</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I just upgraded from an older version of Titanium Developer to Titanium Studio and the current SDK. I am getting errors attempting to initialize theAndroid options menu on a project that was created some time ago (which worked flawlessly previously). The error is:</p>
<p>  TypeError: Cannot read property &quot;currentActivity&quot; from undefined</p>
<p>which is thrown from:</p>
<p>  var activity = Ti.Android.currentActivity;</p>
<p>which looks OK to me. I have tried various suggestions via google and other syntax variations to get this to work, but no joy, including adding a &#39;fullscreen:false&#39; to createWindow which seems a popular solution.</p>
<p>Is there a tutorial on how this is supposed to work?</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the help. Been there, done that a number of times now. No joy. </p>
<p>In fact, I changed my code that was generating the error and despite manually cleaning the build folder and running the Project &gt; Clean thing, and rebuilding, the error message was still reflecting the old code! ARGGGG!</p>
<p>I think killing the emulator&#x2F;restarting solved that. Despite all that, I am still stuck with Ti.Android is undefined, and am not 100% convinced that there is still is not something caching old&#x2F;bad stuff (like a previous sdk). I don&#39;t know where else to go, but for the time being I can develop Android on Linux and iPhone on Mac, which seems a tad loopy. </p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

							<p>Thanks for the answer. No, and that sounds like a reasonable suggestion. If that option is somewhere in the TS interface, I really don&#39;t see it. (I am still struggling with finding things in TS, including the Help stuff!)</p>
<p>I did try removing the stuff in android&#x2F;bin&#x2F;* manually, and rebuilding, but that didn&#39;t change anything for me. </p>
<p>Thanks, again.</p>

							<p>This is on OSX if that should make a difference. Previous builds were on Linux. Having Ti.Android undefined seems like it could be potentially a show stopper.</p>

							<p>It does indeed seem to make a difference. After hours of head banging, and just for sh1ts and grins, I downloaded a fresh copy of TS on a Linux system, and ran the exact same code, with the same config options, and it just &#x2F;&#x2F;works&#x2F;&#x2F;. I wonder if SDK versions might be radically different. How to tell that on OSX? It bombs out trying to do an auto-update.</p>
