							<p>Not really an answer - more an opinion based on having sold solutions that behave in the same way.</p>
<p>Virtual page turning is a skeuomorphic technique that ends up slowing down the user rather than letting them quickly move from page to page.  If your book will have a design that allows for variable text size (recommended) then the concept of an actual page is eroded anyway.</p>
<p>The average touch device user is comfortable with pages of information sliding from side into the screen, the animations are faster and the &#39;hit points&#39; are easier to use, plus it makes it easier for visually impaired users to enjoy your material (provided the pages are not simply images).</p>
<p>I am not suggesting you abandon the page turn animation approach, just decide if the animation is worth the potential negatives.</p>
<p>BTW Have you seen that Apple now owns a patent on the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;11&#x2F;19&#x2F;3659382&#x2F;apple-design-patent-on-virtual-page-turn">virtual page turn</a>?  Unlikely to cause you to and legal issues - but worth noting.</p>

							<p>Hi Don, there is not built in support from titanium like provided in native Xcode project, but the same effect can be done with the help of a native module.<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.1&#x2F;index.html#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;iOS_Module_Development_Guide">check this link for native module</a>.</p>

							<p>Malcolm Hollingsworth, in App Store many apps with page turning animation.<br>Ashish Nigam, I was hoping that there is already a ready means, but if not you can try to write your own.</p>

										<p><p>I know there are, including iBooks from Apple themselves.  There are many fart apps as well, but that does not mean they are a good thing :)</p>
<p>My comment was not designed to suggest you are wrong, just consider the audience before the cool animation.  Again I say this having sold solutions (web based) that use virtual page turning so I know there are times when they work well and times where they hinder.</p>
<p>There are many people out there who are rebelling <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fastcodesign.com&#x2F;1670760&#x2F;will-apples-tacky-software-design-philosophy-cause-a-revolt">against skeuomorphic design</a>.  Also many for it - including Steve Jobs before he passed away.</p>
<p>There are a couple of choices in the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;listing?349301606&amp;q=page+turn#!&#x2F;list&#x2F;page&#x2F;1">Appcelerator Market Place</a> so you can get started straight away.</p>
<p>It is your choice which way you go - was just a comment.</p>
