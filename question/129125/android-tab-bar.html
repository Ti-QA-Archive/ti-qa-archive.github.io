			<h1>Android Tab Bar</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have an app – one that I&#39;m trying to make cross-platform – whose core construct is a tab group with a single tab. It&#39;s built this way so that I get the nav bar with &quot;back&quot; navigation on the iPhone. On my home screen, though, I want to hide the nav bar since it has nothing to offer on that particular screen. To do all of this, I&#39;m setting the <code>tabBarHidden</code> and <code>navBarHidden</code> properties to true.</p>
<p>As seems to be the universal case thusfar in my short Titanium development experience, this works great on iPhone, but bombs on Android. The tab bar doesn&#39;t hide. I now have a lovely grey bar, maybe 100px tall at the top of my screen. I&#39;ve seen indicators that somehow the tab group&#x2F;bar isn&#39;t a native Android construct, but nothing that really helps me work out how to hide it on this one screen of my app.</p>
<p>Any answers out there?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>Don&#39;t forget to put the <code>fullscreen</code> property to <code>true</code>, this usually does the trick. (It did for me at least)</p>

										<p><p>But this isn&#39;t a modal window. This is just the main window for my app. Does that make a difference? Everywhere I&#39;ve seen a reference to the <code>fullscreen</code> property, it&#39;s been in the context of modality.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, even though it&#39;s not a modal window. Setting it to <code>true</code> will show the window content full screen. This will not affect your navigation if that&#39;s what you are afraid of.</p>

										<p><p>And, for whatever it&#39;s worth, adding that property didn&#39;t work from either the object definition or from later assignment.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m sorry if I gave you the wrong answer previously, but I tried so many thing to get this thing working. that I lost track.</p>
<p>I re-checked my code and I managed to get around the problem by directly opening the window when I&#39;m on Android.</p>

										<p><p>Okay, that&#39;s the direction I was heading, but it does sort of torque me a little that the basic application architecture has to be manipulated for cross-platform viability. I was hoping that wouldn&#39;t be the case. Thanks for your help.</p>
