			<p>I am currently working on two iPhone projects in Titanium. Both work perfectly in the simulator.  One of them goes all the way through the Install to iOS Device step and generates an IPA which I am able to distribute and test on my iPhone.  The other one keeps failing with the message</p>

</code></pre><p>I double checked the provisioning profile for that app and even tried it with the profile for my other app which IS working.  No joy, always the same error.  I would be most grateful to anyone who could shed a light on what is going on here. </p>
<p> I should mention that I am working with XCode 4.3.2 Ti Studio build 2.01.201204132053 which turns up as Titanium SDK 2.0.1.GA2 in the build box.  I am working on OS X 10.7.3.</p>

							<p>Hmmm… I had already tried cleaning the app from within Ti several times.  For good measure I went and took out the build directory manually - still no joy.  The two apps - the one that goes all the way to the IPA and the one that does not - are very similar apart from the fact that the latter uses a WebView.  I thought there might be an issue there so I commented out the webview bits and tested again - still exactly the same result.  Very frustrating… . Anyone out there have any ideas what might be going wrong?</p>

										<p><p>After much effort I finally narrowed down the source of the problem.  It turns out that one or both bits of JavaScript I had used in my html file, in the webview, were not to Titanium&#39;s liking.</p>
<p>To put this into context - I found myself obliged to use a WebView to show a map since I need the full power of Google&#39;s infobox annotations which is quite simply not available in Titanium maps.</p>
<p>The First:, the jQuery ver 1.71, minimized.  Given that I was only using jQuery evaluate some JSON and to grab a few DOM elements I simply replaced the JSON parsing with an eval statement (my data are safe) and did the DOM element grab the old fashioned way (getDocumentElement)</p>
<p>The Second:I was using jscoord.js from, http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jstott.me.uk&#x2F;jscoord&#x2F;, to convert latitude&#x2F;longitude values to UTM coordinates.  I simply worked around the need to do this inside the webview.</p>
<p>Result - the IPA now builds!  It is interesting to note that simply having those two js files in a subfolder in the project, i.e. merely commenting out the webview bit did not help.</p>
