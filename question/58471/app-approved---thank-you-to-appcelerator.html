		<section>
			<p>Just wanted to give a big thanks to Appcelerator for making this product available.</p>
<p>My first app has been approved and is in the App Store now. It uses background audio, has lots of streaming video and a lot more.</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunes.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;ejt-music&#x2F;id388917762?mt=8</p>
<p>A word of note - as someone else noted in the Q&amp;A, be careful of how you set UIBackgroundModes in your Info.plist. I had mine set for Audio and Location. I incorrectly thought that because I was getting the user&#39;s location I had to set Location. This isn&#39;t true. I realized after that you only set this if you need the user&#39;s location when the app isn&#39;t active in the foreground. This may be obvious to some, but to me it wasn&#39;t at first.</p>
<p>My first submission was rejected because of this so I resubmitted, waited the 5 days to get into review and then another 1&#x2F;2 day to get approved.</p>

							<div><p>Very nice app!  I was very surprised to see streaming audio in the background, or at least when the phone goes into sleep mode, as I haven&#39;t been able to figure this out for many weeks.  I even signed up for pro support, and have not been able to figure out how to have streaming audio when:</p>
<p>1) The phone is asleep<br>2) The app is in the background</p>
<p>Can you please share the settings you used to get the audio to stream when asleep?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

							<p>Peter - you need to set…</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Ti.Media.defaultAudioSessionMode = Ti.Media.AUDIO_SESSION_MODE_PLAYBACK<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>Also, in your Info.plist make sure you add audio to the UIBackgroundModes section. There&#39;s plenty of info about in the Q&amp;A and elsewhere on the web if you&#39;re unsure exactly how to do that.</p>

										<p><p>Eric,<br>Thanks so much for your willingness to help.  I have honestly been told by Pro support that streaming audio in the background is not yet supported, so I&#39;m very excited to see how you got it to work..</p>
<p>In my testing so far, I&#39;ve been able to get background audio, but only using Titanium.Media.Sound, which does not stream the audio, but instead downloads the entire audio file, then plays it.</p>
<p>So, I would be SO grateful if you can simply share the basic syntax you used.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s what I have tried after your suggestion, which is not working, even with the info.plist change:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Ti.Media.defaultAudioSessionMode = Ti.Media.AUDIO_SESSION_MODE_PLAYBACK<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

var streamer = Ti.Media.createAudioPlayer({allowBackground:true, audioSessionMode:Titanium.Media.AUDIO_SESSION_MODE_PLAYBACK})<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
streamer.url = 'PATH TO MY MP3'<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
streamer.start()<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>Of course, that is simplified, as the streamer.start is in a click event, the url is pulled from json, etc., but if you could share the basic syntax like this for what worked for you, I&#39;d be SO grateful.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

										<p><p>Peter - are you trying this in the simulator or on an actual device that supports BG audio? BG audio won&#39;t work in the simulator. It will work on a device.</p>
<p>Not sure why Appcelerator says they don&#39;t support it when it works fine - except for the part that you can&#39;t control the audio from the iPod controls. Maybe that&#39;s for the next release.</p>

							<p>Awesome job, looks pretty cool. I like how you used background streaming but the pause and play button don&#39;t work with the ipod control. Is this something for yourself or did you do this app for the singer?</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s right. It is I. It&#39;s to give me another way to promote my shows, music, etc. If I&#39;m playing a gig, I can tell people in the audience who have an iPhone to go and just download the app and they immediately get a whole bunch of free content with the option to purchase if they want an offline copy.</p>

							<p>Good job.. downloaded and I&#39;m impressed. I&#39;d love to have this app as a template to do my own but I know that would be asking for too much.. :)</p>
<p>Interesting how Apple allowed you to have the Buy Direct feature to by-pass their in-app model. What happens after someone checks out through PayPal, how to do they get the audio to the phone?</p>

										<p><p>ZK - Thank you. I&#39;m glad you like it.</p>
<p>Colton - You&#39;re exactly right. The Buy Direct option will let a user purchase a physical copy of the item directly from me. I plan on enhancing this in the future (maybe do in-app purchase or at least a cleaner gateway built right into the app), but I feel for now it&#39;ll suffice.</p>

							<p>Sj Sing - I couldn&#39;t figure out how to get the Play&#x2F;Pause button in the iPod controls to control the background audio. I even posted in the Q&amp;A to see if others had a possible solution, but I didn&#39;t hear anything back.</p>
<p>While the Titanium Mobile platform is amazing and pretty complete, I see a lot of work that&#39;s needed to be done on the Media API. I&#39;m hoping SDK 1.5 will address some of these issues (maybe local notifications will help with this?), but like I said, TI is already incredibly powerful so I&#39;m very pleased. For me, not being able to use the iPod controls ss kind of a bummer, but it isn&#39;t a deal breaker for me. I think I implemented the streaming audio as well as I could with the time I allowed myself.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s some other information regarding the development process that may be useful to some.</p>
<p>My overall idea was that I wanted as much of the content in the app as possible to be driven dynamically from my web server. This way I can add&#x2F;update&#x2F;delete content as I see necessary.</p>
<p>Audio &amp; Photos - stored on my web server in a private directory. I use basic authentication to pull them into the app. I use XML files to look at which content I have available.</p>
<p>Video - pulled from my Vimeo profile using the Basic API.</p>
<p>Calendar - parsed from a Google Calendar that I have for my gigs. I have the same parser on my website so it was easy to adapt for the app.</p>
<p>News - this is just the RSS feed from <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ejtmusic.com">my website - www.ejtmusic.com</a>.</p>
<p>Mailing List (in the Settings part of the app) - managed through the Campaign Monitor API.</p>
<p>Push Notifications - handled through Urban Airship.</p>
<p>There were other options I explored at length. One was having real playback controls in the app itself for streaming audio. I found, however, that when audio is streamed there are some bugs with how it detects the length of the audio file. And, there&#39;s currently no way to control the volume of streamed audio so playback controls became less important in my mind.</p>
<p>I also toyed with the idea of allowing people to download tracks right to their device, but again I decided maybe that&#39;s for a future release.</p>
<p>I&#39;m happy to answer any other questions anyone might have.</p>

										<p><p>wow, thanks for describing the process! </p>
<p>I notice you have add notifications for the events. I&#39;m implementing something like that for one of my apps and was wondering if I have it right. You register the device to Urban airship and then take the registered udid and make a request to your server to have it stored with the event info and device info. Then you have a cron running that does a push to urban airship if there is any device that&#39;s registered to any upcoming events … am I on the right track or did you use a different approach?</p>

							<p>Sj Sing - regarding push notifications…</p>
<p>Not exactly. You register w&#x2F; Urban Airship like in the Kitchen Sink example or the example <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.urbanairship.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2010&#x2F;05&#x2F;26&#x2F;appcelerator-and-urban-airship&#x2F;">on the urban airship blog</a>.</p>
<p>After you have a device registered you can choose a couple of different methods for sending notifications to users. For my event notifications I let Urban Airship handle it by registering a delayed notification via their API. Check out the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;urbanairship.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;push_index.html">documentation on their site</a> for more info.</p>
