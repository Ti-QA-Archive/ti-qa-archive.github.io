			<h1>Alloy code seems to run multiple times after upgrading to iOS 8</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I had a mobile app about 60% done under iOS 7 and Titanium 3.3.0 GA. My mobile app was coming along nicely. </p>
<p>After upgrading to iOS 8 and Ti 3.4.0 GA, my app is throwing dialogs sometimes 5, 6, 7 or more times whereas before I upgraded, it was a normally performant alloy controller, functions and whatnot. Basically I am now shocked and horrified and seemingly very far back from my target release deadline.</p>
<p>I am using pretty basic alloy code based on the examples on the site. There is exactly one call to display one confirm dialog, for example, yet in both the simulator and iPhone install, my app is glitchy, blinks, the screen flashes, and the dialog is displayed several times… Am I the only one going through this?</p>
