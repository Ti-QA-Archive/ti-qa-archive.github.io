			<h1>VideoPlayer .play() causes multiple videos to end and fire &#39;complete&#39; event</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;m building an iPad app using Titanium 1.6.0 (it was also the same in 1.5.1) with the 4.2 iPhone SDK.</p>
<p>a bit of a weird one this but I couldn&#39;t find anything on Lighthouse or any answers in the Q&amp;A (although I did find this unanswered forum <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;21971&#x2F;videoplayer---creating-multiple-instances-causes-issues-with-play-controls">question</a>).</p>
<p>My project follows a similar style to the Tweetanium project. I have a file with a function which can be called to create a Video Player view (see a simple test case in this <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;1604596">pastie</a>).</p>
<p>In my main application window, I create two of these video views, each with different videos and data. When I start playing one of the videos, pause it, and then go and play the other video it causes both to &#39;complete&#39;. </p>
<p>The click event to start the second video fires, but once video.play() is called in the callback, the &#39;complete&#39; event on both videos is fired causing both to end.</p>
<p>I thought it may have something to do with my variable references pointing to the same video object but that isn&#39;t the case as I can log separate data from each of the videos in their respective &#39;complete&#39; event listeners.</p>
<p>Any ideas or thoughts on this? Is this a bug in Titanium? Do multiple videos need to be in their own window rather than multiple views in one window?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Pat</p>

							<p>Note from bottom of documentation on videoPlayer object</p>
<p>Notes<br>Starting in iPhone 3.2 SDK, the video player can be embedded in any normal view. However, if you create multiple video players at one time, only the last one to have its URL set will display video content or behave as if it is a view for a video player. Prior to 3.2, only fullscreen views were available on iPhone.</p>
