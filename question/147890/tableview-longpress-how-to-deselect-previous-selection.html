			<h1>TableView Longpress, how to deselect previous selection?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have an iPad&#x2F;Android app in which we are implementing the TableView for a slide out menu (TOC).  We are calling the same &#39;loadPage&#39; function for events &#39;click&#39; and &#39;long press&#39;.  The problem is that occasionally for whatever reason, when doing &#39;long press&#39;, the previous menu selection is still highlighted when select new one, and the link for &#39;loadPage&#39; doesn&#39;t happen, but now both menu links are highlighted but not on right page.  Should I explicitly be doing a &#39;deselectRow&#39; call?  Could this just be a clicking timing issue on the iPad maybe?</p>

							<p>I possibly have taken care of the issue by replacing my TI.UI.createView object listener from a &#39;click&#39; event listener to a &#39;touched&#39; event listener.</p>
<p>We were using:</p>
<p>myWindow.addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;, loadPage);</p>
<p>was changed to:</p>
<p>myWindow.addEventListener(&#39;touchend&#39;, loadPage);</p>
<p>What was happening was we have a slide out Table of Contents menu.  Most of the time it worked fine, but occasionally after selecting a section and it opening up in the main window, you might try to select another section from the menu to open, and you would do a long press of the item and let go, it would highlight (change color) to indicate which section was selected, but it wouldn&#39;t open the content in the main window, and also the previous section would also still be highlighted.  So it was as if it didn&#39;t do the loadPage, but it did see that it was selected.  It would then take a couple of clicks on another section to start working again.  Did try using the &#39;long press&#39; action listener as well, but still sometimes didn&#39;t load and both would be selected.</p>
<p>Titanium SDK Version:  2.1.4</p>

										<p><p>Quick tip; please comment on the related answer or the actual question if there is no answer - rather than creating a whole new answer which is really a comment - it makes it harder in the future to work out threads if answers scores change or other answers are added. (You are not being told off)</p>
