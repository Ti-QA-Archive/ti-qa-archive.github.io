			<h1>Still &#34;module not found&#34; or &#34;file not found&#34; pointing to module</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello Everyone. I&#39;m still having the same problem of titanium android module project not found. I started over and created a new main project and new module project. I followed these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Created new android mobile project in Ti Studio.</li>
<li>Copy all my .js files from the old project to the new one.</li>
<li>Created new android module project with Ti Studio.</li>
<li>Recorded the version # and module id for future reference.</li>
<li>Added the .jar file I need into the main project&#39;s \lib folder.</li>
<li>Modified the .classpath folder to include a &#39;classpathentry&#39; for the .jar file</li>
<li>Built the module project with Ti Studio.</li>
<li>Modified the main mobile project tiapp.xml file to include a node for the new module.</li>
<li>Built the main mobile project.</li>
<li>Added a &#39;require&#39; statement to my main mobile project&#39;s app.js file</li>
<li>Run the main mobile project. Result &quot;module not found, com.example.mymodule&quot; in<br>Ti Studio.</li>
</ol>

							<div><p>The module is located in it&#39;s own folder in the Ti Studio workspace. Studio placed it there. Don&#39;t know what zip file you are referring to? I don&#39;t have one in the module project. I do recall reading one piece of documentation that referred to a module.zip file, I believe. But for all the modules I&#39;ve created trying to alleviate this problem, a zip file was never created during module creation? Hopefully this is my problem! Can you elaborate? Thanks.</p>

							<div><p>when you create a mobile module project and compile it  , titanium creates a zip file at given path of this module . Copy the directories contained in the zip folder to your project and then try it again.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for all your comments. I tried the suggestion of clicking on tiapp.xml&gt;modules section&gt;green plus button&gt;select module. However, my module does not appear in the list. On the modules screen before pressing the green plus button, my module project appears on the right but it is grayed out.<br>Another suggestion was to copy the folders from the zip file created by the module project build to the main project directory. I&#39;ve followed directions ex;plicitly many times for creating a module project and I&#39;ve never seen a zip file in the module&#39;s directory. In one document I recall reading, a zip file was mentioned but it was vague as to where it came from or how it was created. I just assumed this zip file was created if you were using Eclipse? I&#39;m using only Ti Studio exclusively.<br>Any additional suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks again.</p>
