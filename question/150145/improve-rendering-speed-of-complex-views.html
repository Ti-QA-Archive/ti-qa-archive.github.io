			<h1>Improve rendering speed of complex views</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have an app where views (plain views, image view, labels etc) are added in about 6-7 levels of views and child views. On some levels I need to know the absolute size of the parent view, which is not available until postlayout event. </p>
<p>The problem is that the rendering is slow enough to cause a visible delay to the user (even on a fast iPhone). If I try and hard code the size on the view, the delay is not there. </p>
<p>My hunch is that the views I add are rendered as soon as I add them and not until all views have been added. This causes a layout&#x2F;render more times than would have been required if I could use something like view.StartLayout(), then add more views and sub views, and finally a view.EndLayout(). No layout&#x2F;rendering would be done between those calls. </p>
<p>I know that prior to 3.0 there were similar calls (startLayout() etc). They are no longer there, plus they were only useful when updating properties of a view, rather than adding child view.</p>
<p>So, what options do I have?</p>
<p>Hard coding sizes might be possible for iPhone, but for Android with all it&#39;s various screen sizes, I don&#39;t think that is an option.</p>

										<p><p>hello john did you find a solution? i am facing the same problem. my application screen had lots of nested views and i need this to get the desired design layout. on android (average device) the rendering is supper fast and responsive. on iOS (even ipad 3) the rendering is at least 10 times slower and the pages freeze for a long time with iOS NavigationWindow (this happens when navigating forward and backward…). i opened an issue with test-case (with sample code) but the response&#x2F;solution from Appcelerator team was &quot;Not Our Bug&quot; and to remove some of my views to make the screen lighter :s; which is not an option for me at all because it will mess up the design.<br>please let me know if you find any solution<br><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC-3355">here is my jira issue</a></p>

										<p><p>I ended up pre-calculating some dimensions before laying out the views. At least for crucial screens. The rest I left for the auto layouts.</p>

							<p>i replaced the vertical view layout with tableView, the result is dramatic increase in speed on iOS. i think there is a problem with the &quot;Ti.UI.View&quot; component on iOS. please see test-case in jira <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC-3355">here</a>. i am still waiting for Appcelerator team to reply &#x2F; reopen the issue.</p>
