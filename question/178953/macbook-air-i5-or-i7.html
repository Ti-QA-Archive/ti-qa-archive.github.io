			<h1>Macbook air i5 or i7?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am about to buy a macbook air laptop with 128GB SSD, however I&#39;m not quite sure whenever the i5 with 4GB ram will run Titanium Studio fine, or I should go for an i7 with 8GB RAM. Those are my only two options, and the price difference between the two is a lot. (thanks to eastern european prices)</p>
<p>I don&#39;t plan to do run photoshop or anything else on this laptop, since I have a workstation for that.</p>
<p>Any advice is appreciated.</p>

							<p>If you can afford, buy the better version. This will give you some more time until you will need to update your machine (new os version, etc)<br>Also a better machine will compile faster.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you guys! Yes, I can afford the i7 version with 8gb of ram so I will go with that. I really wish Titanium had a &quot;recommended system&quot; page.</p>

										<p><p>The SSD is GREAT for development, as tooling does a lot of file writes. Ditto to the RAM concerns. 4gb will break you. The time saved will allow you to recoup the expense.</p>
<p>That being said, a switch to a lighter weight IDE or editor will benefit you even more.</p>

										<p><p>Agreed. Maximize your development productivity and get the most RAM, Proc and SSD you can afford.</p>
