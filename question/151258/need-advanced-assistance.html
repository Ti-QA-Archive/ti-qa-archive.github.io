			<p>I am having a plethora of problems with titanium.  I have an app that I created back in november that ran great and now I am porting it to android and there is no light at the end of the tunnel.  After upgrading the SDK and titanium nothing seems to run properly.  I could get the app to launch but it would crash for no apparent reason.  It would be sitting on the same screen and then just crash and restart back to the splash screen where it would stay and not completely load again.  Now I have upgraded the SDK to 3.1.0.GA in hopes it would fix some of my issues but my simple app wont even launch in it.  But now it also wont launch when i switch it back to 3.0.2.GA.  I love Appcelerator and this message board but I am dead in the water and need some serious hand holding.</p>
<p>I dont know if I am breaking forum rules but it would be a tremendous help if someone could private messages me for a join.me session or something so they can see and tell me what I need to change to get this going.  I am running out of time and any help would be greatly appreciated.  My console log is riddled with error messages and warning that make no sense to me.</p>

							<div><p>Hello!</p>
<p>The right place for this kinds of requests is: go to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;devlink">devlink</a> and write to the registered professionals there.</p>
<p>Good luck,</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;m with Mauro on this one. <strong>Get in touch with a professional.</strong></p>
<p>Developing Android Applications with Titanium can be tricky at best. But it usually requires a good understanding of the Android platform in general as well as very deep knowledge of the Titanium framework.</p>

							<div><p>I was kind of hoping one of them would see this and contact me via DevMail as I dont see how to post a &quot;help wanted&quot; message.</p>
<p>My app is really simple, its just a bunch of tableviews and webviews and everything works perfectly in iOS and the app is already in the app store. I think the bulk of my issues are coming from titanium components and SDKs not being installed right or configuration issues versus syntax.</p>

							<div><p>In the meantime, go to your Android SDK folder, under Tools, launch &quot;Monitor&quot;.  Clear the LogCat, launch your App and watch the log.  Your error will be listed there.</p>

							<div><p>This is not how things work here.</p>
<p><strong>You</strong> need to contact the professionals. There is no way in hell you can expect someone to hang around here hoping to find a paying gig. </p>
<p>So my advice to you (again) is: &quot;Determine the budget you are willing to allocate, Get in touch with professionals and see if they would be interested&quot;</p>

							<div><p>Thanks again.   I appreciate all the help I receive in this forum I just had my back in a corner time wise and was throwing a hail mary.  I now have the app mostly functional with a few small cosmetic issues.  Im learning that I need to just expect that the emulator is quirky and when something doest work the first time, try to clean the project and build again :-)  I have even had an issue where the project mysteriously wouldn&#39;t build at 2am but then would at 9am.  Anyway thanks for all the assistance you guys provide to beginners like me.</p>
