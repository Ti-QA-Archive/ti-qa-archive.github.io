			<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I&#39;m looking to showcase some HTML5 based web apps made using Titanium. If anybody can provide an example of an app developed in this way I&#39;d appreciate it!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>If you are trying to find html5 apps you are in the wrong place.  Titanium is building <strong>native</strong> apps, not wrapped web apps.</p>

										<p><p>Not sure the stage of it (if it works as mobile web version or not), but you could try this one (you&#39;ll have to build it yourself)</p>

										<p><p>@Dan, Titanium Studio ships with a &quot;HTML5-based Application&quot; which despite the horrible name, is a native Titanium Mobile app for iOS&#x2F;Android that does a bunch of WebView boilerplate stuff and you just add your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<p>As Zane mentioned, Titanium Mobile also supports Mobile Web, which technical isn&#39;t &quot;native&quot;, but it works on many mobile smartphone and tablet browsers beyond iOS&#x2F;Android and supports nearly all of the Titanium Mobile API.</p>
<p>@Zane I do not know of any Titanium Mobile Web showcases, but I would love to see what people have built with Mobile Web. :)</p>

										<p><p>@Chris, in Dan&#39;s defense, the &#39;html5-based application&#39; abilities offered by MobileWeb have done nothing for most of us, other than muddy the waters of the &#39;native vs html5&#39; and yield ammo for the anti-titanium crowd.</p>
<p>Some, including myself and Dan, have invested much time in attempting to counter this negative perception of Titanium. while Dan may have missed the &#39;mobile web&#39; tag, there have been some trollish questions of late in regards to HTML5 so I can completely understand his reaction.</p>
<p>Now, to remain on topic, @zane, I haven&#39;t built anything with Mobile Web because it lacks complete parity with the Android and iOS sides of the Titanium API.</p>
<p>Until we have database and multimedia parity, it offers little to me.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for some great feedback guys!</p>
<p>One of our clients is requesting an app that is able to run on Blaackberry and Windows phone platforms. The only native functionality they are requesting is geolocation, so it looks like we will be shipping a combination of hybrid apps for Android and iOS, and the mobile web app for other devices.</p>
<p>Was hoping to be able to punt the technology a bit, but I think it may be too new in Titanium to have many showcases.</p>

										<p><p>@Stephen I don&#39;t agree that the Mobile Web platform has muddied anything. It&#39;s given developers the ability to target platforms that won&#39;t don&#39;t yet natively support and platforms that only allow HTML-based apps such as Blackberry, Windows Phone, Firefox OS, and so on.</p>
<p>Parity is a hard problem to solve. We will never achieve 100% parity across ALL platforms. There are features that simply cannot be implemented. There are plenty of things that iOS supports that Android does not and vice versa.</p>
<p>I understand that Mobile Web has major limitations. For example, Titanium Mobile Web will never support Ti.Database. Maybe someday we&#39;ll have a new database API which will be async and key&#x2F;value based, not SQL based. Mobile Web supports Ti.Media.VideoPlayer. It will never support the iOS specific MusicPlayer. AudioPlayer support is coming later this year (fingers crossed).</p>
<p>@Zane Mobile Web only supports Windows Phone 7.5, and even then we have limited support. IE on Windows Phone 7.5 does not support touch events, so you can&#39;t scroll ScrollViews, TableViews, or ScrollableViews. Windows Phone 8 (or whatever they call it) will supposedly support touch events. In other words, you will need to put a bunch of up&#x2F;down&#x2F;left&#x2F;right buttons all over your app to get it to somewhat work on Windows Phone 7.5. Ugh, I know.</p>
