			<h1>Merging existing Android app with new Titanium feature</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p><strong>Scenario</strong>: I have an already existing mobile Android platform and I was asked to implement a new independant feature.</p>
<p> <strong>Situation</strong>: This occurs due to a thesis I&#39;m elaborating, and I found AppCelerator Titanium which caught my attention, and made me want to implement this new feature using this technology.</p>
<p> <strong>Problem</strong>: So I have the Android app, very well built for a long time now, and running on the market, and I want to integrate my AppCelerator feature on this Android App… Is this possible by some way?</p>
<p> <strong>Tip</strong>: I know it is possible to convert native Android to AppCelerator modules. However, being this an Android App (in other words, the main part of the application) and not just one simple feature, would it be wise to convert it to a module and then implement any new needed feature through AppCelerator?</p>
<p>The &quot;Tip&quot; was the only possible solution I found, although I&#39;m not sure and might not even make sense… I was wishing I could get some hints&#x2F;solutions on this please! Thanks so much in advance! :)</p>

							<p>Sorry Tadeu, I know of no way to do what you&#39;re asking. The &quot;tip&quot; about creating modules is meant for specific functionality that&#39;s not available directly in our API. For example, if you wanted to expose device functionality or an API that our Titanium SDK doesn&#39;t expose, you could create a module for that to be used within your Titanium app.</p>

										<p><p>That  answered my question, which is pity because I was really looking forward to &quot;migrate&quot; things to titanium, since I find it really powerfull. However, congratulations on the work on this platform, keep up this work as it might be a very good tool option in a near future!</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
