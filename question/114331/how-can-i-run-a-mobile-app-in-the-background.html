			<h1>How can I run a mobile app in the background</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello. I need to run my app (for both Android and iPhone) in the background, with a tray icon. How do I do this?</p>
<p>My app will regularly connect to a server and check if there is anything new. So the user starts the app, do stuff, then when he exits the program, it should run in the background until it is activated again by the user.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

							<p>iOS 4.2 already supports apps in the background, actually with the default settings you&#39;ll always have your app waiting in the background if someone press the Home button. The new KS shows that (have a look at the file bg.js) . Not sure about android tho.</p>

							<p>On the Android:</p>
<p>If I press the home button, the program goes into the background, but if I open another app (such as Contacts or Gallery), then my app is terminated. How can I prevent it from being terminated? I want the app to always run in the background, unless the user specifically closes it.</p>

							<p>I was hoping to find an example of this for Android in the KitchenSink…but haven&#39;t come across anything yet.  </p>
<p>I have the same requirement – if something happens…like an incoming call..I want to send our app to the background…..and then have it come to the foreground once the call is terminated.  Also…want the user to select Exit option to actually terminate it.</p>
<p>Possibly something with the Android Service functionality??</p>

							<p>It seems that Android now supports background services for Android. See the android_services.js example in KitchenSink. I have, however, a problem with this example:</p>
<p>If I press the &quot;Start Service via startService()&quot; button, the service starts and continues to run even if I minimize KitchenSink (pressing the home button) and enter start a different app. (This is just what I want.) However, if I then exit the other app I&#39;m in, the service stops.</p>
<p>Is this how it&#39;s supposed to be? How can I prevent the service from being closed?</p>

										<p><p>We are playing around with this too and seem to have the same results as you!  We want the service&#x2F;app to continue to run until a user explicitly exits it.  So far still searching for a way to accomplish this.</p>
