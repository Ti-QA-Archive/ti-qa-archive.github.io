			<h1>File Syncing System</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I want to create a file syncing system between my computer and android device. Instead of describing the system I thought I would just give you guys a sample use case of the system.</p>
<ul>
<li>USER_1 has a computer and an android device </li>
<li>On the laptop the user has a folder called FOLDER_1</li>
<li>On the android device the user has a folder called FOLDER_2</li>
<li>USER_1 puts FILE_1 into FOLDER_1 through his computer, (this file could be anything, .txt, .pdf, .avi,     etc)</li>
<li>The system then downloads FILE_1 from FOLDER_1 into FOLDER_2 through a wireless connection.</li>
<li>Since FOLDER_2 is on the android device, USER_1 is able to access FILE_1 on his&#x2F;her android device.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just for further clarification, when I refer to the system I mean the Mobile App that I am creating on Titanium</p>
<p>And for extra info, the computer is running an apache server.</p>
<p>Now I have looked at the Titanium Documentation for networking and filesystem, and I am still unable to grasp how this can be accomplished. Can someone please point me in the right direction.</p>
<p>As of now this is my understanding of the tasks to be accomplished. </p>
<ul>
<li>creating a connection between the computer and android device (no idea)</li>
<li>accessing FOLDER_1 from the android device (no clue how this is to be done)</li>
<li>checking whether or not there is a change between the two folders (my idea is to compare the directory listings of the two folders)</li>
<li>once the difference has been determined download the extra files from FOLDER_1 (again no idea how to do this)</li>
<li>closing the connection between the computer and android device (if I can figure out how to create a connection I think I can figure out how to do this)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>This system does already exist, and it even has a few integration modules in the marketplace. Its called Dropbox. Check out the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;listing?1425969784&amp;q=dropbox#!&#x2F;list&#x2F;page&#x2F;1">marketplace modules</a></p>

										<p><p>If i bought it in the marketplace would I be able to see the source code of the software? I don&#39;t want to use any third party software as the system that I am talking about is just one part of the app that I am creating.</p>

										<p><p>The source wouldn&#39;t matter, its the Dropbox sdk wrapped in a Titanium module.<br>My point here is that there are entire business models based entirely around this &#39;one part of your app&#39;. Meaning that one part, is not so small, so why not bootstrap it?</p>
<p>But, if you are dead set on rolling your own solution, a good place to start would be to create the folders necessary on either system. Keep a json file that describes all the files and folders in the directory on both systems. When connecting, match those 2 json objects to eachother, if they are the same, then the system is in sync, if not, then find the differences and upload&#x2F;download the necessary files, each time recreating that json, until both files are the same. Once they are the same again, they are sync&#39;d</p>
