			<h1>Modularity for Tab view controller</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi All,<br>I am writing a tab view controller with each of the tab is navigation controller. Im cannot really figure out the how can i separate each tab as a different class and call their methods as and when required because the working of tabs are interelated. change of contents of one tab affects another. To summarize my question i want to achieve the following structure.</p>
<p>Main_Class<br>—Favorites tab<br>—Portals tab<br>—Search tab<br>—set favorites tab</p>
<p>after performing some or other event on any of favorites, portals and search tab i want ultimately a web view to be loaded which will show the result. </p>
<p>Also, I want to maintain a class storing data for the complete app and to execute server calls.</p>
<p>An example showing OOP pattern achieved in Titanium will help in a big way. Thank you in advance</p>

							<p>an OOP like your talking about here I dont think has been done yet… there are a number of &#39;OOP&#39; &#x2F; MVC style scripts in the community, including ones like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;837">this</a> in the market place. But again, I am yet to see one like you are describing. </p>
<p>On the flip side of that, is there a particular reason your looking to use that kind of patter over something like our tweetanium example?</p>

										<p><p>To note, I am not saying what your trying to do CANT be done, but rather that it has not been done in an open space that I can link you to&#x2F;show you.</p>

										<p><p>Basically, i am from a java background and found this MVC pattern in java script bit difficult to understand :D . But since you are saying and even i searched and studied the MVC pattern for Titanium which turned to be as good as OOP can you provide me a example done in MVC for a tab based example.</p>
