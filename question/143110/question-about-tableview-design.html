			<h1>Question about TableView design</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi guys.</p>
<p>First of all, sorry if the question is unclear because I can&#39;t make it short.</p>
<p>I have a TableView with few sections categorized by month. Each month has data inside it and I want to know if it&#39;s possible to show &#x2F; hide the data by pressing on the section headers. </p>
<p>So let&#39;s say, I create a TableView with 2 sections with headers (January and February) and I want to show only January and hide February data. So I can press on the February header and hide the row of February section. Then, when I press the February header again, I want the section to expand and show the data back.</p>
<p>I only know that TableView has <code>hasChild</code> property but correct me if I&#39;m wrong, in iOS it will open a new TableView. I don&#39;t even know how <code>hasChild</code> works in Android because I couldn&#39;t find a working sample for it.</p>
<p>I tried the latest KitchenSink but it doesn&#39;t have what I wanted. Is this possible? If anyone has a tip on how to make this happen, I would love to hear it. Thanks in advance =)</p>

							<div><p>You can try creating customized row and doing the same which you want. that could not be the solution which you are asking here , but an alternative to achieve the same.</p>

							<div><p>What do you mean by customized row? I actually managed to implement custom header view, although it can&#39;t be done in Android. But now I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s possible to implement the feature I mentioned in my question. To hide&#x2F;show the rows of data when the header view &#x2F; header title is pressed without opening new window.</p>

							<div><p>Check out the Verbs app for iPhone. T has something similar. Maybe you can use it and try to understand the logic behind it.</p>
<p>My guess, add a single tap&#x2F;click event listener to the section headers. Add a custom property index to every section. The first section will be 0, the second will be 1 and so on.</p>
<p>When you detect a click, grab the index. And then, you can do something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-title">tableView</span>.<span class="hljs-typedef"><span class="hljs-keyword">data</span>[sectionIndex].rows =null;</span>
</code></pre><p>Always make sure you have this same data stored else where during the app&#39;s session. </p>
<p>This isn&#39;t tested, but my guess is that this would work. Worth a try.</p>

							<p>Hi Steven, customized row i mean to say: you create view and add it to table view row and your view should have icon something like having some details on click.</p>
<p>once user click on that detail icon, you just slide other rows down and open open your details view below it.<br>when user tap on detail icon again, hide your detail view and slide other rows up.</p>

										<p><p>But then it will be different with the initial design, because the clickable area should be the header, not the row. Because the row itself will respond to different click so I can&#39;t put the hide&#x2F;show data into the row itself.</p>
