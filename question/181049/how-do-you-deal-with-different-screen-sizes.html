			<p>A UX-architect sent me a project where in the &quot;home&quot; there are 5 buttons. I grouped them in one view, then I compiled for iPhone simulators 5&#x2F;6&#x2F;6+. Of course the view remains the same fixed size in any platform but in iOS6&#x2F;6+ there&#39;s more space around it. I&#39;m NOT talking about bitmap graphics but coded view and buttons with no graphics inside.</p>
<p>How do you deal with this? Is there any &quot;magic&quot; way to scale the content of the view or should I code by hand, calculating top, left, width and height of views and buttons for every device?</p>

							<p>I always use dp as default unit.</p>
<p>Then, I try to size the views using left, right, top and bottom or by using Ti.Size.FILL or SIZE</p>
<p>That way everything os sized acording to the current screen.</p>
<p>This requires a little extra time of trial and error and planification, but it works really well.</p>
<p>Little few times I have needed to specify the exact height and width of a view.</p>
<p>CHEERS!</p>

										<p><p>In my case, I&#39;ve an external view &quot;container&quot; and it seems I must set its width (since the UX-architect designed it &quot;detached&quot; from the borders of the screen): so, for iPhone 5 I have a container view with width:300 centered horizontally (and this must be reproporioned in 6 and 6+). INSIDE this view I have my buttons, and their width is Ti.UI.FILL (but, of course, this doesn&#39;t solve the issue with their height (moreover, their positions are hard-coded for 1x, so I suppose I must hard-code again if I want a perfect proportion)</p>

										<p><p>The problem with your solution, (hardcoding the width) is that if you get a smaller screen, your UX will break.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a screen that&#39;s 300 width, and your videw is 300, PLUS the margins (let&#39;s say 10 left and 10 right) you&#39;re already off screen.</p>
<p>Using only margins, your views will always adjust to the current screen.</p>
<p>I develop mainly for android and iOS both, so i can have lots and lots of different screen sizes.<br>If you develop only for iOS exclusively, not too much because you already know the devices out there and their resolutions.</p>

							<p>Hi London Moe,</p>
<p>You can scale UI controller according to device resolution by calculating based on screen. for example 100x35 button is showing perfect in iPhone 5s so you can calculate it size for iPhone 6 and 6+ based on iPhone 5s resolution.</p>
<p>e.g</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Alloy.Globals.GetWidth = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">value</span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> temp = (value * <span class="hljs-number">100</span>) / <span class="hljs-number">320</span>;
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">parseInt</span>((Alloy.Globals.platformWidth * temp) / <span class="hljs-number">100</span>);
};
Alloy.Globals.GetHeight = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">value</span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> temp = (value * <span class="hljs-number">100</span>) / <span class="hljs-number">568</span>;
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">parseInt</span>((Alloy.Globals.platformHeight * temp) / <span class="hljs-number">100</span>);
};
</code></pre><p>And use it in your controller. for example as per earlier discussion calculate it</p>
<p>e.g</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> density;
if(OS_IOS){
    density</span> = <span class="hljs-string">"dp"</span>;
} <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
    density = <span class="hljs-string">"px"</span>;
}
<span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> btnView</span> = Ti.UI.createView({
    width : (Alloy.Globals.GetWidth(<span class="hljs-number">100</span>) + density),
    height : (Alloy.Globals.GetHeight(<span class="hljs-number">35</span>) + density),
});
</code></pre><p>Here i define density depends on platform because when you calculating it by using device resolution it return in pixel so you need to assign it &quot;px&quot; for android. and for ios it return non retina resolution so for that need to assign &quot;dp&quot;.</p>
<p>Hop this is helps you.. if you have any doubt let me know… </p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>This is what I do, but that calculation is in a general configuration file, so I created an object with three keys (i5,i6,i6p) and when I assign the width I do it dinamically based on the current device key</p>

										<p><p>Yes, this is very simple and the device only performs the calculation once, not everytime the GUI is loaded.</p>

										<p><p>Yes but as per my suggestion it&#39;s not good at all scenario. let&#39;s assume if single window having more then 10 UI controller with different size and there is more then 5 window. so in this case you need to set all controller key in all window.. Sorry but i feel like it&#39;s static solution.. as per my suggestion it&#39;s working fine in all platform not only iOS devices even it&#39;s looking perfect in all most all device of android..</p>
<p>if your problem is solve by using your solution then keep it.. and continue…</p>

										<p><p>Nilesh, I don&#39;t care about Android. There&#39;s another solution too: you can have a single view with width set as percent (eg. &quot;90%&quot;). Inside this view, you can &quot;play&quot; with Ti.UI.FILL with the content.</p>
