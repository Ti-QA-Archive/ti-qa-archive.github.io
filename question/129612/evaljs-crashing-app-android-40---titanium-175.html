			<h1>evalJS crashing app [Android 4.0 - Titanium 1.7.5]</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have an app deployed in the Android marketplace that uses an evalJS in the webView&#39;s load event as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> sCode</span> = webView.evalJS(<span class="hljs-string">"document.documentElement.innerHTML"</span>);
</code></pre><p>The purpose of the code is to retrieve the page&#39;s HTML source.  It seems the e.source.html parameter isn&#39;t available on Android which is why I&#39;m using this alternate method that I found in another Q&amp;A article (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;64401&#x2F;oauth—retrieving-webview-html)</p>
<p>This has been working fine on devices running Android 2.1 through 3.1.  However on the Galaxy Nexus running Android 4.0 and on the Android 4.0 emulator, the app freezes when the evalJS function is called (as listed in the code segment above).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried building my code with both Titanium 1.7.2 and 1.7.5 with the same results.  Is this a known issue that is going to be resolved?  And is there any other way to retrieve the webView&#39;s HTML source?</p>
<p>I did find this issue which may be related listed in the 1.8.0 RC release notes:  http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-4885</p>
<p>However it seems to be directly related to calling functions within evalJS.  It says that the following code should work:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> title</span> = webView.evalJS(<span class="hljs-string">"document.title"</span>);
</code></pre><p>So I assume my code segment, which is very similar, should also work and thus this bug fix in 1.8.0 is most likely not related.</p>

							<p>Before suspecting there is a bug involved, you need to ensure two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>web view component has loaded</li>
<li>HTML has loaded</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>I&#39;m executing my code from the &quot;load&quot; event which should only execute if the web page has loaded.  How would you ensure those two things?</p>
<p>Also my code works perfectly in Android 2.1 through 3.1.  It only breaks in Android 4.0.</p>
<p>I landed up trying out the 1.8 RC and it fixes the issue.  However it causes a bunch of other issues in my app, so I&#39;d prefer not to use it right now.</p>
<p>I&#39;m hoping there&#39;s a way to get it to work with 1.7.5.  Or if there was another way to retrieve the web page&#39;s source html, that would be good.</p>

										<p><p>If you&#39;re using web view&#39;s load event, then it should work (although, I&#39;m not sure that web view&#39;s &quot;load&quot; means HTML has loaded - I prefer using &quot;window.onload&quot; to be sure).</p>
<p>If it works fine with previous version of Android, then you should consider creating good test case and reporting that to JIRA: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;How+to+Submit+a+Bug+Report">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;How+to+Submit+a+Bug+Report</a></p>

										<p><p>It&#39;s working in 1.8 RC3, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary to submit a bug report.  However like I mentioned, 1.8 RC3 is causing other unrelated issues in my app.</p>
<p>Is there any other way to retreive the HTML of a webView (other than evalJS)?  I&#39;d prefer to stick with 1.7.5 which doesn&#39;t break other parts of my app.</p>

										<p><p>Okay, that&#39;s fair conclusion. :)</p>
<p>Other than &quot;evalJS&quot; … well, you could try to make HTTP call and read response, right?<br>Or, you could play a bit with &quot;evalJS&quot;, if I got this right, &quot;document.title&quot; works fine … so maybe &quot;document.documentElement.innerHTML&quot; is making troubles for some reason. By rewriting that to something else, you could get this working. One of options is this: &quot;document.getElementsByTagName(&#39;html&#39;)[0].innerHTML&quot;</p>
