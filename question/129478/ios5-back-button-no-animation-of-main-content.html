			<h1>iOS5 back button no animation of main content</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>There is a bug in iOS5 where when tapping the back button in a window the main content of the previous screen is just show instantly but the navbar is animated.</p>
<p>There is a ticket in JIRA about this but it was closed directly by Appcelerator and they are not fixing it. I have never created a JIRA ticket. Can anyone that knows how to do it fix it?</p>
<p>Does anyone know of a solution to this issue? I am running 1.8 RC1 and it does not fix the problem at all…</p>
<p>This is the closed JIRA ticket: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-5793</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

										<p><p>No, I am using 4.3 still. Will there be a problem with iOS4 apps if I upgrade to 5 or any other issues with compatibility with Appcelerator?</p>

										<p><p>Then this is the problem.<br>I compile apps with iOs SDK 5 and run them on my 3gs with 4.3 and ipad with 5.0, and I see no issue at all. Also there are no issues with Ti (Lion).</p>

										<p><p>Yeah, you were right! It works fine no (a bit slow in the animation) after updating to latest iOS SDK 4.2.</p>
