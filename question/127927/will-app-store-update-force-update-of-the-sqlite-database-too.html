			<h1>Will app store update force update of the SQLITE database too?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have an iOS app on the app store.  I need to make an update to fix some typos and such in the data that were missed.</p>
<p>If I make the changes in my sqlite db, and build a new release app, submit it to the app store will users who download the app get the new DB?</p>
<p>I only ask since I have been told in the past to delete apps from my development device before installing updates to force the DB to update, and I obviously cannot&#x2F;don&#39;t want to do that in this case – I just want the users to update as normal.</p>

							<p>When users update the application, the new database <strong>will not</strong> be installed over the old one. </p>
<p>This is due to 2 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once the application is installed, it copies the database (from the Resources directory) into the user&#39;s application directory. so replacing the one in Resource won&#39;t overwrite it.</li>
<li>If user made changes in the deployed database, all those changes would be lost. That&#39;s not something most developers want for their users.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is, of course, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;126143&#x2F;force-reinstall-of-sqlite-database">a way to do it using this technique</a>. Just keep in mind that changes made by the user will be lost also.</p>

										<p><p>That link is very confusing, since there are several conflicting opinions.<br>What about if I renamed the DB in my code?  For example:</p>
<p><code>var db = Ti.Database.install(&amp;#39;mm.sqlite&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;foo&amp;#39;);</code> change to </p>
<p><code>var db = Ti.Database.install(&amp;#39;mm.sqlite&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;bar&amp;#39;);</code></p>

										<p><p>Yes, that would do it too.  It does leave the old DB behind on the device.  If your database is smallish that may not be a concern.  But you could clear up that space by using something like this in your new version:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> oldDB</span> = Ti.Database.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>('foo');
oldDB.remove();
</code></pre><p>The above will create an empty database &#39;foo&#39; for those who did not have one, or open a previously existing copy for those who did. Either way, it will then remove the database.  This effectively clears the storage for the old database from your prior users.</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s OK in this case, the DB only has my data. User data I am writing to Titanium.App.Properties, which I assume is a different location?</p>

							<p>What you need to do is have an &#39;upgrade.js&#39; file that checks the version of the app, and do something like</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(upgrade==<span class="hljs-string">'1.0'</span>)
{
run some database upgrade code (all <span class="hljs-operator">of</span> <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> code <span class="hljs-built_in">from</span> <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> highest <span class="hljs-built_in">version</span> down <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> this <span class="hljs-built_in">version</span>)
upgrade =<span class="hljs-string">'2.0'</span> &lt;<span class="hljs-comment">--sets the version of the app to the current version so next time it wont run this code</span>
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(upgrade==<span class="hljs-string">'1.5'</span>)
{
run some database upgrade code
upgrade =<span class="hljs-string">'2.0'</span> &lt;<span class="hljs-comment">--sets the version of the app to the current version so next time it wont run this code</span>
