			<h1>Small Q/A redesign (comments and answers)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Since answers and comments functionality in Q&#x2F;A can be confusing for new users, but also sometimes experienced users posts an answer instead of comment, I think that this could be improved with small UI redesign.</p>
<p>I suggest that there should be two buttons (&quot;Add comment&quot; that is red for comments and &quot;Add answer&quot; that is green for answers) instead of &quot;Add comment&quot; link (that is very small and hard to notice) for comments and text field for answers. Click of a button would open popup window (or show text field) in which we could write and post text.</p>
<p>I think that way we would get much clearer solution. It&#39;s very important to use comments when appropriate because otherwise is awful to read and track discusion.</p>

							<p>Except UI (I don&#39;t have any problem with UI) main thing they should change is their<br>point system. It&#39;s not good enough as Stackoverflow.</p>
