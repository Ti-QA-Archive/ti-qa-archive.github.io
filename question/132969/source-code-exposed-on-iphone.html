			<h1>Source code exposed on iPhone</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure if anyone here is aware, but apparently, when you submit your apps, the .JS files can be viewed on the iPhone. I won&#39;t go into detail &quot;how&quot; you can view it, but those tech savvy amongst you can figure that out. </p>
<p>Not all apps though can be viewed. For example, the JandBeyond app created in Appcelerator cannot be viewed. How did they do this?</p>
<p>How can I publish my app and make sure that all my files are not readable by anyone else?<br>Thanks</p>

							<div><p>Hi Stephen,</p>
<p>I am running the following version:</p>
<p>Titanium Studio, build: 1.0.8.201201262211<br>(c) Copyright 2011 by Appcelerator, Inc.  All rights reserved.</p>
<p>Build: jenkins-titanium-rcp-master-136 (origin&#x2F;master)<br>Date: 26 January 2012, 22:14:21</p>
<p>b) As I mentioned, there are some apps that were not even built by appcelerator, and their files are exposed. Its so easy to view them. I&#39;m pretty sure they were not built by appcelerator at least. </p>
<p>c) Its very easy to just go and take a look at these source files. </p>
<p>I&#39;m not going to message anyone unless its from a Titanium Appcelerator address. I just want them to tell me how they compiled the JandBeyond app because this is one of the apps that&#39;s pretty much bullet proof.</p>

<p>I can see your .JS files (all of them!), and if you have a local database with your app, I can see that too.. yep, I can take it and play with it. </p>
<p>I&#39;m pretty concerned about this.</p>

							<div><p>If you are saying that you can see the JS files in plain text, sitting in a folder you unzipped after renaming the ipa to a zip, then I still want to know your SDK version.</p>
<p>If you are talking about hitting the binary, thats different.</p>

							<div><p>Regarding the database, its an sqlite database, what did you expect to find?  This isn&#39;t news.  There is a database encryption module in the market to resolve that particular problem.</p>

							<div><p>Oh? You think its my studio version? Maybe.. but forget my version of Ti. I&#39;m telling you that there is a way to view the source code of these apps, yet JandBeyond app is &quot;secure&quot;.</p>
<p>How? </p>
<p>I have an idea: i will show you a list of apps I have the source code. 1 sec: </p>
<p>app a ) I paid 3:99 for this.. i can see all NIB files and png files<br>app b ) CARDS (Apple Cards application) - i have all the NIB files for this + more<br>app c) CLubMedGym (yes, that&#39;s where I train out) - I have all their NIB files and PNG files<br>d) my App:  all my local database files + HTML files i&#39;ve used (with Javascript).. </p>
<p>I am PRETTY sure that this is obvious - its no big deal, it must be normal what I&#39;m seeing because there are big name apps there where I can just take the databases and use them. </p>
<p>I do make one small correction - not all of my JS files are showing - it wasn&#39;t the case a few days ago. </p>
<p>But one thing is for sure: jandBeyond is totally hidden.</p>

							<div><p>Stephen - you see the icons and jss files?? Can you email me then? Where do I get them from?</p>
<p>I was just impressed that all my apps on my iPhone were exposed except for this one. Under what name is it? </p>
<p>Mobile SDK - iOS = 4.3 - is that the info you wanted?</p>
<p>I feel you are a bit upset with me, there Stephen. I didn&#39;t mean to cause you or anyone unnecessary worry, but there is way to get files from Apps. That&#39;s all I&#39;m saying.</p>

							<p>If Appcelerator are reading this thread, could you please email me an answer this question and then can you kindly erase this thread. I agree with Ronnie. I really didn&#39;t want to post this exposure, but I need an answer. </p>
<p>However, the app you made called JandBeyond is totally secure… but how? The source code is completely hidden. </p>
<p>Can you please tell us how?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

										<p><p>Personally, I don&#39;t think it should be deleted. While I agree it would not be appropriate to post the method of an exploit here, I do not see why it would be unreasonable for the community to subscribe to a hopeful fix or explanation for a pretty serious concern.</p>

										<p><p>hi Andrew,<br>I am so unfamiliar with Appcelerator. I&#39;m a real newbie, so I do not know the way to contact Appcelerator. If you want to know how to view your source code, please send me a message. </p>
<p>By the way, this isn&#39;t just with appcelerator apps - its with other apps also - there&#39;s a way of compiling or packaging them that just hides all the source code from the end user.</p>
