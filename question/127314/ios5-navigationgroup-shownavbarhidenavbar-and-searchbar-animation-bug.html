			<h1>iOS5 NavigationGroup showNavBar/hideNavBar and SearchBar animation bug?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m using NavigationGroup (no TabGroup), SearchBar attached on TableView headerView part. I hide NavigationGroup on SearchBar focus event and show it on blur event (showNavBar&#x2F;hideNavBar). It was working properly before iOS5 but now when NavigationBar is set to hidden (ie, hideNavBar() method fired) SearchBar starting to animate from bottom of the Window (it disappears and appears from bottom of the Window and animates to top). It happens when showNavBar() method called too. I&#39;ve tried same code with using SDK 1.7.3 and 1.8.0 (github) but I got same result. Is it known bug?</p>

							<div><p>Yeah, there seems to be a couple of issues about NavigationGroups and iOS5… But the appcelerator guys didn&#39;t really make a statement so far (at least I didn&#39;t find one..)</p>

							<div><p>I don&#39;t think they can focus on specific platforms because of nature of Titanium SDK design. I think they need to split up SDK projects for iOS, Android and HTML5 (mobile web). Working on to make same API for every platform is no more good idea i think. If I were subscribed (paid) customer I will have been probably got the answer already. Anyway, I&#39;ve arelady stop waiting answer&#x2F;solution from Titanium&#x2F;Appcelerator.</p>

							<p>I was having some trouble with 1.7.5 yesterday and the nav groups, went over and grabbed a nightly build of 1.8 (no officially released yet) andup to now it solved some of my issues.<br><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;index.html">inline link text</a></p>
<p>Download it and you can place what is in the osx directory (1.8…..) under Library&#x2F;Application support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx</p>
<p>Then open the tiapp.xml and change versions.</p>
