							<p>lion gm + latest xcode 4.2 + iOS5b3 + latest titanium studio + titanium mobile continous build 1.8.x working here. i get some crashes in the simulator, don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s the combination used or simply a buggy nightly build of ti mobile 1.8.x, but overall it works.</p>
<p>however you can&#39;t put apps for approval by using xcode 4.2, you still have to use snow leopard, xcode 4.1, itunes 10.3 (the one before those betas released with iOS5 betas), iOS SDK 4.3.3. i created a virtual box 4.1b2 machine in lion using snow leopard to be able to get apps on the phone and finally to the store. for those interested - once you got it working it&#39;s surprisingly fast (in fact it&#39;s booting faster than my app-overloaded mac in native mode), as long as it has attached enough memory to it</p>

										<p><p>when you distribute the code, it gives options to choose 5.0 or 4.3. just pick 4.3, you can release it.</p>

										<p><p>really? cause it did this twice today, and i wasn&#39;t able to validate or submit the app because &quot;submitting with this sdk-version is currently not possible&quot; (not exactly this wordings but similiar). i did choose &quot;4.3&quot; in the dialogue when creating the distribution package. i&#39;m talking about an error in the xcode part in &quot;organizer&quot; when finally uploading the app, the titanium part worked well for me too</p>

										<p><p>From Apple Dev Support phone call today around 2pm:</p>
<p>4.2 has NOT been approved by Apple for building apps for distro through the app store at this time.</p>
<p>4.1 is currently allowed.</p>

							<p>I installed Lion r4 a few weeks ago on my MacBook, I couldn&#39;t compile a thing on it. I asked <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;121617&#x2F;unable-to-use-simulator-after-update">on here</a> &amp; support stated that Ti is not yet compatible yet with Lion so beware buddy.</p>
