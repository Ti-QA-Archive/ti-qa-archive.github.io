			<p>Hey, diving into namespacing and was wondering if i should re-create the namespace (code below) for each window opened or pass the object in the constructor…</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">// <span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">do</span> this <span class="hljs-keyword">on</span> every page that needs <span class="hljs-keyword">access</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> the namespace??
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> ns={};</span>
Ti.include('ui.js');
</code></pre><p>also, i&#39;m writing this app as a universal app and was wondering if i should use one namespace or if it&#39;s cleaner&#x2F;more efficient to have an <code>ipad</code> namespace and an <code>iphone</code> namespace.</p>
<p>Thx!!!</p>

							<p>You only need to define it once. Ti chains your JS together so it&#39;s callable anywhere down the line. </p>
<p>Well it depends on what your trying to namespace. I usually have a root namespace. For instance I work at UW Oshkosh so our namespace I use is &quot;uwo&quot; and from there I have sub namespaces. uwo.model, uwo.ui and uwo.app which i put the related functions into.</p>
<p>hope that helps or gives you an idea.</p>

							<p>Looking at these answers, I might be misunderstanding the question.</p>
<p>I thought the question was should one create a new namespace in each context (say a window) OR pass it to the other contexts? So far I am just seeing suggestions on how to make the namespace.</p>
<p>I used to create my namespace in the global context by appending to Ti.App, but with all of the memory changes in 1.7 this has new issues that causes lots of crashes. </p>
<p>As to attaching your namespace to a window (e.g. in the window constructor), I suspect this is has a bit of a performance penalty as the new window has to re-evaluate it.  Also, if your namespace includes any functions it is no longer <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-4618">recommended to pass them</a> this way.</p>
<p>This leaves re-loading the javascript namespace via include on each &amp; every page. This definitely incurs a performance penalty and slows down the app. However, it is the only method it seems like Appcelerator will support.</p>
<p>I wish Titanium had something like static classes, as reloading the same code repeatedly on every page just seems bad form.</p>

										<p><p>if you define your name space as a JS object in a higher included js file it will be global through out and be callable in lower files. </p>
<p>Just make sure your using anonymous self calling functions and factories to make it happen. </p>
<p>I was going to suggest looking at the tweetanium sample app but it appears they&#39;ve taken&#x2F;moved it off the appcelerator github.</p>

										<p><p>@mike - thanks for addressing the context issue. i&#39;ve actually noticed in a couple Ti lab apps that they create a lot of windows inside the namespace so that they all share the same scope removing the need to pass anything - but demos always seem to be very shallow and basic and don&#39;t fully exemplify how to code a more complex app.<br>but this is the method i&#39;m going to shoot for which would remove any of the performance penalties you mentioned.</p>
<p>@joel - thx, i dl&#39;d that sample app a while back, i&#39;ll give it another look.</p>

										<p><p>not problem I forked your gist and made some changes.<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;1081107">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;1081107</a> </p>
<p>By converting making our windows and views into functions and by including our files we can chain all our JS together. this make our namespace available anywhere in the application as long as your not calling a function before it is initialized in the chain</p>
<p>Example I have a style.js file that contains all my presets for building UI components, in order to make is work that file needs to be included higher up in the include chain otherwise it won&#39;t be initialized when it gets called. Does that make sense?</p>
<p>One word of caution though the more you use Ti.include the slower the initial load on android gets. They have improved it some in 1.7.x builds.</p>

										<p><p>I appreciate your fork, it is very clear and is the newer style of Titanium development I am seeing.</p>
<p>My problem is I am trying deal with the changes in 1.7, which kind of came out of nowhere. I have an older app which has tons of windows opening other windows (all with the url property). Think of it kind of like the KitchenSink app.</p>
<p>So reading what you are saying, I would have to convert to this single context model. However, that leaves me with a few questions, since my existing project is kind of complex.</p>
<p>1) As I have lots &amp; lots of windows, it&#39;s probably best that I conditionally include windows after a button (or other UI element) is clicked and I am about to open windows. Correct?</p>
<p>2) Can you show me the best way to say open 2 new windows from within window1.js. Say window1.js has a button which you click to open window2.js, which has it&#39;s own button to open window3.js. I understand the concepts, but the chaining of them is a little confusing as to how it is best implemented. All of the Titanium app examples are pretty simple, a single tabgroup type thing that doesn&#39;t help.</p>
<p>Thanks a bunch!</p>

										<p><p>Mike, i&#39;d say the single context is the way to go and i&#39;m also have to adapt to it. i&#39;ve got the same problem with lots of windows opened in a navigation group. i haven&#39;t gotten all the way to the end of this rabbit hole but going to try to make a generic window factory in the namespace and just pass urls to it so that they all have access to everything in the namespace. maybe joel can comment on this idea…</p>

										<p><p>yeah so lets say i want to have a generic webview that i pass the url to and it opens. </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">uwo.ui.createWebView = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(url,title)</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> w = Titanium.UI.createWindow({

    w.add(wb);
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> b = Titanium.UI.createButton({
        title:<span class="hljs-string">'Back'</span>,
        style:Titanium.UI.iPhone.SystemButtonStyle.PLAIN

    w.setLeftNavButton(b);

    b.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>,<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span>
    </span>{
        w.close();
    });

    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> w;
};
</code></pre><p>so here we create a window add a web view to it and even add the back&#x2F;close button</p>
<p>so in our other file we&#39;d call this like this in a tableview event handler</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">tableview.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>,<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span></span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(!uwo.checkConn()) {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> alertDialog = Titanium.UI.createAlertDialog({
            title: <span class="hljs-string">'Network Error!'</span>,
            message: <span class="hljs-string">'Your device is not online. This action requires a network connection.'</span>,
            buttonNames: [<span class="hljs-string">'OK'</span>]
        });
        alertDialog.show();
    } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
        uwo.app.feedWebView = uwo.ui.createWebView(e.row.url,doctitle);
        uwo.app.feedWebView.open({modal:<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>});
    }            
});

										<p><p>Joel, while that does sound easier it doesn&#39;t scale for our gigantic open a window from a window, from a window, from a window type application. </p>
<p>I would have to include all of my windows for all execution paths, which would make it take an eternity to load I am afraid. Also, as you mentioned Android might have some serious issues as well. I of course could do things to ensure they are only included one time to help, but I think I have to include them when I create them to improve performance.</p>

										<p><p>Kelly, I&#39;m kind of doing both, using navGroup in iOS and creating my own one from views in Android.

										<p><p>well i haven&#39;t been able to test this yet (hopefully today) but this is what i came up with. the main thing i&#39;m wondering is if this can keep every page in scope without having to pass objects…like a navigationGroup if you use one. i&#39;m still figuring this stuff out but hope it helps - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;1084712">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;1084712</a></p>

										<p><p>Kelly, I thought the whole point of this was to open Windows without the URL parameter, as that seems to create the new context. If you just add items onto a new window that is created without the URL, it all seems to stay in scope. As this is what my <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;1081264">previous code example</a> was showing.</p>
<p>You may want to look at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;1079742">this example</a> as it had some ideas I incorporated into my navigation structure. Not the best example for windowing, but it shows some good ideas on the navigationGroup incorporation.</p>

							<p>It depends on your programming style. </p>
<p>I prefer using global variable as namespace (same as you&#39;re doing).</p>
<p>It may not be the fastest approach, but I like it because it&#39;s simple and easy to read&#x2F;understand.</p>
