			<p>Hi Everyone,<br>My question may seem weird to you I apologize for that now. Here is my question :<br>My actual Question is making customized tabs for both Android and iPhone. I did that with Views made 5Views(Tabs) in one window and then added a View in each tab to work on that. Now the problem is The Application has become very slow in Android, on iPhone it seems fine. </p>
<p>If each tab will contain a window instead of a View that would be amazing and code would be easily manageable. Anyone knows is that possible ?</p>
<h1 id="tried-method-">Tried Method </h1>
<p>I tried one thing created a <code>mainWindow</code> added Views (Tabs in that window) And then I created 2 more <code>WINDOWS</code> with <code>top set to 10%</code> so that the tabs could be clicked from <code>mainWindow</code>. In this way I can have <strong>Windows</strong> to work on instead of <strong>Views</strong> . But This technique works on iPhone and not android.<br>If anybody has made custom Tabs before or something that can solve my issue please share with me.</p>
<p>I am working on Mac OS , Titanium SDK is 3.4.0</p>

							<p>In short, no you can&#39;t have windows as children of views, except in the case of TabGroups.</p>
<p>If you must use a custom tab solution and the content of your tabs is anything orther than trivial, then you&#39;re going to need to manage memory very carefully, particularly on Android.</p>
<p>When off-screen, consider removing any listeners, clearing table &#x2F; list data, removing maps, unloading images etc. and reinstating them when the tab is selected and visible again. It&#39;s clunky and not much fun to debug.</p>
<p>Honestly though, the native android tabs component does a much better job of this and unless there some really compelling reasons not to, I&#39;d use it.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Terry,<br>First of all thanks for the suggestions they are really helpful. I have already thought this way. But the problem here is My tabs contain <code>webviews</code> and I have to retain the webview state if I come from another tab so, If I remove <code>views</code> on going to another <code>View</code> the App performance becomes better but in that way I can&#39;t retain the previous state. I think I have to compromise at some point. :-( </p>
<p>Titanium Apps are not getting much better on Android as it does in iPhone.<br>Hope someday these things will be done and developers can get it work in a good way.</p>

										<p><p>WebViews are the most memory hungry component of the lot :(</p>
<p>I suspect in truth, these problems are less to do with Titanium and more to do with Android&#39;s poor memory management (compared with iOS) and diversity of device capabilities.</p>

										<p><p>Agreed with you. But Titanium has its lacks even though, as you said earlier &quot;Honestly though, the native android tabs component does a much better job of this and unless there some really compelling reasons not to, I&#39;d use it.&quot; :-)<br>Both these things count.</p>
