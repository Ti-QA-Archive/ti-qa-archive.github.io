<li>The Q&amp;A is community driven (Muhammad is a volunteer)</li>
<li>Appc folks do stop by (thats why the twitter account pointed you here)</li>
<li>We expect you to do your part in the process. &#39;It broke, fix&#39; is no where near doing your part.</li>
<li>If you bought something from the Marketplace, contact the author of the module&#x2F;template for support.  If it is an Appc module, post more details.</li>
</ol>
<p>Missing from your question are a number of important pieces of information. I suggest you take a look at the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Using+Questions+and+Answers">Using Questions and Answers</a> article, specifically the Q&amp;A Question Checklist.  The missing information is critical to reproducing problems in a test environment and often indicates other factors that cause the undesirable outcome you are experiencing.</p>
