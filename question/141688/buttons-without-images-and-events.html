			<h1>Buttons without images and events</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi</p>
<p>Linux<br>Android 2.3.3&#x2F;2.2<br>Ti 2.1.1GA</p>
<p>I am doing an app where the entry-window shows a vertical row of buttons. </p>
<p>The buttons are created like this:</p>
<p>A view<br>add a button to the view<br>add a label and an icon to the view</p>
<p>All of this is done in a CommonJS module</p>
<p>With NO change of code, suddenly only the first button is shown. All labels and icons are shown exactly where they need to be - but the buttons are gone.</p>
<p>A debug run confirms that all code is executed, and that the button objects are created, they are visible, they have the right coords each and every one,</p>
<p>One element on the page is draggable, using the touchstart, touchmove and touchend events. This element is an image and has nothing to do with the buttons.</p>
<p>removing the draggable code from this element restores Ti&#39;s ability to show more than one button, and the buttons are back to normal.</p>
<p>You get this? Removing eventhandlers from a non-related image fixes this error. How on earth can eventhandlers on an image object prevent Ti from showing more than one button? How?</p>
<p>My only luck is that the draggable image is out-of-spec, something I added as an &#39;extra&#39;. I&#39;ll silently not mention it. But if it HAD been in-spec, my hind would be roast tomorrow.</p>
<p>Appcelerator - it&#39;s time to stop the feature-run and start the &#39;lets make this into a solid and reliable product&#39;-run </p>
<p>I&#39;ll be leaving the community really soon if nothing happens.</p>

							<div><p>When posting questions like this, it often helps to simply post the code rather than a long winded description of what is happening in the vague hopes that someone will have any idea of what you are talking about. Create a minimal example that can be easily copied and pasted into a new project that reproduces the issue that you are experiencing. Post that code and I guarantee you&#39;ll get alot more responses to your question.</p>

							<div><p>Anthony - i have fixed the error, see my comment to Alexanders answer to see why I post anyway.</p>
<p>Thing is that we do not have a forum where we can talk - we only have a forum for posting tech-questions, namely this QnA - that&#39;s why I allow my self to be off-topic in an on-topic kind of way</p>

							<div><p>Anthony, I can&#39;t wait until somebody actually takes you up on your suggestion of a minimal example.  I think I&#39;ve asked at least 10 or 15 posters to do that, and not one of them has done it.</p>
<p>In my experience, minimal examples were the <em>only</em> way to fight through a confusing error (sometimes it was me misusing the API, and sometimes it was me stumbling across a bug, of which I found many and have many JIRA issues).  I had at least 3 or 4 such problems that took 8 hours or more to isolate (each).  Most of the time, I figured out the problem on my own while trying to create that minimal example.  And if I couldn&#39;t, at least I had something useful to provide to the Q&amp;A forum or Appcelerator support.</p>
<p>I won&#39;t say that learning Ti Mobile is all sunshine and roses, but with some determination and solid programming fundamentals, you can get over that learning curve.  But I truly believe that if you can&#39;t&#x2F;won&#39;t boil your problems down to minimal examples, you&#39;re not going to be successful.</p>

							<div><p>I have set up a very flexible viewfactory system. It would not make sense to copy-paste actual code. To isolate what happens and present it in a generic way is certainly possible, but rather time-consuming and I am working and I am on a deadline.</p>
<p>As I said: This is not a technical Q, and as such I realize that I am offtopic, but where else to post?</p>
<p>BTW I found the culprit. After the initial layout cycle, I moved the buttons ever so slightly. This caused the button views to not render while labels and imageviews renders in place. I &#39;fixed&#39; it by refactoring so I didn&#39;t need to move them.</p>
<p>New Studio and 2.1.2GA is out, and it seems like the syntax-checker is back on track :)</p>

							<p>You may want to Share Code, I dont think that this issue is related to the eventlisteners. However I have the same opinion regarding android and ti Support. iOS is running for 2 years now with nearly no changes in the Ti core API..</p>

										<p><p>The code is running on top of my own framework - I can&#39;t expect anyone to get into all that.</p>
<p>But I got so irritated that I had to vent. Therefore this question is not: How do i fix that error, the question is: When (if ever) will these constant errors be dealt with?</p>
<p>here are the facts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Code is working through its entire lifetime</p>
</li>
<li><p>all of a sudden code is not working (no change in code)</p>
</li>
<li><p>removing eventlisteners from an image makes button re-appear</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This makes NO SENSE at our level in the toolchain. None whatsoever …</p>
<p>And I am losing patience, I&#39;ve been dancing with Ti for nearly a year now, and all the time I am fighting it, rather than coding.</p>
<p>Ti for iOS is not without its bugs btw. I had a syntax error, forgot a comma in an object litteral. Codevalidator is fubar in the current iteration of TiStudio, so no warning. I get an error from Ti that so-and-so file in an XCode folder is missing - and start a giant bug hunt to find out why that file is missing, or rather, why Ti SAYS its missing, because the file is not missing. After two hours, I spot that I missed a comma, and lo and behold - everything is running again.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a comma is missing in an object literal</p>
</li>
<li><p>codevalidator is fubar</p>
</li>
<li><p>system barfs up with an error of a missing file</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>with android I have to restart studio every 3-4 run, it suddenly loses ability to launch the app, restarting adb does not help - only fix: restart studio.</p>
<p>with iOS i had a long period of every 2. build failing. I also had the amusing: &#39;Unable to locate Ti whateverview proxy&#39; - Ti not being able to find it&#39;s proxies! You know what the fix for that error is? clean your project AND delete the build folder manually. in other words - you have to delete an empty folder, otherwise Ti can&#39;t find this or that view-proxy</p>
<p>It IS timeconsuming (nobody will pay me for those hours - nobody), unproductive and you lose any joy you might otherwise have had, and worst of all: You risk letting clients down, because you simply cannot deliver. And Ti is such a brilliant concept</p>

										<p><p>I had plans to start a shop in my company (which is not owned by me) with young coders doing apps. I could&#39;ve been a paying Ti customer, buying courses for the young ones etc …</p>
<p>So far I have one young coder. He is working with gamemaker instead of Ti, coz&#39; I simply cannot support him when Ti keeps tripping us up. I can manage that on my own but not for him as well. And he regards Ti as a regular uncool thing … and I can&#39;t say that I blame him.</p>
