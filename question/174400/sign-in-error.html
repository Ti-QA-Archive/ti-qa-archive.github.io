			<p>I&#39;ve installed Titanium Studio on my Mac, but every time I try to open the app and log in with my account information, I get a &quot;Sign In Error&quot;. Very frustrating and already having second thoughts about using Titanium!</p>

<p>Missing from your question are a number of important pieces of information. I suggest you take a look at the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Using+Questions+and+Answers">Using Questions and Answers</a> article, specifically the Q&amp;A Question Checklist.  The missing information is critical to reproducing problems in a test environment and often indicates other factors that cause the undesirable outcome you are experiencing.</p>

							<div><p>Dear Stephen, by your completely useless and smug reply I assume it&#39;s perfectly normal for you to open a newly installed app and get an error from the get go. If simply getting the app to run requires multiple commands on Terminal (which didn’t solve the problem, by the way), I dread to think how much effort it will require to get an actual app functioning with Titanium.</p>
<p>I do understand the need for requirements before posting questions to avoid messy anarchy, but this is a very simple issue about opening Titanium. You clearly think of yourself as a Q&amp;A check-list-abiding user, which I think it’s a tad anal, but I get it, you need to draw the line somewhere, whatever. But maybe you haven’t read all 8 questions recently, or else you’d realize none of them are relevant in my case. Oh, wait, my bad–I can tell you my OSX, which is the latest! There now, without using magic, can you think of a thoughtful solution, or do you still think it requires divination?</p>
