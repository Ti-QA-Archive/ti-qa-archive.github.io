			<h1>Titanium camera call not saving GPS information</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m stuck - using standardish showCamera call, photos stored in to the camera roll have no GPS info.  They all seem to have different assets-library URLs, but all have same dimension and file size.  I&#39;m using the medialibrary component from the marketplace to view data in the debugger, but I don&#39;t really think it&#39;s his problem - the data is not being stored in the photos I take.  I can pull them in to iPhoto and they have no geo data.  Other pictures taken with the regular iPhone camera app - in the same location - have the correct geo data.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Titanium.Media.showCamera({
    saveToPhotoGallery : <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>,
    success : <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">event</span>) </span>{
        <span class="hljs-comment">// place our picture into our window</span>

            Ti.Media.hideCamera();
        $.cameraView.close();

    },
    cancel : <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{

							<p>Since around ios5, geo location is not available in the camera meta data for images&#x2F;videos pulled from the camera (or the gallery) by devs.  You can thank Apple for this.  If you want geo data, you will need to use the Ti geo calls and then package that with your image data.</p>

										<p><p>I think you&#39;ve misread the issue.  </p>
<p>When I take a picture with the camera via &#39;showCamera&#x2F;takePicture&#39;, the geo information is not saved with the image.  Looking at the image in any viewer that shows metadata, the lat&#x2F;lon are just &quot;0&quot;.  There&#39;s a whole host of info not there.  </p>
<p>And, FWIW, I&#39;m using a module from the marketplace called &quot;com.brf.medialibraryaccess&quot;, which does give me access to the metadata, which is how I first noticed this.  </p>
<p>When I look at a photo taken with the regular camera app, I see this metadata:</p>

</code></pre><p>There&#39;s a whole host of info missing in the titanium-captured camera pic, and I can&#39;t figure out why.  I&#39;ve not seen any info on this, and it&#39;s frustrating.  Every search for &quot;geo&quot; &quot;camera&quot; &quot;gps&quot; etc nets me the answer you posted - &quot;devs can&#39;t get access to the geo info from the camera roll&quot;, but that&#39;s <em>not</em> the problem I&#39;m facing - the geo information is <em>not captured</em> full stop.</p>
<p>Do we simply not get this information and I never noticed it before?  I don&#39;t <em>think</em> that&#39;s the case, but I might be wrong.</p>

										<p><p>I didn&#39;t suggest that you didn&#39;t know what you were doing or had no idea.  You seemed to respond to an issue that I don&#39;t think was in the question.</p>
<p><em>READING</em> the metadata is not the issue.  It&#39;s not being captured.  That is 100% wholly different.</p>
<p>Had I said &quot;hey, I can&#39;t read the exif data&quot;, your answer would have been accurate.  </p>
<p>My original post included &quot;the data is not being stored in the photos I take. I can pull them in to iPhoto and they have no geo data. Other pictures taken with the regular iPhone camera app - in the same location - have the correct geo data.&quot; I thought this accurately described the situation, which has nothing to do with trying to read exif information from within titanium (which, also, again, as I&#39;ve posted, I&#39;m using a third party module and I can in fact do if I needed to).  But that&#39;s not how you read the post, so perhaps the issue was on my part not being clear enough.</p>
<p>I was searching around for this issue a lot last night, and kept testing things - this was several hours wasted.  This morning, I&#39;ve expanded the search (after a good night&#39;s rest) and this is an issue with Apple&#39;s UIImagePickerController, so it seems.  <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;11367004&#x2F;64188">This post on StackOverflow</a> seems to sum up the issue:</p>
<p><strong>We have worked a lot with the camera and UIImagePickerController and, at least up to and including i OS 5.1.1, it does not return location data in the metadata for either photos or videos shot with UIImagePickerController.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It doesn&#39;t matter whether location services is enabled for the Camera app or not; this controls the Camera app&#39;s use of location services, not the camera function within UIImagePickerController.</strong></p>
<p>To that end, it seems Titanium is using the UIImagePickerController to expose the camera, and as such, normal metadata is not captured in the first place.  <em>Camera</em> app gets this, but the standard toolkit which many&#x2F;most apps use to create custom cameras don&#39;t get this info.  Further poking seems to indicate it&#39;s possible at least with ios&gt;4 to store custom metadata when saving to the photo gallery, but this isn&#39;t supported in titanium (yet?).</p>
<p>PART 2</p>
<p>Rereading this whole thing again - I focused on &quot;(or the gallery)&quot; from your post, Stephen.  You also had &quot;pulled from the camera&quot;, which didn&#39;t seem to be what I was doing.  And the bigger issue really is not that &quot;it&#39;s not available to devs&quot; - again, perhaps just the way <em>I</em> am reading this - but the SDK just does not provide this at all.    Overreaction on my part?  Perhaps a bit.  Rereading your reply, again, it still comes across as having not read the post, as the wording was more about &quot;you can&#39;t read it&quot; (which I can, when it&#39;s in the media), and didn&#39;t point to it wasn&#39;t provided <em>at all</em>.  </p>
<p>Honestly, having searched around for this for a long time, I&#39;d not seen any complete explanation of how these pieces fit together.  It seems to be pretty basic - Titanium uses UIImagePickerController on iOS for camera functionality, and GPS data is not provided to UIImagePickerController - but maybe having all these terms in one post will help someone else searching for the same issue later.</p>

							<p>Having reread this again, and spoken to a colleague about this, I didn&#39;t present the original question as clearly as I wanted to (posted late at night), and responded more curtly to Stephen than I meant to (&quot;you misread this&quot; was too accusatory - I didn&#39;t post as much original info as I should have, and that already indicated I dropped the ball in step 1).  Apologies to all for any negative vibes that were felt from this - they were not intentional.</p>
