			<h1>Distribute - App Store button suddenly does nothing</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I don&#39;t know what caused it, but the <code>Distribute - App Store</code> button in Titanium Studio doesn&#39;t work anymore. It just silently does nothing. The same goes for run on device. The console window does not change at all, and the OSX console application also does not show any Titanium related output.</p>
<p>I can run and debug in simulator just fine. I already tried</p>
<ul>
<li>changing the sdks, nothing works from 1.6.2 to the nightly builds from master</li>
<li>deleting titanium related things from ~&#x2F;Library</li>
<li>deleting titanium related things from &#x2F;Library</li>
<li>deleting my workspace and reimporting the project</li>
</ul>
<p>Right now I&#39;m reinstalling XCode. Yeah, desperation. </p>
<p>Has this happened to any of you? Was there an easier solution?</p>

							<div><p>After removing XCode using the provided uninstall script with –mode=all and reinstalling it through the App Store and reinstalling Titanium Studio, it worked again.</p>
<p>Reinstalling XCode was an adventure, by the way. In the &quot;Purchased&quot; section of the App Store I saw &quot;0 byte of 0 byte&quot; for the XCode download status, but it never started downloading. After killing both the App Store and <code>storeagent</code> and deleting their various plists from ~&#x2F;Library, it installed OK. </p>
<p>Weird day ;-)</p>

							<div><p>thanks for the tip - I gave it a go but still no joy :-(</p>
<p>It does now launch xcode, but I not that when it tries to access my keychain codesign is looking for a key called &#39;key&#39; which seems odd</p>

							<p>I have a similar problem, Distribute - App Store goes through the motions and then just stops. Viewing the logs it gets to perform Clean Build, asks for access to my key chain and then nothing happens.</p>
<p>baffled!</p>
