			<h1>Android 4.4.3 crash</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>A customer reported problems when running our app on his Nexus 5, newly updated to android 4.4.3. I read that the new version will cause problems for &quot;root&quot; apps, such as when reading files in the data library. We often read local files, but I can&#39;t test this since I don&#39;t have a device with 4.4.3, and there isn&#39;t a 4.4.3 emulator as yet. So, Titanium team, is there an issue in the file access routines? Are they using root? Or is there some other incompatibility with 4.4.3 I don&#39;t know about?<br>Thanks in advance for any ideas.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you for answering, Moiz. </p>
<p>App was built with Titanium 3.1.2.GA, for android 2.3.3 and including Ti.inappbilling 2.1. No problems with other customers up to 4.4.2, just the Nexus 5 that seems to have gotten the 4.4.3 “stealth” upgrade. I don’t have a 4.4.3 device, and there isn’t an emulator yet, so I don’t know where in the code the problem is.</p>
<p>I don’t have enough info to post a bug on JIRA, so I was throwing out a feeler to see if there are known issues with 4.4.3 and workarounds for them.</p>
<p>– Kipp</p>

										<p><p>But you should update the titanium sdk version for your application to 3.2.3, in the latest version they have support for android 4.4 Kitkat, and resolved many other bugs, so what I will suggest you is that you should also update your titanium sdk, it may also solve your problem.</p>
<p>If this helps you then please accept the answer, this may help other titanium developer in future.</p>

							<p>Hi Moiz -</p>
<p>OK, new build with Titanium 3.2.3.GA, targeting android 4.0.3. Customer with Nexus5 running 4.4.3 says &quot; I&#39;m encountering the same issue as before - blank screen when I pull up a quiz, and no way to exit out of blank screen except closing APP and restarting.&quot;</p>
<p>When they &quot;pull up a quiz&quot;, we&#39;re loading an HTML file from local storage into a webview. So - my first guess is the file isn&#39;t available. I saw internet posts about Kitkat altering access to the SD Card, but we&#39;ve had no word of problems from customers running 4.4.2 and below. Are there other file access issues with 4.4.3?<br>We&#39;re copying our distro files to Ti.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory, and expecting to read and write from there arbitrarily. Is there some new security measure we need for this?<br>Thanks,<br>Kipp</p>
