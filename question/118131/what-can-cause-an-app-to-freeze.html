			<h1>What can cause an App to freeze?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have been working on a mobile app, and lately it has started to freeze on the iPhone (simulator and devices) without any errors. It doesn&#39;t crash or throw any exception. It just freezes.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve started to add Ti.API.info logs everywhere, but the freeze seems to be random.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve disabled analytics tracking, and I still get a freeze.</p>
<p>The App is opening windows on init, then showing and hiding them. When clicking on buttons.</p>
<p>Memory available is still around 22mb when it freezes. The app doesn&#39;t respond to any interactions and is just frozen.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve searched this forum and have seen several users with freeze issues.<br>Is there any other way to be able to see what can cause this error?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve debugged using the console in xCode (which seems to be outputting the same as Titaniums log in Debug mode)</p>

							<p>When something like this happens to me, I usually start commenting everything, until it works again, and then I decomment the code a class at a time. I know, it&#39;s not an easy task, especially if your code is very complex, but you can give it a try. Have you tried to recreate the project from scratch?</p>
<p>EDIT: once I had a similar problem, I&#39;d added a letter with an accent as a comment, and didn&#39;t set the project in UTF8, my app crashed without an useful error message, and I solved it like I described it above.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Alberto, hopefully I can debug it with the new Titanium Studio. It seems promising.</p>
