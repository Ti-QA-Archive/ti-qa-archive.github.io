			<p>I am new to Titanium studio. I was working in X-code before this. I have some questions to be asked. If my questions are cleared, then I would like to purchase a membership from Appcelerator for development. Please give me the details about the deployment of the apps in iPhone and android….</p>
<ol>

<li>Is this like &quot;write once and run in both android and iOS platforms&quot;? 2. - Do we have to do any extra things beyond the Titanium studio to run the same code in both the frameworks?</li>

<li><p>Its not entirely write once and run on both platforms, even tho titanium does a great job at making the same code work for both platforms. An iPhone just is not an Android. In most cases you will need to make seperate code sections for Android and iPhone. Which is not difficult to make. Just look at the titanium kitchensink project. This will learn you the basic with ease and shows you what titanium is capable of.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Also tweetanium, a twitter app made in titanium, is 1 app that works great on both iPhone and Android. Its an open source app so you could look into their code for examples.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There arent more steps to deploy or run on device. I havent gone to the studio  version. But there will always remain an xcode project in the build folder. This you can open and then run on device or make an .ipa file the way you do it normally.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This one im still not 100% sure, but in the end you have an exacutable in Xcode and Java. Titanium compiles javascript code to their native code. If i recall on iPhone this was done on run time, but not so sure about that.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Correct me if im wrong somewhere, whole lot of info.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you very much for your answer. It helps me a lot to understand.</p>
<p>So you are saying that, if we want to make a project to run on both devices, we just want to code once and compile it there in titanium studio. then we will get the .app file and .apk file for iphone and android. so we can use thet app files to deploy our product. right?</p>
<p>Thank you<br>Sreekumar K U</p>

										<p><p>Yes thats right, but you should test and debug on a regular bases for both devices. </p>
<p>Don&#39;t expect your app to be 100% working on both devices without coding specificly for either devices.</p>
<p>In code you can simply ask what device it is running on and then run code for that device. In most cases there are some UI differences you need to sort out.</p>
<p>Other than that, when you have the .apk and .ipa files its the same procces as you would code in Xcode or Java.</p>

							<p>&gt; Is this like &quot;write once and run in both android and iOS platforms&quot;?</p>
<p>Pretty much, but not completely. Some code has to be specific for each platform because some conventions are different (tabs in Android are at the top, but in iPhone are at the bottom).  About 90% of the code should be the same though.</p>
<p>&gt; Do we have to do any extra things beyond the Titanium studio to run the same code in both the frameworks?</p>
<p>No. Just studio and the SDK of each platform.</p>
<p>&gt; What will be final output of the application?( will it be the same like in Xcode? if not please give details)</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure about the iPhone side, but on the android side you get a .apk file, which is basically the packaged app. I&#39;d say it&#39;s the similar in iPhone.</p>
