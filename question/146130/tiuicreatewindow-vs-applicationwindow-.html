			<h1>Ti.UI.createWindow vs ApplicationWindow ()</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>hello:<br> I have a new problem and to come back to you.<br>I&#39;m trying to make examples out there on the net, but all I find Ti.UI.createWindow used. When you create a project object appears ApplicationWindow () which I think is a window adapted to the device, but do not see how to relate, for example, TabGroup, or create more than one window … That is all ApplicationWindow () with Ti.UI.createWindow</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I think you are referring to the convenience function <strong>ApplicationWindow()</strong> this is meant to help you build apps in a more modular way, but can add confusion when you are looking for example code on the net.</p>
<p>Try creating a default project which does not use and convenience functions - this will make it easier when you are adding code from the net.</p>

										<p><p>This suggestion was to make it easier to to play with code you find on the net until you are comfortable with it, then you will be able to add it to your own app.</p>
<p>I always have the app I am working on and a test app so I can create things stand-alone and then place into the main app, improves error checking and removes dependence.</p>
<p>Just tips,</p>

										<p><p>I had not marked it is not the answer, is a solution for learning, but it solves the problem of the working platform. I&#39;m new to Android &#x2F; ios but with years of experience in other systems, and tried to jump stages … I deeply appreciate the time I&#39;ve spent, but waiting in case someone could give me more information.</p>
<p>As always, excuse my English. Is a translation of google</p>
