			<p>Hi, I have an existing app built prior to alloy.  As I make enhancements and add new screens can I make some parts of my app take advantage of allow without rewriting the app?</p>

							<div><p>Hello,</p>
<p>AFAIK, you can&#39;t mix alloy and non-alloy. In order to compile an alloy app, what will happen is: </p>
<ul>
<li>Take the alloy project, compile it from alloy to Classic Titanium Code</li>
<li>Take the Titanium Code and compile it to objective-c &#x2F; java source code.</li>
<li>Take the objective-c &#x2F; java and use native tools to compile it to binaries in iOS &#x2F; Android.</li>
</ul>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The difference between Alloy and non-alloy is structure of the app.  Alloy uses all the same language structures as not using Alloy - however there is separation between presentation, structure and code.</p>
<p>You can use most of your actual code that is non-UI related and in fact you can convert you UI based code and have a very limited use of Alloy structures.</p>
<p>However that would be missing out all of the benefits and only causing you lots of work with no benefit.</p>
<p>In order to use Alloy you really need to start again with your app a section at a time and bring your non-UI code back in as you go.  This sounds like a lot of work - and depending on the size and complexity of the app this may take a while.</p>
<p>BUT - you can end up with a better app because of it, and not just because of Alloy.  This will give you the time to break your app apart to find all the common UI and functions and then start building them into Alloy equivalents, done well, you end up with one of each, with one set of styles.</p>
<p>Then bring your code in and convert into CommonJS modules (for maximum re-use).</p>
<p>This should be done with caution as you may end up hating yourself and everything else - unless you really plan this out.</p>
<p>A good starting point would be to create a simple test app that features one part of your app only - then see the pain level.  If this works expand it to the whole app.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
