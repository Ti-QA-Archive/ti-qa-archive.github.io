			<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I am trying to configure titanium in my mac 10.9.7 with xcode 6.1 installed.</p>
<p>I see that as soon as i ru tistudio, it asks me to install required updates (node, npm, alloy and …) when i click install, takes my SU password and it shows trying to install node.js and progresses till 23-24% and suddenly disappears. when i go to command line and see, node -v command gives command not found, npm gives command not found. this means ti studio is unable to properly configure. also when i go to platform, ios sdk it does not appear with proper path. even i configured with xcode-switch and command went successfully, but the sdk does not appear. what is this problem and why is it not smooth ?</p>
<p>request for help setting up</p>
<p>is it possible my mac is having restricted permissions ? how was i able to install xcode and other stuffs with same password then ?</p>
<p>regards<br>jagat</p>

							<p>ok, i guess some permission issue was there, i installed ti studio 3.3 in another machine where i have full admin right, it installed fine, but i ran into other problems. in simple hello world problem, when i run for ios simulator, it shows progress bar dialog for a fraction second and then nothing happens. in settings, it has identified proper ios contents folder and selected ios 7.1 simulator in settings, still it does not run ! xcode independently runs a objc program fine in the 7.1 dimulator. i have also set android sdk, there it starts emulator, but emulator is black for long time and then times out ! the emulator runs independently from avd manager though</p>
<p>i am really having a hard time making any progress. !</p>

										<p><p>Hi J m, Request you to do not create new answer since your description is comment to the above one.</p>
<p>I will suggest for Android you need to increase timeout since native android emulators are pretty slow or use <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.genymotion.com&#x2F;">genymotion</a>.</p>
<p>How to increase timeout in android</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">
titanium config android<span class="hljs-class">.emulatorStartTimeout</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span>
</code></pre><p>For ios, Its quite strange behaviour. Try to clean and build the project again.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Narendra Raorane</p>

										<p><p>thanks, </p>
<p>it is so unfortunate that i am stuck ! i don&#39;t see log file in build directory !<br>what is the known best working ti studio version for mac 10.8.5 and xcode 5.1 ?</p>
<p>I see that ti sdk 3.5 GA appears in drop down in ti preference.</p>
<p>this is getting really frustrated to start</p>
