		<section>
			<p>Hey Guys! I&#39;ve created an app for both iOS and android on my mac and it was running perfectly. </p>
<p>Now I&#39;m working on windows and installed Titanium Studio 3.4.1 and installed various android SDK&#39;s including Android 5.0, 4.4.2, 4.1.2, 3.2.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve copied my app files from mac to windows and imported them into the studio. But whenever I run the project in android emulator. It gives me this inside the console:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[INFO] :   Found Titanium <span class="hljs-keyword">plugin</span> id=ti.alloy <span class="hljs-keyword">version</span>=1.0 
[<span class="hljs-keyword">ERROR</span>] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process <span class="hljs-keyword">exit</span> value was 1
</code></pre><p>and nothing else.</p>
<p>So, I don&#39;t know what the problem is.</p>
<p>Please help me out.</p>

							<div><p>Just in case (no promises :)<br>If you have installed a different Ti version on Windows (different from the version you have used to create your projects on Mac) and &quot;drag &amp; drop&quot; your project from MAC to Win, perhaps you should change the &lt;sdk-version&gt; tag on TiAPP.xml to the one you are working now.<br>I have spent 2 hours with this stupid thing… I have change this and everything was ok…</p>

							<p>Hello Amaresh,</p>
<p>Thanks for your inquiry. There are some reasons for &quot;Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 1&quot; this error to occur. Maybe emulator is getting timed out, or you need a clean build.</p>
<p>Here are some steps you should follow.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Restart your PC and try to run it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>just clean your project and try to run it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be careful of path follow this <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Software_Locations_and_Environment_Variables">link</a> after installing node if show node problem just restart your PC.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>if anything not work……</p>
<p>You just uninstall node and titanium studio and delete the supported file .titanium, .android, .eclipse from C&gt; User &gt;your PC Name this location and titanium studio folder also this location C&gt; User &gt;your PC Name &gt;appData. And after all re-install it and update the node and CLI completely, and set the android sdk path then restart PC and run it again. This <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Installation_and_Configuration">Document</a> can help you. If you are building alloy project then install Alloy 1.5.1 with Titanium. To do that Run </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">sudo npm install -g alloy@<span class="hljs-number">1.5</span><span class="hljs-number">.1</span>
sudo npm install -g titanium@<span class="hljs-number">3.4</span><span class="hljs-number">.1</span>
</code></pre><p>Also it&#39;s faster to use Genymotion virtual devices (or emulators) to test Android applications. It is an alternative to the Android SDK&#39;s native Android Virtual Device manager. Genymotion emulators run a lot faster than the native Android emulators. Here is the link to configure <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Installing_Genymotion">Genymotion</a> with Titanium.</p>
<p>Also, here are some similer community issues with the same error.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;140526&#x2F;solution-application-installer-abnormal-process-termination">Link1</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;142108&#x2F;error-application-installer-abnormal-process-termination-process-exit-value-was-1">Link2</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;45331&#x2F;timed-out-waiting-for-emulator-to-be-ready-why">Link3</a>.</p>
<p>Hope this helps you. Feel free to ask any following issues. Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>@Amimul Hossain I&#39;ll try your solution now…but I&#39;ve created a default two tabbed alloy application and it runs perfectly. Does that mean there is a problem with the project itself?</p>

										<p><p>@Namrata You can Try&#39;n create a new project on windows and copy all the files inside of the app folder into this new one. And run the new project.</p>
<p>I know its not the best solution but at least you can move forward with your project.</p>
<p>And if you are looking for a better solution, then you may try these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean the project and build.</li>
<li>Check the target SDK version under tiapp.xml</li>
<li>Make sure all the targeted android SDK&#39;s are installed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

										<p><p>@Namrata I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s the main problem here, that you can&#39;t know for sure what is actually causing the crash.</p>
<p>Have you tried creating a new project that I suggested?</p>

										<p><p>@Amaresh yes i tried it. I am still stuck. I think it must be because i am using a customized theme. But then how it runs on MAC?</p>

										<p><p>@Namrata By customized theme do you mean replacing native bars with custom views?<br>I&#39;m doing the same with my app also, creating a custom tabBar, navBar etc. It works fine for me.</p>
<p>Can you post your tiapp.xml file, so I can take a look?</p>

										<p><p>@Namrata you haven&#39;t mentioned the sdk version to use for the project.</p>
<p>Try adding this </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">&lt;uses-sdk <span class="hljs-string">android:</span>minSdkVersion=<span class="hljs-string">"14"</span> <span class="hljs-string">android:</span>targetSdkVersion=<span class="hljs-string">"19"</span>/&gt;

										<p><p>@Namrata I don&#39;t think that there is a problem in code. Whenever this type of error shows up, it is generally with the app files rather than the controllers.</p>
<p>You could try commenting out your android related code and see if it works.<br>OR you could create a new project in titanium studio and then copy its tiapp.xml file and replace your tiapp.xml file with it.<br>But make  a backup first. And then try adding one functionality at a time until you are faced with the same error.</p>
<p>I know this is not a great solution but there&#39;s no harm in trying…</p>
<p>And also check your theme folder location and its name. </p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
