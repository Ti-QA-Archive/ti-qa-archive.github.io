							<p>Hello Djamel, </p>
<p>I will post in the answers section this time so I really get my point across. You really need to have a look at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;ask">the guidelines to follow</a> when asking a question. you and I both know this is not the first time people from the community had to ask you to be more explicit.</p>
<p>You are also probably aware that people here are taking the time (on their own free time by the way) to help other developers who have (legitimate) questions. All that for <strong>free</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, it can only seem <em>fair</em> to those same people to give them as much information as possible so they can help you to the best of their knowledge. Without having to go back and forth with you through lengthy exchanges where you ask a small fragment of your question and then ask a subsidiary question (again, again and again). All that traffic only blurs the message and <strong>could have been avoided</strong> if you took the time to put all the information your were looking for in your original post. </p>
<p>I sincerely hope you get my point and that you will keep contributing to the community. Not only by asking questions, but also giving answers to other developers in need of help. You&#39;ve been in this community for a while now (almost 18 months) so I am confident that the knowledge you gained over that time would greatly benefit the community.</p>
<p>As they say in Canada: <code>No hard feelings hey!</code></p>
<p>See you around Djamel</p>
