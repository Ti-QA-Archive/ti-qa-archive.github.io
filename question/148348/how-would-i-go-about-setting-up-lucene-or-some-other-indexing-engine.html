			<h1>How would I go about setting up Lucene or some other indexing engine?</h1>

			<p>I&#39;m looking to build an app that can search a large quantity of text files. My best option at the moment is to process them as paragraphs into a sqlite db, add the fts plugin to my app and use fts queries on the database to return my results. The only issue is sqlite fts doesn&#39;t do edit-distance results on individual words. So my app&#39;s users will have to spell the words of their query exactly as it appears in the texts they&#39;re searching. This limitation might greatly impact the amount of relevant results. This isn&#39;t a horrible alternative, but if I could use Lucene or a similar engine it would meet my needs perfectly. </p>
<p>Has anyone had experience using it or a similar engine? How did you get it set up?</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve looked into solr in previous projects, it&#39;s definitely something I keep my eye on. However I do need <strong>offline</strong> searching. This will need to work with offline iPads, iPod touch and so on. Thanks for the suggestion though.</p>

							<p>If your objective is the searching in very big datasets, trhe solr lucene is a good choice. You can speak with solr machine over http. Please look to solr REST API.</p>
