<p>NavigationWindows seem to appear on top of each other in the order in which they are opened. Setting the zIndex property on them in Alloy XML files, TSS files, or via JavaScript seems to have no effect at all. Regardless of what the zIndex is set to the NavigationWindow opened most recently is always on top of all other NavigationWindows and elements. Changing the zIndex programmatically has no effect either.</p>
<p>See this gist for a super simple Alloy example that demonstrates this problem: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;ShawnCBerg&#x2F;8271743">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;ShawnCBerg&#x2F;8271743</a></p>

It sounds like you have a pretty clear regression case. As Trevor stated, you may need to have a little back in forth with the engineers on the ticket as NavigationWindow is purposely different than NavigationGroup in some ways, but since NavigationWindow was put forth as a true replacement (since NavigationGroup is gone), your expectation of being able to use most of the same behavior is warranted.</p>

							<p>Im confused. This is not a problem.</p>
<p>It is the way the whole architecture works.</p>
<p>You open a window, it is added to the window stack, you open another it is put onto of the first.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Trevor,</p>
<p>I understand how windows open <em>inside</em> of a NavigationWindow. This is a problem with the NavigationWindow elements themselves not stacking properly. I have multiple NavigationWindows that I need to set the zIndex of so they are stacked properly but the zIndex is ignored. Take a peek at the gist linked above and you&#39;ll see what I mean.</p>
<p>All of this worked fine with NavigationGroups (now deprecated).</p>

										<p><p>Trevor,</p>
<p>His issue is that NavigationWindow is not a (direct&#x2F;complete) replacement for NavigationGroups.  If NavigationWindows are to always be full screen, never have siblings, then a number of their properties and methods need to be removed.  Either zIndex is broken with NavigationWindows or zIndex doesn&#39;t apply to NavigationWindows. If the first, it needs fixed.  If the latter, then docs need to be updated.</p>
