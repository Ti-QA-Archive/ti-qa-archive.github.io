			<h1>Build size too large in Titanium Appcelerator</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,<br>How to reduce build(apk) size using titanium appcelerator in SDK 2.1.4  or 3.0.Actual class size and resource size is less than 2 MB where as we get 9 MB apk file. Is there a way to use proguard to achieve less size. Kindly suggest a way to reduce build size without decrementing the SDK to 1.7 or 1.8.<br>Note: compressed png images are using.</p>

							<p>Hello Senthil,</p>
<p>If you search the Q&amp;A you&#39;ll find many people have the same size concerns.</p>
<p>Here are my observations about the APK and app size since I too have been looking into this.</p>
<p>With SDK 1.8.x you generally for even the most basic app (ie default template app) end up with a 5.2Mb APK file. If you unpack the APK, it expands to between 11Mb and 12Mb. The files that make the APK and app so big are the v8 libraries of which there are two, each library is about 5.2Mb big. The reason there are two libraries is (from what I can tell) is that there is one library for older device architecture and one for newer device architecture. So if you want to use SDK 1.8.x and the V8 javascript engine you&#39;re stuck with these files sizes.</p>
<p>One way to drop the file size is to either use SDK 1.7.5 or not use the V8 javascript engine.</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t need the updates, bug fixes and speed of SDK 1.8.x then you can shrink a basic app&#39;s APK file size to about 2Mb, the expanded folder size will be about 4Mb.</p>
<p>If you want to use SDK 1.8.x then you can choose to use the Rhino javascript engine rather than the V8 engine. Not using the V8 engine, you loose it&#39;s speed and other optimisation related features but app still work fine. SDK 1.7.5 uses the Rhino engine BTW. So if you use SDK 1.8.x with the Rhino javascript engine for a basic app the APK file size ends up being also about 2.1Mb and the unpacked size of about 4.2Mb.</p>
<p>So as you can see from my experimentation there are really just two ways to cut down the APK file size, use S.D.K 1.7.5 or use S.D.K 1.8.x with Rhino. The V8 javascript engine will add about 3Mb to your APK size, and 6Mb to your unpacked app size, but for that you get additional javascript execution speed and other optimisations.</p>
<p>As for optimisations outsize the SDK, you can look at optimising the file resources that are included in your app. For example some images might be smaller as JPGs rather than PNGs, some images might be smaller as indexed GIFs or PNGs rather than 24bit JPG or PNG files. Obviously you also want to remove any unused files from your resources directory. You can also host some resources (images, videos, etc) online rather than including them in the app, this would require that you download them once off or reference them as the app needs them, this obviously means that your app would need internet connectivity to run.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Your app size is actually small.  A large percentage of your app size made up by the required libraries that support the app.</p>
<p>I would suggest you compare a new default project build with the size of yours.  Just create a new default project and go straight to the build.  The size of this app is the smallest you will ever get your app.  As this includes all the standard libraries and support materials.</p>
<p>The difference between your app and the test app is the margin you can tweak.</p>
<p>Your JavaScript files are automatically minified during the build process, so you are left with the obvious targets to reduce, which looks like you have a good grasp of.</p>
<p>It sounds like you are probably doing all you can do right now.</p>

							<p>There is no magic which can be done to reduce the size much, but try looking at your resources and place the images and other stuff which are platform specific in platform specific folder, if not.</p>
