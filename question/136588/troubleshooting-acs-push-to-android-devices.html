			<h1>Troubleshooting ACS push to Android devices</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I was working with Push notifications last week and got them configured, got my device registered, and was able to send&#x2F;receive push notifications to the device. Now I login to ACS and see that I am still registered, I start my app on the device and I send a notification, but it is not received on the device. I un-subscribed then re-subscribed from my app, and that was reflected properly in the push notification status (ie. it said &quot;0 Android client subscribed to push notifications&quot; when I unsubscribed, then &quot;1 Android client subscribed to push notifications&quot; when I subscribed, so the device is registered. I have my application reporting to me that the deviceToken is registered. Still no notification to the device.</p>
<p>Please remember that <strong>THIS WORKED</strong> last week… </p>
<p>So the question is, how can you troubleshoot where things are going wrong? Not sure where to start here.</p>
<p>Any advice appreciated.</p>
