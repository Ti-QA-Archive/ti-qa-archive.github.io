			<h1>Images &amp; Localization strings disappear in &#34;live app&#34;</h1>

			<p>iOS 9, iPhone 6, latest xcode 7, SDK 5.0.0</p>
<p>Hello, this is really weird but I uploaded my app as usual through xcode to itunesconnect. Everything went fine, but when the app got approved by apple and released it to appstore; it didnt contain any images nor localization strings (i18n) at all. I can just see the identification strings everywhere (The name that I give to each label).</p>
<p>I dont know what&#39;s wrong, so I tried to upload it again but this time I tested it on the device just to be sure. Everything looks fine. Then I uploaded it through xcode, and downloaded it to my iPhone through Testflight.</p>
<p>I still doesnt work, no images. Everything works great but as I said 12 times already there&#39;s no images.</p>
<p>Anyone who might have a clue about this?</p>

							<p>It seems that the images and localizations doesnt get bundled. Is there no one who ever had the same problem?!</p>
<p>Now I&#39;ve upgraded to El Capitan, no progress. I&#39;ve even re-installed Studio + Xcode with nothing new to report..</p>
