		<section>
			<p>My app has a handful of windows. After each of those windows is created, I have code whose intent is to lock those windows in portrait mode:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">win</span> = Ti.UI.createWindow({ ... });
<span class="hljs-keyword">win</span>.orientationModes = [ Ti.UI.PORTRAIT ];
</code></pre><p>I still can&#39;t believe that there isn&#39;t a more universal way of doing this for Android, but that&#39;s a gripe for another day. :-) For now, this is <em>mostly</em> working. I&#39;m hoping someone here can help me remove the <em>mostly</em> qualifier.</p>
<p>The app opens with a tab group containing 4 tabs. If I rotate my device as soon as the default active tab is loaded, the layout rotates as well. Oops. In fact, if I go immediately to <em>any</em> of those tabs and rotate my device, the layout rotates. More oops.</p>
<p>However – and this is the fun part – if I relaunch the app and jump first to a secondary window, one loaded from one of the tab windows, and rotate my phone, no display rotation. Yay! Now I jump back to any of the tab windows, the ones that were rotating before, they no longer rotate.</p>
<p>Wat?!</p>
<p>That&#39;s the pattern I think I&#39;m seeing right now. Anyone seen this before? I&#39;m guessing that it&#39;s a tab group thing, but I don&#39;t see any orientation accessors in the API. Any guidance would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<div><p>I tried one custom manifest solution, but at the end of the day, I still have to make the change for every activity, but then, even worse, remember to do the same for any activities that may get added later. It&#39;s easier to remember, I think, if it&#39;s just part of the window creation process.</p>

							<p>Android orientation is tied to the activities, as Rob noted. In the tiapp.xml (or AndroidManifest), you&#39;re essentially defining what orientations the app could take. In your JavaScript, you have the opportunity to specify which orientation a specific window will support. As I think you&#39;ve found, one is essentially a subset of the other.</p>
<p>This is handled similarly on iOS. In the tiapp.xml you specify the orientations the app could take; in your JS you specify the orientation for a window. The syntax is a whole lot simpler, of course, because you just add (or remove) the XML tags.</p>
<p>I suggest you manage the app&#39;s orientation as late as possible in the dev cycle. Alternatively, you should periodically update the tiapp.xml by removing all the &lt;manifest&gt; stuff, regenerating the AndroidManifest.xml, and moving that content back to tiapp.xml.</p>

										<p><p>Okay, so if I understand correctly, it sounds like my only option is to open <code>build&amp;#x2F;android&amp;#x2F;AndroidManifest.xml</code>, copy the <code>activity</code> contents to the <code>android &amp;gt; manifest</code> parent in my <code>tiapp.xml</code> file and make the orientation changes to those lines. And then, of course, maintain this over time.  Does that sound about right?</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s the &quot;preferred&quot; method because it keeps all your configuration in one place – the tiapp.xml file. You can also use a custom manifest by copying build&#x2F;android&#x2F;AndroidManifest.xml to platform&#x2F;android&#x2F;AndroidManifest.xml. Again, you&#39;d need to maintain that over time. And you&#39;d have to manually merge any changes (such as version numbers) from tiapp.xml to your custom manifest file.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, Tim. It&#39;s a little more pain than I had hoped, but it does seem to be working to fix the orientation.</p>
