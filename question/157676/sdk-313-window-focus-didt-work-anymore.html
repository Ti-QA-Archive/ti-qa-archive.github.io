							<p>I have a similar problem on ios7, using sdk 3.1.3:<br>I implemented the new NavigationWindow to replace a NavGroup as instructed here: (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2013&#x2F;09&#x2F;be-ready-for-ios-7-with-titanium-3-1-3-rc.html), and none of the windows fire the &#39;blur&#39; event.</p>

										<p><p>i tested it a little further. the blur and focus events fire normally in the NavigationWindow if there is not another window rendered. So if you render a window over the navigation window, then it will not fire the blur and focus events.  They seem to work fine if the navigation window is the only open window.</p>

							<p>I have the same problem. Focus events do not seem to be firing at all in 3.1.3 on iOS. Everything is fine on 3.1.2. It&#39;s a shame that with the Titanium SDK updates seem to introduce regressions with worrying regularity.</p>

							<p>Hi Gabriel, Filipe, Alex, Marvin, I also had this problem for my app. I also retooled the navigationGroup into the new navigationWindow and since I also had a so-called &#39;Toast-notification&#39;-module running in the app (showing those nifty temporarily messages to a user), which opened with a <code>Ti.UI.createWindow(...),open()</code> - method (and after a few (1.5) seconds closed automatically) suddenly all the blur&#x2F;focus events didn&#39;t call anymore, breaking the app. </p>
<p>So this thread actually helped me looking into the right direction. Thank you. Here is my workaround:</p>
<p>What I did was replacing the second createWindow, (The message window (HUD-module)), with a View. And adding this view to the NavigationWindow, so it would always be on top of the navigationWindow, but as a view, not a Window. </p>
<p>Maybe this is something you guys can also implement as a workaround for your hamburger menu and other multiple window shizzle. Just adding the sidebar as a view instead of a seperate window. </p>
<p>cheers!</p>
