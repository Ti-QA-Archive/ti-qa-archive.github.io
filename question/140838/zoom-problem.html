							<div><p>Hi Ankur</p>
<p>We cannot possibly help you with the amount of information you have provided so far.</p>
<p>Anything we try will simply be a guess.  We can probably help you - but for us to do this - you need to help us.</p>
<p>Please provide a code sample that we can easily paste into our own test apps so we may reproduce you issue.  By all means simplify your code if it long - just make sure what you provide can be run and reproduces the issue you are seeing.</p>
<p>When you provide code - please add three <code>~</code> symbols above the top line of code and another three <code>~</code> below the last line of code.  This way we can read the code with ease and do not have to spend lots of time working out how it should have looked - or worse an error appears <em>because</em> it was posted as plain text.</p>
<p>Also in this case a couple of screen-shots would be very useful.  One of each window - so we can see exactly what you are talking about.  Use a service like <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;droplr.com&#x2F;">droplr.com</a> to upload your images - it will give you a short url we can use to see the images.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
