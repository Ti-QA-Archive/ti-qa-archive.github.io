			<h1>Android focus events (again) - onload?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,<br>I have an app in the Android store which loads remote data into different tabs.</p>
<p>The first page gets &#39;latest&#39; another tab gets &#39;nearby&#39; etc etc</p>
<p>This to worked on the tab &#39;focus&#39; event.</p>
<p>I am now working on the next version that addresses some minor bugs. But it seems that the focus event is no longer working.</p>
<p>In the meantime I have had to replace my computer due to a hardware failure but created a new app in Titanium and copied code into it.</p>
<p>The version of titanium has increased to 1.7 and the Android SDK stuff is up from 10 to 11.</p>
<p>Since focus events are so flakey what is the best practise for loading data when a tab or window is first shown…. i.e. before ANY USER INTERACTION as it would change the design alot to put a big button in the middle and arguably make it a pretty poor user experience.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jez</p>

							<p>To make this fire on load of the apps &#x2F; tabs, i simply removed the event listener wrapper around my call to get the data.. .this means that the data does not update when you leave and return to the tab but it also means that the app functions and does not leave the user with a blank screen on certain tabs (not blank, but data free).</p>
<p>A workaround, but really tab focus events need fixing up .. </p>

							<p>I use similar design and to my knowledge, android child win event on tab such as focus&#x2F;blur event is dead since some version back in 1.60, and still not working with latest 1.8.0 beta. </p>
<p>I have wasted days of coding trying to manipulate code with similar outcome without success. Subscribed. </p>

										<p><p>There have been tickets opened and closed again for this, it seems that things don&#39;t stay fixed on updates… yet we always get told to use the nightly builds.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t want to turn this into a gripe about Appcelerator - it is good and I appreciate the work the guys do, but this kind of thing (along with out of date docs, brief info about things in the developer blog [e.g. jss] etc) is why i wont subscribe to the indie or pro developer packages, things need to be more stable as this is a tool for development for real world clients, not a hobby.</p>

										<p><p>Agreed. Features are consistently broken with every new update. As a developer, it&#39;s a pain as i&#39;ve lost truth in TI&#39;s quality control. That&#39;s mean most time on my ends to validate codes, new or old, and yeah, the doc is pathetic.</p>

							<p>The only event that does seem to fire consistently is the focus event on the TabGroup.  I am listening for this and then firing an event to the window of the tab that is the activeTab and then updating my view from there.</p>

										<p><p>I tried this and the event did not seem to fire. Maybe i need to add the additional event fire to the window of the tab index.<br>It would be great if there was recommended way to do this from Titanium, instead of out of date API docs.</p>
<p>Thanks anyway.</p>
