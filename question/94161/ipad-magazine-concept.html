			<h1>iPad magazine concept</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>We&#39;re designing a simple magazine app for the iPad and would greatly appreciate some feedback regarding on how the magazine pages are handled. </p>
<p>At the moment, we&#39;re converting the magazine pdf to jpegs (pngs are too big! ~1mb per page) and displaying those pages in a ScrollableView. </p>
<p>Apart from having the magazine data in pure text,images,templates etc. (like ePub designs), we&#39;re just wondering if this bundle-of-images is a valid approach, or if there&#39;s a better way of doing this ?</p>

							<div><p>This conversation it very topical.  Thanks for asking.  I&#39;ve been dealing with this as well.  Looking at &quot;Esquire&quot; app it looks like they&#39;re using an HTML5 approach, however, this &quot;webview&quot; has been said to take up a lot of resources, so the alternative has been to do it using &quot;native&quot; controls and display.  Any comment on native vs HTML 5 would be appreciated.  </p>
<p>Also, I&#39;m using ScrollableViews to navigate right to left, but I&#39;m having a more difficult time going vertically &quot;within&quot; a story.  Any thoughts on the best way to handel nav to get a &quot;wired&quot; &quot;esquire&quot; type behavior.   </p>
<p>Much thanks</p>

							<p>Hi there, just to help a friend&#39;s company did develop a specific software for ipad magazine.The approach is similar to yours. they developed two sides, the ipad side with player that is basically a jpg based magazine with hot spot.<br>Hot spots are element the combines audio, video, 3d player and so on. The other side is the editor, a web based application that import the jpg image of the paper plus the ability to add hotspots.</p>
<p>Consider that:<br>1)a normal issue is about or more than 200 mbyte. (that is acceptable for the editor)<br>2) the included the inapp purchase. They manage a publishing server that the editor (the owner of the newspaper)uses to publish their issues.</p>
<p>Based on my experience i can say that your approach actually is the standard usesd in this moment. if you do not have specific skill in the editor&#39;s area let say that they do not think much more complex than a pdf translation of their magazine. (except bit magazine like time, sport illustrated that plan a division to manage online content on ipad.</p>
