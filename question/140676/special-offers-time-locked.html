			<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I was wondering if anyone knows how the stuff McDonalds have in their app works.</p>
<p>They have an offer for a cup of coffe and to get you&#39;d have to swipe your finger in front of the cashier.<br>When you do that a picture comes up that says that your offer has expired.</p>
<p>After 2 weks or something you can do it again.</p>
<p>Is that possible with titanium? To do a special offer thingy like that that locks in the same way?</p>
<p>Here is the McApp link if you&#39;d like to check it out.<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunes.apple.com&#x2F;se&#x2F;app&#x2F;mcdonalds-sverige&#x2F;id322810359?mt=8</p>

							<p>This is something you would want to store server-side… otherwise people could just un&#x2F;reinstall the app to get more offers.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;d create or use a user system where people could create accounts. I&#39;d also have a redemption history for the user. Then, when they viewed an offer, I&#39;d check their history, and see if they were eligible again.</p>
<p>The added bonus of a redemption history is the historical data for future uses, like targeted marketing.</p>

										<p><p>Yes that sounds fair enough but the thing is how to do it without creating accounts.</p>

										<p><p>If you want to do it without accounts, you&#39;re pretty much stuck. On iOS, users could get around your virtual restrictions by un&#x2F;reinstalling the app. On Android, all you&#39;d have to do is delete the app data in the application manager. I guess it comes down to how much you need to protect your offers.</p>

							<p>Hi Richard</p>
<p>I have downloaded the app to find the section you are talking about but I am not sure where the section you are talking about is to see if there is anything special.</p>
<p>Can you provide a screenshot - use something like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;droplr.com&#x2F;hello">droplr.com</a>.</p>
<p>But I think Shannon is right, apps like this (I produce a few myself) usually create a feed to a webserver for &#39;offers&#39;, in that feed it includes at least; a title, graphic, value and expiration date.  The device simply reads that and will only show it until the expiration date has exceeded.  If the offer is redeemed then the the app store the used ID or marks the offers database table row as redeemed.  That way the app will no longer offer the single use voucher again - if that is what we are talking about.</p>
<p>It is also possible for the app to fire back to the server the redemption of that offer and the location of where it was redeemed.  It will normally do this next time it seeks data.  It is good for checking success criteria for marketing people.</p>
