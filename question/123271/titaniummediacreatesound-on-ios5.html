			<h1>Titanium.Media.createSound on iOS5</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Has anyone tried using Ti.Media.createSound on iOS5?  I have a simple app that just basically plays an audio file, however it doesn&#39;t make a sound anymore on iOS5.</p>
<p>The code is simple, basically this:</p>
<p><code>var file1 = Titanium.Filesystem.getFile(Titanium.Filesystem.resourcesDirectory,&amp;#39;audio&amp;#x2F;sample.aif&amp;#39;);
var sound1 = Titanium.Media.createSound({sound:file1});
sound1.play();</code></p>
<p>My app is in the app store and works fine on iOS 4.x as well as the emulator.  But on iOS5 simply nothing happens - no sound is played.</p>
<p>I did have at the top of my app the following which seems to have no effect on my app in 4.x but in iOS5 it makes the difference between other standard controls having any audio.  (for example the spinner control makes a clicking sound, however if this line is present in app.js then the spinner no longer clicks)</p>
<p><code>Ti.Media.defaultAudioSessionMode = Ti.Media.AUDIO_SESSION_MODE_PLAYBACK;</code></p>
<p>Thanks for any help</p>

Thus, kindly raise any issues, comments or feedback about Apple beta software in the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;devforums&#x2F;">Official Forum</a> instead.

										<p><p>I didn&#39;t think my question violates the NDA, but I can respect that you guys have to be cautious.  could somebody tell me if my Titanium code has an obvious error in it regardless of iOS version?  The documentation on Media is very slim.</p>

										<p><p>Jake,</p>
<p>My suggestion is to repost your question and code and remove any reference to iOS5 or any other beta software.</p>
