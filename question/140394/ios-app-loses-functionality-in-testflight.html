			<h1>ios app loses functionality in TestFlight</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have an app developed with Appcelerator, and the iOS version has been tested both in the emulator and on my iPod through a cable.  My Titanium studio build is: 2.0.1.201204132053.  My iPod Os version is 5.1.1.  My xcode version is 4.2.  My problem is:  a crucial function in my app does not work when distributed through TestFlight.  Basically, I press a button and nothing happens.  I will instrument the code to see exactly what is going on, but i&quot;m wondering if anyone has an idea what could cause this?  It seems unlikely that it could be caused by the distribution process.  Also, is there a log that I can get from the iPod that would help explain what is going on.  Thanks.</p>
<p>Susan</p>

							<p>Hi Susan,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been using Testflight for the past 3 or 4 apps and haven&#39;t experienced any major issues as of yet.</p>
<p>What version of the Testflight SDK are you using? I use a module (paid for) from the Appcelerator Marketplace which is working nicely.</p>
<p>Are you uploading the builds through their website or via their desktop app? The desktop app also uploads the error files as well for easy crash reporting. This might help identify any issues.</p>
<p>Simon</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m also using the TestFlight SDK from the Appcelerator Marketplace. It works great. It will take any errors or Ti.API.info() logs you make and store them in their web client.</p>
<p>The most likely cause is that you are getting an error or exception on the device. TestFlight will give you visibility into what&#39;s causing it.</p>

										<p><p>May sound like &#39;me too&#39; but the TestFlight module from the Marketplace has been a great investment for us.  I have only occasionally noted a delay if the testflight servers are having an issue or the connectivity of the device is questionable.</p>
<p>Testlflight in its most basic form is simply easing the process of ad hoc distribution. If that is all you are doing, then Testflight isn&#39;t actually adding any code to your project.</p>
<p>If you are including the Testflight SDK which helps with monitoring, feedback, crash logging, then Testflight does have code in your app.</p>
<p>Post some snippets of code relating to your button event in addition to the answers Simon has asked for.</p>

							<p>You can check the logs by opening <code>xcode =&amp;gt; window =&amp;gt; organizer =&amp;gt; &amp;lt;select your device&amp;gt; =&amp;gt; expand menu =&amp;gt; console</code>  this is likely the same console, which you see in TiStudio.</p>

							<p>I looked at the app log in xcode, and this is what I saw:</p>
<p>Exception Type:  EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGBUS)<br>Exception Codes: EXC_ARM_DA_ALIGN at 0x003fffff</p>
<p>I solved the problem by using a development provisioning profile instead of a distribution provisioning profile, something that is alleged not to work at all.  So far I haven&#39;t used the TestFlight sdk – I&#39;ll look into it.</p>

										<p><p>It&#39;s definitely worth using it, here is the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;744">link to the marketplace</a>.</p>
<p>The developer is really friendly and replies quickly to if you have any trouble.</p>

							<p>Just wanted to also let people know we have a <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;4114">TestFlight module in the Marketplace</a>. Mainly developed as it has a slightly different deployment model allowing the use whichever SDK version you want. We use it ourselves and let me do things like enable the Area51 features in the latest v1.2 SDK</p>
