			<h1>Since Studio 3.2.0 - it&#39;s not finding my Android SDK</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Just today, Ti Studio has decided to not be able to find any Android SDK in the location I have specified (and where it has always been).</p>
<p>In Preferences &gt; Studio &gt; Platform &gt; Android the message is : &quot;[Android SDK Home] No Android SDKs were found under the specified SDK location&quot;</p>
<p>My SDK is located at &#x2F;opt&#x2F;android-sdk<br>My NDK is located at &#x2F;opt&#x2F;android-ndk </p>
<p>I have Android SDK versions 2.0 (API 6) all the way up to 4.3 (API 18) installed. </p>
<p>The required 2.3.x version are installed where they always have been.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve seen a few other people have this issue to, but no clear solution.</p>
<p>Anyone have any other ideas as to why this has just decided to stop working?</p>

							<p>On Windows 7, I fixed the issue by adding the npm directory to my path and then restarting titanium.</p>
<p>C:\Users[User]\AppData\Roaming\npm</p>
<p>Once you add the directory you have to restart titanium.</p>

							<p>I have solved this. It&#39;s actual pretty simple. The cause of the problem is that Titanium Studio is not calling things by their name. What caused the confusion for me when I first encountered this problem was that a message was saying: An Android SDK is missing. Titanium requires Android platform 5.0</p>
<ol>
<li>There is not such thing called Android platform 5.0</li>
<li>In the error message, they really mean, Android SDK API 5. Not that I didn&#39;t write API 5.0</li>
<li>Because of point 2 above, the 5.0 will mislead people and make then thing of the Android version which is currently at 4.4.x for KitKat.</li>
<li>If Titanium know which Android SDK API Level is absolutely required, why not make it available in the list of checkboxes and check it by default? That&#39;s a no-brainer.</li>
</ol>
<p>THE SOLUTION: Install the Android API Level 5 using the Android SDK Manager using the following steps …</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Open the Android SDK Manager. This is done from the command line by running the script tools&#x2F;android in the Android sdk folder. Since my Android SDK is located at ~&#x2F;android-sdk-macosx, I had to do the following</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>~<span class="hljs-regexp">/android-sdk-macosx/tools</span><span class="hljs-regexp">/android</span>
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>IMPORTANT: The Android API 5 is deprecated so you will not see it in the list. To solve that, make sure that you select <strong>Sort by: API Level</strong> and check the <strong>Obsolete</strong> checkbox, then scroll in the list of packages and select and install everything under <strong>Android 2.0 (API 5)</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Restart Titanium studio and check thet status of the Android SDKs. If you already had the Android SDKs, you can simply specify the path of the previously installed Android SDK and Voilà. If no, you can start downloading whatever version you like. It&#39;s much more pleasant to work with once you get passed that nightmare.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Have fun.</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s unfortunate. Can you tell us more about the messages you are getting? It might help. Also, does it used to work? Do you have the environment variable set? etc.</p>
<p>In my case, I used to have a working environment since 3.1.0 which go upgrades to 3.1.1, 3.1.2, then 3.1.3. Then with 3.2.0, all hell broke loose until this solution solved it.</p>
