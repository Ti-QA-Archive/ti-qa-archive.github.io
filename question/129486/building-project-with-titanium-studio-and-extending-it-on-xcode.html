			<p>I have created a black application in titanium studio for iphone. on running it shows its default view i.e a view with 2 tabBars. now i opened the project on xcode and i can see that native code of my project.<br>what i need is that, now i want to develop or extend the project using xcode not titanium studio. I want to add some controls to the view that titanium created for me.<br>Or i want to add another tabBar using xcode, How can I do that.</p>

							<p>simply put, you cannot. appcelerator was not designed to work that way</p>

										<p><p>but what about the extension they talk about?? they(appcelerator) say that you can extend your application using objective C or other lang. you can use Xcode also.<br>What if i want to implement a feature in my app that is more easy to implement in native code rather that using javascript…</p>

										<p><p>so you want to say you cannot change what has been done by titanium studio in xcode. The thing you can do is to build a separate module i.e functionality that can be further added to our existing titanium project</p>

							<p>I found the answer as mentioned in the above comment by Aaron Saunders, we have to write modules that will extend my project using the native language.</p>

										<p><p>When you run a titanium project you build, if you have a look in you project directory, in it you&#39;ll find a &quot;Build&quot; directory. In that directory you&#39;ll find the different platforms you ran your application on - one of them will be iPhone.</p>
<p>In that iPhone directory you&#39;ll find xCode project. if you open xCode and run it though xCode it will run. You can browse around the project and change things - but that is not what you are supposed to do. What you are actually seeing in that project is the Titanium sdk that is being &quot;joined&quot; as one xCode project in order to evaluate you JS files and build native code out of them.</p>
<p>It&#39;s perfectly ok for you to want to extend Titanium with xCode and do some things you can&#39;t do with the Titanium sdk. In that case what you would like to look into is how to extend titanium via native modules. What that means is that you write a module for titanium using native objective-c code, compile it, and bring it into your titanium project.</p>
<p>have a look at this guide here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;iOS+Module+Development+Guide">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;iOS+Module+Development+Guide</a></p>
