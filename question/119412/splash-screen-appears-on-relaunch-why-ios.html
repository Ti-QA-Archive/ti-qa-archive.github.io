			<h1>Splash screen appears on relaunch, why? (iOs)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve never seen an app where the splash screen appears on relaunch, is this a bug in Titanium or am I missing something?</p>
<p>Could it be that the currently loaded js file takes awhile to load and the splash screen displays meanwhile, even though it&#39;s a relaunch? When the splash shows on relaunch it&#39;s much quicker than if the app is started for the first time..</p>
<p>I&#39;ve done some testing and this really gave me an headache.<br>My app is running in landscape. If I press the home button and relaunch the app while in landscape mode, it will show the splash. If i press home again and relaunch again, there won&#39;t be a splash, so just the first relaunch.<br>If i start the app in portrait mode there will always be a splash on relaunch.</p>
<p>Anyone recognize this behavior and got a solution?</p>
<p>If not, do you know if Apple will allow that the splash appears on relaunch?</p>

							<p>I don&#39;t think the app will go in the background, that is why its starts up again, o it doesn&#39;t show the splash as a bug, it just starts-up ll over again.</p>
<p>I am not sure if this is a bug, and i don&#39;t think Apple will have a problem with that.</p>

										<p><p>No, it does relaunch and does not start up all over again. If i open a menu option and a new window, this is where the user will go after exiting and relaunching the app. But still he will see the splash, but it does not show the menu which would be shown on a fresh start.</p>
