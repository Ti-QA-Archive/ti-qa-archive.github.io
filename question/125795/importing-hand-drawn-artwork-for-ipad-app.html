			<h1>Importing hand-drawn artwork for iPad App</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We&#39;re in the process of creating an app involving a lot of hand-drawn artwork.  We hope to make the app available for multiple platforms, but we want to optimize for iPad. Does anyone have any advice regarding the sizes we should be creating and scanning in our artwork?  Further, does anyone have a recommendation for a high quality scanner?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>Any scanner will give you today more resolution than you will use so, about the size of the original, I would suggest you to use the more confortable for you to draw. For example, an A4 paper scanned at 1.200 dpi (which is a very common scan resolution) would give you an image larger than 10.000 x 16.000 pixels. Appart of this, scanners bigger than A4 size are very expensive. If your work is bigger than A4, consider use a camera and a lighting set instead of a scanner.</p>
<p>About the scanner, depends on the kind of artwork. An ink draw, which is reduced almost to black and white tones will require less sensibility than a watercolor draw. The most important features for a scanner is its native resolution (not interpolated) and its density (usually called Dmax). If you have a limited budget, take a look and compare your options. </p>
<p>Scan always at the largest size the scanner lets you, at its native resolution and use any software to reduce to the device size and resolution. Considering iPad is 1024x768 you will have more detail you could expect from your draws.</p>
