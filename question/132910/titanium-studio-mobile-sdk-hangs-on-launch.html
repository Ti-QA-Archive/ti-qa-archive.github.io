			<h1>Titanium Studio Mobile SDK Hangs on Launch</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>I have recently downloaded and installed the Titanium Studio Mobile SDK on my 2010 MacBook (2.4GHz Core 2 Duo, 4GB RAM, OS X 10.7 Lion). Whenever I try and launch Titanium (the latest version) it&#39;ll log me in, bring up my latest project and then just hang there for up to ten minutes. I&#39;ll get the &#39;spinning beachball&#39; as my cursor and just cannot use Titanium whilst this is happening. When it&#39;s done, I can use it and write code fine. But, whenever I try and do anything like saving, building, cleaning, running, etc, it will hang again.</p>
<p>Although I&#39;m not using the newest system out there, my MacBook handle very large Xcode 4.XX projects without too much of an issue.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried reinstalling Titanium Studio and I have the latest version of Xcode and the iOS SDK installed on my machine.</p>
<p>Can anybody help me out? Am I missing something really basic?</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>Kiran</p>

							<div><p>That system is plenty powerful enough for Titanium iOS development.<br>I like 8gb for Android though, because its emulator is such a system hog, but your 4gb should work.</p>

							<div><p>if you go to your terminal, type:</p>
<p>mpmirandaMBP:Resources mpmiranda$ java -version<br>java version &quot;1.6.0_29&quot;<br>Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_29-b11-402-11M3527)<br>Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.4-b02-402, mixed mode)</p>
<p>you should get something similar. </p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro</p>
<p>Ps. Start the Studio and then go to help-&gt;Get log and send it to mpmiranda@appcelerator.com IS this a pristine lion install or an update?</p>

							<div><p>Did that. I got: </p>
<p>java version &quot;1.6.0_29&quot;<br>Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_29-b11-402-11D50)<br>Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.4-b02-402, mixed mode)</p>
<p>OK, I&#39;ve just launched Studio and will send you the log when it loads (due to the error described in this post, it may take a few minutes!)</p>
