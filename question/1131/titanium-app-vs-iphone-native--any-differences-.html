			<p>Hi everyone,<br>           I have a question about Titanium possibilities now and in the future. I have been following Titanium development for over a year (since 0.1) and now I am asking myself this question : does Titanium support ALL iPhone SDK possibilities ? Can we do exactly the same, 100% ? What will happen when new SDK version comes out ? Will it be supported on day 1 of each new final iPhone OS version ? And before in fact, to test and adapt our applications before it comes out…</p>
<p>I am asking this to know if it is a viable possibility for mobile development…</p>
<p>Same question could be applied for Android, Desktop and other future platforms (Blackberry and others)…</p>
<p>Thanks !</p>

							<p>I am building an application right now with Titanium and I haven&#39;t found anything that I have needed to do that hasn&#39;t been possible with Titanium.  While writing the application directly in Objective-C will give you a more granular level of control, Titanium will give you speed.</p>
<p>If you are going for a totally in-depth 3d game then Obj-C is probably your best bet. </p>
<p>As far as iPad development goes, it seems that Titanium is already supporting a lot of what is possible.  They state that your apps will work on the iPad out of the box.</p>
<p>As with anything that is constantly evolving there is bound to be a bit of lag.  But you can always download the beta sdk and run your Titanium app in the simulator with the new iPhone SDK to see if your features are working.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

							<p>Does Titanium Mobile support ALL features out of the box?</p>
<p>No way! There are probably hundreds of obscure <em>features</em> it doesn&#39;t support as is. However, since TM is open source, and totally modular, I guess there&#39;s NOTHING that can&#39;t be done if you&#39;re ready to get your hands dirty ;)</p>

							<p>Think of Titanium as a Rapid Application Development Tool. Like a 4GL or 5GL.</p>
<p>As of today, I think Titanium has gone a long way from 0.1.<br>It is not easy for a FREE solution to stick around for so long and it has given web developers the power to develop for iphone, android, etc</p>
<p>Given time and resources, I think Ti will support more and more of native SDK API but that requires help from the open source community as well.</p>
<p>As for me, I&#39;d say &#39;Kudos to Ti!&#39;</p>
