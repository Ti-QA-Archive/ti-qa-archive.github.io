			<h1>Android/iPhone map app using map image with drag, pinch and touch hotspots to open new page.</h1>

			<h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<p>I have not done any Titanium development yet so I am just asking to see if this is the best solution for me. I could develop this app in game salad but that costs $299.  Using Titanium would have a larger learning curve especially if the drag and pinch code has to be written from scratch.  I would like to know how easy this app would be to develop for someone with limited JS knowledge.  I have written a reaction time test in JS but nothing like a full application.</p>
<h1 id="the-app">The App</h1>
<p>A large image map of a city that the user is able to drag around the screen. Pinching would zoom in to the image.  The map would contain location marked with a red dot.  Upon pressing one of these dots the user will be taken into a new screen with details about the location.</p>
<p>As much information and help is greatly appreciated.  Thank you.</p>

							<p>Hello Steve,</p>
<p>You could just use a <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Map">mapView</a> and the provided maps from google to use the pinch to zoom and drag functions (which are natively provided with a map view). Then you could use a custom annotation which would be on the positions that you want the user to click on and these could take you to a new page. Having not developed an app before the learning curve will be large but it is doable for someone of limited knowledge. </p>
<p>Hope this answers your question!</p>
<p>Carter</p>
