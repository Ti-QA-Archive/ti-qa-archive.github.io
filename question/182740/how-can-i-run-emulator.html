							<p>Hi Peter, first of all you should calm down to sort out things sooner…i can understand what predicament you are in…..</p>
<p>Now, if Studio is saying that there is no SDK 2.3.3 installed, then first of all open the SDK manager either from Studio or directly from Android folder…….. i don&#39;t know which OS you are using so please open the SDK manager from yourself….</p>
<p>Then check that whether SDK 2.3.3 is installed or not…. </p>
<p>If it is installed then cross check all environment variables needed to setup Studio coz it may be possible that you have all SDKs installed but the path to Studio is not correct which is showing this error.</p>
<p>I also faced this issue in beginning, almost every person face this, &amp; the error was that path variables were not set &amp; there were some component missing for the correct SDK version needed to run the app.</p>
<p>I hope this might help you, if not then get back to us with some helpful screenshots of installed SDKs, environment variables paths &amp; setting of paths inside Titanium Studio.</p>
