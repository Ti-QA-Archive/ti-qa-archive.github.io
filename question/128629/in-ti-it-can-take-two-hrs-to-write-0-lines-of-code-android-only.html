		<section>
			<p>Before this log, I spent more than an hour getting Ti to run acceptably, finally I gave up and decided to reboot my machine. This log is AFTER the reboot</p>
<p>16:23 23-11-2011    starting the android AVD before Ti just to see if it makes a diff.<br>16:24 23-11-2011    for some reason the Android.bat is not starting (Windows 7 to blame I think)<br>16:27 23-11-2011    finally it started<br>16:28 23-11-2011    AVD is booting<br>16:30 23-11-2011    The word &#39;Android&#39; has changed from console to the bitmap, ensuring me that </p>
<p>booting is actually taking place<br>16:31 23-11-2011    the AVD has booted<br>16:32 23-11-2011    starting Ti now - I hope that the preboot has helped<br>16:33 23-11-2011    doing the first build-&gt;run on emulator - of course Ti starts up a new emulator </p>
<p>so I&#39;ll have to wait for that to boot.<br>16:35 23-11-2011    it&#39;s been 12 minuttes, I haven&#39;t coded anything yet … Nor have I even thought </p>
<p>of my program, all my efforts are directed towards Ti and the emulator<br>16:36 23-11-2011    I&#39;m kinda bored here … and angry … and frustrated. This log is my 2nd </p>
<p>attempt today of doing what I do best: Code and be creative<br>16:37 23-11-2011    uh oh - the Android word has dissappeared, thats 4 minutes into the boot …<br>16:39 23-11-2011    6 mins after, the status bar has appeared - and yes - android Homescreen. 6 </p>
<p>mins to boot! It took only 3 mins<br>16:41 23-11-2011     building again. Ti complains that there is more than one emulator and stops.<br>16:42 23-11-2011    trying again … Yup - it&#39;s true. Even though Ti insisted on starting its on </p>
<p>emulator, it barfs because there is another running.<br>16:43 23-11-2011</p>
<p>16:43 23-11-2011    Trying again - midwayerror: More than one emulator<br>16:45 23-11-2011    And then Ti finally barfs, the error it already nows about, which shouldn&#39;t be </p>
<p>an error made it barf<br>16:46 23-11-2011     Ok - I&#39;ll close one of the emulators, I&#39;ll close the one I created myself<br>16:47 23-11-2011    Running again, this time only the Ti started AVD is hanging around<br>16:48 23-11-2011    OK - nothing is happening, Ti is waiting for the SD-card on the AVD it launched </p>
<p>itself, the AVD that mounted it&#39;s SD card a looong time ago<br>16:49 23-11-2011    it timed out - and now it installs the application any way - wondering why it </p>
<p>was waiting for the SD card that it never used, but happy that another 60 secs are gone by without me </p>
<p>having to do anything at all …<br>16:51 23-11-2011    application boot!!! 4 minutes!<br>16:52 23-11-2011    another run, and this time it still insists on using 60 secs waiting for the SD </p>
<p>card that is already there, the SD card that it doesn&#39;t use. Aborting - exit AVD and try again<br>16:53 23-11-2011    running the app again, ADB is returning one device, which happens to be my </p>
<p>phone. Ti has decided to wait for an actual AVD - but it doesn&#39;t launch one, so that&#39;s like waiting for </p>
<p>Godot - ok Exit Ti and restart it.<br>16:57 23-11-2011    First run in newly-started Ti … Ti starts the AVD allright, I&#39;m watching it boot<br>16:58 23-11-2011    there goes the text - in only one minute, hopefully this instance will run acceptably?<br>16:59 23-11-2011    FINALLY MY APP IS RUNNING! The first screen is on for ever …<br>17:00 23-11-2011    Running<br>17:03 23-11-2011    Ok - I want to switch branch, but of course .build_log and .fastdev lock are not in .gitignore. - so I have to commit them, strange that nobody has thought of that<br>17:05 23-11-2011    it&#39;s been about 40 minutes and I&#39;ve yet to write any code. It&#39;s been like this every day. I&#39;ve googled and googled, and I see scores of people with the same problems, and no solutions. I&#39;ll take a 5-min break and cool of, I feel angry and frustrated again. To think that you can say &#39;Develop for Android&#39; and then deliver what appcelerator delivers. After the break: Animations causing loss of backgroundImages on other objects, things that does not work as expected or announced.<br>17:11 23-11-2011     back from my break - it&#39;s been 48 minutes into this log, 2 hrs since my coding session started. I&#39;ve written exactly 0 lines of code.<br>17:15 23-11-2011    OK - this is still shit, it ran good yesterday, but today it&#39;s taking forever. I&#39;ll do a fresh run and time it. Here are the results: 0:00 run-start, 1:19 application launch, 1:56 code begins to run.</p>
<p>I&#39;m 2 hrs into my workday, the AVD is running exactly as crappy as when I started. I&#39;ve written 0 lines of code - 2 hrs and nothing to show for it</p>

							<p>Are you done yet?<br>This is the longest monologue I ever saw in my life :)</p>
<ul>
<li>the android emulator is damn slow. Yes it is. I have a mbp with 2.8G cpu and 8G or RAM and I develop on the device or else I would explode because on how many coffee I would drink waiting for emulator to run. If you don&#39;t have a device don&#39;t close the emulator and don&#39;t press stop. Just run over and over again the app.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You might want to disable fastdev - is not working in all the conditions (depends a lot on how you write your code)</li>
</ul>
<p>This how to do it:<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;120444&#x2F;how-to-disable-fastdev</p>
<p>This will slow down things (even more) but will have ur latest changes for sure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>On windows 7 there are some issues but it seems the page is not anymore in the Appcelerator&#39;s wiki :(</p>
</li>
<li><p>What did u gave up your mac?</p>

										<p><p>this is the fourth day, and I was thinking: No-one is going to believe me, so I decided to write it all down.</p>
<p>The Mac I had was too small, I&#39;ve got a monster windows machine now - you know the idea was: If I have a fast machine things will go faster. But it doesn&#39;t.</p>
<p>I am totally disappointed in the fact that appcelerator tells us that this is cross-platform, but it turns out that 4&#x2F;5 of all modules are for iOS and 4&#x2F;5 of all the bugs are for Android.</p>
<p>A lot of the problems I&#39;m facing could probably be fixed if I knew a lot about Android and Java-programming, but I don&#39;t. In fact that is one of the reasons I use Ti ….</p>

<p>You might be right, but compiling takes forever too. I&#39;ve written one meager page of code, and Ti behaves like it&#39;s compiling OpenOffice</p>

							<p>Ti.API.info does not work … it worked on my Mac, but here it&#39;s just silence. I probably need to enable something, I&#39;d look it up, but I&#39;ve already done it, and the docs say nothing about having to enable anything …</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve written two lines now, two extra ones - they cause the app to force-close. </p>
<p>The lines are in the createWindow call:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-string">navBarHidden :</span> <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>,
<span class="hljs-string">modal :</span> <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
</code></pre><p>Now this USED to work, but in the meantime I introduced a scrollableView </p>
<p>Why on earth a scrollableView cannot be attached to a modal window is beyond me, </p>
<p>OK - those are not the lines responsible I found out. I have a 1:30min turnover from hitting &#39;run&#39; to actually seeing my app crash, of course trying to . There is no apparent reason for the crash</p>
<p>Ah - it turns out that the apk I&#39;m writing and the apk Ti is running is not the same! The delay is so huge that I&#39;m actually seeing the results of earlier runs …</p>

										<p><p>Make that 2:30 turnover if a recompile is involved.</p>
<p>More than 1 minute of that is spent &#39;installing application on device&#39;</p>
<p>My app is puny, but it weighs in at 2.5Mb - more than a minute to push and install 2.5Mb locally on my machine? Do Java-devs face these loooong waits too?</p>

							<p>It&#39;s been 4 hrs. I&#39;ve managed to get my code to work like it did yesterday, only yesterday I was able to hide the navbar, today I can&#39;t. Not sure if anything else have changed - it&#39;s probably my fault, but I simply can&#39;t contain the long waits, the abrupt force-closes and then the REAL bugs AND keep an eye on every detail in my code. It is not possible.</p>

							<p>Right now it takes about 40 secs from pressing &#39;run&#39; to seeing the app in the emulator. I haven&#39;t got the faintest clue why, fastdev is running, I never started it, and I&#39;m wondering why Ti didn&#39;t just start it the first time?</p>
<p>that&#39;s great, now I can venture into the land of &#39;working as it is documented: Hardly at all&#39; </p>

<p>(these three runs were without altering a single letter in my code)</p>
<p>This means that you cannot trust what you see - the app you think you are debugging can be the previous version before your edits. I think that a lot of weirdness stems from this fact.</p>

										<p><p>Well even though the android emulator is slow, Titanium helps me build the app more faster then the native… I am a native developer too so i can say this based on my experience.. so cool to get a line coded Social API which i cant do in native so easily.. </p>
<p>Thanks Titanium for making the android development a lot better than when we started …</p>

										<p><p>Meanwhile the adb-server lost connection to the AVD, it gave up on the phone this afternoon - nothing </p>
<p>changed by me, just ADB and my phone in mutual agreement to disagree …</p>
<p>ah - I&#39;ve waited three minuttes for a compile. It comes out with protocol failure again. Time to </p>
<p>restart the whole damned thing</p>
<p>That only took 30 secs, nice to have a fast machine, now for the first run:</p>

<p>widgets</p>
<p>22:53 Ahhh …. ADB has no connection</p>
<p>3:34mins of realizing the ADB wasn&#39;t connected, no run this time, trying again:</p>
<p>22:55 starting the run<br>22:56 &quot;Compiling Android Resources… This could take some time&quot; - I know whoever wrote that </p>
<p>must be a nice fellow with a good sense of humour, but the msg is starting to annoy me …</p>
<p>22:57 OK - a restart of ADB did nothing. It&#39;s still not connected - only 2:30mins wasted </p>
<p>this time</p>

							<p>Well, after logging into this site, using the only webform in the entire internets that refuses to remember your login, I thought I&#39;d tell you the conclusion of yesterday:</p>
<p>In order to have a Android Emulator running that is usable, here is what I did:</p>
<p>In Titaniums &#39;run configurations&#39; choose a suitable API for your program - Google APIs Android 2.2 seems to work, I had hell with 2.3.3, although that might not have been the API but something else.</p>
<p>In the Android SDK (android.bat) choose &#39;manage AVDs&#39; and delete them all.</p>
<p>Run your program once, but kill the emulator immediately</p>
<p>In Android SDK edit the new AVD that Ti created:</p>
<p>SD-Card: size: 512Mib</p>
<p>Snapshot: Enabled If you run into trouble you&#39;ll have to start the AVD from the SDK with the &#39;wipe user data&#39; option. You can also go with &#39;disabled&#39; and wait for the boot, you&#39;ll only have to wait once</p>
<p>Skin: HVGA (the higher resolutions runs slower and takes up a lot of screen)</p>
<p>Hardware: Press New and add &#39;Device ram size&#39; with a value of 4096 (less would probably do, but I have 16Gigs of the stuff)</p>
<p>Click &#39;Edit AVD&#39; - go back to Titanium and run your program, the first run will be slow, but then it should pick up speed. </p>
<p>I&#39;ll now go searching the Ti API using the only searchform on the entire internets that require you to delete some words (&#39;search documentation&#39;) before searching …</p>

							<p>Well - the day starts out great, I&#39;m trying to add a imageView:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    dayView = Ti.UI.createView({
        <span class="hljs-string">backgroundColor :</span> color,
        <span class="hljs-string">backgroundImage :</span> <span class="hljs-string">'/img/window'</span> + (i + <span class="hljs-number">1</span>) + <span class="hljs-string">'.png'</span>
    })

    dayView.add(Ti.UI.createLabel({
        <span class="hljs-string">top :</span> <span class="hljs-number">80</span>,
        <span class="hljs-string">left :</span> mm.Screen.absWidthHalf - <span class="hljs-number">10</span>,
        <span class="hljs-string">text :</span> (i + <span class="hljs-number">1</span>).toString(),
        <span class="hljs-string">color :</span> <span class="hljs-string">'#FFCC00'</span>,
        <span class="hljs-string">font :</span> {
            <span class="hljs-string">fontFamily :</span> <span class="hljs-string">'Droid Serif'</span>,
            <span class="hljs-string">fontSize :</span> <span class="hljs-number">100</span>
        }
    }))
    leftLid = Ti.UI.createImageView({
        <span class="hljs-string">left :</span> <span class="hljs-number">20</span>,
        <span class="hljs-string">top :</span> <span class="hljs-number">20</span>,
        <span class="hljs-string">width :</span> <span class="hljs-number">283</span>,
        <span class="hljs-string">height :</span> <span class="hljs-number">425</span>,
        <span class="hljs-string">image :</span> <span class="hljs-string">'/img/window'</span> + (i + <span class="hljs-number">1</span>) + <span class="hljs-string">'l.png'</span>
    })
    leftLid.show()
    dayView.add(leftLid)
</code></pre><p>I don&#39;t know about that &#39;show&#39; method, it&#39;s just an experiment and it doesn&#39;t work ..</p>
<p>The dayView is added to a scrollableView, and it shows perfectly - but my imageView? No luck. Instead if I make it a normal view (Ti.UI.createView) it works … This might or might not be a bug, I see nothing in the docs that suggests I&#39;m doing this wrong …</p>

										<p><p>It turns out that the imageView will not show images in HVGA - it will show a &#39;backgroundImage&#39; allright, but not an &#39;image&#39; or an &#39;url&#39;. Also some images are just not displayable at all, neither as background, in other views or anything …</p>
