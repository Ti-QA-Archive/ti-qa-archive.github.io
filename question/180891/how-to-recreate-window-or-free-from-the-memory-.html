							<p>Could not understand your question there Hussein, but Im going to take a stab in the dark and assume you want to remove a window from memory. If that is the case, when you do a window.close(), all items inside the window are released and memory is released. make sure you set window = null after that so that the object is garbage collected.</p>

										<p><p>Sorry, Im having a hard time understanding your problem. Are you saying that the data does not refresh on a certain control? If so then you want to make sure you refresh the data by setting the data property on that control before you show that particular window.</p>

							<p>Hussein, It would really be more helpful if you can explain in detail what controls you are using. Some code snippets to support your explanations would also help.</p>
