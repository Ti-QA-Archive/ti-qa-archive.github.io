</code></pre><p>Using Ti V1.8 all I&#39;m trying to do is just like they do in the kitchensink, include some external java script files; simple enough right? There are other threads about this that date back quite a bit. One suggestion is change the file extension, which I did with .jsf; didn&#39;t work. Tried putting them in their own directory; didn&#39;t work. Even tried external sourcing, and still didn&#39;t work. I know that it&#39;s not loading the script files because I wrote a little test file that had one function that executes <code>alert(&amp;#39;Hi&amp;#39;);</code> when called, and that didn&#39;t work. I&#39;m at wit&#39;s end; I spent that last 3 days on developing the app outside of the SDK and thought &quot;hey all I have to do is dump the files and viola!&quot; The only think I haven&#39;t tried is writing a function that opens the files and writes their code directly to the head of the page.</p>

										<p><p>I had tried the app:&#x2F;&#x2F; approach and that failed, and this approach totally fails too, which makes absolutely no sense since it is the absolute path. The more I think about it though, maybe it has something to do with the fact that the window that contains the webview is created after a button press…which shouldn&#39;t matter, but I think I remember reading somewhere about issues with webviews created after events going horribly wrong. I just assumed that since I created a whole window that it wouldn&#39;t matter. I&#39;m off to test my theory…</p>

							<p>Hello Sean,</p>
<p>Try changing the extension of your js files to js.lib, as in, if your file is named &quot;myFile.js&quot; rename it to &quot;myFile.js.lib&quot;.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s essentially what I was trying to accomplish with using .jsf as the extension, however I did try using .js.lib and still no go. :&#x2F;</p>

							<p>My theory was indeed correct, the fact that I was creating a window that contained my webview after a button was clicked was indeed the culprit. That being said, the fact that I wasted a day on this makes me seriously reconsider using appcelerator for future projects. Something this trivial should not be such a serious problem.</p>
