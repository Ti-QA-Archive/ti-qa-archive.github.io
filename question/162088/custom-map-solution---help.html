							<p>Hi</p>
<p>This is essentially a large zoomable and moveable image that has defined hit points, not that much of an issue to achieve.</p>
<p>Depending on if you are using iOS or Android you can come at this one of two ways, if you need cross platform support then you need to go the Android only route or make your code swap between both version - might be easier to go Android only if you are cross platform at least for you version 1.0 app.</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS</li>
</ul>
<p>Use <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.UI.ScrollView">ScrollView</a> to contain your bigger image, so create the ScroollView and then add an imageView inside.  Set the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.UI.ScrollView-property-minZoomScale">minZoomScale</a> and <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.UI.ScrollView-property-maxZoomScale">maxZoomScale</a> properties to allow the child image to be zoomed in and out by the user.  The child image will move around inside the portal of the scrollView easily.</p>
<ul>
<li>Android </li>
</ul>
<p>As Android does not support the ScrollView moving in both width and height directions at the same time (you have to choose which direction it will scroll at creation) then you cannot use the ScrollView for the Android verison.  </p>
<p>You will need to create a parent view and add the image as a child - however yu are now required to use event listeners to respond to touchmove in order to set the top and left values so that the internal map image which is bigger than the device screen will move in and out of view - so the user can focus on the section they wish to view.  You can manually zoom the image - but this will be harder to manage yourself.  Add this as a follow up feature.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hit Points</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to handle the &quot;hit points&quot; simply create an array of x&#x2F;y points to equal the position of interest on the image map, add the width and height as extra parameters and an action value - so you know what this &quot;thing&quot; is meant to do when touched.  Add a click event to the image view to listen for the x,y position and then loop the array to see if that x&amp;y are greater than your array values but less than the array x+width and y+height values.  If you have a match respond based on the action value.</p>
<p>The array could look something like this;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[
    { x, <span class="hljs-number">10</span>, <span class="hljs-string">y:</span> <span class="hljs-number">10</span>, <span class="hljs-string">w:</span> <span class="hljs-number">50</span>, <span class="hljs-string">h:</span> <span class="hljs-number">80</span>, <span class="hljs-string">action:</span> <span class="hljs-string">'shop1'</span> },
    { x, <span class="hljs-number">110</span>, <span class="hljs-string">y:</span> <span class="hljs-number">110</span>, <span class="hljs-string">w:</span> <span class="hljs-number">50</span>, <span class="hljs-string">h:</span> <span class="hljs-number">80</span>, <span class="hljs-string">action:</span> <span class="hljs-string">'shop2'</span> },
    { x, <span class="hljs-number">210</span>, <span class="hljs-string">y:</span> <span class="hljs-number">110</span>, <span class="hljs-string">w:</span> <span class="hljs-number">50</span>, <span class="hljs-string">h:</span> <span class="hljs-number">80</span>, <span class="hljs-string">action:</span> <span class="hljs-string">'shop3'</span> }
]
</code></pre><p>I hope this helps.</p>

										<p><p>you think it is the best solution to archive experience like the video?</p>

										<p><p>Not sure what you mean by &quot;archive the experience&quot;.  Watching the video I believe the problem to be a floor plan (as your example but could be anything) that the user can scroll around zoom in and out of and click points of interest.  If so then this is a great solution, with this talking about an image and Alberto&#39;s using an SVG file both provide the same end point.  Whilst I love SVGs - I prefer not having to use the webView which he also agrees is one of the downsides to an otherwise great file format.</p>

										<p><p>This depends on how irregular your shapes are;</p>
<ul>
<li>Straight edged but not simple rectangles; in your mind break the shapes into smaller rectangles and in the array I suggested have one or more entries for each action.  So pressing any part of the shape will do the same action it just might be in a different array element</li>
<li>Simple jagged shapes that do not overlay one another, make the rectangle slightly bigger than than the shape itself so it actually covers areas that are not technically part of the shape itself - this is good as most people will prefer a slightly large touch zone for ease of use anyway</li>
<li>Circles that do not overlap each other; make the rectangle contain the circle - it will have areas in each corner that are not really part of the circle but again in normal use this is fine</li>
<li>Overlapping irregular shapes, these are more complicated<ul>
<li>Easiest; create your array of rectangular shapes over each irregular shape (all shapes really), you will get some shape overlaps.  Create an array of those overlap rectangle.  Now loop the shape array as before if it matches then check the overlap rectangles if the touch point is in one of these ignore the touch as it was not on top of any actual shape</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Most precise but much harder - create and array of polygon x.y positions to map around the shape, then use an algorithm to loop the shapes and they points to determine if the touch was inside outside that position.  This is complicated to explain and complicated to write.  The <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Point_in_polygon">wiki page - Point in polygon</a>actual explains the logic - but unless you have something very complicated I would go for the easy option.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not as hard as you think and these processes are the same as everyone else has to go through.</p>

							<p>An alternative to Malcom&#39;s solution (I really like it), could be related to a solution I had to do find with a third party partner. I needed to parse SVG maps and find routes from room to room. So I ended up using a <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.google.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;wayfinding&#x2F;">jQuery plugin</a> that let me do that (not really updated a lot).</p>
<p>Similarly, you could create your own SVG with all the places and then associate an action to the click.</p>
<p>PROs: it&#39;s crossplatform and won&#39;t need to create two different logics<br>CONs: it&#39;s a webview - experience taught me to avoid them as much as I can</p>

										<p><p>@Alberto - I love SVGs but would really prefer native support - they make many things so much better and easier.  But personally I find the need to use webView is a little heart breaking and adds to the complexity of the solution.  Love the pros - just a shame about the cons.</p>

										<p><p>I wonder how long it&#39;ll take for someone to develop an SVG reader for Titanium..!</p>
<p>I know, making it work for both Android and iOS was a pain, there&#39;s still something not adding up (eg: having control over it like centering the map, etc).<br>I was kinda forced into it, since my problem wasn&#39;t the same as the OP, but I just add to find the route between two points, and the budget didn&#39;t include time to develop a native SVG reader.</p>
