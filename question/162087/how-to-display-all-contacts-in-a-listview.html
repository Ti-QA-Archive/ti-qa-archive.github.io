							<div><p>Yes that is the way to get help, respond to someone who asks a question without an answer to that question and then demand if I have a solution.  Any reason for the big red text shouting for a solution.</p>
<p>I ask question to gain answers, as without those answers it is not suitable to provide and ad-hoc answer.  Right now you appear to have provided zero example of what you have tried - no descriptions of what hasn&#39;t worked for you - or what you are having a particular problem with - it surely cannot be the whole thing as contacts and list views are two distinctly different things - so at this point you are stating you know neither of these at all.</p>
<p>So I can only assume you are after a complete working solution to your problem without you having done any of the work.  Which in itself is not a problem - if you can get some code without having to do anything yourself why not.  But seriously in the Q&amp;A we want to see that you have at least tried - if you have code (which in most circumstances you should have) what can be tweaked - what working test you have provided which is not quite right - so we can tweak it.</p>
<p>All of this is explained in the same place <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;ask">you asked the original question</a> - you have to go past it to enter your actual question.</p>
<p>I am one of the most active and giving people on the Q&amp;A, I can end up being involved for many days where required - creating test case after test case.  But ONLY if the author of the question puts in some effort.</p>
<p>Plus I think people are hiding when they use generic names rather than a real one on the Q&amp;A - this is a community of people - you are a person called &quot;Deepan&quot; if I am correct so that should be your name and not a generic label of &quot;IT Department&quot;.</p>
