			<h1>iOS screen resolution/density relationship</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Can someone explain what is the relationship between screen resolution and density?<br>I understand that with retina display the density is set as &#39;high&#39; however the resolution remain the same, how will this impact the way I write code that fills the view with a list of screen given by the screen height dynamically?</p>
<p>For example using basic iphone simulator ( 320 x 480 ), I was able to fit 20 items on the screen. But when I use iphone 3.5inch with retina display (320 x 480) i still see 20 items in the simulator.<br>Q1 - Is this what it is expected in retina display?<br>Q2 - Following Q1, will I see a difference between simulator and actual device for retina display?<br>Q3 - if not, with retina display activated, does this mean that I have to manually consider the screen height to double ie 480x2 to achieve 960 based on the density and then code it in such a way that it display 40 items instead?</p>
<p>thanks</p>

							<p>A1 - Yes, this is what is expected as the density is taken into consideration for retina displays. Although if you provide high res. imagery (which are twice the size of your originals and placed in the same location) and suffix them with @2x then these will be used instead in order to take advantage of the retina display. e.g. image.png becomes image@2x.png</p>
<p>A2 - There should be no difference between simulator and device.</p>
<p>A3 - Bearing in mind what I have already answered, if your intention is to see 40 items then yes you will have to take that into account when coding, but otherwise no additional consideration should be needed to code between standard and retina.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

										<p><p>Thx for your reply, but could you elaborate more on A3 in terms of visual aspect between the two?<br>Using 480 with no Retina, I can fit 10 items ( each item is 48 height) so with Retina display it is still going to be 10 items just that on a retina display screen each item looks twice at big?<br>So if I were to have the items visually look the same in height, then that means when I have Retina on I need to code it such that each item is 24 height. And because of 24 height i am add 10 additional items (24 x 20) to achieve 480 in height to fit the whole screen.</p>
<p>I guess I am not understanding the concept of resolution and how it changes the way things are shown on screen</p>
<p>thx</p>

										<p><p>So as youve noticed the items on a retina screen are larger than that of a standard screen. As i mentioned no additional consideration is needed in order to position and size each item as it is already handled when compiled.</p>
<p>But if your intention is to have the items look similar in size on retina compared to standard then as you say you will have to adjust your code to achieve this.</p>
