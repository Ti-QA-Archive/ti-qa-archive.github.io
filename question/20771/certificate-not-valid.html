			<h1>Certificate not valid.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I know this has been asked a million times and I have searched the forum but everybody who asked didn&#39;t get a good response. Can somebody tell me how to see whats being done when the application is packaged, like a command line verbose. That way I would be able troubleshoot if the right certificates are being used and if any other errors or warnings are being outputed.</p>
<p>SOLVED</p>
<p>4.0 SDK Beta will not compile for the app store. I downgraded to 3.2 and recompiled and it uploaded successfully.</p>

							<p>&quot;The binary you uploaded was invalid. The signature was invalid, or it was not signed with an Apple submission certificate.&quot; I have heard this is a generic error from Apple. All the troubleshooting hints on apple.com involve seeing the packaging output code.</p>

							<p>My painful experience might help you guys. I was having the same issue for some days and until today I found the cause. My issue was NOT certificate issue. Either you use Application Loader or iTunes website to upload the .zip package, the error message mislead you to check certificate issue.</p>
<p>My issue was actually using a beta iPhone SDK. I got the correct error message by submitting a native Xcode package. So the issue was simply gone by downgrading to Xcode SDK final release.</p>
<p>However I still feel mysterious about one point, along my quest to the solution of issue, I did try to re-upload a previously accepted package binary through web and got cert error feedback… my puzzle is: how iTunes web knows my current SDK…</p>
<p>Anyway, I guess this sharing could help some folks like me.</p>
