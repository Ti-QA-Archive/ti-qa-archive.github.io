			<h1>different Application IDs for Android vs. iOS</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have an iOS provisioning profile for <code>com.company-name.application</code>. Unfortunately, the hyphen is invalid for Android, so my App ID for Android should be <code>com.companyname.application</code>. I tried using a custom <code>Info.plist</code> to override the App ID for iOS, but the Titanium SDK scripts use only the <code>tiapp.xml</code> setting.</p>
<p>Is there a way to set a different App ID for iOS vs Android that doesn&#39;t require me to modify <code>tiapp.xml</code> manually whenever I switch gears from one to the other?</p>

							<p>Not sure there is a one-off way to handle this, nonetheless, it seems like alot of trouble to go through to keep a hyphen. Wouldn&#39;t it just be easier to remove the hyphen from the iOS profile to make everything uniform? You do it once and its handled forever, rather than changing every app you decide to build.</p>

										<p><p>If thats the case, then unfortunately the quickest way is going to be to build for iOS, pop open the App Editor in Studio, remove the hyphen from your id and then build for Android.</p>
<p>It may get cumbersome, but if you can&#39;t debate good organization and consistency across platforms with you client, then you might have to roll with it as I&#39;m not sure that this is a hack anyone has already tried to code in.</p>

										<p><p>Yeah, that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing currently. It&#39;d be handy if tiapp.xml would accept <code>id_android</code> and <code>id_ios</code> override settings as well as just plain <code>id</code>.</p>

										<p><p>It never hurts to put in a feature request for such things. Though, it may be just a layer of abstraction not required by most developers. Nonetheless, if this is going to be something required often, it doesn&#39;t hurt looking into building in the functionality for yourself … see &quot;tiapp.py&quot; in Titanium&#39;s mobilesdk version folder.</p>
