		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m new to titanium development, and javascript as well. I have strong working knowledge of REALbasic, and have developed in MySQL and FileMaker Pro. I&#39;m looking for someone in the Dallas (I&#39;m in Dallas most weekends) area or Greenville, SC area (I&#39;m traveling there a lot during the week) that I could hire to train me. I&#39;m thinking at least a few lessons to get me up and running and such. Ideally I&#39;d love to find someone who knows REALbasic, even just a little, that could help me connect some of the dots between the two methodologies. Anyone live in or near Dallas or Greenville interested in giving a few lessons?</p>

							<p>Yes, I have. Some have been helpful, but others not so much. The most helpful thing I&#39;ve found so far has been a tutorial on another website, but even it just walks you through the steps of what code to put, and I need a bit of coaching on the concepts. I feel certain if I had a human to talk to and bounce questions off of for an hour or two, I&#39;d easily get past that hump, so to speak.</p>
<p>As an example, when I started my switch from FileMaker to MySQL as a database, I kept getting stuck in this concept of establishing relationships. In FileMaker, you must predefine relationships. In MySQL, not so much. After a number of leading questions to a co-worker, I finally was able to ask the question… &quot;So, in MySQL, relationships do not exists until you define them within your query?&quot;, after which he said, that&#39;s right. Believe it or not, that fundamental conceptual question was all I needed. I already understood enough of the basics to teach myself the rest.</p>

							<p>I live in Greenville, SC. I&#39;ve thought about organizing a Titanium Titans meetup in the area, but have been pretty swamped with projects. I&#39;ve never done REALbasic before, but I could try to help you out.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m here on business so I&#39;m busy during the day. Would you consider setting aside an hour or two some evening for me? What would you charge for a lesson or two?</p>
