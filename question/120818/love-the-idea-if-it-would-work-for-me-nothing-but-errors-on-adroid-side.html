			<p>Im curious if theres going to be any future support for android? Its understandable how the videos only show ios since that works everytime. Im averaging 1.5 hours everytime trying to get the android side to work properly and just open the app in the emulator. </p>
<p>Every error I&#39;ve run across I research here and find Im not the only one and it seems alot of people have the same issue and no support. Find a work around for that error only to have more. Obviously the current version of titanium isnt stable running android and I really dont want to waste time (I would even attend the classes if it worked) if theres no support. </p>
<p>So not one single problem running ios but cant get android to function properly. How many others have the same issue?</p>

							<p>for android dev titanium uses the mozilla rhino engine. for ios javascript core. rhino has already a <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;Rhino_JavaScript_Compiler">inline link javascript compiler</a> to build java.class files. that compiler is more strict than the titanium ios wrapper engine stuff. so the best way is like kami already said. build it for android and afterwards for ios.</p>

							<p>It is difficult to develop for Android, since it took a complete startup of the emulator each time you changed something. I thought they changed that to speed things up a bit.</p>
<p>Look in the api whats supported for what platform, usually this is corretly noted in the api.</p>
<p>But developing for iPhone is a hell of alot easier and faster then developing for Android.</p>
<p>It is better to programm for Android in titanium, then test it on iPhone. This works way better then the other way around.</p>
