			<h1>1.3.3 becoming slower and slower?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>i know it is a work in progress, but way back at the beginning of the 1.3.2 ordeal, i caught a tweet that said there were massive speed improvements already done (maybe 2 days after 1.3.2 was released). so, first 1.3.3 i tried did seem about 2x faster than 1.3 - mainly tableviews loaded quite quickly. but, for me, there were insurmountable bugs a week or so ago. </p>
<p>so, maybe end of last week, finally caught a build that fixed my worst bug. but, tableviews seems to load a bit slower. and, after testing, again… a few random freezes appeared. </p>
<p>well, just tried a couple more 1.3.3 builds (last one - commit 24460f4e109fda60047e)- and, things seem really stable now. but, the tableview loads are maybe 2-4x slower than they were with 1.3.2 or 1.3. so much so, that it seems to be a bug. the user perception would be that i am loading data from the web, when i am not. it is really that slow. </p>
<p>just wondering… anyone else noticing this? </p>
<p>and, if so, is this going to improve (and thus, must keep waiting)? or, is this just how it will be? </p>

							<div><p>i am now using 1.4 - and, i see performance to be the same as 1.3.2 - no improvements. but, i just caught a @appcelerator retweet that says a titanium user sees 10x performance in tableviews. is there some undocumented trick that enables this? anyone know? (the documentation page for tableviews in the API guide still says 0.8 - so, nothing new there). thanks!</p>

							<p>If tableview performance hasn&#39;t improved since 1.3.2, I&#39;m going to have to remove my apps from the app store and scrap my apps (no sense in rewriting everything in Obj-C…I haven&#39;t made enough money on these apps to justify the constant rewriting between point versions of Titanium and now a complete rewrite to Obj-C.)</p>
<p>Paul, tell me this ain&#39;t so. I&#39;ve been patiently waiting 1 month for performance improvements and you drop this bomb on me at what seems to be the end of the 1.4 dev cycle.</p>
<ol>
<li>I can&#39;t believe 1.4 is 1 month late.</li>
<li>I can&#39;t believe that the Appcelerator team can&#39;t fix this performance bug within that whole month.</li>
</ol>
<p>Frankly, I&#39;m amazed that so many people love Appcelerator Titanium. The time saved writing apps in Javascript is completely negated by the large rewrites I have to perform to work around many Ti bugs, or rewrites du to changes and deprecations occuring between Appcelerator Titanium updates.</p>
<p>What are the people on Twitter loving about Titanium? Is it because they&#39;re just dabbling around and writing &#39;Hello world&#39; test apps that have no real-world value and they&#39;re using the most basic parts of the API which may not have many bugs? I find that hard to believe because &#39;tableview&#39; is pretty effin&#39; basic and it&#39;s <em>broken</em>.</p>

							<p>A lot of us feel your pain Marc. Many have already jumped ship and joined the Phonegap team so they don&#39;t have to keep rewriting the same apps after every other point release. We&#39;ve been lucky though. We only had to completely build 2 apps twice using Ti from the ground up. Pretty friggin funny huh? I know 1.4 is taking a long time but it&#39;s supposed to be rock-solid when released. Hope so.</p>
<p>By the way, Objective-C is not so bad once you get used to it and the goofy way it handles things sometimes.</p>

							<p>I have the same problem. Tableview runs very slowly on sdk 1.4 and is crashed regularly when scroll up and down. I think Titanium developers should fix and create a patch for this issue first because it&#39;s a common component. I&#39;m very annoyed when changing code for my project many times.</p>
