			<h1>click event listener on Ti.Facebook.loginButton</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>My app only supports the landscape orientation on iPhone. There is a Facebook login button in the app, which opens up the login dialog in landscape mode. But logging into Facebook in landscape mode is very user unfriendly. You can&#39;t see what you&#39;re typing.</p>
<p>So I tried to &quot;intervene&quot; by adding an event listener on the FB button so that when the button is clicked I can change the orientation to portrait. But it doesn&#39;t work. The click event never gets fired.</p>
<p>So the questions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is there a way to force a portrait orientation when Facebook login dialog is created?</li>
<li>Is there a way to capture the click and add your own event listener?</li>
</ol>
<p>Ti SDK 1.5.1 and iOS SDK 4.2.</p>
<p>Or should I just go try Ti release candidate 1.6?</p>

<p>you are not going to be able to intercept the click event on the login button so you really have no recourse. You could always force Portrait before displaying the facebook login button??? Poor UX but it is an option.</p>

										<p><p>The problem with Ti 1.6 is that the new module requires the user to have the Facebook app installed. If the Facebook app is installed, the user bounces from your app to the FB app and comes back. But if the app is not installed, the user goes into Safari and never gets back to your app. I&#39;d much rather have the in-app experience of Ti 1.5.1, wouldn&#39;t you?</p>
<p>Having said that,,there is the benefit of single-sign-on for people who are already logged in..so that&#39;s pretty cool. But again..only if the FB app is installed.</p>

										<p><p>is that true on Android? I ran some test code about two weeks ago on my device and it worked without having facebook installed on my device… i am 99.9% sure you are not required to have Facebook installed</p>

							<p>I would NEVER advise this however you could place an full opaque layer above the FB login button and assign it a click event handler.</p>

										<p><p>Brian, the problem with that approach is that there is no way to actually trigger the Facebook login button&#39;s functionality without having the user click it. If you create a layer over the button, that button&#39;s click event will fire and will give you the opportunity to rotate the screen. So far so good. </p>
<p>But after rotating the screen, there is no way for you to do something like <strong>fbButton.fireEvent(&#39;click&#39;)</strong> or anything like that to simulate the actual click :-(</p>
<p>If there is a hack to work around this, please let me know.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Sid,</p>
<p>Did you manage to trigger the fbButton programatically?</p>
