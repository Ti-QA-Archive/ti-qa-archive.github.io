							<p>As said by Christian. Yes it is, because it builds completely native apps for both platforms. Much better in performance efficiency speed etc as compared to other platforms like PhoneGap, Sencha Touch etc.. And as for as you are concerned with radio buttons you can check this link  <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;143312&#x2F;radio-buttons">radioButton</a>..Thanks</p>

							<p>Yeah, Always Titanium Studio is Best option for Cross-platform. Because In Titanium Use very Easily. If you have knowledge about web development (HTML, JS, or CSS). you can work easily and smoothly….<br>and Day by Day  this is much more easily and handle every thing smoothly…..</p>

							<p>HI Bhoomi, YES it is good platform for cross platform app development and as you said it does not provide one or two functionality that does not mean its not good. <strong>you can write your own module for that and even can earn money also by selling it</strong></p>

										<p><p>see for many time you may face issue specially performance related in titanium with android, so if you are good in android native side then you may need to debug for performance issues, and may need to use native module also.</p>
<p>for iOS we generally do not face any issue.</p>
