			<h1>Suggestion: more affordable ways to contribute</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>With your current setup, we have a choice of paying nothing or paying $200+&#x2F;month, something which I imagine is out of the price range of many hobbyist developers. Please consider adding some more affordable options.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t expect you to provide the same service for less money, and I think you should be paid for the work you do - but I can&#39;t afford $200&#x2F;month. You could offer individual videos for say $20-30 per hour, which is well above the rates places like the pragmatic bookshelf charge. Or offer quotes for fast-tracking bug fixes. Or offer a &quot;chat with a developer&quot; service where we pay $1-2&#x2F;minute for expert help, with perhaps a minimum charge of $10-$15.</p>
<p>Such services would be much more accessible to people just starting out with Titanium. It&#39;s very hard to justify throwing down $200 on a new platform you&#39;re not familiar with and don&#39;t even know if it&#39;ll meet your needs.</p>
<p>Having said that, I&#39;m not an economist, so I don&#39;t know if your current system will make you more money. Just my 2c.</p>
<p>(PS: your forum tells me my content is &quot;pretty long&quot;. Are you trying to encourage one-line posts?)</p>

							<p>+1<br>it would be nice for those who can&#39;t afford to pay 200&#x2F;month<br>to pay an annual(or major version) licence and have access to betas.</p>

							<p>+1  Really need some additional options, or at least official communication that they are in the works.  Sometimes feels we&#39;re in a bit of a void here.</p>

							<p>I agree. It wouldn&#39;t be nearly as bad if there was more in the way of free support, but a quick look at the reply counts on these forum threads reveals the premium memberships to be the only viable means of support if we run into problems. However, I&#39;m a college freshman, so I have nowhere near that amount of money to burn every month. And let&#39;s be realistic here- the odds are against you that you&#39;ll make $1700 in revenue from your app in one year, just to break even, never mind make a profit. I certainly don&#39;t expect that as anywhere near certain, so I&#39;m more into it right now as a hobby and learning experience.</p>
