			<h1>Building Titanium 3.0 project takes forever since update to xcode 4.6.1</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi!<br>For a week now my Titanium workflow has been severely slowed down and I have absolutely no idea what to do…</p>
<p>It all started when MaxOSX 10.8.3 update came out and a small Xcode 4.6.1 along with it. I haven&#39;t touched Titanium Studio nor any of the SDKs. I&#39;m using latest 3.0.2.GA.</p>
<p>Also by mistake I upgraded node to v 0.10.0, but after reading blog post I downgraded to 0.8.22. </p>
<p>I&#39;m still able to build.. but average build time now about 5 minutes(!). Sometime less (when it&#39;s pre-build). But as soon as I clean the project … it takes forever. Basically I&#39;m unable to work as before. When I start building it goes up to the point where it says: </p>
<p>&quot;Invoking xcodebuild&quot;</p>
<p>After that I can go for a walk and have a coffee. Come back and it would still be building.</p>
<p>Also I noticed when building for device or distribution I have to wait additional 5 minutes until it pulls the dialog to select certificates.. And after long process of build it takes even more time to &quot;copy itunes artwork&quot; until the app actually appears in iTunes.</p>
<p>I thought Xcode was to blame, but after trying to build a native project - it&#39;s lighting fast I think it&#39;s something else.</p>
<p>Has anyone experienced this? I could really use some help. Maybe there is a way I can debug this? Check some logs? Clear some cache?</p>
<p>So far I tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deleting &#x2F; reinstalling Titanium Studio</li>
<li>Deleting titanium related folders in ~&#x2F;Library</li>
<li>Deleting and reinstalling XCode from MAS</li>
<li>npm install titanium -g</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m all out of ideas. Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

							<p>Hello,</p>
<p>There is a related <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC-2012">bug</a> with a workaround. Looks like we don&#39;t suport 4.6 just yet. Please apply the workaround and let me know if that works for you.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro</p>

										<p><p>Thank you Mauro for your response.</p>
<p>Funny thing is I decided to create a new account on my mac and see how it performs there.<br>It compiled the project swiftly! So no problems …  I&#39;m trying to figure out now whats wrong with my primary account, by deleting all the preferences I can. Xcode &#x2F; Titanium &#x2F; Node &#x2F; Alloy are the same on both accounts so it should perform likewise.. </p>
<p>What workaround are you talking about exactly? Removing the Simulator?</p>

<p>nvm, I was able to resolve the issue myself.<br>Basically what I did was removed the following folders from home directory ~&#x2F;</p>
<p>.npm<br>.titanium<br>.eclipse</p>
<p>Also I reinstalled titanium + alloy from command line:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">npm <span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">install</span> titanium -<span class="hljs-keyword">g</span>
npm <span class="hljs-keyword">install</span> alloy -<span class="hljs-keyword">g</span></span>
</code></pre><p>All works fine now. Alloy even appeared in Titanium Studio on project creating (which wasn&#39;t the case before)</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to mark the answer as valid so others with similar issues are able to locate the answer more easily.</p>
