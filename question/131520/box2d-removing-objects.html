			<h1>Box2d Removing objects</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all</p>
<p>im trying to get to grips with the mysterious Box2d module</p>
<p>my issue is removing box2d Body objects</p>
<p>i can destroy and null the objects yet no matter what i try i cannot seem to remove them from memory.</p>
<p>i thought i was handling the removal of them with &#39;destroyBody&#39; until i had a look in the xCode profile tool and the values keep piling up (for views and Box2dBody objects)</p>
<p>i tried looking at the C documentation and also at the other javascript ports documentation of Box2d but none of the removal functions ive tried seem to work…</p>
<p>im sure &#x2F; hope somebody else has had this issue before me. :)</p>
<p>ps any idea as to when the titanium docs will be made available …is Jeff still working on it or has it been scraped&#x2F;pushed to the side ?</p>
<p>Any info is welcome!</p>
<p>Thanks </p>
<p>Gary</p>

							<div><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I guess you are using it from the Marketplace. In this case, with modules, you can write to marketplace-support@appcelerator.com, explain them this issue; they are in charge of the modules support </p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro</p>

							<p>hi mate, </p>
<p>i emailed module support and have actually received a response.</p>
<p>They have confirmed it to be an issue within the module itself and will hopefully be fixing it in the next release.</p>
