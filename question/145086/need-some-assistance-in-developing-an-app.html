							<p>Hi</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> If you are trying to forward all emails that iOS is in control of then the short answer is - No.  There are no hooks available to allow you to handle the system events that would be required to achieve this.  I believe this is a limitation of iOS and not of Titanium.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> If you want to create a service that will allow others to provide their email details and you then offer a forwarding service then yes it is possible, but the iPhone would only be used to manage the account settings as having emails come to the phone only to be redirected elsewhere would be pointless.  </p>
<p>If you were going to try number <strong>2</strong> then know that this will be a big project and require dedicated servers and your own server based software to achieve your goal.</p>
<p>This is a very big project if you are not sure what you are doing and will require advanced knowledge of email systems and protocols to get it to work.</p>
<p>Trust me - I have written a system to handle email marketing and email auto response handling some years back.  Whilst things have become easier - it is still not a simple project.</p>

							<p>Hi,<br>have you tried sending the email to for example a PHP script with a http request? You can handle the email part with PHP, while all you have to do in your app is send a http request with <code>Titanium.Network.createHTTPClient()</code>.</p>

										<p><p>With Titanium you can send data to a serverside script, for example a .php file that is hosted on a (dedicated) webhost. You can forward the email by sending it to that hosted script, which will in turn send it to wherever you or your user want it. </p>
<p>I use this script to send (and get) user information to and from my server, but I think it will work for you too:</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if this is what you had in mind, but this would be my first step. Hope it helps.</p>
