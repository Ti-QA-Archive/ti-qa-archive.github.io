			<p>Hi i&#39; m just starting with titanium and would like to do a test app that need an offline map with markers, i&#39;m using latest SDK and is for ios and android.</p>
<p>I found this article but it doesn&#39;t bundle a complete example, i tried to get all peaces together but it doesn&#39;t seem to work<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;techblog.troyweb.com&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;2012&#x2F;11&#x2F;a-mobile-app-with-offline-maps-using-titanium&#x2F;</p>
<p>actually is also very hard for me to understand where it fails</p>

							<p>I&#39;m using it in a project right now but it&#39;s not that easy to tweak and well merge with the other code (you have to mix html and the native Titanium APIs). The example given by the author is complete.</p>
<p>have a look at the answer I gave here <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;153038&#x2F;how-can-i-manage-the-pins-shadows#answer-263599">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;153038&#x2F;how-can-i-manage-the-pins-shadows#answer-263599</a></p>
<p>and have a look at other posts <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;search&#x2F;leaflet">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;search&#x2F;leaflet</a></p>

							<p>thanks i also bought &quot;Titanium Offline Map&quot; that you rated, i&#39;m also disappointed because it has a messy code, but i could clean it up, the only real issue now is when tiles are not available</p>
<p>i added </p>
<p>errorTileUrl: &#39;..&#x2F;..&#x2F;tiles&#x2F;notile.png&#39;,</p>
<p>in L.tileLayer</p>
<p>but i still get a lot errors like this one<br>[ERROR] :  Error loading &#x2F;Users&#x2F;myuser&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;iPhone Simulator&#x2F;6.1&#x2F;Applications&#x2F;code&#x2F;OfflineMap.app&#x2F;tiles&#x2F;14&#x2F;10221&#x2F;6102.png.tile</p>
<p>i tried the same code in webbrowser but don&#39;t get any error</p>

										<p><p>first off, don&#39;t open a new answer, rather comment an existing one.</p>
<p>that error means that you try to load the tiles from your Resources folder, and probably they&#39;re not there. You have to pass the right path. The webbrowser cat load the tiles because they are on the root folder.</p>

										<p><p>thats correct, but i thought that js library worked correctly since it doesn&#39;t  trought errors in web browser, and correctly load replacer image when tiles are not presents</p>
<p>how can i get a more specific error, now is impossible to understand where the error is generated</p>

										<p><p>you can&#39;t ask me where the error is generated, I don&#39;t have a clue of what your code&#x2F;your app is structured. </p>
<p>Second, it&#39;s not that easy to make this work. I spent around 10 days to have everything set up like we needed. If you need specific help (how to change this, how to achieve that), it&#39;s ok. If you ask &quot;help me, I need this to work but I dunno why it doesn&#39;t&quot;, you won&#39;t find anyone here available to help you.</p>

							<p>sorry but is my first project with titanium, and i don&#39;t really know a lot of things<br>i was asking about this project because from comments i knew you purchased too</p>
<p>i think that right now it kind of works, and i guess that the only option is to modify leafletjs code so it doesn&#39;t try to load the tile if image is not in the folder</p>
