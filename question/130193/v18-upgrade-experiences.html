			<p>I have tried for a couple of days to run my application in 1.8 on Android but have given up and reverted to 1.7.5 until I have more time to investigate.<br>The speed of fastdev is a real plus, however, these are the things I have found inconsistent. (Admittedly, some do have relatively easy workarounds):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The &quot;for each&quot; syntax is no longer recognised</p>
</li>
<li><p>TableViewRows don&#39;t seem to behave as before. (I use insertRowAfter with a dictionary of custom properties to keep track of data linked to rows, but the row that gets created does not keep those custom properties.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Splash screen does not show</p>
</li>
<li><p>the currentTab property has a null value</p>
</li>
</ul>

							<div><p>I also had to revert due to new bugs, but there are things you can do to minimize those issues. I definitely didn&#39;t have any issues with the splash screen, but TableViewRows were (and always have been) a mess for me in terms of performance and stability.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Perform a clean install. Remove all the Titanium Studio directories from your computer, including the .titanium directory in your OS&#39;s user home directory. (IMPORTANT: Back up your 1.7.5 SDK directory before erasing Studio. I had to build it from source a few days ago because I made that mistake. Not hard, but time-consuming.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make sure you know the syntax differences between V8 and Rhino. Most people won&#39;t run into them, but they&#39;re worth investigating.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create a new app and copy your Resources directory into it. This has solved a lot of problems for me in the past.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Titanium has many layers. Your app &lt; JavaScript runtime &lt; Titanium SDK &lt; Android&#x2F;iOS &lt; *nix. The least-stable and least-tested of these layers are, of course, your app and the Titanium SDK, although a bug could exist in any layer. You need to do experiments with clean apps to determine if your code or if Appcelerator&#39;s code is causing the problem. Just create a new app and test the functionality that&#39;s screwing up for you. In your case, you might want to create a new app and see if the splash screen works.</p>

							<div><p>Ok, to be more correct, it works differently.</p>
<p>I have my default.png in the Resources&#x2F;android folder, and in 1.7.5 it always gets used. There are also resolution specific default.png files in the images sub-folder and in 1.8.0.1 it is using the resolution specific version.</p>
<p>When I get chance, I will try to create some reproducible examples of the other issues so I can log them properly.</p>

							<p>My experience is that sticking with old releases is best for business.<br>You know the bugs and maybe, luckily, you&#39;ve found some (tons of) workarounds.<br>Moving to new SDKs is always stressful. Many view just refuses to open AND&#x2F;OR present bizzarre behavior, and a new witch hunt season begins.</p>
<p>In 20 years of development, this is the worst tool I&#39;ve ever used.<br>I&#39;ve got stuck with 2 projects sold on this platform and MUST make it work.<br>After that, so long AppCelerator, see you never again.</p>
<p>P.S. Updating the Titanium Studio (which I gave up using) updates to v1.75. Is v1.8 so bad they got it reverted?</p>

										<p><p>Exactly:  never, EVER upgrade Titanium unless you have the time to come up with potentially dozens of new workarounds.</p>
<p>And actually, if you have that much time, just reimplement everything in Objective-C and Java.  I dream of having that kind of time.</p>
