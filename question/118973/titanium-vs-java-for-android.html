			<h1>Titanium vs Java for Android</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>OK so I have given Titanium a 3-4 day evaluation and really like the concept because we are a small shop and need to support both iOS and Android and our app is a fairly basic data-driven interface.</p>
<p>However, I have noticed in this short time that I am having a significant amount of trouble getting things to work on Android.  That includes features not being supported (Toolbar, NavigationGroup, etc) to more severe things like events not firing properly.  All of these things work great on the iPhone, but I am fighting the Android build every step of the way with poor results.</p>
<p>We do have in-house Java skills but of course it&#39;s preferable to have a single codebase for all mobile devices.  I&#39;m just wondering if this is still a fantasy?</p>
<p>I&#39;d probably at this point considering using Titanium for our iPhone app and just going with Java for Android.  I really don&#39;t want to do this but nor do I want to spend a ton of time learning all the Android&#x2F;Titanium glitches if the product is going to wind up being poor quality.</p>
<p>Any thoughts or opinions would be appreciated.  Thanks!</p>

<p>If you search for some of the numerous Android apps developed on Titanium that are already successful (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.6wunderkinder.com&#x2F;wunderlist&#x2F;">wunderlist</a>, is just one I like), I hope you can see what is achievable.</p>
<p>Your recent posts that I have answered, particularly <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;118980&#x2F;fireevent-on-android---what-am-i-doing-wrong">here</a> and <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;118837&#x2F;login-page">here</a>, involve some fundamental concepts. Once you understand these, and similar, and feel comfortable with the environment, you will no doubt be able to get the most out of it.</p>
<p>Speaking for myself, I certainly could not have made a proper assessment of Titanium in only 4 days. I am certain you will get a more balanced view of its strengths and weaknesses if you give give yourself time to gain some experience.</p>
<p>Good luck with it.  :)</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Paul, your answers have definitely been helpful.  I ultimately decided to go with Titanium in the end. Though it has room to improve, I&#39;ve slowly figured out how to make it do my bidding!</p>
<p>My biggest issue has been the Android.  There are multiple ways to do certain things which all work on the iPhone, but the Android seems to be much more picky.  Sometimes one method will not work on the Android at all - other times it will make the Android crash.  Though once you do find that &quot;correct&quot; way to do it, it does work great on both devices.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t wait for blackberry support, I&#39;m sure that will add even more fun to the mix!</p>

							<p>To answer my own question I am slowly finding my way around things and I think I is is possible to build a decent cross-platform mobile app with a shared Titanium codebase.  However my impression is that that currently Android support is secondary to iOS.  I realize the devices are not exactly the same, but I would like to cast a vote for less &quot;iPhone Only&quot; features in future versions of the Titanium SDK.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, currently android support lags behind iOS, but the gap has narrowed considerably.  Prior to mobile SDK 1.5.x, the difference was more pronounced.  So they are moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>I suspect there will always be numerous differences, because the native UI components available are not the same in each OS.</p>
<p>That said, my opinion is that Titanium is still sufficient for many types of cross-platforms app, even when building an Android version.  However, I suppose it will depend on what you are trying to achieve.</p>

<p>Please try to avoid answering your own question, because it can make it difficult for others to follow the discussion when the thread gets long, and also means that you won&#39;t be able to closed the thread when it is resolved.  You can get around these problems by using the comment facility, instead.  Many thanks!  :)</p>
