			<p>Hi!</p>
<p>My app is rejected, because it stores data in incorrect location. </p>
<p>In my resource folder i have an sqlite db, and i install it in the app -&gt; it will be in &#x2F;Library&#x2F;Private Documents&#x2F;xy.sql<br>after installation i set db.file.setRemoteBackup(false) and it seems ok in simulator (i got the right attributes)</p>
<p>thats all. Documents folder is empty, i just download json, and xml in the app, but i dont store it. </p>
<p>any idea, what can be wrong?</p>
<p>thanks in advance</p>

							<p>When in doubt, ask.  Apple that is.  Your follow up with them should be polite, yet precise.  &quot;Sirs, specifically what data is being stored in the wrong place and what is the appropriate place?&quot;</p>
<p>Maybe we&#39;ve been lucky, but our interactions with the iTunes folks has been good.  They have always been forthcoming with details that helped to resolve any issues.</p>

										<p><p>yes, i tried it. i was asking what files are in wrong location.. and they said, go and ask technical support, with code level assistance. so it was not helpful. ofc i asked technical support, but i have to wait, and i think, they cannot check my app.. :(</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m sorry to hear that.  If the only file you are writing&#x2F;installing is the database, then the new 1.8.x should be putting the database in the correct place.  Wonder if maybe you got an reviewer who doesn&#39;t know about the new location requirements.</p>

										<p><p>Sorry to hijack, but trying to figure out how to convince Apple my app is correct :)</p>
<p>The exact same happened to me: app rejected because of new guidelines. However, I upgraded to 1.8.1 and added setRemoteBackup(false) to the database file and re-submitted and it got rejected again a week later. I asked them politely for more details on which file was the problem, but just got the standard &quot;ask tech support&quot; answer. </p>
<p>So Gergely: how did you get them to reconsider? Was it because of the message you sent to tech support, or did you reply again to the original rejection message?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

										<p><p>hi! i did reply again to the original message: i wrote, i followed the guide, and set the flag, and asked them, wich file is in wrong location. next day i got an answer, they checked again, and it seems OK. so, it seems, worth to try</p>

										<p><p>I just got hit with this too, but on a second version of an app. They approved the initial version and there was only minor changes to the update.</p>
<p>The app gets XML &amp; JSON but does not store it, however there is large database in the app - to make it work. I think this is the file they are complaining about.</p>
<p>So if i set this flag that makes the data get stored correctly? - I will give it a go and see whether they are happy.</p>
<p>I love the way apple give you a cryptic reason for rejection that is only there due to their updates to store world + dog in their iCloud. It may be easier to develop for, but i turned to Android long ago and strongly recommend it to all my clients.</p>

										<p><p>Jez, store in the private documents and set the flag on your database file. Should be ok.</p>
<p>We had 9 apps in iTunes, all using databases and file storage.<br>As we updated them shortly after the new rules came about, left notes for the reviewers.  Got some good feedback, quick suggestions.  I&#39;v yet to have a terribly antagonistic exchange with a reviewer.</p>
