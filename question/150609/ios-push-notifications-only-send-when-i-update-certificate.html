			<h1>iOS Push notifications only send when I update certificate</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I am currently working on a native iOS app using Appcelerator.</p>
<p>The app works fine when in development mode - the certificate is on Appcelerator and push notifications are received pretty much as soon as I send them from the console.</p>
<p>I have created my Production certificate on Apple&#39;s Provisioning Portal and uploaded that to Appcelerator on the Production side of things. Here&#39;s the weird part:</p>
<p>When I try to send a push notification via Appcelerator&#39;s push console, it does not get received, at all. However, when I go back to Appcelerator Settings, <strong>remove</strong> the certificate then <strong>re-add</strong> the <strong>same certificate</strong> again, all of a sudden the last push notification I sent from the console is received on all devices built for Production (i.e. the Ad-Hoc devices).</p>
<p>I can consistently produce this… send a push notification and it only gets received when I remove and re-add the certificate again.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any suggestions? I am thinking that obviously the certificate is correct and valid because if not, I would not be receiving <strong>any</strong> push notifications…it seems like something wrong with Appcelerator to me, but please prove me wrong.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<div><p>OK - they are coming through now. However, they are coming through <strong>exactly half an hour</strong> after I send them. Could this be a problem with Appcelerator&#39;s handling of timezones or something?</p>

							<p>Hi, I have the same problem. In development mode notification works fine. In ad-hoc distribution that use ACS development I don&#39;t receive notifications on my devices. Devices are correctly registered and are correctly reported like ios clients.</p>
<p>Can you help me?</p>
