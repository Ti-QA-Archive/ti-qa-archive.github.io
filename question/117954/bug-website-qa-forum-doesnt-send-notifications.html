			<h1>BUG: Website Q&amp;A forum doesn&#39;t send notifications</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>It seems that only one type of notification is sent — to the post&#39;s author, when a direct answer is posted. No others, e.g. other commenters or interested people who&#39;ve clicked &quot;subscribe&quot;.</p>
<p>Amirite?</p>
<p>If true, the result is that Q&amp;A and users-helping-users is deterred, or at least highly reduced.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve seen other posts lamenting this: One must go through one&#39;s &quot;My Q&amp;A&quot; list and manually check for replies.</p>
<p>Comments?</p>
<p>EDIT: Filed &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;25719-titanium-desktop&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;594-website-qa-forum-doesnt-send-notifications&quot;&gt;support ticket 594&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.</p>

							<p>Hmm! It looks like it began working right after I wrote this post, and just recently, notifications stopped working again. I&#39;m getting replies on posts I&#39;ve authored, and not being notified about them.</p>

<p>Please read <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Contributing+to+Titanium#ContributingtoTitanium-SubmittingBugReports">Submitting Bug Reports</a> before you raise <strong>any</strong> tickets.  The process is to ask the community - to have an actual discussion - and then to raise a ticket when all else fails. Otherwise, the open ticketing system is likely to become too much of a burden for the core devs to manage, thus potentially resulting in a closed system.</p>
<p>I hope you understand.</p>
<p>By the way, I had already reported it directly to the person in charge.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>Of course, it is the very process itself being broken that the ticket addresses.  </p>
<p><strong>In other words, I can&#39;t ask the community about it, when the community software is broken.</strong></p>
<p>FYI, this problem has been raised, and never responded to by Appcelerator in the past, and so I feel pretty good about this ticket submission.  E.g., <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;85751&#x2F;qa-e-mail-notifications">here</a> and <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;77021&#x2F;qa-email-notifications">here</a>.</p>

										<p><p>It&#39;s not that you bringing up the issue is not appreciated - in fact, your input is essential. However, it&#39;s always best to discuss it first to see what other peoples&#39; experiences are. One ticket raised in error may be a trivial issue in your opinion, but the management involved for 100s of tickets that are either incorrect or duplicated or poorly-described or contain paragraphs of opinions rather than facts, unnecessarily consume peoples&#39; time. This diverts resources away from what we all want the core team to be doing - writing code.</p>
<p>If people abuse the ticketing system, by which I mean they do not follow the requested procedure, then it will become a closed system. I really, really, do not want that to happen, as then we would lose the many tickets raised by the community that are of a very high quality. </p>
<p>Note that the Q&amp;A posts you reference are not really relevant - they are over 5 months old, and the system certainly has been working since then. Hence, this is a new issue. Also, you raised your ticket <em>before</em> you posted to the Q&amp;A. This is not the best approach, as is explained in the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Contributing+to+Titanium">Contributing to Titanium</a> guide.</p>
<p>I hope you can appreciate this point of view, which aims to make the best use of everyone&#39;s time, even if it is not how it could ideally work if there were unlimited resources.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
