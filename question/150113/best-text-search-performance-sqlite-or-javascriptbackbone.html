			<h1>Best text search performance ¿SQLite or Javascript/Backbone?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Considering an Alloy collection already loaded in memory with a bunch of models with some text fields on them, what will perform better as general rule for a full text search? </p>
<ol>
<li><p>using backbone filter method, as explained <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;10468039&#x2F;searching-for-text-inside-nested-object-backbone-js-collection-as-example">here</a> </p>
</li>
<li><p>or call directly to SQLite doing SELECT table WHERE LIKE=%text% ?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In my specific case I just need to know the models that contain that text on any field, no matter which one.</p>
<p>As the collection already exists, my idea is to implement the selected method extending the collection methods, unless there is any good reason to don&#39;t do that. Anyway, performance is my priority.</p>
<p>thx!</p>

							<div><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I would recommend to do search in the sqlite level. It&#39;s usually implemented in C in both platforms, so it&#39;s quite efficient. </p>
<p>Best,</p>

							<div><p>Thanks Mauro, but AFAIK the javascript runtime machine also is in C, so it should be also quite efficient and, even more, content is already in memory, isn&#39;t it?</p>

							<p>I do not have the answer. I will just say there are multiple factors here.<br>How are your data stored in memory. This is important. And how do you use it in javascript.<br>look here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jsperf.com&#x2F;javascript-associative-vs-non-associative-arrays (run the test).</p>
<p>Secondly, how large is your collection. Are we talking 50,  5000 or 5 mio models?<br>Model mapping and data bindings come into play now. How is this mapped, is it a linear mapping, do you have reference mapping etc.</p>
<p>Do you search case sensitive?<br>Could you provide far more detailed description ?</p>
<p>My personal opinion: I would say sqlite is way faster. (but I cannot prove this..)</p>

										<p><p>Mads is essentially right here. It depends on the structure and amount of data you are dealing with. He mentions pretty much all the points I would. One thing you could do to ascertain what works best for your particular situation is to try both and time the results. Wrap your &quot;filter&quot; function in a timer and see how it compares to wrapping your custom SQL query in a timer.</p>

										<p><p>thank you guys. I get the message, just wondering if there was an obvious answer. If I would have to load the collection only for this search I would definitely think that, as Mads said, sqlite would be faster. But since the collection is already loaded on memory, I&#39;m not so sure. </p>
<p>searches are global and not case sensitive, if not matters, but content is dynamic, so it could have from 1 to 1000 entries.</p>
