			<h1>No iPhone Build Folder</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello -</p>
<p>For some reason when I try to build my app to the iPad, I get an error message System Exit 65.  I have seen multiple questions regarding this, and the answers are as varied as it comes.  So, the next thing I was going to do was take my xproj out and just deliver it directly to xcode, and this led me to find that I have no build folder in my app.  I used to have these iPhone build folders with the xcode translations, and then they just seemed to stop.  Is there any clues as to what I did wrong, and how I can fix it?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>Go into your app root via terminal and type.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">rm</span> -rf build/iphone

<span class="hljs-keyword">mkdir</span> build/iphone
</code></pre><p>Try running it again.  You will first receive the Exit 65, then run it again, and it will successfully build.  Hope this helps.</p>

							<p>Okay, this will show my newbieness to no end, but how do I get into my app root?  I have gotten the terminal up and I can certainly try those codes, but I just need that one piece of info.  What should an app root look like?</p>

										<p><p>Try and leave comments to the answer, instead of posting a new answer.  Members here kind of get annoyed by that.  Anywho, your app root is where ever you created your application.  Titanium Studio defaults to ~&#x2F;Titanium.  In terminal you can type:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span> ~/Titanium
</code></pre><p>Then in this directory type.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">ls</span>
</code></pre><p>You should see your project in there.  Simply &quot;cd&quot; into your projects directory.  You are now in it&#39;s root.  Then run the above &quot;rm -rf&quot; command.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

							<p>I think Paul is suggesting cleaning the project folder on your development machine, not the device.  So, whereever you have created your project (usually within a TI Studio workspace) you can issue that command (on linux) to clean the project and re-instate the build folder.  On windows, navigate to the same place in Windows Explorer and just delete the build&#x2F;iphone sub folder</p>
