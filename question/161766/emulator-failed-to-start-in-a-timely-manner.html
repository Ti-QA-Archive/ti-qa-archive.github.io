							<p>Hi Ritesh.</p>
<p>I have the same problem, but I found 2 workarounds:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Launch and wait the first time until the emulator is ready, then you will find a new option in the launch section (in the left upper corner), named SDK (seems like Studio believes is a new &quot;device&quot;). If you select that SDK, then the new launch will re-use the emulator.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Launch and wait the first time until the emulator is ready, then launch again. As you know, it will open a new emulator (first a DOS window, then the emulator window). If you CLOSE the DOS window before the new emulator window is shown then, incredibly, Studio will use the existing emulator (I don&#39;t know if this is a bug or what, but works).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One note: remember to close the other launched processes in the console, I found that they are always opened. Just stop it and all will work.</p>

							<p>Unless you have a compelling reason to be running an emulator with 2.3.3, I&#39;d suggest you look at running the genymotion emulator (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;genymotion.com">genymotion.com</a>). It is also x86 based, but is much faster and easier to operate (along with camera access) than android x86 emulator.</p>
<p>I have yet to have it timeout on me.  Ti 3.2.0.GA (along with 3.2.0 cli) supports genymotion very well.</p>
<p>See: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2013&#x2F;12&#x2F;using-genymotion-with-titanium-3-2&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2013&#x2F;12&#x2F;using-genymotion-with-titanium-3-2&#x2F;</a> (<strong>note:</strong> you do not need to install beta anything, as 3.2.0 is GA since that article was written)</p>
<p>If you need the google apis (and you will) follow the instructions here: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.zeezonline.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;11&#x2F;install-google-play-on-genymotion-2-0&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.zeezonline.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;11&#x2F;install-google-play-on-genymotion-2-0&#x2F;</a></p>

										<p><p>Unfortunately, Genimotion needs some advanced features for VGA card to work, like OpenGL 2.0, that I don&#39;t have. At least, I was unable to use it.</p>
