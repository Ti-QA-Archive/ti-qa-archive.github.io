			<h1>Move existing titanium app to alloy framework</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>We have a titanium application built without alloy framework. Now we are planning to add more features into that application. Can we use alloy framework for new features? In short how do we migrate the existing application to alloy framework.</p>

							<p>I believe I saw a post in the Appcelerator blog about providing some form of migration tool at some point. However, given this is moving to an MVC with complete separation of concerns and existing code may not have been designed like that (unless you had written your own?) its going to take quite a bit of re-factoring manually to move everything into its correct place. Plus, the new declarative syntax for view creating is completely different to manually constructing your components. I wouldnt hold out too much hope on a &#39;click to convert&#39; solution</p>
