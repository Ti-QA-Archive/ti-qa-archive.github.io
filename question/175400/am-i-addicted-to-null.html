			<p>I&#39;ve taken to nulling every variable and event once they become unneeded as a precaution against leaking memory. Is this overkill and can it affect performance since they require about 30% more lines, space and action?</p>

							<p>Yes, almost certainly.  There are very few circumstances where you explicitly have to null out objects. If a variable is defined within a function and does not pass a reference to itself (Eg within a closure) outside of it, then there is no benefit to &#39;nulling&#39; it out. The GC will clean it up for you.  So, in your example, <code>arr</code> does not need nulling</p>

<p>Good clean up is a must and commended, sometimes it goes over the top, but admitting you have a problem is the first step.</p>
<p>You have not said if you are on iOS or Android (or something else), each normally has its own SDK tool to tell you how to check what objects persists after you would have expected them to be released. As Nick says thinks references not variables themselves.</p>
<p>Android has ddms&#x2F;monitor to help, but for iOS xcode includes Instruments (which you can use) and makes the process so simple it is a pleasure (at least if you use it since app creation - starting half way in makes it a little harder of course).</p>

<p>BTW I am not laughing at you, but with you - I love your own words &quot;Am I addicted to null?&quot; superb.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you both.<br>And thank you Malcolm for respecting my platform&#39;s anonymity =)</p>
<p>The Rick Blalock video was what scared me into the nulling of everything. If I remember correctly, (because I watched it a while back), there was a point in there where he closed a window stating that it&#39;s contents would be collected and someone in the audience pointed out that it wasn&#39;t, and he acknowledged that it was strange.. not sure if I am recalling it exactly because I couldn&#39;t find it scrubbing through. </p>
<p>This led me down the path of over nulling.<br>The SDK tools are helpful but not terribly simple.</p>
