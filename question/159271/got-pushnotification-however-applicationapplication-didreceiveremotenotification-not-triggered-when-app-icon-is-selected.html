			<h1>Got PushNotification however application:application didReceiveRemoteNotification: not triggered when app icon is selected</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>iOS 7.0<br>Device :iPhone 4s</p>
<p>How your push notification service is managing the below flow ? There is no documents are provided regarding his issue at your web site , can you help me out for this ?</p>
<p>The following are the expected behaviours when a PN comes in:</p>
<p>App is in the background and I click on the notification: I can see the notification in notification center. Click on the notification, the app comes to the foreground and I can see the above method is called.</p>
<p>App is active and already in the foreground: I can see the above method is called.</p>
<p>Now, the following is the peculiar behaviour I am seeing:<br>PN comes in. See it in the notifications, see the badge on the app icon. I click on the app icon - not the notification: In this instance I found that the above method is not called. I was expecting it to be called…</p>
<p>Now what is the solution for that whenever the third scenario happens , user make some request to server like that is there any pending notification on the server for each user ID ? if yes than it will make download of it and executes next task</p>
<p>is your Appcelerator ACS Push notification is working on the above principal ? if yes than how can i do ? if No than is there any Other ways to achieve it ?</p>

							<div><p>When you tap on the App Icon, your said method will never be called. This is the expected and only behaviour. For [application didReceiveRemoteNotification] to be triggered, the app will always either have to be in the foreground, or app launch triggered by tapping on a notification.</p>
