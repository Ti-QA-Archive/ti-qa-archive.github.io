			<h1>Clear WebView Cache &amp; Cookies</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi! I am really in need of a way of clearing a webView&#39;s cache, as I mentioned in the title. It&#39;s an important way of making the particular function I&#39;m working on preform properly. The help I can offer is that deleting this file will reset the webView, although it might do more than just that. </p>
<p>Anyway, here is the path (Three dashes indicate new folder) :</p>
<p> <code>iPhone Simulator---5.0---Applications---F5E9D673-ACD4-4DA4-B6B4-2C584F2A5442---Library---Cookies---Cookies.binarycookies</code></p>
<p>So, I&#39;m going to need a way of deleting that file within the iPhone file path whilst actually on a device. I also know to set the cache property to 0, which will prevent caching. So, unless there&#39;s another way, please help me to figure out how I can delete this file while using a device.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time!</p>

							<p>a few months ago, I needed to clear all cookies as well, but I had to modify the sdk, but don&#39;t worry, just a few lines! see my <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;iamyellow&#x2F;titanium_mobile&#x2F;commit&#x2F;8c754cdbc06ec62c5b3b38b5aceb709c88b2393b">commit changes in github</a>.<br>once done and project rebuilt, you&#39;re going be able to clean all the cookies for a domain with this API:<br>Ti.App.cleanCookies(&#39;domain.com&#39;)</p>

										<p><p>sure we can do the same. there&#39;s the webview proxy java source (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;iamyellow&#x2F;titanium_mobile&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;android&#x2F;modules&#x2F;ui&#x2F;src&#x2F;java&#x2F;ti&#x2F;modules&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;ui&#x2F;WebViewProxy.java">here</a>) and something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">android</span><span class="hljs-class">.webkit</span><span class="hljs-class">.CookieManager</span><span class="hljs-class">.getInstance</span>()<span class="hljs-class">.removeAllCookie</span>();
</code></pre><p>do the trick (at least for the cookies)</p>

										<p><p>I tend to learn visually, but what I&#39;m understanding is that each time the webView loads, you&#39;re suggesting taking the Url they&#39;re tying to load, appending it, and then loading that instead? Maybe some brief sample code would help to make it more clear, and anyway, thanks for the answer!</p>

										<p><p>No the WebView interprets the HTML at runtime every time, this isn&#39;t cached (as far as I know) instead browsers usually cache script docs and images. Scripts and images can be external to the web-page, so a url is a valid src path. Therefore you can also append a fake query string, this to the browser will look like the path is different, therefore it won&#39;t try to load the cached script &#x2F; image it will re-grab it. I use this in my Android app where I have a web-view.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> randomStr = <span class="hljs-built_in">Math</span>.random().toString(<span class="hljs-number">36</span>).substring(<span class="hljs-number">7</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">//random string so that webview won't cache the image!</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> img = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Image();
img.onload = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{
    $(<span class="hljs-string">'#bg'</span>).css({
        background: <span class="hljs-string">"url("</span> + e.path + <span class="hljs-string">"?"</span> + randomStr + <span class="hljs-string">") top left no-repeat"</span>,
        width: <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.width,
        height: <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.height
    });
};
