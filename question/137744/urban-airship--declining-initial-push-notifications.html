			<h1>Urban Airship &amp; Declining Initial Push Notifications</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>My test app loads up, requires log in, then I&#39;m asking for Push Notifications and tagging their unique username&#x2F;ID against Urban Airship so I can manage individual messages.</p>
<p>In a test I did a few days ago, if I accepted the initial request, then I was able to individually send notifications as I knew the device token against the username.</p>
<p>If the user initially declines push notifications, is there a way to call it up again (in a switch for example)? </p>
<p>I may just be having one of those days (it&#39;s Friday and looking forward to the weekend!) but it seems after the initial cancellation of push notifications, I can&#39;t get it to trigger the permissions again within a switch.</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

							<p>In iOS I don&#39;t believe you can have it show the alert again. You would have to instruct them to go to their settings to turn it back on.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Matt, I read the same in the iOS HIG shortly after posting. No fault of AppC, but a bit annoying when trying to test user experience with and without Push.</p>
