			<h1>REST PUT to AWS S3 -- works on iOS, not Android</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<h2 id="what-works">What works</h2>
<p>We have successfully come up with the code to upload a file  using a RESTful PUT to Amazon&#39;s S3 simple storage service.  We have shared all of our code and required libraries at the links at the bottom of this question.  Hopefully others find this helpful when uploading files from iOS to S3.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>The upload does <strong>not</strong> complete successfully on the Android Simulator or an Android device.  The error we get is: </p>
<p><strong>InvalidArgument: Authorization header is invalid – one and only one &#39; &#39; (space) required</strong></p>
<p>We have checked extremely thoroughly for extra spaces.  The upload would fail on iOS as well if there were actually extra spaces in our authorization header.  Yet this code works great for successfully uploading files using an iOS simulator and device.</p>
<h2 id="our-setup">Our Setup</h2>
<p>Titanium SDK: 1.6.2</p>
<p>iOS SDK 4.3</p>
<p>Android SDK: APIs 2.2  Screen: HVGA</p>

							<div><p>Ok thanks Matthew I&#39;ll stop banging my head against a wall then. Can I ask did you use another storage service to fix the issue or did you just can the project? I&#39;m thinking of looking at Google Storage or similar. Just wondered if you had found an API that accepts the PUT request from Android. Many Thanks.</p>

							<p>I don&#39;t know about Android, but I had to really hack the original code up to make it work in iOS on SDK 2.1.2. I had to tweak the date format generated, cleaned up the building of the Authorization header (which was being generated incorrectly), and cleaned up the generation of the specific URLs.</p>

										<p><p>Agreed. Thanks to Matthew for the original code, but the authentication didn&#39;t work for me - even on iOS. It would only work if the bucked allowed &quot;Everyone&quot; level access.  Zach&#39;s github authentication worked on iOS straight away. (SDK 1.6.2)</p>

							<p>I&#39;m using a the HTML POST solution… It requires 1.7 RC ~&gt;  see my gist here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;1012632, this lets me fetch a signature + policy from my web server and then send the file to s3 using a multi part form post.</p>

							<p>Matthew - did you crack this eventually.</p>
<p>I too have iOS working fine. I can also get a small file into s3 from Android but it doesn&#39;t contain the picture. Very odd.</p>
<p>Anything you can share would be appreciated.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Sam,</p>
<p>Struggling to get the data.txt file into the Android data application filesystem so I can&#39;t test the data.txt option.</p>
<p>However I have got the code back to working on iOS and putting the smaller &#39;none&#39; file from Android. I did it by NOT sending the authorisation header. Crazy I know but it works on iOS.</p>

							<p>Ok I can confirm that after for testing the situation is this;</p>
<p>The code supplied in this thread does support iOS uploads but not Android (the file simply never makes it to s3 due to the fact that the  &#39;Authorization header is invalid – one and only one &#39; &#39; (space) required&#39; error occurs&quot;</p>
<p>However if you comment out the authorization header iOS still uploads the full file and Android uploads a very small 15 byte file, but no actual image behind it. Very, very odd.</p>
<p>Does that happen to you Sam?</p>

							<p>Just to add more to this it appears that SDK 1.8.2 has issues uploading images when using httpclient.</p>
<p>Guess I&#39;ll just have to wait for the latest SDK upgrade - hopefully 1.9.</p>

<p>More specific to say, in android </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">xhr.<span class="hljs-built_in">send</span>(blobImage)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

<p>It is supposed to work in &quot;POST&quot; but not luck in &quot;PUT&quot; in Android. I just want to report it as a bug before we add something in our client code.</p>

							<p>I have a defect file with Appcelerator with regards to the people having issues with Android uploading 15 bytes instead of an image.  See here:</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-9590</p>

							<p>This bug was fixed on Tuesday (Aug 14th). Can someone download the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;index.html">nightly build</a> and see if it&#39;s fixed?</p>

							<p>Has anyone got this to work?</p>
<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-9590">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-9590</a> says it is resolved as of release 3.0.0, but I am using Titanium Studio, build: 3.4.1.201410281727 and I am still getting this issue.  I am using the same segment of code as shown in the test case in the PR, except with my own filenames, URLs, etc. It works on iOS simulator but not my Android device. I get the following error message:</p>
<p><strong>InvalidArgument: Authorization header is invalid – one and only one &#39; &#39; (space) required</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;m wondering if maybe this problem started to happen again because of something in the recent builds? My version of Titanium is apparently either reading &quot;[object TiBlob]&quot; instead of the actual image data when I do <code>fileContents = uploadFile.read();</code> or it is just not sending the actual image data when I later do <code>xhr.send(fileContents);</code></p>
<p>What should I do?</p>

										<p><p>We never got timely support or answers from the appcelerator team, so no, we never got it to work.  You might try posting a new question to see if you might be able to get some help.  Best of luck to you.</p>

										<p><p>We&#39;re in luck! The REST PUT actually does work. If I comment out the line in my code that adds the Authorization Header for AWS, it magically begins uploading my images:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">xhr.<span class="hljs-built_in">set</span>RequestHeader('Authorization', Ti.Utils.base64encode(AuthorizationHeader).<span class="hljs-keyword">to</span>String());
</code></pre><p>where <code>AuthorizationHeader</code> is defined elsewhere in my code.  The funny thing is this line works in iOS but not in Android. The definition of the <code>AuthorizationHeader</code> is nothing but simple string processing, which I assume works the same with both platforms. This leads me to believe there is something wrong with the implementation of <code>base64encode()</code> in Android.</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to test with a third-party implementation of <code>base64encode()</code> and report back my findings.</p>

										<p><p>As near as I can tell, this behavior is caused by <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-9111">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-9111</a>.  Does anyone have a good work around?</p>
