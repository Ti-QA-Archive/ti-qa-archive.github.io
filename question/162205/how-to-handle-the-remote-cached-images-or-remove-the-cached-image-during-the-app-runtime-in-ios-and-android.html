			<p>Hi frnds,</p>
<p>I need a help. Do anyone know about, how to handle the cached  remote image of application during app runtime. Due to big size of image in my app, app goes crash in ios. i have checked leaks of my app in xCode instruments. and i found that  due to high memory of images in cached folder. i have done some google and i found some links in appcelerator Q&amp;A, they are not  helpful to me. i am stuck with this. Can anybody help me to solve this issue. Do anybody have any idea for solving this issue. There is no method or API available to handle this problem.</p>
<p>Your help will be appreciated, best of luck in advance.?</p>

							<p>Hi Sagar</p>
<p>Thanks for the update.</p>
<p>Let me see if I can explain your issue.</p>
<p>You are loading between 30 &amp; 50 mg worth of images onto a mobile device in one go and your running out of memory.</p>
<p>The issue here is you are loading 30 - 50 mg worth of images onto a mobile application in one go. You can&#39;t do it. The device just won&#39;t handle it. End of that is your problem.</p>
<p>Now to explain slightly further for each image lets say 2mg. You will require a minimum of 3 mg of memory to download that file, due to the handling of the data etc. Mobile device don&#39;t have swap files so that is effectively RAM. Now you wish to render that image. minimum 8mg of resources to display it. Approx resource usage 4 - 5 times the image size.</p>
<p>So for each 2mg image you will need around 11 - 15 mg of resources to display it times that by 10 and your in the 100&#39;s of mg.</p>
<p>Now going into acceptable downloads of data onto mobile. 30 - 50mg of image downloads REALLY. sorry but that is just wrong, unless you are downloading those images ONCE only and your informing the user of this fact, and I would also make sure they are on WIFI only. </p>
<p>I don&#39;t know exactly how you app works, but if I downloaded 30mg of images over my phones connection I would not only delete the app, but make a mental note not to use any future apps from that source.</p>
<p>So in a quick summary, what your trying to do really you shouldn&#39;t, and yes you will run out of memory and no its nothing to do with the cache.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>T.</p>
