			<h1>Problem with Titanium Studio Debugger &#34;suspend on error&#34;</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am using Titanium Studio 1.0.7.201112281340 with Ti SDK 1.8.0.1.  When debugging on MacOS in the iOS simulator, the debugger will stop on a certain line in one of my source files.  There is no error or warning message that I can see, certainly not in the Console, nor on the simulator.  If I resume execution, it keeps breaking on the same line.  If I right-click on the stack trace, and un-check &quot;Suspend on errors&quot; and then resume execution then everything continues as expected, no errors in the simulator, Console, or anywhere.  For reference, the file in question has only two JSLint errors, and they are in other locations in the file. (undefined global variables)</p>
<p>So, two questions:  First, is there any way to see what error the debugger thought it was suspending for?  Second, is there any way to persist the un-checking of &quot;suspend on errors&quot;?  Right now I have to un-check this every time I debug.</p>
<p>Thanks all!</p>

							<div><p>Ok, more info here: I got a non-minified version, and it turns out that the debugger is pausing when an exception is being thrown, even though the exception is being caught.  Turns out this has already been discussed here: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;129360&#x2F;why-does-titanium-studio-pause-the-debugger-on-caught-exceptions">Why does Titanium Studio pause the debugger on <em>CAUGHT</em> exceptions?</a>.  I guess I will add my own request that the Ti debugger be changed to not suspend on caught exceptions.  Thanks.</p>

							<div><p>Turns out that you can persist the un-checking of &quot;suspend on errors&quot; in Preferences -&gt; Titanium Studio -&gt; JavaScript Debug.  Still can&#39;t see how to tell what the error was short of letting it continue, and hope that something shows up in the console</p>
