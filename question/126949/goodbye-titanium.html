			<p>I worked with Titanium for almost 2 months now. I had some struggles but eventually learned a lot from this program. Unfortunately i wasn&#39;t happy about the results. After some evaluations i came to the conclusion wasn&#39;t the right thing for me.</p>

							<p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>I&#39;m sorry to hear that Titanium was ultimately not the right solution for you.  If you&#39;ve been running into specific issues, however, we&#39;d love to help you if we can.  The best place to get help, as Ivan mentioned, is here in the Q&amp;A - it&#39;s not an official, SLA-driven support channel, but Appcelerator employees are out here every day trying to help as many people as we can.  If you have a question out there that&#39;s blocking you and you&#39;re not getting a response, feel free to ping us at community at appcelerator dot com, and someone on our team can take a look.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>-Kevin<br>Dev Relations Manager (@kevinwhinnery)</p>

										<p><p>Hi Kevin. I think it&#39;s not fair that you&#39;re so eager to help in this case, while in some other you (or others from Appcelerator) are not.</p>
<p>Here is one good example:<br><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;126491&#x2F;old-jira-tickets">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;126491&#x2F;old-jira-tickets</a></p>
<p>(read comments and follow the links to get the picture)</p>
<p>Tim answered 3 question and has 100 Q&#x2F;A point. I answered 331 questions and have around 6700 Q&#x2F;A points (among other things).</p>
<p>The thing here is the negative attitude Tim has. Should I use my time and intelligence for criticism of Titanium, rather than helping others and asking kindly to get help?</p>
<p>It seems criticism is the only thing that works (I&#39;ve seen this few times). That sucks.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Ivan,</p>
<p>I think that&#39;s a fair criticism.  Where we as a company have been attacked, it usually commands more of a response from us. While it&#39;s a human response (to respond when attacked), it&#39;s not fair to people who are active contributors. In this sense, we are rewarding the wrong kind of behavior, which is something I will have to consider in how we build out and manage our community support and communications going forward.</p>
<p>However, it&#39;s not a question of us being willing to help one person and not willing to help another.  Our desire is to help everyone, but with a community of 200,000+ developers it would be difficult to do this without neglecting other areas of need.  When dealing in a resource-constrained environment, the squeaky wheel tends to get the grease, which isn&#39;t fair for the reasons stated above.</p>
<p>How we try to support developers (in Q&amp;A and beyond) comes down to the following flow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we have any threads in progress with community members?  If so, follow those first.  We try and make an impact with individual developers on individual issues as much as we can, and try and follow through on interactions from Q&amp;A, IRC, e-mail, Twitter, Facebook, blog comments, etc. before moving on to new ones.</li>
<li>In Q&amp;A, has the question received any answers or comments yet?  If not, we try and take a look to at least get them started in the right direction.  Comments to tease out clarifying information or direct answers.</li>
<li>Is there a question that&#39;s getting voted up, or one that seems to be generating a lot of discussion?  This is an indication that developers care about the given question, and we try and weigh in if we can.</li>
<li>Unanswered questions</li>
</ul>
<p>While it may not be optimal, that&#39;s what we do.  But with a community as large as ours, unfortunately our own individual impact does not travel as far as we would like.  We don&#39;t have an ulterior motive or shadow agenda with how we answer questions, though - our genuine desire is to help as many people as we possibly can.  You bring up a good point though - maybe there needs to be another bullet in this process to account for &quot;good behavior&quot; and not just &quot;bad behavior&quot; (discussion inducing questions).  That&#39;s something we can try and bring into our process.</p>
<p>I hope that gives some visibility into how we do community support.  One mechanism we try and provide is to allow developers to reach out to us at community at appcelerator dot com to help nudge us toward issues they&#39;re seeing.  It&#39;s not perfect, but again, our emphasis is on helping as many people as possible.</p>

<p>Just wanted to chime in and say I appreciate the candor and well-reasoned response.  It really helps to know &quot;there is a method to the madness&quot; so to speak.</p>
<p>On a more vested interest level, as someone who is currently in the top 10 points in the Q&amp;A but without a Pro membership where I can open support requests, let me add the more I think about it, the more I like your last idea idea too.  :)</p>

										<p><p>Wow, negative attitude really works (just kidding) :)</p>
<p>Anyway, Kevin, thank you for your answer, I really appreciate the way you responded and I understand your problems since I was working with CRM systems before I started to work with Titanium (and I had to deal with all kind of clients, their &quot;my-issues-are-the-most-important&quot; requests and limited human resources). And I think that in general you all are doing good job.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I would also like to mention something from <strong>technical perspective</strong>, as I already mentioned in the comments in the link I provided. I think some issues in JIRA are (very) badly prioritized. There is one good example on how resources could be invested in a better way (see the comments). There are more examples.</p>
<p>I think people who are newcomers are facing a lot of fundamental problems in framework itself (things are getting better, I have to say). Some of them (if not the most) are documentation related, but there are issues that are related to the basic functionality in Titanium and which are not resolved quickly (or at all) as they should be. This kind of issues in general doesn&#39;t need to come from active community members, newcomers also have reported number of valid issues that are standing in the queue for a long time. That makes them frustrated (as they see other issues that are not so important in general are being resolved constantly) and I think that is justified.</p>
<p>That said, I think there should be one more bullet for prioritizing issues that greatly contribute to Titanium stability and basic functionality&#x2F;usability no matter from whom do they come from. I think that would benefit Titanium in general and not only to some particular community member.</p>

							<p>Right.</p>
<p>Can you be more specific? IMHO, Titanium has problems, especially in bug-solving department and documentation, but Q&#x2F;A and Wiki seems OK to me. You asked just one question here, isn&#39;t your evaluation a bit premature?</p>

							<p>Funny thing that when you &quot;attack&quot; or post something negative about a product, the thread is instantly answered. Instead of my other thread where I had a major issue with the Facebook dialog (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;126684&#x2F;facebook-dialog-error">here</a>), and I wasn&#39;t the only one. </p>
<p>I understand that you want to know what kind of problems I was experiencing and what kind of things I missed in Titanium.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile device debugging </li>
<li>Limited Documentation </li>
<li>Apps are much slower </li>
<li>Android development is buggy compared to Iphone </li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand I found some very useful tutorials to make an very fast application(Those from Dan Tamas). These tutorials Helped me a lot. </p>
<p>But the main thing is(for me), that you are limited to do certain things with cross-platform development. Because it&#39;s a layer above the current Iphone sdk and Android sdk.</p>
<p>My intension here was not to stomp Titanium into the ground. And not to troll everyone here. Maybe that my first post was lacking some further information. </p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

										<p><p>Mobile device debugging is in JIRA, waiting to be implemented: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TISTUD-501">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TISTUD-501</a></p>
<p>I guess they don&#39;t find it interesting because most of them use iOS simulator for developing. On the other hand, people who work with Android primary, have to use devices for developing because emulator is extremely slow. But the problem is that they can&#39;t debug on device with debugger, and because of that, debugging is very difficult for every non-trivial project.</p>

										<p><p>Although they implemented the fast development service for android so you don&#39;t have to start the emulator every time, when you run your project.</p>

							<p>I think it has an easy answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apps are slower than native apps.</li>
<li>Android performance is too slow… Even on a 1ghz device. It&#39;s not acceptable.</li>
<li>Now i&#39;m in BB developement with this framework, it&#39;s very, very, very painful.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my case, i can not choose, i have to work with &quot;this&quot;.</p>

										<p><p>I will say that as for android, the V8 upgrade that is being worked on will fix this in many respects.</p>
<p>As for BB, it is in beta only for paid subscribers, and with that comes the extra support as we know it has issues (hence being in beta).</p>

							<p>Still one <em>could</em> wish for better android support.</p>
<p>It permeates through the whole appcelerator experience that a mobile device is called an &#39;iPhone&#39; and then there&#39;s this odd offspring called &#39;android&#39;</p>
<p>This feels a bit disappointing to those of us who are here because of the cross-platform feature.</p>
<p>IE. the module market, woaaa what a load of nice modules! lemme see … hmmm … this one is iOS only, lets try another … same thing, same thing, same thing. And modules aren&#39;t even marked as to what OS they are for on the frontpage, because &#39;naturally&#39; they are for iPhone, what else? This is a small gripe, and is only an example that shows me that the reason that android development on Ti is behind is not because of Android, but because iPhone is DA PHONE.</p>
<p>But it is NOT &#39;da phone&#39; - it is rapidly losing out to android. Any curve you see (any curve I&#39;ve seen at least) shows a dramatic rise in android usage and a levelling out&#x2F;slowly declining iPhone curve - and the two curves will very soon cross, and Android will be market-leader.</p>
<p>I&#39;m still new to Ti, and so far, Ti haven&#39;t seen a cent of my money, but I am starting a mobile devteam for my company, and I&#39;ve decided to start out with Ti, and we might end up buying some of the professional offerings of Ti - support - modules etc … </p>
<p>But please, please, please ramp up your priority on Android, I need it, we need it, and YOU need it.</p>
<p>Make modules for it, squash some of the many Android-only bugs, tout it - BE CROSSPLATFORM PLEASE - that&#39;s why I&#39;m here!</p>

										<p><p>I would not choose Ti for your company. It&#39;s not fully crossplatform, you have to change a lot of source code from the iPhone version to the Android version. I would use native sdk&#39;s.</p>
<p>Corona SDK IS crossplatform, you don&#39;t have to change any code from android to iphone.</p>

										<p><p>Point taken - we&#39;re currently pouring the vast majority of our engineering resources into Android dev to close this gap.  They&#39;ve always been resourced equally from a platform standpoint, but in many ways the Android platform requires more resources to develop for.  This is being reflected in our own investments in engineering.</p>
<p>To be quite clear, there are three things we hear loud and clear from the community that we need to work on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overall Platform Stability and Performance</li>
<li>API parity between iOS and Android (where appropriate)</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>These areas are receiving major investment across the board right now, and you&#39;ll all see major deliverables soon as we reorganize our wiki documentation, roll out normalized layout APIs and more parity work in 1.8, and implement V8 as our JavaScript engine for Android.  We&#39;re also moving fast and decisively to staff up quickly on the platform and QA side - exciting updates there soon.</p>
<p>We are listening, and we are our own harshest critics.  We think Titanium is a great platform today, but can be (and must be) even better.</p>
<p>Thanks, and reach out to us directly with any feedback (community at appcelerator dot com)</p>

										<p><p>@noe - corona is &quot;full&quot; cross platform because they don&#39;t use native UI, but openGL (at least this is my understanding).So as long as u can draw, of course it will look like full cross.<br>The way each platform works (in native mode) makes impossible a full normalization of the methods, properties,etc.</p>
<p>Now about making Ti a base for ur company or not - I would say YES, I did it, I gave up on all the web background I had and moved to mobile with Ti only - but is requires a lot of work, patience and dedication.</p>
<p>Anyway, you cannot make everybody happy, and for sure the way Ti works is not for everybody. </p>
<p>But let me tell you something, I prefer to adapt few lines of code to make it work on both platforms then to write several screens of code - multiplied with 2 for both platforms - just to get a damn window to show :)</p>

<p>I&#39;m not &#39;pissed off&#39; with Ti, but today we spent 1.5 hrs getting a background-image on a button, and as it turned out - we did it right in the first place, but our PNG was very quietly unliked by Ti. I don&#39;t have the specific details as I was only involved part of the way. The codeformatter eats non-whitespace under certain circumstances, you can increment a top property directly, but not a left (or vice versa) - if you do that, the app crashes. I&#39;ve had to make an add function with a loop in it in order to add values from Ti.UI objects. You can&#39;t download specific versions of Titanium, you can download Titaniumblabla.dmg or .exe and then hope it might be version 1.8, you don&#39;t know, so you have to download the whole thing in order to check. This is not a bug-report, this is just a user experience account. It&#39;s like treading on ice …</p>
<p>And still I like Ti :) Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m a sucker for javascript, I dunno. But I definitely do not feel locked in by Ti, if I&#39;m smart I can even take a lot of my code to ie. the web (btw. bad abbreviation I used there :) with very litte rewriting.</p>
<p>It was great seeing your presentation (everybody should watch that!) - and thanks for your answer here. Can you tell me when 1.8 will be generally available?</p>
<p>Regards<br>Esben</p>
