			<h1>Blank Run Emulator Screen</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Ok not sure what has happened, it has been working all morning but in the past 10 minutes I went to run the emulator from the Titanium Developer, but I get a blank grey screen…</p>
<ul>
<li>I have tried going to the Edit screen and saving.</li>
<li>Creating a New Project and Importing the files from my project to it.</li>
<li>Reinstalling Titanium Developer</li>
</ul>
<p>All with no luck?  What has happened?  I can get the screen when i start a fresh project with the default dir and files.</p>

							<p>I had this happen last night. I had cleaned out the build directory to get rid of old junk. I had to put back the platform directory. In my case, I was working on a Mac and the directory I had to create was PROJECT&#x2F;build&#x2F;iphone. I assume it would be PROJECT&#x2F;build&#x2F;android for Android. Untested on Windows.</p>

							<p>Chris, in my experience, these kinds of issues are often caused by incorrect permissions when, for instance, TiDev has been run as two different local users to launch the same project.</p>
<p>What OS are you using? </p>
<p>Are you using android? If it&#39;s iphone, then these steps will be similar, but may not be identical:</p>
<ul>
<li>close your emulator</li>
<li>rename your <code>build</code> directory (so that you have it as a backup) and then create a completely empty <code>build</code> directory. (the files the original contained will be recreated when you boot the app)</li>
<li>in your &#x2F;tmp, temp, or &quot;Temporary Files&quot; directory, there is a directory called <code>android</code> (or iphone). Rename this directory. (it will be recreated when you boot the emu)</li>
<li>click the <code>Edit Profile</code> &#x2F; <code>Save Changes</code> button (to force a full build, although this ought to happen anyway)</li>
<li>boot that project app&#x2F;emu</li>
</ul>
<p>I have other suggestions, but I&#39;d like to know which part of the process works. Hence, would you give me feedback and, if need be, I can post some more.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
