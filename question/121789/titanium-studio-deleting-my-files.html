		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have been having an issue with Titanium Studio that I thought I should bring to the attention of the appcelerator staff. If I create a new file in the app explorer window, studio remembers this in it&#39;s undo history. When I am testing changes in my app, I often run the app then hit command-z to undo the changes and run again. Because the button that launches the simulator is in the app explorer window, the app explorer window has focus when I go back to make changes. If I don&#39;t click on the file view before pressing command-z, Studio thinks I want to undo my last action (in this case creating a file). I have deleted my most recently created file two or three times this way, and have lost several hours to recreating code. If I hadn&#39;t been using git, I would have lost hundreds of lines of code.</p>
<p>I just wanted to suggest that Titanium Studio implement confirmation dialogues. Irreversible actions such as deleting my source files should not happen without me intending them to.</p>
<p>I am using Titanium Studio, build: 1.0.1.201106171427</p>

<p>Would you mind screen casting this for me? I&#39;ve just tried everything under the sun that I can think of to duplicate this behavior and just haven&#39;t been able to. If you could make a short screen cast of this behavior it would be very helpful.</p>

							<p>So, as far as I know, here&#39;s how to replicate the issue, and a workaround if it happens. It&#39;s unfortunately a default Eclipse behavior which means that it&#39;s something we&#39;re going to have to figure out how to work around. We apologize profusely to anyone who has run into it.</p>
<p>1) File &gt; New File will create a new file. This will not respond to &quot;Undo&quot; (see Eclipse bug here where they fixed that)</p>
<p>2) Selecting a file in Project Explorer and copying it <em>will</em> create a file that can disappear if you press Ctrl + Z. However, you can get the contents back again:</p>
<p>2a) Go into &quot;Project Explorer&quot;</p>
<p>2b) Right-click on the root of the project in question and select &quot;Restore From Local History…&quot;</p>
<p>2c) Select the particular resource, and if you like, select a version. Finish out of the dialog.</p>
<p>I agree that there should be some sort of confirmation, but unfortunately that may not be possible to implement easily. We&#39;re investigating all the options to see what&#39;s possible.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we will add &quot;Restore From Local History…&quot; to the App Explorer. It&#39;s not the best solution, but it should be one step users can take immediately. Please let us know if these steps help in any way and confirm how the problem manifests itself.</p>

							<p>This has happened to me a few times. I hit command z to undo something, but   instead my entire file directory gets deleted, and there is no way to get then back. This is very frustrating. Please look into this Appcelorator. I just lost a couple days of work in spoof of a second.</p>

							<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This most definitely is happening.  It happened multiple times to my coworker and I didn&#39;t understand what he was talking about until it happened to me just now….on a Sunday evening after spending all day in a code file which is now gone.  This needs to be fixed asap.  The problem is if you have focus in the project explorer, then Command-Tab to another window, then Command-Tab back expecting your current file to be in focus and hit Command-Z to undo, because the last thing you did in the project explorer was to add the file to the project and because unbeknownst to the user the project explorer has the current focus, it removes the file.  If you hit Redo, it&#39;ll add it back the way it was when you first added it hours before and all the changes are gone.  Deleting a file without user confirmation has got to be in the number one spot for bad usability in the user experience 10 commandments.  My team has lost many hours because of this issue rewriting code and it has now put our budgeted schedule at risk.  This should be a hotfix asap.  I can&#39;t imagine any of my team members doing something like leaving a line of code in a production app which deletes a user&#39;s touched file without a confirmation.  Maybe check the time the file was added to the project and compare it against the last updated time and confirm with the user if they differ?  That developer needs a talking to.</p>
<p>Real sloppy guys.</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve had this happen several times before and I don&#39;t know why? I&#39;ve dumped my working project files in dropbox and luckily dropbox backs it up. So I was able to recover it that way thank goodness. Another issue that is driving me up the wall is that every once in awhile the names of my files will be altered. For example: Facebook.js, Model.js, Sockets.js and even MY_DB_File.db will change to lowercase. So now when a user first installs the app MY_DB_File.db file it will not be found as my_db_file.db has replaced it.</p>
