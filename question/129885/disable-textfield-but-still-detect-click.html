			<h1>Disable textfield but still detect click</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello, I&#39;m stuck on this …</p>
<p>I want to disable a textfield but still have a listener detect a click&#x2F;focus on that field. I&#39;ve tried adding a rightbutton in the textfield with it&#39;s own listener but disabling the textfield disables the rightbutton as well. I guess I&#39;d expect it to work that way.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also tried editable:false but that doesn&#39;t seem to have any effect.</p>
<p>The reason for all of this is that I don&#39;t want the keyboard appearing when the field gets focus or is touched (I want the event to handle things) but that seems unavoidable. It seems that disabled:true is the only way to stop the keyboard but that also prevents listeners from receiving events from that field.</p>
<p>As a work around, the first thing the listener does is call a blur on that field to hide the keyboard but this seems ugly.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<div><p>Aaron, good question. I guess its to maintain the visual appearance of a form. I can&#39;t seem to get a label to look exactly like a textField and that bothers me. If you know of styling options that I&#39;m missing, please let me know. For now, I&#39;m calling:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">_<span class="hljs-tag">unit</span><span class="hljs-class">.blur</span>();
</code></pre><p>on the field&#39;s listener  ( _unit being the textField ) to clear the keyboard. Haven&#39;t tested on device yet but it&#39;s acceptable in the simulator.</p>
<p>I guess I would prefer not to show something at all (like the keyboard) then to have to programmatically hide it after the fact. I get your point though - I just thought there was a clever way to stop the keyboard from showing at all. Guess not. I may resort to labels down the road if I can get the styling right.</p>

							<p>I don&#39;t think that calling blur(); function on event listener is an ugly way. But i think this is the only way you should follow. After all this will give you a work around.</p>
