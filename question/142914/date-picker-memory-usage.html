			<h1>Date Picker Memory Usage</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I am in the process of porting a multithreaded app into single threaded commonJS style app. Everything is going well and I am seeing both performance and memory improvements. I am using the xcode profiling tools to ensure the app is actually improving.</p>
<p>My app uses several date pickers (Ti.UI.createPicker({type : Ti.UI.PICKER_TYPE_DATE}). When I add these pickers to a view, each one seems to add a HUGE amount of memory. I&#39;m talking like 2MB for each picker. I&#39;ve gone through and definitively can say that it is the picker. I&#39;d never noticed the picker memory usage before because it was hard to identify what was chewing it up in the old app architecture.</p>
<p>Anyone else seen this? Is this the expected memory usage?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tested on iOS5.1 and iOS6 using SDK 2.1.3RC2, results are identical, as is iOS5.1 with 2.1.2.</p>
<p>Nick</p>

							<div><p>Doing further investigation doing a healshot analysis I can see that memory is indeed being used by the DatePicker with the usage in bunch of &#39;UISectionRowData refreshWithSection:tableView:tableViewRowData&#39; under the object.</p>

							<div><p>There&#39;s no need for sample code.  Write something in Titanium that adds a date picker, i.e. by clicking a button.  Run the app in the profiler.  Watch the memory spike that the date picker causes.  And if you want to get saucy, time how long it takes to load and render the date picker on hardware (not the silly simulator).</p>
<p>Conclusion: Ti.UI.PICKER_TYPE_DATE on iOS is such a performance killer that it is unusable.</p>
<p>The only viable option is to use a custom-built date picker.  It will still take up a ton of memory, but will render much more quickly.  And by &#39;render&#39; I mean: someView.add(datePicker).</p>

<p>Also, how many pickers it mean &quot;My app uses several date pickers&quot; … ? 2, 10, maybe 50 pickers?</p>

							<div><p>I have the same problem, I use two pickers in the same screen, one for date and the other one for hours, and I get 10 392kb mallocs, totalling almost 4Mb, when a normal picker just takes a few Kbs. If I comment out these pickers I can have an stable but unusable application. Please fix this.</p>
