			<h1>don&#39;t use itunes</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Is there a way to go around using itunes? since I don&#39;t sync my ios device with the mac i&#39;m developing on, itunes wants to delete all installed apps on my ipad while syncing.</p>
<p>so i&#39;d like titaniumstudio to only produce the .ipa file, which i then can transfer via the iphone configurator.</p>
<p>if there is currently no easy way to do this, please consider adding an option in one of the coming releases.</p>

										<p><p>CLI cannot push an IPA to an attached device as it would most likely have to use undocumented functionality in violation of various legal blah blah blahs.  CLI should be able to push to testflight in the future though.</p>

							<p>Couple of things mate, just &#39;adding features&#39; isnt as easy as you may think it is.</p>
<p>Apple controls the way apps are permitted to be installed on their devices.<br>There are essentially 2 ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>developer provisioning profiles - these lets a developer put an IPA onto a device through itunes via a cable. This is the way that Apple has designated.</p>
</li>
<li><p>distribution provisioning profiles - (adhoc and itunes) itunes are, obviously, used to sign and provision your ipa for distribution only through the App Store.  The second is Adhoc. Ad hoc lets a developer designate 99 devices a year on which they can install their apps without going through itunes and the app store.</p>
</li>
<li><p>(there is enterprise, but its like having your own app store)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these are well documented by Apple in their developer documentation, which all real iOS app developers ought to be reading and are expected to be knowledgeable on, as these are the Bible as far as Apple is concerned an dit is the developer&#39;s responsibility and no one else&#39;s to understand this information.</p>
<p>Now, it is possible to remotely install your apps using an AdHoc profile, using a service such as <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;testflightapp.com">testflightapp.com</a> or others like it.  You will need the device id of the device you wish to install to, enter it into your itunes connect developer area, attach the device to a provisioning profile, sign your API using the then downloaded provisioning profile.</p>

<p>then in the future, you may want to ask a question a bit more clearly so that nice folks like Javier don&#39;t waste valuable development time on really cool tools (have you seen his latest utility?) giving you an answer to which you then say &#39;thats not what I wanted to know&#39;</p>
<p>In Titanium Studio there is an option for Ad Hoc distribution.</p>

										<p><p>It&#39;d be nice to have a switch in Titanium CLI as Benjamin asks to disable the iTunes install as sometimes you only want the IPA file to distribute it over the air as explained here:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobiledevelopertips.com&#x2F;xcode&#x2F;distribute-ad-hoc-applications-over-the-air-ota.html">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobiledevelopertips.com&#x2F;xcode&#x2F;distribute-ad-hoc-applications-over-the-air-ota.html</a></p>
<p>I have a Jenkins headless slave mac mini that compiles Titanium apps directly from Git and generates a QR code page to install into the developer devices (Similar to PhoneGap Build but for Titanium apps).<br>It makes it easier to distribute apps that way. There is no point to install the app on iTunes.</p>
