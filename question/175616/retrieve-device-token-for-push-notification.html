			<h1>Retrieve device token For Push Notification</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am working on an application which requires push notifications to be received by making use of Amazon SNS service as per client specifications.</p>
<p>So, i just need to retrieve the device token of the mobile device and send it to the server, everything else is taken care of on the server side with reference to Amazon SNS.</p>
<p>Im currently using Appcelerator cloud service(ACS) method registerForPushNotification and retrieving the device token and sending it across to the server. </p>
<p>My query is as follows -</p>
<ol>
<li>Is there any alternative to retrieving the device token if not by making use of ACS.</li>
<li>If no alternatives, i would really appreciate any information on Pricing with reference to ACS. I would like to know, if i were to use registerForPushNotifications method only, would i need to purchase a plan with Appcelerator?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks. Any thoughts are much appreciated.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Network-method-registerForPushNotifications">registerForPushNotifications</a> method for iOS is not related to ACS.  You can use it in combination with ACS, but it is the same method used for Urban Airship as well.  I know - I use it with UA.</p>
<p>You do not need to pay for any plan simply because of this.</p>
<p>On the basis that you are able to fire over some SNS code you have been working on I might be able to help you connect SNS to Titanium.  It is on my list of To-Dos - today is as good as any, provided you have a starting point point.</p>
<p>Keep in mind I offering to review your code and help you get it working - not provide you a pre-built library.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Malcolm,</p>
<p>Thank you for your response, Sir. I have been trying to find some information on this subject all weekend. Just for better understanding as i am just a beginner, i would request you to answer the following too. </p>
<ul>
<li>To retrieve the device token, it is required that i upload my p12 details( for APNS), and API keys(for GCM) to ACS, right? There is no bypassing this step and still getting the device token, correct?</li>
</ul>
<p>Logically, i understand that this is how it should work, but just for the sake of more info, i request you to shed some light on this from the production point of view.</p>
<p>As for SNS, the server side development team of my organization is working on actually registering the device for SNS service, retrieving the Amazon ARN and carrying out the push. This was decided primarily because of the lack of availability of pre built libraries for Titanium. I was under the impression that i would just need to manage the callback function of the push notification. But from your comments, i seem to be missing something. Would you please elaborate.</p>
