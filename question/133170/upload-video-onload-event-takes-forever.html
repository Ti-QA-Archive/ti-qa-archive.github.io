			<h1>Upload Video onload Event takes forever</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am uploading a video to a webpage and it works fine, the upload is fast and the progress rates are fast up to around 90%. Then it stucks. It stucks like around a minute and then suddenly <code>onload</code> is fired.<br>I don&#39;t have any special code:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'multipart/form-data');
xhr.open(<span class="hljs-string">"<span class="hljs-keyword">POST</span>"</span>, url);
xhr.send({file:Titanium.Filesystem.getFile(Titanium.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory, <span class="hljs-string">"_"</span> + _videoID + '.mov').read()});
</code></pre><p>The video file is most likely being recorded using the iPhone camera.</p>
<p>Here are my specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>TiSDK: 1.8.2(although onload seemed to fire faster in 1.8.1)</li>
<li>iOS: 5.0</li>
<li>Mac: 10.7.3</li>
<li>xCode: Latest</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#39;s no show blocker, but it&#39;s certainly annoying not to be able to tell my clients why the last 10% take sometimes 80% of the time. Anyone has an idea? If not, please vote this question at least up, so that it gets attention :)</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Christopher</p>

							<p>There is no guarantee that the problem is client side.  The onLoad will only fire when the remote server confirms completion of the session.  It might be that the server is the cause of the delay while it deals with the data it just received.</p>
<p>You can use the onSendStream and onReadyStateChange to see where in the process you are as you debug this.</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s not it unfortunately. <code>onprogress</code> stops always at around 90% and <code>onreadystatechange</code> stays quiet till the end. Does it work for your video upload? Can you please share your code with us? Maybe I did something wrong…</p>

										<p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>does it work in the server side? This could be because of server load… does it matter at what time of the day you do this test?</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro</p>
<p>Ps. Does it happen on local network (same network than the servers?)</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m seeing a similar thin to this. I have an upload service, which does some processing of the files before returning, but I have noticed that on iOS the upload progress never reaches 100% (1.0) until the server actually responds with the success data.</p>
<p>On Android, it all works fine. The file uploads (to 100%) then the app waits for the server response. </p>
<p>This bug has been around for ages I think.</p>
