			<p>I found this on the docs:</p>
<p>The global scope of app.js is not accessible from other contexts or within CommonJS modules. So, you can&#39;t just dump variables there so you can access them throughout your app.</p>
<p>Wait. I thought any variable I declare in app.js is accessible in other CommonJS modules. I&#39;ve tested it before. The above docs is confusing….</p>
<p>??</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The fact that you can right now is not something that is expected to remain and not cross platform.</p>
<p>Creating variables in the app.js in the hopes they will be accessible throughout the app is dangerous and prone to cause issues from memory leaks to dependency issues.</p>
<p>The doc is not confusing it does state the fact - do not do it.  That rug will be pulled from underneath you at any time. </p>
<p>I am going to guess and say are you also using a name space variable inside the app.js?  Or simply defined variables?</p>
<p>Whatever you are doing the afest thing to do right now is place those things inside a CommonJS module (consider it a utility module) and reference it directly inside app.js and any other file.</p>
<p>If you have any variables that you are relying on right now you do not think this will work with provide me a snippet and I will suggest better alternatives.</p>
<p>BTW please do not tell you are you using <strong>window.url</strong> and&#x2F;or <strong>Ti.include</strong>.  Own up if you are I can point you in the correct direction for those things as well.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks. It&#39;s more clear now.</p>
<p>So you suggest I create a singleton using CommonJS module like this?</p>
<p>singleton.js</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var <span class="hljs-built_in">singleton</span> = {}<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
module.exports = <span class="hljs-built_in">singleton</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>Then I can require singleton.js in anywhere. As long as I&#39;m not using window.url, they&#39;ll all reference to the same object. Right?</p>
<p>My understanding is that window.url creates a new context. So require(&#39;singleton&#39;) in the new context actually creates a new object. Right?</p>
<p>What about Ti.include?</p>

										<p><p>Oops I forgot this question:</p>
<p>in Alloy, can I use compiler constants like OS_IOS, OS_ANDROID directly in CommonJS modules (under app&#x2F;lib) without issues? Or they shouldn&#39;t be accessible either?</p>
<p>by the way, can I contact you privately, Malcolm? Are you familiar with Alloy Database Migration? I have a few questions for that too.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot!</p>

										<p><p>Yes to the first question, that is how I use CommonJS - this way that you can set and get anything inside from anywhere and it is always accessible.</p>
<ul>
<li>Models are designed to provide a repeatable context - so you do not need that from CommonJS</li>
<li>Controllers&#x2F;Views&#x2F;Styles and Widgets give you back UI that can be created multiple times and each one different - so you do not need that from CommonJS</li>
</ul>
<p>It is all about finding the right thing and using it the right way.</p>
<p>Never use window.url - it does create a multiple context app - this is NOT something you want, that has not been the design pattern for sometime and with good reason.  My only hope is that we can get newbies to stop findings those example code blocks and instead find better smarter ways.</p>
<p>Ti.include - good question, I have been campaigning for some time for its deprecation and now it has been.  It was designed to take a file of content and dump it in-line.  It had its time, but now it is an anti-pattern.  I wrote an article about it on <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tidev.io&#x2F;">tidev.io</a> recently - worth a read;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tidev.io&#x2F;2014&#x2F;05&#x2F;30&#x2F;sdk-3-3-0-ti-include-deprecated&#x2F;">Titanium 3.3.0: Ti.include() deprecated.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>When you have platform specific code always use the compiler directives - the Alloy versions, rather than the Titanium property versions.  There is a difference but for this point - simply use; OS_IOS, OS_ANDROID.  I ALWAYS use them as follows;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-comment">(OS_IOS)</span> {
  <span class="hljs-comment">// something cool</span>
}
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-comment">(OS_ANDROID)</span> {
  <span class="hljs-comment">// something coolish</span>
}
</code></pre><p>I avoid this syntax variation;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-comment">( OS_IOS)</span> {
  <span class="hljs-comment">// something coolish</span>
} else <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-comment">(OS_ANDROID)</span> {
  <span class="hljs-comment">// something coolish</span>
}
</code></pre><p>Readability is the main reason, but it also means you are less likely to accidentally break a branch.</p>
<p>Whilst I obviously take paid work on a one-to-one basis (I do own a development agency) my time is valuable so I try to make sure that what I provide pro bono is always accessible by the community as a whole.  Thus here on the Q&amp;A and via the TiDev.io site I mentioned.  I am sure you will agree I am generous with my answers given this one and the other I just answered for you.</p>

										<p><p>Sorry I didn&#39;t get the following:</p>

<p>Some quick examples?</p>
<p>And you are saying I&#39;m safe to use compiler directives in CommonJS modules (app&#x2F;lib), right?</p>
