			<h1>how can we upload audio files of sizes more than 25MB Limit</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi<br>I am using Appcelerator cloud for uploading my audio files which have sizes more than 25 MB and using titanium for app development, but Appcelerator cloud has a limit on file size which is 25 MB, can we use custom objects to upload files of large sizes, I see there is no way to upload large files as custom objects, I am stuck, so any suggestions would be highly welcomed.</p>

							<p>Use ACS to store an url of the file saved on Amazon S3.<br>I&#39;m using this approach on one of my apps ( own nodejs server, not ACS ).</p>
<p>Try to find out if ACs suports  streams, so you can upload on S3 using knox (a nodejs module for S3) <strong>without</strong> saving the file on disk, but stream it directly to S3.<br>Or you could send the file from the device directly to S3 and send the url to ACS.</p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>

										<p><p>That would probably be the more effective way around your problem. While keeping your existing ACS integration with your application.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Not sure that ACS is the right platform for your files if the 25Mb limit is a problem.  You can chat with Appcelerator sales who may be able to hook you up with a paid custom plan.</p>
<p>I would look into other solutions like;</p>
<ul>
<li>box.net</li>
<li>Amazon S3</li>
<li>dropbox</li>
<li>your own server</li>
</ul>
<p>I would favour S3 but you will need to do a cost benefit analysis.</p>

							<p>Didn&#39;t use ACS … but maybe you can lower audio quality and therefore reduce file size?</p>
