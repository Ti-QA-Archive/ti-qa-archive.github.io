							<p>Ok, Yazmin, need a better explanation.</p>
<p>If your app is too slow, what are you trying to speed up? If you are downloading an image from a  server and the transfer of the image is too slow, then you need to make a change on the server to compress the file before it gets sent. If the file is already compressed before you send it, then maybe the file size overall when it is uncompressed on the client is the problem. If you have no control over the file at the server, you can download, save to the device, compress on the device to shrink the original image, then use that to show… But that would only be a last resort in my opinion… </p>
<p>Maybe if you elaborate, I can help further.</p>
<p>Ray</p>
