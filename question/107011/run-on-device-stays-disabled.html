			<h1>Run on device stays disabled</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, I&#39;m currently developing an application for iPhone and it works fine on the simulator. My problem is that the &quot;run on device&quot; button is always disabled even if all steps have been followed (I can put my app on device via XCode). Even so, the two certificates (normal and intermediate) are not detected: the lines stay on the Titanium window even if the certificates are on KeyChain.</p>
<p>Maybe a clue: when I open the project with XCode, I have to change manually the SDK from 4.0 to 4.2 to make it work. Otherwise I have a &quot;Base SDK missing&quot; on the XCode Window that prevents the build.</p>

							<p>Do you have an Ad-Hoc provisioning profile installed?  I&#39;m wondering if it is looking for that.</p>
<p>On the XCode Base SDK missing, I always get that too.  I believe it&#39;s because the base project is built on 4.0.</p>

							<p>Yes I have: I can run my app on my iPhone if I use XCode to open the project and put it on the device. It means that all required steps are fulfilled.<br>I don&#39;t think that Titanium is looking for the provisioning profile. It clearly shows that it is looking for the certificates (those are the only remaining links above the &quot;run on device&quot; button).</p>

							<p>Ok I&#39;ve had the same problem a long time, I noticed when I added a provision for Distribution Ad-Hoc and the whole problem was gone.</p>
<p>So try to add a distribution provision and see if it works.</p>

							<p>Thank you for your answers.<br>The problem disappeared suddenly after a complete rebuild (deleting the content of my build&#x2F;iphone directory): in fact I&#39;m not sure that it is the trigger, but the certificates have been recognized after that.</p>
<p>As this manipulation fixed a lot of problems I had, I think that Titanium should add a &quot;Rebuild all&quot; button on the interface that does the job. It would be easier and safer than deleting files manualy.</p>

							<p>Personally, I&#39;ve never had luck with using Titanium to build to my device or for distribution.  I just open the project in Xcode, set my iOS sdk version and set the target to be a device, and do it that way.  Same for distribution.</p>
<p>The only problem is if you do a rebuild, you have to re-open the project and sometimes re-do the target setting, but its still faster to me and not as buggy.  All Titanium does is say something like &quot;install error&quot; and no helpful information. </p>
