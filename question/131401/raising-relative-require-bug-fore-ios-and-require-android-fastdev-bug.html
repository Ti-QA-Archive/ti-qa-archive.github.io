			<h1>Raising Relative Require Bug fore IOS and Require Android FastDev Bug</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>When I go to jira I cannot raise a bug for project mobile; so I will raise them in question in the hope that someone with more privileges then me can raise them; they are stopping Development and are show stoppers;</p>
<p>there are currently 2 bugs in 1.8.0.1. </p>
<p>I am on mac osx lion;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Relative Require does not work with IOS;</p>
</li>
<li><p>IF you require with leading &quot;&#x2F;&quot; fastdev sends tokens of incorrect paths; therefore you will see &quot;vendor&#x2F;vendor&#x2F;utils&quot; exist false as when in folder vendor and I require &#x2F;vendor&#x2F;utils it just appends from the current path</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>is there a reason why someone cannot raise a BUG on the mobile project?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>yeah that is true; but is means fastdev does not work; and working with android without fastdev is like watching paint dry</p>

										<p><p>IMHO, it&#39;s much better to develop on device, Android emulator is slow and buggy.</p>

										<p><p>hmm yes and no; does fastdev work on the devise? having instant feedback on changes for tweaking and general dev makes a developer have the fuzzy feeling of this is enjoyable;</p>
<p>whilst I have an ice cream sandwich android; having multiply android devise is surely not the way forward for me is it?</p>

										<p><p>No, I don&#39;t think fastdev works on Android devices, but if you have time and will you can port this solution to Android: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;titaniumninja.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;10559549700&#x2F;fastdev-for-ios-how-it-works&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;titaniumninja.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;10559549700&#x2F;fastdev-for-ios-how-it-works&#x2F;</a>.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t mean that you develop on every device there is :) , just one is enough, emulator can be used at the end (or when really necessary) to see if everything works fine on other devices. The problem with emulator is that sometimes some things does not work on it, while they work perfectly on device and you end up fixing bugs that actually does not exist. :)</p>

										<p><p>Even with those messages I debug quite happily on Android and FASTDEV does seem to work (ie it is very quick to recompile and deploy - 10 seconds)</p>

										<p><p>@Mark - Nope. I asked for that feature a long time ago, including fastdev on device, but no luck with that. As you can see, I am community member and most of the things that I suggest or report are ignored (no matter how useful they might be).</p>
<p>You, as enterprise member, could have more luck with that. :)</p>
<p>No matter the fact that there is no debugger that works on device (I think I saw a ticket for that in JIRA, in TiStudio, I think), I think development on device is still faster. I would rather debug using console output, than using emulator.<br>Still, fastdev could be very useful and I will try to implement Olivier&#39;s solution for (my) device (don&#39;t know when :( ).</p>
