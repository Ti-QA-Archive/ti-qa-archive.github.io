			<h1>Android Emulator will not open</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Problem: the Android emulator will not open when launching a Ti Project, or from the Android Tools AVD manager (this is true of both AVD&#39;s created by Titanium or manually created by me). Oddly, AVD&#39;s seem to function normally if started via command line (eg. $ .&#x2F;emulator-arm -avd test -partition-size 128 -no-snapshot-load -verbose -cpu-delay 0 -no-boot-anim -debug all -show-kernel &amp;).</p>
<p>There is an emulator-arm process started in the problem scenarios, but it never &quot;displays&quot;, and starts taking all CPU, and eventually has to be manually killed.</p>
<p>System: Ubuntu 10.04 LTS 32 bit, using the Ti mobilesdk. I have verified the recommended Java version is being used. This system has previously had a fully working Ti Studio &#x2F; Android Tools environment without issue. (I have another 10.04 LTS system that works just fine.)</p>
<p>Titanium and Android SDK  and Android tools are fully updated to latest stable versions.</p>
<p>Things I&#39;ve tried:</p>
<p>Multiple &#39;project cleans&#39;</p>
<p>Killing and restarting all components (verifying they are indeed killed.), eg &quot;adb kill-server; adb start-server&quot;, same with android tools and Ti Studio.</p>
<p>Manually deleting the .android&#x2F;avd and .android&#x2F;cache folders</p>
<p>Fastdev both true and false.</p>
<p>Tried several versions of Android SDK. </p>
<p>What I get in the console window:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[INFO] Titanium SDK version: <span class="hljs-number">3.0</span><span class="hljs-number">.0</span> (<span class="hljs-number">12</span>/<span class="hljs-number">12</span>/<span class="hljs-number">12</span> <span class="hljs-number">18</span>:<span class="hljs-number">49</span> a5894b3)

[ERROR] Timed out waiting <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> emulator to be ready, you may need to close the emulator and <span class="hljs-keyword">try</span> again
</code></pre><p>There are several AVD&#39;s available according to Android Tools AVD manager.  All have green check marks to indicate they aren&#39;t broken.</p>
<p>While an emulator process is started, nothing really &quot;opens&quot;, so &quot;closing&quot; does not help in this case. </p>
<p>I&#39;d like to get better logging but haven&#39;t found a way to do that. I see a few other people have had something similar, but I don&#39;t see any resolutions.</p>
<p>I know this isn&#39;t a Titanium issue per se, but am hoping someone has been here before or has ideas for finding a solution. Thanks.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>This is a common problem but not the easiest to solve, here are some things to try;</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you are not testing against Android SDK 4.2 - this is not currently supported.</li>
<li>Confirm your Java is 1.6 and NOTHING higher</li>
<li>Delete ALL AVDs, Titanium will automatically create a new one</li>
<li>In &quot;Run Configurations&quot;, change the Android Emulator SDK version to a different version</li>
<li>In &quot;Run Configurations&quot;, change the Android Emulator SDK version to include the suffix [armeable] or [armeable-v7a], for example; Android 2.3.3 [armeable] or Android 4.1.2 [armeable-v7a]</li>
<li>If you hold your files on a non-local file-system (network drive for example), create a locally stored test app, run that into the emulator, leave that running and then run your own app - this actually works for me - no joke</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>Thanks, I actually wound up re-installing the Android tools stuff and rebooting and that fixed whatever was choking. Odd that it would launch command line but not from Ti or the Tools GUI.</p>
