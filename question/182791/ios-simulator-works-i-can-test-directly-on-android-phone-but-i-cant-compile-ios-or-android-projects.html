			<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I posted this on the other Q&amp;A (community.appcelerator.com), but it&#39;s kind of dead over there and I haven&#39;t got any replies.</p>
<p>I upgraded to Appcelerator Studio a few weeks ago. Everything was working fine until I actually went to compile a project. I was originally trying to build an Enterprise iOS project, but have since tried to package for the iOS store and Android, and the same thing happens every time. After choosing the certificates, profile, etc., I click publish. A window pops up with a status bar, but goes so fast I couldn&#39;t even tell what it said until I recorded it and played it frame by frame. It says &quot;Performing Pre-Launch Check&quot;. Once that&#39;s done, nothing happens. I&#39;ve updated Xcode, there&#39;s no updates available for Titanium, and I&#39;ve tried all SDKs from 4.0.0 to 3.4.0. Same thing happens every time.</p>
<p>Another thing of note. I have a sample alloy project that I was messing around with. It actually keeps building after the pre-launch check. This made me think it might be something with my old Classic style projects. As a test, I created a brand new Classic mobile project. The default SDK was 3.4.0, so I left it at that. Didn&#39;t touch any of the code, tried to build it, and it doesn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas? Thanks in advance.</p>
