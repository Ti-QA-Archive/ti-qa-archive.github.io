			<h1>Switching between Landscape/Portrait = Screwed up Table Views</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>It seems that text is not properly reformatted when the application switches between landscape and portrait mode.  I put together a very small sample app (~100 lines of code):<br><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;1054148">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;1054148</a></p>
<p>To see what I mean, just fire up the code and do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Tab1, switch to landscape mode (command + left arrow).</li>
<li>Then move to Tab2, and notice that the text has not been reformatted.</li>
<li>While still in Tab2, switch back to portrait mode (command + right arrow)</li>
<li>Move back to Tab1, and notice the text is also screwed up there</li>
</ol>
<p>I am using 1.3.2 and iPhone SDK 4.0.  Could someone else please confirm the problem?  Is it a bug, or am I incorrectly specifying the table layout?</p>

							<p>Just dropped your code in and have seen this behavior as well.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32238-titanium-mobile&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;1354-orientation-and-layout-issues">I created a Lighthouse ticket to track it here</a>.  Thank you for providing the test case, the developers will have a much easier time reproducing and fixing.</p>

							<p>Argh, I can&#39;t believe no one has touched this bug in Lighthouse since it was created 5 months ago.  Are people not supporting landscape view in their Titanium apps?  How could this not be important enough for 1.5?</p>

							<p>I removed the widths on lines 49 and 83, as instructed, and it does not correct the problem.</p>

							<p>Repeating what I said on the LH ticket:</p>
<p>My apologies for not looking at this earlier. It&#39;s actually due to the sample code requesting two conflicting widths. That is, there&#39;s the width set to &#39;auto&#39;, which instructs the text field to stretch as far as it can horizontally to hopefully fit the text in one line. But there&#39;s also the fact that the containing row has a fixed width, and the label wants to have left and right margins of 10 within that.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not straightforward, and we still need to work on both ensuring the algorithm is the right behavior to go, and if so, educating people on it. &#39;Auto&#39; can be misleading as it&#39;s meant for &#39;Size to fit my contents, regardless of the parent&#39;s bounds,&#39; and it sometimes feels like &#39;Do what I mean.&#39;</p>
<p>Either way, if you remove the extra autos (Lines 49 and 83), which undoes the conflicting widths issue, you&#39;ll get the desired effect.</p>
