			<h1>Can&#39;t start/build my titanium project with IOS 5</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I should start with saying that I&#39;ve earlier started with a Titanium app, and only now have I gotten the opportunity to get my Apple Dev Licensing done, and I wanted to get it up and running (at least functioning) on my new IMac. I&#39;ve already seen it working (in the emulator) on another Mac, but not yet on this one. The problem is, as it&#39;s a fresh install, I can&#39;t try and go back to IOS 4.x, I&#39;m pretty much stuck with 5.</p>
<p>The problem I have is that, when starting a new Mobile app, the IPAD&#x2F;IPHONE (and, logically, the android too) buttons are greyed out. In addition, when I try to build my app, I cannot select an IOS version to run it with.</p>
<p>I have installed XCode, and I have the newest version of both the Titanium editor and the mobile framework (I&#39;ve tried it in both 1.7.3 and 1.7.4 with the same result) so i should have everything I need. I also tried reinstalling Titanium to no avail.</p>
<p>So, any ideas what I might have overlooked? Or is IOS 5 simply not supported yet?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<div><p>This sounds like a titanium issue. Have you dare I say it.. rebooted after closing down studio. It sounds like you have everything to get it running in the emulator.</p>

							<div><p>Sincere apoligies for my lack of wit in this matter, but which properties and what path ^_^&#39; - I&#39;ve looked through both the general settings of the studio (Because I can&#39;t even start a new project with the IOS SDKs) as well as the properties of the project I made earlier, but i was unable to locate what you meant.</p>

							<div><p>Ok, restarted, double-checked the path to be at &#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium - also double-checked all the files in there to be there, most notably the Titanium Mobile 1.7.3 and 1.7.4 SDKs. But still the same problem as in this screenshot</p>

							<p>Try Titanium Studio. Also, you might need new Development Provisioning Profiles and such. I remember having a hard time too. I also deleted all the files in the build folder. I hope it works.</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve finally gotten it to work, by installing the old Xcode 3 with IOS SDK 4.3. This also allowed Titanium to recognize the IOS SDK 5.0 - However, I do think Titanium has problems with fresh IOS 5.0 installs, so my advice would be to look at this and make sure other people end up with less problems.</p>
