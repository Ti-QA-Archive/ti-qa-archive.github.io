			<h1>Titanium Studio riddled with errors..</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello! I followed each step and installed the latest Titanium Studio on Windows 7. I tried running Android emulator on a sample projects but I get too many errors in the console. I googled the errors, tried different fixes and get new errors. Also on every re-install there are new kinds errors. I want to learn Titanium but I&#39;m losing faith in the IDE. Is there a specific rule to follow to make it work? I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m missing..</p>

							<p>Getting emulator to work in Titanium Studio is a nightmare. Everything is a trial and error scenario. Why isn&#39;t the IDE issue fixed? Everyone seems to have emulator problems.</p>

							<p>Android emulator worked fine for me, but there are still loads of errors. Most of them look to be a lack of hardware feature availability, such as GPS and 3G availability etc. The emulator just handles the absence of features really badly.</p>

										<p><p>I finally got it to work by installing only the minimum required Android 2.2 SDK. I still see some errors in the console but the apps run. I think that we ultimately I&#39;ll have to test it on a real mobile device. The emulator is good for layout tests on different devices.</p>

										<p><p>For what it&#39;s worth I run the emulator using SDK 3.0 on Android API ver 2.3.3 at a screen size of WVGA854. As long as you can get Android 2.3 working on any version of the SDK you&#39;re covering something like 70% of the Android base anyway.</p>
<p>I find layout changes are best done on-device anyway, purely for speed of re-launch :) Can&#39;t get the FastDev feature working though :|</p>
