			<h1>Efficient use of Memory while switching views</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>In my app I have only one window and I am using VIEWS to show different screens. In last screen I want to give BACK Button so that user could move back to original screen.</p>
<p>Now my question is, do I need to ADD and REMOVE views every time or just use &quot;visible&quot; property? Chances re user does not open a particular view. Will this not cause memory issue?</p>
<p>What&#39;s the cost of adding&#x2F;removing views? Do removing of views will remove child objects as well?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>Typically a BACK button when used as a part of a navgroup, removes the current window from the stack, in turn releasing memory used by the window and any attached elements.</p>
<p>Coming from xcode, it was always a best practice to optimize memory by releasing objects you didn&#39;t need anymore. I would think that this fundamental carries over in Titanium and although Ti does most of the memory allocation and release for you, it&#39;s still beneficial to keep this concept top of mind.</p>
<p>So if you keep all your views hidden, the objects and all its children will remain in memory and this can be costly if you have media objects. And from what I understand about how Ti works, removing views will release all its child objects from memory.</p>

							<p>Actually when you remove a view <strong>you are not removing it completely from memory</strong>. To achieve that (accordingly with this post on the lighthouse), you will need to remove+delete the view to destroy it completely.</p>
<p>&quot;Think of remove() as lazy-unload.&quot;</p>
