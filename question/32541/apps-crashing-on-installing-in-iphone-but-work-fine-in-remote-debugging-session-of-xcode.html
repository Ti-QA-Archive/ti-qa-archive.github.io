			<h1>Apps crashing on installing in iPhone but work fine in remote debugging session of xcode</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am having a serious problem. My APP as well as kitchen sink work great in the emulator. I can even open the iPhone projects in xcode and run them fine on the device.</p>
<p>However, if I try to manually run the apps on the device by clicking on it in iPhone, the Apps come up and immediately crash (both kitchen sink as well as my app).</p>
<p>I had been doing a POC of porting our iPhone app to titanium in order to convince my company that appcelerator is the way to develop projects but this issue is being a hinderance for me. While it took me only 1 week to create the App in titanium (which took 1 month in cocoa), these kinds of issue are really hard to debug for me.</p>
<p>Can someone guide me as to how to debug this issue or what might be going wrong?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
