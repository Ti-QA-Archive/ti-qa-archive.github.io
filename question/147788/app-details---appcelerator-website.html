										<p><p>Then, I think your apps are not registered to Appcelerator correctly. Don&#39;t know why.<br>But you can create new project and replace your Resources folder. In this way you can create a app that is registered on Appcelerator.  Also confirm that you have checked the Automatically Cloud Enable option.</p>

										<p><p>Nadeen, after I created the first project and it didn&#39;t work I created another and that also didn&#39;t work.  Both had cloud services enabled.  Will try again when I get home from work tonight.</p>

										<p><p>Nadeen, create another one and that one seems to work fine.  Noticed that this one has the Titanium icon on the side while the others (that don&#39;t work) have a dull cloud.</p>
