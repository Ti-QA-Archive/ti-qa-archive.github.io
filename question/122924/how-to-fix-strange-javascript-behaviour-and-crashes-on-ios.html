			<h1>How to fix strange javascript behaviour and crashes on iOS</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>OK, so I&#39;ve been developing with Titanium for a good while now with my first App running very nicely on Android. Now I want to release the app for iOS too and I&#39;ve run into what seem to be javascript related problems on iOS. Code that works perfectly well on Android, and as far as I can tell is valid javascript code is causing problems on iOS, specifically the app either crashes hard with no log&#x2F;debug to explain why, or the javascript just doesn&#39;t behave the way I expect.</p>
<p>It&#39;s taken me a good long while to isolate one of the problems into a simple enough example to post up here in the hope that someone can shed some light on what is going on (or what i&#39;m doing wrong). The following code sample is based on what I am doing in my app, apologies that it lacks context but I wanted to create a really concise example, there is a lot more code in the real app for this scenario but this demonstrates the problem best.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">obja = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(parent)</span>
</span>{
<span class="hljs-comment">//    this.parent = parent;</span>

    <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.view = Ti.UI.createView();
};

obja.prototype.show = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span>
</span>{
    Ti.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">'here we go'</span>);
    <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.view.mrgOwner = <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>;
    Ti.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">'we dont get here if the \'this.parent = parent\' line above is uncommented'</span>);
};

objb = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span>
</span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.o = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> obja(<span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>);
    <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.o.show();
};

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> o = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> objb();
</code></pre><p>Basically the above code will crash on iOS if the lie &#39;this.parent = parent&#39; is uncommented (it doesn&#39;t crash at this line but at the line &#39;this.view.mrgOwner = this;&#39;. I&#39;m using Titanium Studio with SDK 1.7.1 and XCode 4. I&#39;ve tried with XCode 3, mobile SDK 1.7.2 and 1.8.0. Also tried completely reinstalling XCode and Titanium Studio + SDK&#39;s but it doesn&#39;t make difference. Works fine on Android but not on iOS.</p>
<p>I&#39;m getting other javascript weirdness too, particularly a problem where object references that I pass around my code seem to end up pointing to different copies of the object so when I make a change in one part of the code, another function referencing the same object gets different values. Haven&#39;t been able to isolate a simple example of that problem yet (and again this problem doesn&#39;t happen on Android)</p>
<p>If anyone knows what might be going on here I&#39;d appreciate the input as this is the only problem holding me back from releasing on iOS.</p>

							<div><p>When value weirdness occurs, I ask myself, &quot;am I programming like this is single threaded or multithreaded.&quot;  Usually, in my own case, because I&#39;m in JS and not c++ or O-c, I revert to the old world of JS one line, one result which yields situations where multiple functions in different threads may end up affecting the same variable at the wrong time.

<p>I&#39;m not sure I understand what you&#39;re trying to do with your code. You&#39;re coding in a manner I would not. Are you trying to make a factory method for views or something? Like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">obja = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
   <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> view = Ti.UI.createView();
   <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> view;
};
</code></pre><p>As for your second question, objects are passed in a strange way that is both by value and by reference. See <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;518000&#x2F;is-javascript-a-pass-by-reference-or-pass-by-value-language&#x2F;3638034#3638034">this stackoverflow answer</a> for more details.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the quick response Tim. The code example is a little obtuse because I wanted to create a valid example but without the overhead of my whole app. The &#39;obja&#39; represents a page object in my app which contains a view with all it&#39;s children (it&#39;s not a factory). The &#39;objb&#39; then represents my &#39;controller&#39; object which instantiates and communicates with the page object (obviously in my real app both objects have many more methods and interactions, event handlers, etc).</p>
<p>I guess the point is that the code example is perfectly valid Javascript as far as I can tell, and works absolutely fine on Android. You can try for yourself by just popping my example code in the &#39;app.js&#39; of a basic app in Titanium Studio and then running it in the iOS simulator. I can&#39;t understand why uncommenting the line &#39;this.parent = parent&#39; then causes a crash in a completely different function.</p>
<p>Regards my 2nd point about other javascript weirdness, thanks for the tip but I am aware of the by ref &#x2F; by value stuff in JS. I&#39;ve done some further investigation and I think I have an idea of what is going on, but I&#39;m not sure why it only affects iOS. Basically I&#39;m adding a custom property to a Ti TableViewRow object which contains an object reference: e.g.:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> myObj = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> myDataObj();
myObj.status = <span class="hljs-string">'not clicked'</span>;

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> rowView = Ti.UI.createTableViewRow();
rowView.myObjProp= myObj;
</code></pre><p>then in my row click event handler I access the custom property in order to change the properties of my data object, e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(evt)</span> </span>{
  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> obj = evt.row.myObjProp;
  obj.status = <span class="hljs-string">'clicked'</span>;
}
</code></pre><p>although the event handler seems to modify the object successfully, if I then reference the object via the &#39;myObj&#39; global variable the changes made in the event handler are not there. It&#39;s almost like the event handler is presenting me with a different copy of the object. Again this works fine on Android, i.e. the change made in the event handler affects the same object as referenced by the &#39;myObj&#39; global variable. I&#39;m wondering if on iOS the custom properties of Titaniums JS proxy objects are serialized and then deserialized so that they are effectively copies of the original objects which would explain this behaviour?</p>

										<p><p>I tried some further digging and debugging and it seems as though JS on iOS is not setting object properties as I would expect. Setting this.parent should add the parent property to your o object. But in the debugger, I never see new properties added to it. Same for obja and objb. They are empty objects.</p>
<p>We are talking two different JS engines: Rhino on Android and JavaScriptCore on iOS. I&#39;m kinda throwing up my hands and saying it must be due to differences in implementations that&#39;s giving the different behaviors. You could probably beat your head against the wall figuring out exactly what&#39;s going on. The pragmatic approach might be to alter your code to fit what works.</p>
<p>Sorry I don&#39;t have any really helpful insights to offer. Maybe someone else with a deeper understanding of JSCore will speak up.</p>

										<p><p>There is definitely some differences in the iOS JS Engine, the Android Rhino engine seems to adhere more closely to the JS spec. I&#39;ve actually worked around the 1st problem now (the &#39;this.parent = parent&#39; problem) although I could forsee future scenario&#39;s where I would want this to work.</p>
<p>For the 2nd problem I am going to try and refactor so that I only attach properties with simple types (e.g. string&#x2F;number) to the TableViewRow object. Basically attach an index number to the row and then use this to lookup the object from an array in the event handler. I&#39;ll let you know if this works!</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ve done some more investigation and I believe that both my issues are actually due to the same problem. I&#39;d really appreciate it Tim if you can validate my findingsâ¦.</p>
<p>So it appears that on iOS when you add a custom property to one of the Titanium JS proxy objects, e.g. a &#39;view&#39; object, that your property is serialized as a copy of the value&#x2F;objects that the property refers too. Whats more it appears this copy is a &#39;deep&#39; copy, i.e. it copies all referenced objects as well. This is best demonstrated by this code sample:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// Create an object with a child object</span>
<span class="hljs-built_in">var</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">parent</span> = {
    value: <span class="hljs-string">'test'</span>,
    child: {val: <span class="hljs-string">'test2'</span>}
};

<span class="hljs-comment">// Create Titanium view object and assign our object as a custom property</span>
<span class="hljs-built_in">var</span> view = Ti<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>UI<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>createView();
view<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>myObj = <span class="hljs-keyword">parent</span>;

<span class="hljs-comment">// Change value of our object properties</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">parent</span><span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>value = <span class="hljs-string">'something else'</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">parent</span><span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>child<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>val = <span class="hljs-string">'different'</span>;

<span class="hljs-comment">// Are the values referenced by the local variable the same as those</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// accessed via the property of the view. They ought to be the same</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// as normal javascript code would make the 'view.myObj' refer to the </span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// same object as 'var parent'. Android works as expected but iOS </span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// does not!</span>
alert(
    <span class="hljs-string">'Values equal, parent? '</span> + (<span class="hljs-keyword">parent</span><span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>value === view<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>myObj<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>value) + 
    <span class="hljs-string">', child? '</span> + (<span class="hljs-keyword">parent</span><span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>child<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>val === view<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>myObj<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>child<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>val)
);
</code></pre><p>If you run the above on iOS you will get the alert telling you that the values do NOT match. Whereas on Android the values DO match!</p>
<p>I believe this explains my original problem where the object references its parent (i.e. when &#39;this.parent = parent&#39; is uncommented) as this effectively creates a circular reference such that when we get to the line &#39;this.view.mrgOwner = this&#39; the serialisation enters a recursive loop resulting in stack overflow and application&#x2F;simulator crash.</p>
<p>It also explains the 2nd problem where the changes made in the event handler function do not affect the original object reference that was added to the TableViewRow because the object is actually a copy.</p>
<p>Now I know what will happen on iOS I can work around it in code, although it is somewhat inconvenient. I think Appecelerator should fix this functionality as it is very difficult to debug and causes weird problems that I wouldn&#39;t mind betting are effecting other Titanium users (particularly as from a Javascript perspective I am not doing anything wrong and therefore this really should be considered a bug). So to be clear, when a custom property of a Titanium JS proxy object refers to an object it should be treated as a reference and not a copy of the object AND the behaviour should be consistent between iOS and Android (and Blackberry)!</p>
<p>If this issue cannot be fixed (i.e. is intrinsic in the way that Titanium interacts with the JS engine on iOS). Then Appcelerator ought to update their docs &#x2F; getting started guides to make it clear that the support for custom properties on Titanium JS proxy objects should only be used for simple values, i.e. string&#x2F;number, not for objects as they will be copied rather than referenced on iOS!</p>

										<p><p>This issue is not just with reserved propert y names like parent. I&#39;m having this issue with a number of different property names. The common denominator is that I assign objects to these properties, and that&#39;s what&#39;s making iOS Simulator crash, although it also depends what&#39;s in the object and where the object came from. Haven&#39;t tried Android; MobileWeb deals with this just fine.</p>
