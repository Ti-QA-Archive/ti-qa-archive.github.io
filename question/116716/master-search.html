		<section>
			<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>I&#39;m creating a tab bar based app with one of the tabs a Search tab.  I will have multiple tables containing software names, versions, vendors, etc. and need a &#39;master search&#39; to search all of my tables at once.  I&#39;m able to use the built-in search for each table with no problem but, as you know, it only searches the table it&#39;s located in individually. I want to allow users to use a top-level search to find what they&#39;re looking for without having to drill down through various tables to get to what they want.  Can someone point me to or provide example code for searching multiple tables at once and pulling the search results into a table view?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

<p>All my data is pulled from a MySQL Database, so I guess I could just have a page that pulls all the data and someone could just cycle through the entire thing…</p>

							<p>I am currently working on a similar problem, my solution is to have an API call that handles the search on the server and provides me the aggregated results.</p>
<p>I dont know your application architecture, but if there is a lot of data you might want to try that approach</p>
