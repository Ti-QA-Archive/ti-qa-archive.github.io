			<p>I&#39;m trying out Titanium for iPhone development primarily. Previously I was a .NET Developer, so I&#39;m used to Visual Studio having everything integrated. I&#39;m not used to developing on my Mac, other than a bit with XCode.</p>
<p>I would appreciate any suggestions for editors and debuggers for developing with Titanium.</p>
<p>thanks.</p>

<p>Are you aware that Appcelerator acquired Aptana recently? See <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;appcelerator-acquires-aptana&#x2F;">this page</a>. I imagine that Appcelerator will start promoting Aptana as the preferred tool soon.</p>

							<p>Aptana Studio 2 or 3 is a free IDE, but be aware that it has a rather large footprint.</p>
<p>On the Mac, the kind of default standard is TextMate.  It&#39;s really nice and has a built-in text expander for shortcuts, which allow you to code very quickly without having to go to a bundle kind of thing.  It&#39;s also a smaller footprint. There is no syntax checking, but there is color highlighting for most common languages. However, it&#39;s $56 US. </p>
<p>Smultron is a very functional, kind of minimal editor, as is TextWrangler (BBEdit&#39;s little brother). Both are similar, have a reasonably small footprint and are free of charge.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>Korky</p>

							<p>I&#39;m a 15+ year Microsoft web developer so I remember the days of Classic ASP. I tried to use Visual Studio and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s fine but I have just decided to use Aptana. I used it before Appcelerator bought them and it&#39;s worked great. I use both versions on my Mac and PeeCee.</p>

										<p><p>I use VS and its derivatives, and yes, its a big overkill.</p>
<p>Aptana is good, but I quit using it when they mindlessly dropped PHP support. Then I went to NetBeans (equally as big).  The 2.05 version of Aptana is good for HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS kinds of things so it works well and has those things you want if you want an IDE.</p>
<p>Titanium IS the both the compiler and debugger, by the way (not in the true sense, but you could think about it that way.</p>
<p>In any case, on a MAC, if you want a great, free IDE, Aptana or NetBeans will be equally as good.  If you want only a text editor with extensions, my suggestion is TextMate.</p>

							<p>As others have mentioned Aptana Studio is good for this kind of of development already, and we&#39;ll be bringing a lot more Appcelerator-specific features to it. Some early highlights:</p>
<ol>
<li>Titanium-specific code assistance while editing</li>
<li>Compatibility with the ADT Eclipse plugin</li>
<li>Integrated Titanium packaging and deployment for desktop and mobile platforms</li>
<li>Debugging</li>
<li>All-in-one package so no need to download and configure a bunch of separate development environments.</li>
</ol>
<p>Aptana Studio currently has a pretty robust extensibility model, and you can import a number of TextMate bundles into it, so it&#39;s relatively easy to customize it to suit your needs.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll of course be adding more as time goes on, but we think the features above alone should help smooth and enhance Titanium Development. If there are things people would love to see, please let us know.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>Ingo</p>

										<p><p>Interesting, Ingo.  Are all these features already in the current version, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aptana.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;studio2&#x2F;download">2.0.5</a>?</p>
