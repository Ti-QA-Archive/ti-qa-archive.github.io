							<div><p>I am moderating this question.</p>
<p>This is yet another question is a series that you have asked since your account was created.  This is a Q&amp;A and it is designed for people who do not know something or have problems to seek help from others.  However there are rules and there are a basic set of understandings that are found in society as well as here;</p>
<ul>
<li>You try things yourself BEFORE coming and asking questions</li>
<li>You show what you have tried or where you have searched in order to help those answering that you have both tried to resolve this and if the things you are searching for help in away answer what could be a misunderstanding</li>
<li>You do NOT ask for complete code.  Many of your questions have done this.  It shows you have no interest in learning and you simply wish to be provided everything without any effort on your part.</li>
</ul>
<p>So these are some tips to help you be a better developer and make the most of the Q&amp;A;</p>
<ul>
<li>Read this - <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tidev.io&#x2F;2014&#x2F;02&#x2F;05&#x2F;titanium-qa-how-to-ask-a-successful-question&#x2F;">Titanium Q&amp;A: How to ask a successful question</a></li>
<li>Try things yourself, this question already has answers, they are all in the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#">documentation</a> you have to look for them - but they are not hidden, there are many examples</li>
<li>Learn that to understand a language and an API - you have to try things, tweak the values and see what happens</li>
<li>The best developers spend time learning abut how each thing works and then they are able to decide if they can or should include this thing as it solve the problem at hand.</li>
<li>The best developers know how to search out for answers - Ray makes a very obvious statement that he rightly believes you have yet to understand - search first.  Personally I always search;<br>&quot;Appcelerator (your problem)&quot;</li>
<li>You are unlikely to be the first with these problems</li>
<li>Developers who try to glue their app together with random code from all over the place without understanding it will create bad apps with bad user experiences and will fail to understand how to fix problems as you probably only contributed 10% of the app yourself</li>
<li>Developing apps is a skill that only a few have</li>
<li>People will stop answering your questions for the reasons I mentioned above - and as you can see that has happened already.</li>
</ul>
<p>So spend some time in the documentation, play with each part, learn how everything fits together.  Use several Android and iOS devices with as many good and bad apps as you can download.  Learn what works and what fails.  Then be an app developer and develop an app - but you have to learn first.  This is the same as any other job, thankfully pilots learn how to take off, fly and land before they actually do those things.  Brain surgeons do not get to play with an open skull on their first day of work.  App developers are the same - and as with those two examples - you have to constantly learn more as things change.</p>
<p>This question will be closed as it will not get answered, once you have spent some time learning and trying - then come back here you will be welcomed as long as you learn from my comments above.</p>

							<p>You need to start learning&#x2F;leveraging from available information… My spoonfeed answer still stands… Google this &quot;save remote image locally site:appcelerator.com&quot;</p>
<p>There are many examples here. </p>
