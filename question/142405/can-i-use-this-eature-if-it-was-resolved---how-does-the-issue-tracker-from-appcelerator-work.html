			<p>I need to move an annotation on a map, and as I can see, it has already been solved few days ago:<br><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-10739">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-10739</a></p>
<p>How can I use this feature? It says release 3.0 . Does this mean that it will be added to release 3(which might be many months from now). Is there any way to use the fix? I tried updating the SDK but it didn&#39;t solve the issue. How should I approach this, as I need it urgently?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

							<p>This means that its fixed in the current 3.0.0 CI build. You can grab nightly builds from the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;index.html">CI Server</a>. Please keep in mind that continuous integration builds are NOT officially supported. If you have issues and ask questions regarding CI builds, very few people are going to be able to help you, and will probably tell you to use a supported version.</p>

										<p><p>No, it will be integrated into the 3.0.0 release, I believe the 23rd release will be 2.1.4 RC. I gave you the link to the CI server above. You can also see the tutorial in the wiki article <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides2&#x2F;Installing+Titanium+SDK+Continuous+Builds">Installing Titanium SDK Continuous Builds</a>.</p>
