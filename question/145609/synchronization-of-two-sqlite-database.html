			<h1>Synchronization of two sqlite database</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>On my server I have a sqlite database file. This file can be downloaded on the three devices. In these two devices I can make changes to the file (insert, edit or delete records) and save changes offline, on the local database. From the device I have to create a function that, when I am online, synchronizes data of the local database with data of the sqlite database on the server.</p>
<p>What is the best approach to allow synchronization of the two databases?</p>

							<p>Your best bet is to download the sqlite file from the remote server, remove the local database and then install the downloaded database locally. Should be quick and painless.</p>

										<p><p>This is what I&#39;m already doing. But there is a problem I had not considered … I call my two devices: device1 and device2.<br>Suppose that the two devices downloading the file on the server. Both from the device2 device1 that, I add new records to the database. When the device1 will be online, replace the databse server with that of device1. If you then connect the device2, I have two possibilities:<br>1) download the database from the server (thus losing the data stored on device2)<br>2) replace the database server with that of device2 (losing data device1)</p>
<p>This solution, therefore, is not good. Should I instead create a function that allows me to run a data synchronization.</p>

										<p><p>You can push the changes from each device to the server, make the changes on the server, then sync the database from the server, in essence picking up any changes that have been made by the other device. No matter what, if a device is allowed to make changes to the db while offline, then you will always have some level of inaccuracy with the data. You&#39;re literally talking about creating a CVS with your database.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think sqlite was created with master-slave replication in mind, however, that doesn&#39;t mean that it can&#39;t be done. Maybe you should check out something like sqlite3-rdiff that would allow you to compare your databases, and create deltas that are also sqlite files. This of course would have to be done as master-slave as master-master with 3 different databases would be incredibly difficult conflict resolution.</p>

										<p><p>Reflecting a bit, I&#39;ve come up with this solution:</p>
<p>I could create an additional table (changesTable) that contains all changes made since the last synchronization.</p>
<p>Every time I run an SQL statement, I put in changesTable a timestamp and a string that contains the SQL code executed.</p>
<p>When I download the file from the server, I check if there are records in the table changesTable. If there are records, I check the timestamp of the last table changesTable of my device. If the timestamp of the server is more recent, I run all SQL statements in the table changesTable server, whose timestamp is greater than that in the table of the device.</p>
<p>As soon as I can, I have to try this :)</p>
