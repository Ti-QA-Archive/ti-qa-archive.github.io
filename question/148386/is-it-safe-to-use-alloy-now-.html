							<p>Hi</p>
<p>There are many apps being built right now and some already in the respective stores that are entirely Alloy.</p>
<p>Yes it is still in beta but full release I believe is due for Titanium SDK 3.1 which due sometime around April if memory serves me.</p>
<p>There are a few bugs, but most are documented, the Q&amp;A has many how to examples and the documentation is rich with examples.</p>
<p>If you are planning a new app new very worth considering especially if the re-use and separation of code is likely to speed up and make your app more manageable.</p>
<p>I would and will in fact be using Alloy as the basis of my next app.  There is a learning curve because you have to be strict with yourself in the separation to make the biggest gains.  In my opinion using a MVC structure is the intelligent way to go and Alloy appears to be a good implementation.</p>
