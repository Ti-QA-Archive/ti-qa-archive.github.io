			<h1>Problem with Views wrapped in scrollViews to enable zooming</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have an app that was initially developed using an older Titanium SDK that supported the maxZoomScale property in the scrollableView object. The app loads an array of<br>Views into a scrollableView and I wanted these views to be zoomable, so the maxZoomScale was set to 2.0 in createScrollableView. This worked perfectly, but when maxZoomScale support was dropped from scrollableView (I think in SDK 1.8.0, not sure), my zooming capability broke.</p>
<p>Since maxZoomScale is now only available in scrollView, I decided to wrap the Views in scrollViews before handing them off to createScrollableView, per an example in the maxZoomScale page of the API docs. This worked, however, I&#39;m seeing weird rendering problems with some of the views..the content (mostly text) appears, but it&#39;s misformatted (font too large, style settings not adhered to).</p>
<p>It seems that this weird behavior is related to the size parameters set in createScrollView, particularly contentWidth and contentHeight. I have played around with these and have tried every combination, but the rendering problem remains. I&#39;ve tried setting these to hard values, percentages (eg, &quot;100%&quot;) and &#39;auto&#39; (which is what many of the API docs and forum comments suggest) and nothing works. In fact, when set to &#39;auto&#39; I get a warning message that says that &#39;auto&#39; is set to 0 and the view may not display (it actually does display). If I leave out everything but maxZoomScale, the scrollView breaks and nothing displays, so it seems that size parameters are required, but they are set incorrectly.</p>
<p>Configuration: SDK 1.8.2, Titanium Studio  build 1.0.9.201202141208 on OSX 10.6.8; iOS 4.x, 5.0 on both Simulator and device</p>
<p>Code (simplified):</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">myView = Ti.UI.createView ({
    top:<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,
    left:<span class="hljs-string">"5%"</span>,
    right:<span class="hljs-string">"5%"</span>,
    backgroundColor:<span class="hljs-string">"#fff"</span>
});

myScrollView = Titanium.UI.createScrollView ({
    maxZoomScale:<span class="hljs-number">2.0</span>,
    contentWidth:<span class="hljs-number">248</span>, <span class="hljs-comment">//have tried 'auto' and '100%', doesn't fix issue</span>
    contentHeight:<span class="hljs-string">"100%"</span>, <span class="hljs-comment">//have tried 'auto' and hard value, doesn't fix issue;</span>
            <span class="hljs-comment">//have also tried setting width and height, to no avail</span>
    top:<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,    <span class="hljs-comment">//it seems redundant to set these again, but unless they are</span>
        <span class="hljs-comment">//hardcoded, the view breaks (can't even use the get methods to grab</span>
        <span class="hljs-comment">//them from myView object, eg, myView.getLeft</span>
    left:<span class="hljs-string">"5%"</span>,
    right:<span class="hljs-string">"5%"</span>,
    backgroundColor:<span class="hljs-string">"#fff"</span>
});
myScrollView.add(myView);

<span class="hljs-comment">//...this is part of a looping code that actually builds an array of views</span>
scrollViewsArray.push(myScrollView);

<span class="hljs-comment">//...then passes them to a scrollableView</span>
scrollView = Titanium.UI.createScrollableView ({
    views: scrollViewsArray,
    showPagingControl:<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>,
    pagingControlHeight:<span class="hljs-number">20</span>
});
</code></pre><p>So my question is, does anybody have any ideas what might be going on here? Is this related to the width&#x2F;height settings of scrollView, or to something else? If so, what&#39;s the best way to set these settings so that they are inherited from the object being viewed (the entire available View space is being used, I&#39;m not trying to limit the size in any way in scrollView). </p>
<p>Lastly, I have read the explanation in the API docs page of maxZoomScale regarding its removal from scrollableView and ImageView, but it seems to me that it should&#39;ve been left in there. Now, support for zooming is only left in scrollView and we have to wrap everything in it if we want to use zooming, an extra step that seems burdensome.</p>
<p>Thanks for any explanations.<br>-Daniel</p>

							<p>I think the problem starts with using percentages in position properties (left, right…). I think it&#39;s ok for sizes (height, width), but for position may result confusing. </p>
<p>I can&#39;t figure out exactly what are you trying to do, but I suggest you to start with a fixed size for myView (<code>top:0, left:0, right:0, bottom:0</code> or <code>width:x, heihgt:y</code> where x and y are any value. </p>
<p>In <code>myScrollView</code>, set <code>contentWidth</code> and <code>contentHeight</code> to <code>auto</code> and <code>zoomScale:1</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to send a more complete code sample, with a real view as you want to use, I&#39;ll help you.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the  suggestion Javier, I really appreciate it! </p>
<p>Let me try that, and if it doesn&#39;t work maybe I can send more code. It&#39;s quite a bit of it and rather complex, but I&#39;ll see if I can send more to further clarify. I inherited this code so I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m not entirely familiar with it either ;-(</p>

							<p>Javier, your solution worked, thanks!</p>
<p>The rendering problem appears to have been caused by the width of the view being narrower than the width of the content I am trying to display. Using percentages instead of defined view sizes led to this problem occurring in some of the pages, thereby causing those pages to render poorly.</p>
<p>By first defining the width of myView, setting contentWidth&#x2F;Height to &#39;auto&#39; in myScrollView works fine with no warnings, and all pages render fine provided the myView width is wide enough for the displayed content. </p>
<p>So, the code would be something as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">myView = Ti.UI.createView ({
    top:<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,
    <span class="hljs-variable">width</span>:<span class="hljs-number">290</span>,
    <span class="hljs-variable">height</span>:<span class="hljs-number">350</span>,
    backgroundColor:<span class="hljs-string">"#fff"</span>
});

myScrollView = Titanium.UI.createScrollView ({
    maxZoomScale:<span class="hljs-number">2.0</span>,
    zoomScale:<span class="hljs-number">1.0</span>, <span class="hljs-comment">//this doesn't make a difference, but I left it in just in case</span>
    contentWidth:<span class="hljs-string">'auto'</span>,
    contentHeight:<span class="hljs-string">'auto'</span>,
    top:<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,  
    left:<span class="hljs-number">15</span>,
    right:<span class="hljs-number">15</span>,
    backgroundColor:<span class="hljs-string">"#fff"</span>
});
myScrollView.<span class="hljs-built_in">add</span>(myView);

scrollViewsArray.push(myScrollView);

scrollView = Titanium.UI.createScrollableView ({
    views: scrollViewsArray,
    showPagingControl:<span class="hljs-keyword">true</span>,
    pagingControlHeight:<span class="hljs-number">20</span>
});
</code></pre><p>The problem with hardcoding the size is that things break down when the phone is flipped to landscape. So the width and margins need to be recalculated.</p>
<p>To solve this, I used the window size property to recalculate the margins and width for every view:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">margin = Math.<span class="hljs-built_in">ceil</span>(myWindow.<span class="hljs-built_in">size</span>.<span class="hljs-variable">width</span> * <span class="hljs-number">5</span>/<span class="hljs-number">100</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">//5% margin</span>
<span class="hljs-variable">width</span> = myWindow.<span class="hljs-built_in">size</span>.<span class="hljs-variable">width</span> - margin*<span class="hljs-number">2</span>;
</code></pre><p>then reset the width and margins in myScrollView:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">myScrollView.contentWidth = width<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
myScrollView.left = margin<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
myScrollView.right = margin<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>It would be great to be able to use relative percentages to do all this, but this produces unpredictable results, at least in my code. If the myView width and height is set to percentages, the myScrollView contentWidth&#x2F;Height cannot be set to &#39;auto&#39; - this generates that warning that says the object has an auto value of 0 so it may not be visible. Also, if I use percentages for the margins (right and left), I get occasional rendering issues, and the transition between different views in myScrollableView is mushy and wobbly. So using relative percentages seems to be problematic all around for me.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#39;m sure some of these issues may be specific to my code, and there may be other ways to do this, but this approach has worked for me. Thanks again Javier for leading me on this path.</p>
<p>All of this was needed because maxZoomScale was removed from the View object, which I still don&#39;t quite understand why. I&#39;d be curious if anyone else has had problems with this change or sees it as adding extra unnecessary complexity when working with zoomable views. </p>
<p>-Daniel</p>
