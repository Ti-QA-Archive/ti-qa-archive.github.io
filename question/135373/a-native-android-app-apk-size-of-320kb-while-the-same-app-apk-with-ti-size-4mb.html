			<h1>A Native Android app apk size of 320kb while the same app apk with TI size 4mb+?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello</p>
<p>I know this is not the question which raised due to any version update or any other changes in the TI framework, but common for all TI version. </p>
<p>I am looking for the solution to reduce the size of my android apk. Is there any possibilities to get the reduction in the size with the coming soon Ti.2.0 updates?</p>
<p>Is there any other framework out their which would probably help me to reduce at least 20% to 40% of the apk size?</p>
<p>Really need the answer on this, as this is the only thing which makes my client worried more.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Nikunj</p>

							<div><p>I am also interested to know whether 2.0 will address this issue. But I am not going to be too hopeful on this since there is no indication yet for Appcelerator to do this.</p>
<p>One thing for sure you can do is to compile the core yourself, and strip whatever libraries that are not needed. If you open the apk file using 7zip for an example, under lib folder there are another two subfolders which are quite identical:armeabi and armeabi-v7a. I think these are v7 and rhino libraries and they shouldn&#39;t be in together in the apk. Probably the changes needed from Appcelerator is if user chose v8, then don&#39;t embed the rhino libraries. I could be wrong though, v8 may still refer to some symbols in rhino - so for this, there is a need to restructure the libraries so v8 will never depend on rhino in future.</p>

							<div><p>I tried to remove the so-called rhino library, the apk size went down from close to 6MB to 3.6MB which is 40% size reduction. And if you custom compile, you can probably get it down by another 20% - YMMV of course.</p>

							<div><p>Dude both ARM EABI libs are needed :)They are ARM plugins for better executing of the code. Deleting one might cause a crash</p>

							<div><p>Nikunj.. you can search around on how to compile the libraries.. I forgot the link.. sorry :)</p>
<p>Filip,<br>Yes as I said in my post (although probably not clear).. v8 may still refer to some symbols in rhino although IMO.. they both look very identical (and both has stlport which is a waste!). Appcelerator should refactor both libraries so that v8 doesn&#39;t depend on v7 and vice versa. That way, we can remove rhino if all we want is v8.</p>

							<div><p>Hi Syed</p>
<p>ok sure, i will look for that. But if some one could come up with great article or any post then might help many of other developers like me out to solve this problem. </p>

							<div><p>I am waiting for the answer from the Appcelerator team but seems like they all busy setting up the launch event of 2.0, I dont blame it as its a party time for all.. so lets just wait for a little more to get the solution.</p>
