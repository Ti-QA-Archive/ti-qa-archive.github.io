I thought that it might only be a problem for us Mac developers getting errors on new installs but today I got this email from one of our consultant companies:</h2>
<p>We tried to download and install the Appcelerator tool. We were successful in downloading the files but whenever we tried to install the same, it gave error message. Can you please send us the install files of the tool so that we can use that file to install the same on our server? Please zip the files as executable files are not permitted by firewalls.</p>
<h2 id="please-let-us-know-your-feedback-">Please let us know your feedback.</h2>
<p>This is not just a big embarrassment for us but for all developers trying to stand-up for something we started to believe in. What happened to Appcelerator?</p>

<p>We don&#39;t &#39;ignore&#39; anyone.  We&#39;re 20 people supporting a community of 50,000 developers.  Believe me when I say that we work our tails off to meet the needs of as many people as we possibly can.</p>
<p>We&#39;re improving the doc daily, we just added a fulltime QA person, we just added a fulltime training person, we are trying to blog more, squash bugs, and add as many cool scenarios to our offering as we can.</p>
<p>We can do better.  But I can tell you, we don&#39;t ignore anyone.</p>

										<p><p>There are quite many questions from developers not even able to get started on the Q&amp;A and I don&#39;t understand why Appcelerator do not prioritize helping these (possibly with bugfixes - most of us are very advance users that would solve a simple installation process).

I will email you directly but if we solve the issue please post it to the Q&amp;A. Many others have the very same problem.</p>

							<p>Scott Schwarzhoff is right. Appcelerator work their asses off to bring us the best. Some, such as jeff, even work through Sunday to get bug fixes done. I follow @titanium_github on twitter and the progress is truly amazing! Like he said, they have a lot on their hand and they&#39;re doing their best to meet everyone&#39;s need but if you really need urgent support, I suggest you upgrade your account. Plus it supports them become better and better! </p>

										<p><p>Can you imagine how many developers that are not even getting the basic application with Kitchen Sink running will buy premium membership? Naturally we want to get a feeling of the application before investing in it.

										<p><p>Interesting thread.    I&#39;m guessing that the 1,665 <em>unanswered</em> posts in this forum are from people that <strong>DO</strong> feel a bit ignored.   </p>
<p>I agree with Mr Rasmussen - if I can&#39;t get basic functionality to work as a demonstration of product capabilities - I&#39;m not going to pay $200&#x2F;month <em>hoping</em> that it will magically start working.  </p>
<p>This is why software developers have trial versions - you download it and try it … if it works and you like it, you buy it.  If it doesn&#39;t work and the devs don&#39;t&#x2F;won&#39;t&#x2F;can&#39;t help you get it running, you uninstall and find another (working) solution.</p>

							<p>Can not agree with this.  I develop on an Apple and in less than one week I have a great working application. The forums provide an easy opportunity to learn from others just by reading them in detail.  I have not found a problem that has arisen I have not been able to find an answer online or by reviewing the Kitchen Sink application.  </p>
