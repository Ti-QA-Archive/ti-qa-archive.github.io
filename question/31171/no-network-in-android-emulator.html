			<h1>No network in android emulator</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Ti SDK: 1.3.0<br>Android: API 2.2</p>
<p>Currently I am not able to access the network from the android emulator (note that I don&#39;t have the iphone emu installed in order to compare).</p>
<p>How should I go about resolving this?  I have pasted my trace here : <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hals-paste.pastebin.com&#x2F;EQj8nm9p">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hals-paste.pastebin.com&#x2F;EQj8nm9p</a> , which contains a number of errors that may or may not need resolving. Although I have another issue which I will explain in another post, the emulator and apps work as expected in other respects. Any advice is appreciated.</p>
<p>I have searched the Q&amp;A, but have not found any information about this issue, so I hope someone will kindly offer me some help.</p>
<p>Hal</p>
<p>PS. The Q&amp;A formatting syntax for links does not seem to work. If I am doing it wrongly, please advise. Thanks!</p>

							<p>This is a common problem with the emulator. Occasionally, it boots up in a weird state. It&#39;s not a Titanium issue, it&#39;s an Android <code>adb</code> issue. It may take a couple of tries, but do the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>Exit the emulator</li>
<li>From the command line execute: <code>adb kill-server</code></li>
<li>Wait 5 - 10 seconds then execute: <code>adb start-server</code></li>
</ol>
<p>You should see a message that the adb service is starting. If not, repeat 2-3. In some very rare cases, it&#39;s only happened twice all year to me, you&#39;ll just need to reboot your machine.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you for your lightening fast answer Don.<br>I tried your suggestion of using kill-server&#x2F;start-server, but it did not fix it.  I deleted the ~&#x2F;,android folder in my profile, and rebooted, and then started Tidev and launched the app, and this time it worked.<br>Thank you once again!  :)</p>
