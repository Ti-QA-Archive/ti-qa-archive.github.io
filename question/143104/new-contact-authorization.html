			<h1>New Contact Authorization</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>So it seems after you ask the user for authorization to access contacts the first time… you can NEVER ask again. I have a switch in my app where the user can save the contacts in the app to their address book if they like.</p>
<p>In the event they at one time denied the app access, on purpose or by accident, I cannot ask them to authorize my app again. I have to instruct them to go into their privacy settings and change the setting there?</p>
<p>That is crazy. Please let me know if I understand correct. The requestAuthorization function does indeed say it works only if the status is Unknown.</p>

							<p>It looks like this is the behavior Apple set, nothing to do about.</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;ios&#x2F;#releasenotes&#x2F;General&#x2F;RN-iOSSDK-6_0&#x2F;_index.html#&#x2F;&#x2F;apple_ref&#x2F;doc&#x2F;uid&#x2F;TP40012166-CH1-SW19</p>
<p><em>Checking access authorization status:<br>An app can use the authorization status API to check if it can access contacts, calendars, reminders, or the photo library. This API is independent from the request access API and <strong>will not prompt</strong> the user to grant or deny access.</em></p>

										<p><p>In my app, when the user hits the &quot;save to contacts&quot; switch AND they have denied access, I create an alert that tells the user they must change this setting in their device privacy settings. I guess that is the way to go for now.</p>

										<p><p>I looked up linking to settings and it appears this was removed in 5.1. Unless you have it working somehow. A Google search returned the links to the settings, but I tested it and the phone tells me Safari doesn&#39;t know how to open that type of link when I tried.</p>
