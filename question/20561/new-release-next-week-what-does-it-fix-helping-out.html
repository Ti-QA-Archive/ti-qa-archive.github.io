		</header>
		<section>
			<p>So according to the email I received today, there will be a new release of Titanium next week.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for me, I have to make a final decision about sticking with Titanium&#x2F;Appcelerator or finding a new solution by this Friday. Due to the headaches we have run in to over the course of the upgrade to 1.2.1 I can&#39;t justify spending additional time&#x2F;resources waiting.</p>
<p>Can someone give me an idea of what is being fixed?</p>
<p>Is the missing Android Simulator problem to be fixed?</p>
<p>What about java problems on Macs who have gone from 1.2 to 1.2.1? For me all the SDK&#39;s loaded fine in 1.2. After going to 1.2.1 everything disappeared. (This happened the same on 3 different machines.)</p>
<p>I really, truly believe that Titanium is the solution our org needs, however, these problems that have come up and the seemingly lack of interest in fixing them in a timely fashion has me questioning whether or not I want to build my mobile development strategy around this system. More importantly, it has those around me questioning it.</p>
<p>I know the front page of the site says 41,861 active developers currently. When I started here it was probably half that. Of all those new developers, are they able to get functioning systems? I&#39;m assuming they are all having the same problems that I am having from looking at many of the posts here in the q&amp;a forum.</p>
<p>Maybe a better question to ask is: how can I help? </p>
<p>I&#39;m not a stellar c&#x2F;obj-c&#x2F;java programmer. That is why I love the notion of Appcelerator&#x2F;Titanium. It allows me to use things I already know to build.</p>
<p>But, maybe there is something I can do to help in some way? What is it? </p>

							<p>Jason, </p>
<p>I ran into some trouble with 1.2.1 and I think i just got it fixed.<br>I am going to point out the steps i took to get apps running on the android simulator without crashing, including kithen sink.</p>
<p>1 - Get the latest 1.2.1 SDK from http:&#x2F;&#x2F;drop.io&#x2F;bhootu4 ( Thanks Kevin ) and you will need to place that in Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx&#x2F;</p>
<p>2 - Get ALL the Android SDK including the APIs. Install them using the AVD manager, restart Titanium and make sure you see 1.6,  API 1.6, 2.1, API 2.1 etc. </p>
<p>3 - If you create a  project and cant see the Run on android emulator tab you need the fixed android.py file &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_mobile&#x2F;raw&#x2F;55fea80fe28a5940b890c2291ec68b7a756a3c27&#x2F;support&#x2F;android&#x2F;android.py&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;  it goes in &#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx&#x2F;1.2.0&#x2F;android</p>
<p> 4 Restart Titanium, create a new project you should get tabs for iphone and android, run Android emulator, dont worry if it fails the first time,  wait to yhe emulator is running and hit launch again.  Hold tight ( it takes while, at least on my Mac ) and you should be Rolling.</p>
<p>5 - For Kitchen sink, Grab the latest from Github dounload, create a new Project, DONT IMPORT this one, the copy the Resources folder from the Kitchensink and overwrite the new project&#39;s resource with the kitchen sink.<br>one.  Before you launch on emulator make sure you are using API X.X, 1.6 and 2.1 work fine for me.  Since kitchen sink uses maps it will need to be run with that SDK.  It seams to take forerver to launch , but again, wait to the emulator is up and running and hit launch.</p>
<p>I&#39;m pretty sure next release won&#39;t need all the workarounds ( I HOPE ) </p>

							<p>This is the one issue I have with Titanium. Bug fixes take forever. I&#39;m not trying to sound ungrateful, but ever since the whole upgrade for better support came around, the ball&#39;s been dropped. Thus I&#39;m re evaluating Adobe Air.</p>

							<p>@Bryce, I&#39;m not sure how the ball has been dropped on bug fixes. Of the 146 in the queue we hoped to fix for 1.3.0  82 have been addressed 76 fixed. Many of the items have been directed specifically at the Android fastdev problem created in 1.2.0. We had the android.py workaround almost immediately and had the other fixes available and listed in Q&amp;A on several Questions.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve also been providing up-to-date 1.2.1 builds for Android to people that ask and have set up a temporary download location at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;drop.io&#x2F;titanium_android_nightly">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;drop.io&#x2F;titanium_android_nightly</a> Neither these updates, nor the source have been restricted to premium members they have been available to all Appcelerator users.</p>
<p>@Juan at this point, you should be able to grab one of the nightly builds and not have to do anything other than point your project at it. No more patching android.py etc. You will still have to provide the pre-requisites like android sdk, platform libraries, java, etc.</p>
<p>@Jason here list of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32238-titanium-mobile&#x2F;tickets?q=milestone:%22Release+1.3.0%22+state:resolved">Resolved 1.3.0</a> items. Not every fix has a ticket, but most of them do. I&#39;m not sure what &quot;everything disappears&quot; refers to wrt to 1.2.1. </p>

							<p>Don,</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>The &#39;everything disappears&#39; was in reference to Titanium just losing the ability to find any of the Java SDK&#39;s for the menus. It&#39;s the issue with &#39;loading….&#39; just never going away.</p>
<p>I will look through those 1.3 items with fresh eyes in the morning.</p>
<p>Thanks for the input. It&#39;s appreciated.</p>
<p>  –  Jason</p>

							<p>@Jason. That usually means, but not always, that the android sdk location on the profile page is incorrect or the platforms haven&#39;t been downloaded. Check your profile page first. Also if you can provide a Trace level log, we can usually diagnose it.</p>
<p>One of the problems is that we get no notifications that questions have been updated yet. So we have to go through all the questions and check for updates. If some question is taking to long, neither @marshall_law or I (@donthorp) mind getting a ping on twitter with a link to the item. It doesn&#39;t mean we can drop everything and get to it, but it does mean we know a response is needed. Hopefully Q&amp;A will be updated soon to address that issue.</p>

							<p>I admit the journey with Titanium is a rocky one for me too but once I get all the quirky stuff sorted out, it is still an easier solution that objective-c (i think).</p>
<p>Since this is open-source, I wonder if there are enough contributors to make it better and more robust. It would be great if the community can chip in!</p>

							<p>I had some trouble on the latest one trying to<br>&quot;build for device&quot; on iphone it kept on asking for android sdk path (which I dont have installed).  In this case, just set the path in the profile tab as &quot;&#x2F;&quot; and it skips this check.</p>
<p>1.2 has been really good, fast and almost bug free. I&#39;ve found that the installer has given me more greif than any thing else :)</p>
<p>Keep up the good work guys! And maybe have a cheaper upgrade plan for just analytics and I&quot;m sold in the upgrade too!</p>

							<p>After spending most of the day today trying to get this stuff to work I have made some headway.</p>
<p>I am seeing the proper Java SDK&#39;s showing up in the menus now. </p>
<p>For whatever reason the android updater on my box is having all types of problems and can&#39;t seem to update the SDK&#39;s, so I ended up dumping the directories and pulling them over from another machine. (the &#39;add-ons&#39; and &#39;tools&#39; directories)</p>
<p>I did not make any changes on the profile page, I did check it and it was pointing to the proper directory and it worked before the 1.2.1 upgrade. But after dumping the sdk files and bringing in these copies from the other machine it works. I didn&#39;t expect it to work like that, but it did.</p>
<p>I have KitchenSink running on both iPhone and Android emulators now. That is great.</p>
<p>I was also able to install KitchenSink on to my Nexus One. That&#39;s huge progress and I&#39;m pretty excited.</p>
<p>However, I am unable to get the app that we have developed here to run on the android emulator. Upon startup it crashes every time.</p>
<p>I then created a super simple base app that contained nothing but 3 windows and it does the same thing. The &#39;unexpectedly closed&#39; error.</p>
<p>&quot;The application XX (process com.XX) has stopped unexpectedly. Please try again.&quot;</p>
<p>Upon searching through the Q&amp;A forum I found this:</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;17051&#x2F;android-emulator-unexpectedly-quit-on-all-applications</p>
<p>Which seems to point to it being a Snow Leopard problem. I am running Snow Leopard on all the machines I&#39;m testing with, so I&#39;m guessing this is it.</p>
<p>However, I&#39;m able to get KitchenSink to run and install, just not apps create here. Not even that extremely basic app.</p>
<p>But…I did get both apps developed here installed on the N1 now. The simple app runs, but the larger apps crashes just as they both do in the simulator.</p>
<p>So I guess my question at this point is: is this a Snow Leopard issue or something else? The fact that others are having problems with Snow Leopard makes me think that is a part of it, however, the fact that KitchenSink works fine has me thinking that maybe it&#39;s not a Snow Leopard issue.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>
