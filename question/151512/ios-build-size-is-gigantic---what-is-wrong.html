			<h1>iOS Build Size is Gigantic - What is Wrong?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve successfully submitted several apps to the iOS and Android stores.  My most recent iOS submission was rejected because the file size was too large.  It was over 148MB!  I couldn&#39;t believe it because my app has very little actual content (most of the heavy lifting is done by downloading and playing videos after the app is installed).</p>
<p>I went back to look at the file size of my app.  My total app is less than 14MB.  Every time I clean my project and then build it for local and&#x2F;or distribution the build folder grows exponentially.  I removed cloud features, etc… and I&#39;ve gotten the build down to 90MB but that&#39;s still too large for my liking.  Why is the build so large if my entire Titanium folder for the app is less than 14MB.</p>
<p>I&#39;m using Titanium Studio 3.0.2 on a Mac Book Pro OSX 10.7.5.  I&#39;m using TItanium SDK 2.1.1GA.  It is a universal iPad&#x2F;iPhone app.  </p>
<p>Please help!</p>
<p>-Tim</p>

							<div><p>Have you checked the build folder to see what is being included? I remember having a couple of large png&#39;s copied over by accident. Blew up my install from 12mb to over 50 and that was juust one file. Sort your directories by size and see what shows up.</p>

							<div><p>Hello Tim,</p>
<p>This is quite interesting. Is there any way you can use a later version of Ti SDK? There are lot of fixes in order to optimize the size of the published app. </p>
<p>Best,</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>What is the size of the {appname}.IPA file when you build for device?</p>
<p>Make sure the only files and folders inside your app folder are related to the app directly and not things that helped you make the app like; PSDs etc.</p>
<p>If you have any folders at this level move them out, make sure you ONLY have things you need inside the resources folder.</p>
<p>Always &quot;Clean&quot; before builds for this SDK version and physically check the folder is cleaned.  Close the simulator before cleaning of course.</p>
<p>Make sure you have removed any modules from your local app folder if you are not using them, plus any old versions (should not be required but just-in-case).</p>
<p>Your app folders normally will not have more than these root folders (may not have all of these)</p>
<ul>
<li>{app name}\app</li>
<li>{app name}\build</li>
<li>{app name}\i18n</li>
<li>{app name}\modules</li>
<li>{app name}\platform</li>
<li>{app name}\plug-ins</li>
<li>{app name}\resources</li>
</ul>
