			<h1>ACS Keys mismatched between app and web interface</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Mobile, SDK 2.01GA, Android Phone, Cloud Services</p>
<p>So, I was compiling the Cloud Sample App from the API directory that Appcelerator provides and when I clicked &#39;Enable Could Services&#39; in the TIApp.XML editing from Studio, I had a problem with my network connection… No keys came back. So I simply clicked the button again, got the keys and started testing the app on my android phone. Everything works as expected…</p>
<p>So I logged in to take a look at the data through the Appcelerator Applications… and my application is there, but with different keys! So I can&#39;t see the data that the application is creating in the web services, because I&#39;m accessing an application that is not listed as part of my account… So… How do you reconcile this?</p>
<p>I suppose that I could change the keys in my tiapp.xml file to use the keys found on the web interface, but can I get an application created with the keys I am using? This is just a demo app I am playing with, but in the future, if this happened again, is there a process to resolve this?</p>

							<p>I think its still a bit Buggy and kind of beta. I have a similar problem, in my case the app gets the Keys but the backend says the app is Not ACS enabled.. ebabling multiple Times did Not solve the problem. However newly created apps do work.</p>
