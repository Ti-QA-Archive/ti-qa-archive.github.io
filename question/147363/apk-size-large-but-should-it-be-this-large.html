			<p>I had a dev in India make an app out of a book for me. The size of the html&#x2F;css and images is about 7MB. The size of the app built with Titanium is 23MB downloaded to my Windows computer and 29.7MB installed on my Android phone.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve read others on here who have questions about the size but most seem to be talking about maybe 5MB - 10MB added on. This is 22MB added to an original 7MB! Is Titanium or my dev at fault here? Any opinions would be appreciated.</p>

							<p>Titanium&#39;s set of libraries that it packages with will take up a bit of space. To be honest it really depends how the app was built. You say html&#x2F;css, so if this app is essentially a lot of web views, wrapped in Titanium, then i&#39;m not sure why the APK could be quite that big. However, if native components are being used and not just webviews, then it could potentially be that big. </p>
<p>On Android there are many sets of folders for each different resolution&#x2F;screen-dimension that Android supports. If a developer takes the time and puts optimized images in each of those folders for the different devices, then that can substantially add to the APK size.</p>
<p>One of my cross platform apps is roughly 30MB for the iPhone&#x2F;iPad version. Compared to the 49MB for the Android Phone&#x2F;Tablet version.</p>
<p>The speed of the app could be an issue where they may have used the older Rhino Android engine, and may also depend on what device you are using. </p>
<p>Hope this helps a little.</p>

										<p><p>Well, I doubt he added the different sizes of the images like you mentioned. I was hesitant about going this cross platform route because I tried that with the js frameworks and they were too slow to use. He guaranteed me this would be as fast as native. It runs fast on a new phone, but most folks don&#39;t have new phones! Something that should have taken him, maybe, 3 weeks is now 3 months. So I don&#39;t think that he was the Titanium expert he let on to be. Live and learn! Thanks a lot Christopher, appreciate it!</p>

										<p><p>Thats unfortunate. I think Titanium is still overall the best choice next to going completely native. Good luck to you though and if you need any further help i&#39;m sure there are a lot of developers willing to take a look. Take care.</p>

							<p>7MB for an application is pretty standard, so don\&#39;t worry about that. Please note that the application&#39;s limit size on Google Play is 250MB if I remember correctly. So adding a few more items won&#39;t go over that limit.</p>
<p>Another thing though, know that the final packaged application will be smaller than the one you compile to test. That&#39;s because packaging will remove some unused libraries. But don&#39;t expect a big reduction in size though.</p>
<p>Hope this makes it clearer for you.</p>
