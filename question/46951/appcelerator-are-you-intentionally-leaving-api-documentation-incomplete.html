			<h1>Appcelerator, are you intentionally leaving API documentation incomplete?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Love what you guys are doing with this platform! And I know you need to sell support packages to make the open source business model work. But are you intentionally leaving the API documentation incomplete?</p>
<p>Simple example from <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;latest&#x2F;Titanium.Map.Annotation-object.html">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;latest&#x2F;Titanium.Map.Annotation-object.html</a>:</p>
<p>It states that <code>Titanium.Map.createAnnotation</code> has an <code>image</code> property that replaces the default pin image and only works on the iPhone. Bummer. No pin images for Android.</p>
<p>By some fluke as I was researching an unrelated issue, I noticed someone&#39;s code in a Q&amp;A post that had a <code>pinImage</code> property. Low and behold, I&#39;ve got pin images on Android!</p>
<p>What about <code>Titanium.Geolocation.reverseGeocoder</code>? How could that one have gotten left out?</p>
<p>A problem I had tonight: MapView events don&#39;t seem to be firing. Hours wasted until I <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;16421&#x2F;map-view-loading-event-not-firing">read this Q&amp;A</a>, which informs that <code>loading</code>—and presumably <code>complete</code> and <code>touchend</code>, the ones giving me trouble—don&#39;t work on Android. Would have been nice to know.</p>
<p>Can&#39;t recall the other instances off the top of my head, but I&#39;ve spotted other omissions with the API docs when comparing to KitchenSink code and Q&amp;A posts.</p>
<p>On that note, it&#39;s rough that there&#39;s all this great looking sample code in KitchenSink, yet judging by the number of questions, many people can&#39;t get it to run. I gave up myself.</p>
<p>The situation with Titanium and the startup I work for: I thought Titanium looked sweet and wanted to prototype an app to see if it can really cut it. The moment that&#39;s a yes, I&#39;m moving out of a prototype mindset, thinking production code and I&#39;m on a premium support plan.</p>
<p>If you guys could make this stuff a little easier I might already be paying.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a simple idea that would be cool for the premium docs: Screenshots of all the UI components.</p>
<p>Thanks dudes. Keep up the good work.</p>

							<p>The API docs aren&#39;t intentionally incomplete.  We&#39;re working on revamping them right now and increasing the coverage - we know there are gaps.  It&#39;s kind of tough because since the API isn&#39;t actually implemented in JavaScript anywhere, we can&#39;t really use standard documentation tools.  We have to manually generate docs from documentation files that we write ourselves, so sometimes properties and functions don&#39;t get written up.  Finding Kitchen Sink examples that aren&#39;t written up is frustrating, so I&#39;m going to make sure we go through that example to make sure we cover all of those items.</p>
<p>Most of the Kitchen Sink issues have to do with issues downloading the source and importing directly - if you can create a new project, copying the contents of the Kitchen Sink Resources directory into the new project&#39;s Resources should get you going.</p>

							<p>Was thinking of suggesting a wiki, then this topic appeared!</p>
<p>No harm in setting one up alongside the existing doc to see how it goes…</p>

							<p>Until the guys at Appcelerator find the time to improve their own documentation, I&#39;m going to start a community wiki. If there are folks that like to help me with it, you can contact me at titanium [at] doney [dot] nl.</p>
<p>The wiki can be found here :) Feel free to improve it and create new pages!<br><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.doney.nl&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.doney.nl&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;</a> </p>

							<p>Precisely! I&#39;ve already suggested it; why no wiki ? This way people can help each other by extending the documentation. :-)</p>
