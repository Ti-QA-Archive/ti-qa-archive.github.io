			<h1>compiling slow as very slow molasses</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Today I have spent 2hrs fixing TitaniumStudio - it still runs like molasses. I&#39;ve tried reinstalling and reconfiguring and the best part? I haven&#39;t got a clue what is wrong.</p>
<p>I am on Linux with latest studio and latest SDK 1.8.2</p>
<p>This setup has worked like, well not a charm, but reasonable - now it&#39;s almost impossible to compile, and the emulator takes foreeeever to do even the smallest things. Usually my emulator hogs the CPU, but not now.</p>
<p>Ti insists on recompiling Android resources, and yes - it&#39;s true &#39;this could take some time&#39; - it takes quite a long time, not longer than usual, but usually it only compiles Android resources upon a clean or a tiapp.xml change. Now it&#39;s every time. ooops correction, now it is not every time. Reason? Something I did perhaps - it seems completely arbitrary</p>
<p>Somedays Ti runs very fast - but most of the time it runs slooooow. What can we learn? It is ABLE to run fast, but something is not right.</p>
<p>I include a multitude of files, adhering to the &#39;require&#39; model, right now each file is 2-3 seconds in getting from the Computer to the emulator. My browser loads and render facebook much faster than it takes to pull one file from the pc to the emulator, that can&#39;t be right? And what is the advantage of the fastdev server if it is so slow? BTW - why does it insist on transferring files that did not change? That seems inefficient?</p>
<p>Eclipse and java seems to blaze ahead - if I did native Java Android applications I wouldn&#39;t be spending 40-50% of my time </p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">do</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> Titanium.toolchain.sucks){
    fix
        <span class="hljs-keyword">test</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">discard</span>
        reconfigure
}
</code></pre><p>There seems to be very little advantage concerning developing time, if the advantage of javascript and crossplatform-code is eaten up by a tool chain that hardly works and is so unstable.</p>
<p>Does anybody have some advice - anything - that can help me understand WHY ti gets slow and what I can do to fix it? I don&#39;t even know what to diagnose or test or lookout fore</p>

							<div><p>Can you see if it is actually cleaning? Two ways to see:</p>
<ol>
<li>Watch the projectName&#x2F;build&#x2F;android folder to see if ti is empty before the compilation</li>
<li>Turn on troubleshooting (See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;tis&#x2F;Errors+Building+Titanium+Projects#ErrorsBuildingTitaniumProjects-Builderrorinconsoleoutput">here</a> but use com.aptana.core&#x2F;debug&#x2F;builder). Then look in your log file. It should indicate that the folder is being cleaned</li>

							<div><p>Something was odd about that project. When I selected &#39;clean&#39; the project wasn&#39;t listed. But a manual clean didn&#39;t help.</p>
<p>I made a new project and copied the old resource folder into the new project. That helped, although I am still looking at 2½ sec. transfer-time per file I&#39;ve included. I use &#39;require&#39; a lot, so it takes forever. In this project it takes approx. 2:06 minutes from hitting debug until the program is actually running in the emulator, approx. 1:30 of which is spent getting files that didn&#39;t change in any way.</p>
