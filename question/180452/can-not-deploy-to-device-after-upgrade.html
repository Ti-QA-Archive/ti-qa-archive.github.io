			<h1>Can not deploy to device after upgrade</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi<br>I got myself a new iPhone 6 (after loosing my Iphone 4S) and now I have truble deploying my recent project on iphone and ipad.</p>
<p>I was working on Titanium sdk 3.4.0, Xcode 5 (something).<br>Titanium first gave me the message saying no Xcode was installed. I figured out that the version I had was not compatible with the new phone but in order to upgrade, I also had to upgrade my Mac ios, so I upgrades to Yosemite.</p>
<p>Since, I am now running Yosemite, Xcode 6.1.1, Titanium sdk 3.5.0 GA but I still can not deploy to device.</p>
<p>I also have been trying with my old iPad, to which I have made no changes, but that doesn&#39;t work either.<br>I have successfully deployed on android, so this is a pure ios issue.<br>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance &#x2F;Tove</p>

							<div><p>Solved!<br>I had been reusing provisioning profiles or id:s by just editing. Had to make all such things (id, provisioning profile) all over. During build I then got an alert asking if &quot;codesign can have access to keychain&quot;. That did the trick.</p>

							<p>Hi Tove,</p>
<p>For deploying app in ios device you need to add device UDID in provisioning profile.. so you add your iPhone 6 UDID into your provisioning profile. and also mention it it&#39;s not deploying also in old device. so check provisioning profile expire date may be your provisioning profile expire. or check in Run Configuration your project pointing to which provisioning profile if it pointing to different provisioning profile then also it&#39;s not installing in device… </p>
<p>if still not work then send us your error… </p>
<p>if you have any doubt then let me know…</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
