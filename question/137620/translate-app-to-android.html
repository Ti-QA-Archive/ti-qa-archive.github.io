<p>I have finally made an app! (Much thanx to all the guys on this site that has answered all my questions no matter how small and stupid! :)  )</p>
<p>I have made it for iOS and my question now is how to make it to work on Android?</p>
<p>Do you have any links to where i can find some reading on the subject i would be really glad.</p>
<p>I imagine that the worst part is done or am i wrong?</p>
<p>Thanx</p>

							<p>Hi Richard. Embrace yourself! What you are trying to acomplish is a nightmare&#39;s tale: Working hand to hand with iOS and android is frustrating enough… leaving it for last will be a journey of its own. You will come to understand the motto &quot;Code once, debug everywhere&quot;</p>
<p>That being said: some pointers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Try to change all of your object.getProperty() for object.property. Titanium creates the methods for the object upon creation depending on the os, so you won&#39;t view.getAnchorPoint in Android for example.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Try to move all your object.setIphoneOnlyProperty({}) to the constructor if possible. If not, prepare your self to fill your way with if ( &#39;iphone&#39; === Ti.Platform.name ) object.setIphoneOnlyProperty()</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you have some things in JSS, move them back into the app itself. Some objects just DON&#39;T RENDER if they are fed with a JSS property they don&#39;t support (ex. left property Ti.UI.TextField object on Android &lt;&lt; this one kept me insane for a whole week!!! )</p>
</li>
<li><p>Look for os specific folders workarounds (ex. Android has externalStorage)</p>
</li>
<li><p>android emulator doesn&#39;t support geolocation, so have an android device at hand</p>
</li>
<li><p>android needs heavyweight windows to properly work with the back button</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don&#39;t expect the same look and feel! remember that they are Different devices, with different philosophies. Honor them</p>
</li>
<li><p>PickerView, DashboardView, CoverflowView, ScrollableView are some example of iOS specific components. Abandon them on android or be prepared to do the component manually yourself!</p>
</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>Alright!</p>
<p>That was some useful tips!</p>
<p>I really dont use so much iOS specifics just CoverflowView. But my biggest nightmare is the dp.</p>
<p>I have set up 3 maps in &#39;images&#39; called low, medium and large.  I tried to put the imaes from my iOS project in the medium but then they wouldnt show up. Just if i let them remain in the images folder.</p>
<p>Do you know of any good looking gallery that i can use instead of CoverflowView i would be greatful.</p>
<p>But how about those images?</p>
<p>Is it safe to assume the the ones i got in my iOS project is &#39;medium&#39; ? and i can take it from there to make the other resolutions?</p>
<p>But i guess i have a long way to go. I dont even know how to deploy the app to my phone to see how it looks.  I have searched for some instructions but i dont seem to find any.</p>
<p>I have one samsung S2 and one GT-S5570 to test on and also a galaxy tab but that is WAY in to the future.  Any pointers on how to get the app to one of the phones?  </p>
<p>Thanx</p>

							<p>This will all depend on any iOS specific UI elements you might be using on your app. </p>
<p>Also, some elements act slightly differently. </p>
<p>First, check for Ti.UI elements which have &#39;iPhone&#39; in the name, them work back from there.</p>
<p>Some people like to have a single codebase for iOS and Android and use the API to determine which functions to use. I prefer to make a separate project and do it that way. </p>
<p>Really, it all depends on the complexity of your app interface.</p>

							<p>Rickard:</p>
<p>Deploying apps to the android device is cumbersome as well. You have to make sure you have at least APIs 7 &amp; 8 (Android 2.1 and 2.2)</p>
<p>Also, additional pointers are <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;137369&#x2F;icon-doesnt-show-in-the-emulator">&gt;here&lt;</a></p>

							<p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>your way is (right)clicking in left menu and select &#39;Install on Android device&#39;.<br>But – a little problem: May be you get a lot of errors. Why? you have used API commands which only runs in iOS environement. ie. navBarHidden = true, because on Android you have no navbar or system buttons …</p>
