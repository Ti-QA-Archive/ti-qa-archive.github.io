			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been struggling with this for a few hours and have no idea why I can&#39;t package an Android app although the emulator runs with no problems. </p>
<p>I am able to package other apps just not this one..<br>Any idea what could it be? </p>
<p>Here&#39;s the log:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[DEBUG] <span class="hljs-string">"/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/3.0.0.GA/android/titanium_prep.macos"</span> com<span class="hljs-class">.moscona</span><span class="hljs-class">.app1</span> <span class="hljs-string">"/Users/appledev/Documents/Titanium Studio Workspace/Dr Moscona New/build/android/bin/assets/Resources"</span> ui/common/FirstView<span class="hljs-class">.js</span> ui/handheld/android/ApplicationWindow<span class="hljs-class">.js</span> ui/handheld/ApplicationWindow<span class="hljs-class">.js</span> app<span class="hljs-class">.js</span> ui/tablet/ApplicationWindow<span class="hljs-class">.js</span> notificationService<span class="hljs-class">.js</span> ti<span class="hljs-class">.cloud</span><span class="hljs-class">.js</span>

<p>Missing from your question are a number of important pieces of information. I suggest you take a look at the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Using+Questions+and+Answers">Using Questions and Answers</a> article, specifically the Q&amp;A Question Checklist.  The missing information is critical to reproducing problems in a test environment and often indicates other factors that cause the undesirable outcome you are experiencing.</p>

							<div><p>@Stephen, thats right Unabled is a grammatical mistake, which should not be the case atleast.</p>
<p>@Idan, provide the information Stephen mentioned and also check in your code that <strong>are you using unicode characters there or some unwanted code is there(Hidden unicode characters)?</strong></p>

							<p>Hi Idan</p>
<p>do you have Java 1.6 installed? Look at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Titanium_Compatibility_Matrix-section-29004837_TitaniumCompatibilityMatrix-JavaDevelopmentKit">Titanium Compatibility Matrix</a> and also check your other environment for the necessary components and versions.</p>
<p>Please provide more information next time, as Stephen has already said!</p>
<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>Matthias</p>

							<p>Hi Guys, thanks for all the responses.</p>
<p>I was able to isolate the problem - what I did is removed stuff from my project and tried to package it - removed modules, than removed AndroidManifest etc. eventually I replaced my app.js with a simple app.js and the project was packaged.<br>after some more digging into app.js it seemed that the problem was a memory issue (given that this is Android, that should have been my first guess), I have too many webviews and when I remove some of them everything works fine.</p>
<p>Thanks again,<br>Idan</p>
