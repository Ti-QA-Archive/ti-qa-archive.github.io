			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Is there any chance getting a device-unique id on both android and ios? Ti.Platform.id changes on every new installation of the same app. </p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Short answer no.</p>
<p>Apple restricts the ability to generate a unique value that can track a user on their device across installations.  This is a major security protection put in place a couple of iOS versions back.  I believe Android has a similiar set of rules.</p>

										<p><p>I am not sure if you were also asking if the unique ID could be the same on iOS and Android - if so - definitely no.</p>

										<p><p>If your app connects to a remote API you control that requires the user to login in to use the app then you could pass the unique database row id back to manage the uniqueness.  This would also span the platforms and re-installs.</p>
<p>Obviously this is ONLY of use if you have the API model I explained above - otherwise a totaaly useless suggestion in your case ;-)</p>

										<p><p>First I had a login form but I don&#39;t like the idea because I think this bugs the user too much and I don&#39;t really need the login. The second problem is the &quot;forgot password&quot; function which can be really annoying inside an app. </p>
<p>I thought that Apple doesn&#39;t allow different apps to have the same &quot;uuid&quot; but for the same application the same uuid should be possible.</p>

										<p><p>As I said the login method only works if you have an actual need for the login - adding simply to track is not going to be liked by users.  I have a few apps that use logins, but only because the users have secure info available only to them - so it fits with the users needs.</p>
<p>I am not sure I suggested that Apple has the same UUID for different apps - this is not possible.</p>
<p>Apple does NOT have a UUID available any more due to the security concerns.  Appcelerator provides a randomly generated unique value on each install - you retrieve this value - nothing to do with Apple and not transferable to another install on the same device or another device.</p>

							<p>To identify a &quot;unique&quot; device, there are several workarounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>MAC address (iOS &amp; Android, currently often used as UDID replacement, but seems unavailable in iOS 7)</li>
<li>OpenUDID (iOS &amp; Android, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ylechelle&#x2F;OpenUDID">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ylechelle&#x2F;OpenUDID</a>, deprecated)</li>
<li>advertisingIdentifier (iOS, available since iOS 6, related to IDFA)</li>
<li>identifierForVendor (iOS, available since iOS 6, related to IDFV)</li>
<li>android_id (Android, Secure.ANDROID_ID)</li>
<li>device_id (Android, IMEI from TELEPHONYMANAGER)</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides MAC address (Ti.Platform.macaddress), you need a custom module to read these values with Titanium Appcelerator. I can provide some snippets if required.</p>

										<p><p>Both advertisingIdentifier and identifierForVendor can be reset by the device and then provide a new value, each scenario is documented in the Apple documentation.</p>
<p>MAC address is now unusable due to the latest iOS, OpenUDID is now dead.</p>

										<p><p>How about storing a unique identifier in the keychain? In iOS this value shouldn&#39;t change on new app installation.</p>
