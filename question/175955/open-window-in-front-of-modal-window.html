			<h1>Open window in front of modal window</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey, </p>
<p>I have an ios app with a window controller which can be opened within a navigationWindow but also as a modal window.<br>In this controller i open another Window on a specific action. This window has a semi transparent background and should overlap the navigation bar. (So i&#39;m not able to use a view)</p>
<p>The window opens just as it is supposed to as long i&#39;m opening it from the navigationWindow. But whenever i open the semi transparent window from the modal window it is opened behind the modal window.<br>I guess this is because modal windows are always on top. I also have tried to open it as a modal window but then i&#39;m not able to make it semi transparent.</p>
<p>has anyone an idea how to open the semi transparent window always on top of every other window, even in front of modals?</p>
<p>cheers<br>Horst</p>
