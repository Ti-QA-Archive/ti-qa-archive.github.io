			<h1>App update notifications with private / corporate app distribution</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>This isn&#39;t specific to Titanium, but I&#39;m not sure where else to ask. Maybe someone here knows…</p>
<p>If you privately distribute an app (e.g. Apple&#39;s Enterprise program), how are app updates handled? With Market&#x2F;Store published apps, users get a notification that an update is available. That prompts them to download the new version. You can probably be reasonably sure that most users are thus using the current version.</p>
<p>Is there a way to prompt users that there&#39;s a new version when you privately distribute an app? </p>
<p>I suspect not, so part 2 of the question is what strategy would you take to force corporate users to install updates? Notification could be handled through email or even an in-app notification.  </p>

							<p>Tim,</p>
<p>You are correct that apps distributed outside the app store do not get automatic update notice notification.  Thus you have to roll your own version checks.</p>
<p>My suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement the ability to upgrade over the air by placing the new *.ipa with embedded profile on a server of your choice using techniques discussed <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;samvermette.com&#x2F;71">here</a>. </p>
</li>
<li><p>On the same server, place a small text file you can download which contains the most recent version number.  In your app, at whatever interval you (or the user) wants, grab the contents of that file using httpClient() and compare to your current version (Ti.App.verion).  When they are different, alert the user and ask if they want to update.  If they do, openURL() to the server page with the new version download.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What I do is place both the <em>.ipa for the iOS version and the </em>.apk for the android version on that page and call it from either platform.  You can use the user-agent string on the server side to filter what you show them or just show both links and let the user pick one.</p>
<p>Note:  OTA upgrade support was added in iOS 4.x so will not work on devices never upgraded to iOS 4.  Also, if you do not want to host the update on your own server (my preference), you could use <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.diawi.com&#x2F;">this</a>.</p>
