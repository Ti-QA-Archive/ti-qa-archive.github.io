			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>i&#39;m writing an app for iPad for a new fiction book that&#39;s coming out.<br>among other things the app does, it needs to give users the ability to read the book.<br>i have the book in PDF format.</p>
<p>i tried putting the PDF in webview and it works fine, but it has no features. i was wandering if someone knows about a better way or even a source code out there, that does the fancier stuff, like paging, remembering the page you were on, animation when moving between pages etc.</p>
<p>thought it will be good to ask before i start it from scratch</p>
<p>cheers.</p>

							<p>If you register as an Indie developer you&#39;ll get access to two different modules that work with PDFs in PageFlip and QuickLook. PageFlip might do what you want as it says: &quot;Display pages of data to your users. Comes stock with easy to turn pages, multiple transition effects (fade, flip, and slide), a quick PDF mode, and a view-based mode.&quot;.</p>
<p>However, it&#39;ll cost you monthly being an Indie developer and PageFlip is still pretty limited IMO. You&#39;d probably be better off figuring out a solution on your own, at least until the modules get a few more features.</p>

<p>No it doesn&#39;t currently support zoom, which is why I&#39;m not able to use it myself.</p>

							<p>The Quick Look appears to be almost if not identical to loading the PDF in a Webview.. where&#39;s the benefit in paying $9.99&#x2F;mth&#x2F;seat for the privilege of being able to do that already? I can&#39;t see where the benefits are at all in this.</p>
<p>If there was a page navigation (move to page 75 of 100 automatically) and highlighting&#x2F;searching and horizontal viewing then we&#39;d be talking.</p>
<p>Please integrate these Titanium!</p>

							<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;m the developer of <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;yakamozlabs.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;pdftouch-titanium">PDFTouch SDK</a> which is a PDF rendering framework for iOS that also has a module for Appcelerator apps. You can use it to display PDF files in your app or make apps like the iBooks app. It also has features like double page mode and page-curl animations when flipping pages.</p>
<p>PDFTouch SDK is a commercial product but it comes with the complete source code when you purchase a license.</p>
