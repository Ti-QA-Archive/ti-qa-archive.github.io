		<section>
			<p>so i am creating an app that you scan a barcode of a product and then that opens up an associated product pdf…this is working great when i am connected to wifi but when i turn wifi off and just use 3g or 4g it won&#39;t send the request to open the pdf? </p>
<p>this may be a stupid question but do wireless 3g networks not allow you to call the Titanium.Network.createHTTPClient()</p>
<p>if they do, how can make this work?</p>
<p>thanks a lot, i really appreciate any help</p>
