			<h1>Limit app download over-the-air</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi</p>
<p>I&#39;m searching for info about the limits in google play and app store downloading <strong>using 3g\4g ( and not with wifi ). I thought that limit was around 20 MB in both stores</strong> but now i have found that on google is 50 and for iOS store has raised up to 100.</p>
<h2 id="google-play-">Google play..</h2>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;distribute&#x2F;googleplay&#x2F;publish&#x2F;preparing.html</p>
<p>The overall size of your app can affect its design and how you publish it on Google Play. Currently, the maximum size for an APK published on Google Play is <strong>50 MB</strong>. If your app exceeds that size, or if you want to offer a secondary download, you can use APK Expansion Files, which Google Play will host for free on its server infrastructure and automatically handle the download to devices.</p>
<p>The maximum size for an APK published on Google Play is 50 MB.<br>You can use up to two (2) APK Expansion Files, each up to 2 GB in size, for each APK.</p>
<h2 id="app-store-">App Store..</h2>
<p>For iOS apps, check that your app size fits within the App Store requirements.</p>
<p>iOS App binary files can be as large as 2 GB, but the executable file (app_name.app&#x2F;app_name) cannot exceed 60 MB. However, consider download times when determining your app’s size. Minimize the file’s size as much as possible, keeping in mind that there is a <strong>100 MB limit for over-the-air downloads</strong>. Abnormally large binary files are usually the result of storing data, such as images, inside the compiled binary itself, instead of as a resource inside your app bundle. If you are compiling an image or large dataset into your binary, it would be best to split this data out into a resource that is loaded dynamically by your app.</p>
<p>Some info about this?</p>
<p>Thanks ;)</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>You have not stated what the problem is or what information you are actually seeking.  You appear to state you previously believed that the values were one thing but now they are something else.</p>
<p>They are something else - they were raised.</p>
<p>So not sure what you are actually after.</p>

										<p><p>The problem is that looking for information about download limit over the aire&#x2F;mobile data&#x2F;3-4g in lot places people talk about some android devices or maybe operative system version itself, that can&#39;t download apps bigger than 20mb without wifi connection.</p>
<p>We are developing an app and want to build it for ios and android with the same content and for that reason is really important to know if for both stores we can use 50 like the limit or would be better to think on 20.</p>

										<p><p>This is where you find out that things that sound equal are not always equal.</p>
<p>Android limits the size of the APK to 50Mb this is not the limit for over the air (non wifi) it is the maximum size for the APK when the app is created.  You will not know this size until you package for the store and then read the final size.</p>
<p>iOS states their value for over the air downloads (non wifi).  Again you will not know the size of the app until you have packaged for the stored and read the final size.</p>
<p>Whilst you are creating a cross platform app the sizes of these two final file will not be the same.  Android has a heavier burden of supporting libraries to start with and if you provide all the density image variations then those asset file sizes will also be larger than the iOS version.</p>
<p>If you think your app will exceed the limits then use a technique many people use.  Package all the functionality in the app and then consider post-install downloading any additional assets required. this will not count towards over the air limits as those only account for initial app downloads.</p>
<p>You could also (and smarter) download additional assets as required - by this I mean only bring down the assets you need for where you are now, when you move somewhere else then grab those and cache them for later use.  This makes the users experience a much easier one and reduces the load on the server that will have to serve these extra assets.</p>
<p>So in short - both platforms are different, move away from the idea that 20Mb is the limit and keep updating yourself on new information as things change.  HOWEVER keep in mind these limits are OS version specific.  So if you are supporting older OS versions you app files will need to be no larger than those levels rather than the new ones as the larger files may not then be available to the older OS versions.</p>
