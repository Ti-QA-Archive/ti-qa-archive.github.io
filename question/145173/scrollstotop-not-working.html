			<h1>scrollsToTop not working</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi</p>
<p>I&#39;m aware you can&#39;t have more than one scrollsToTop-able view open, otherwise the functionality breaks - you must only have one view with that set.</p>
<p>But I cannot get this working despite going through my entire code with a fine tooth comb and setting every text area, scroll view, table view and web view to <code>scrollsToTop: false</code><br>And then setting just one web view to <code>scrollsToTop: true</code></p>
<p>Is there anything else that is known to break the scrollsToTop functionality?</p>
<p>Developing for iPhone.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<div><p>Please provide some code that we can use to reproduce the problem.  The code should be short and ideally stand-alone so it can easily be placed into a test app.</p>
<p>A couple of the many reasons I am asking for code as we have now way to know how you have designed your app and positioned your views on the screen, which view you are hoping will scroll (not all will).</p>
<p>BTW a tip about scrollsToTop (at least on iPad - not had time to check iPhone), you can have more than one, when placed side by side tapping above each will trigger the scroll on the one underneath - individually.  The reason I mention this is layout IS a factor.</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;m struggling with the same issue (with 3.1) and I&#39;ve done the same thing as Ben.  Hard to extract a sample app from the full app to reproduce this issue.  Has anyone had the same problem and solved it?  If so how?  Thanks.</p>

							<div><p>Just solved my issue but I&#39;m not sure if this solution applies to you.  The scrollsToTop was working fine until I added a few instances of the new ListView component. Unlike ALL OTHER scrollview components, the ListView names the scrollsToTop flag &quot;willScrollOnStatusTap.&quot;  Can you believe that!!!</p>

							<div><p>Hi Gopi. Thanks for that. The project has now finished and I never managed to fix the issue. Next time I get a few spare minutes I may go back in and see if your solution works for this.</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing!</p>
