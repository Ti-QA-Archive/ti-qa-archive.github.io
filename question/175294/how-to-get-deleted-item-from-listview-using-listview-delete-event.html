			<h1>How to get deleted item from listview using listview delete event</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I&#39;m using til ListView component in my App and has implemented the editing functionality to allow items to be deleted from the list.<br>The items in the list is marked canEdit which results in the delete icon left to the item when editing is true on the ListView.<br>When the item is deleted i have added a listener to the delete event on the ListView and the event is triggered correct and the item is removed from the listview.</p>
<p>All this works fine, but how do i get the deleted item to remove it from the data storage?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Depending on how you built the listView these are two of the likely choices to return a reference so you may delete the record.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> deleteItem = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">e</span>) </span>{
    Ti.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">'itemIndex: '</span> + e.itemIndex);
    Ti.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">'source: '</span> + <span class="hljs-built_in">JSON</span>.stringify(e.source));
};
listView.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'delete'</span>, deleteItem);
</code></pre><p>The first will show the index entry of the data passed to it.  The second displays the properties for each element that returns the delete event.  Adding a custom property here might provide you with the information you are after.</p>

										<p><p>The itemIndex is the index of the item before it was deleted and the e.source is a reference to the listview.</p>
<p>It makes sence that the deleted item isn&#39;t available on the listview, but it would be nice to have as an event argument.</p>

										<p><p>So if you have an array of data that built the ListView and itemIndex points to the item that has been removed - that association is the link between the two surely?</p>
<p>If you are concerned about deletes 2, 3 and beyond as their indexes are now adjusted based on the removal of previous entries of the list that no longer reference the original array - yu need to adjust the array during the deletion.</p>
<p>So something like this;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-label">originalDataArray.splice</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">itemIndex </span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>Now the indexes will match each time a row is deleted.  If not this what am I missing?</p>

										<p><p>Hi</p>
<p>Thanks for the help.<br>My listview is based on an array, loaded via a network service, that i then create rows from that is added to my listview. To avoid to maintain both the array and the listview items. I haven&#39;t stored the array.</p>
<p>My original idea was to get the item in the delete event from the listview and then call a network service that would then delete the item server side, but the item that i want to delete is not available on the listview or the delete event after deletion.</p>
<p>What i have done is this:</p>
<p>var preEditSectionAndItems = [];</p>
<p>var setPreEditSectionAndItems = function(){</p>
<p>  preEditSectionAndItems = _.map($.listview.sections, function(section){</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">  <span class="hljs-tag">return</span> <span class="hljs-rules">{
    <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">items </span>:<span class="hljs-value"> _.<span class="hljs-function">map</span>(section.items,<span class="hljs-function">function</span>(item){
       return item</span></span>;
    }</span>)
  };
});
</code></pre><p>};</p>
<p>In the delete event i then find the item deleted via itemIndex and sectionIndex.</p>
<p>I hope this isn&#39;t the best solution, but it works:-).</p>
