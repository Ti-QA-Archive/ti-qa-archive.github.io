							<div><p>hi,</p>
<p>I think this problem is related with zip file. Still, it might indicate a real problem with the archive.</p>
<p>What happens when you try to open that Zip archive directly by, for example, double-clicking it in the Finder?</p>
<p>Not sure about this solution.</p>
<p>But you need to doanload sdk again and try again</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>Hi Angela</p>
<p>Firstly please check you have run xCode. If it hasn&#39;t been run for the first time since installation, then you get errors like this.</p>
<p>If xCode has been run and is all fine, then go to you home directory, ~&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx and check you have 3.1.2.GA installed you should also have 3.1.3.GA installed.</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t have then instal them, if you do and your having problems delete the directories and start again. 3.1.3.GA should install automatically through Studio updates. You can get all the builds from <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;index.html#3_1_X">here</a> if you want to instal any previous SDK&#39;s.</p>
<p>But if your using xCode 5 you really want to be using 3.1.3</p>
<p>T.</p>

										<p><p>yes, I have tried all of the above. it just won&#39;t update at all. when I downloaded the .zip file directly and put in in the folder it is supposed to go, it said something to do with child statuses. I have literally spent HOURS &amp; HOURS trying to get to work. It&#39;s so frustrating. I&#39;m not an IT professional lol. I have tried uninstalling (deleting directories) and reinstalling about 3 times. I put a question in on the Jira website and they said that they couldn&#39;t replicate the error so closed my question and directed me here.</p>
