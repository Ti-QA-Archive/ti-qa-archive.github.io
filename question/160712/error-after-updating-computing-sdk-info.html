							<p>Yes, I&#39;m getting that, too.</p>
<p>I&#39;m chalking it up to the usual week or so of work lost for a typical Titanium update.  Don&#39;t worry, after a few days of frustration and blind experimentation you might actually get things working again.</p>

							<p>I was able to get past this error by shutting down and starting everything up again. Then there was another update to be installed. After that, the issue went away. There was still another days worth of issues to work through, but at least it was a start.</p>

										<p><p>I think I have a solution (that not solves the problem, but helps to launch application)</p>
<p>Launch from Titanium Studio your project as iPhone emulator;<br>During &quot;invoking xcodebuild&quot;, open Xcode project of your app project (build&#x2F;iphone is created during this step);<br>Launch your project from Xcode.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a bit annoying, but it works on my 7 yo macbook…</p>

							<p>I have this problem also and it&#39;s stated that the fix is in Studio 3.2.0, but since I&#39;m running Mac OS X Lion 10.7.5 (and have to on my old MacBook Early-2008) I have to use Studio 3.1.2 because it&#39;s the last Studio to support XCode 4.6 so can&#39;t update Studio. Is there no fix for this at all? I can&#39;t afford to buy a new laptop just to address this issue. Perhaps it&#39;s Phonegap&#x2F;Cordova time. <em>barf</em></p>
