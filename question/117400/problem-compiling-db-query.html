		<section>
			<p>I have a query that I am building in javascript.  below is the code:</p>
<p>var SQL = &#39;select [Column 1], [Column 2], Modifier, Type From table where (([Column 1] in (&#39; + list1 + &#39;)) or ([Column 2] in (&#39; + list2 + &#39;)) and EndDate=\&#39;*\&#39;)&#39;;</p>
<p>it actually generates SQL that looks like (from Titanium.API.info(SQL);):</p>
<p>select [Column 1], [Column 2], Modifier, Type From table where (([Column 1] in (&#39;123&#39;,&#39;456&#39;)) or ([Column 2] in (&#39;123&#39;)) and EndDate=&#39;*&#39;)</p>
<p>I then execute the sql:<br>var rows = db.execute(SQL);<br>if(rows.isValidRow()){<br>   Titanium.API.info(&#39;ROW COUNT = &#39; + rows.getRowCount());</p>
<p>It looks like the execute command isn&#39;t working because I get this error:</p>
<p>Cannot call method &quot;isValidRow&quot; of null</p>
<p>But - I can copy the sql out of the info screen and paste it directly into my sqlite editor and it works.<br>Any suggestions where to look?</p>

							<p>I think you need to put the variables in the query outside the main query, I don&#39;t think you can add them like that. </p>
<p>rows = db.execute(&#39;SELECT myfield FROM mytable WHERE myvalue = ?&#39;, value);</p>
<p>The question mark represents the &#39;value&#39; variable.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the reply, but this gave the same result.  I tried a similar query on a very basic table - just 10 rows with letters and numbers.  The app threw the same error - so after trying everything else I changed the Andriod SDK version from 2.2 to 2.3 and the second query suddenly worked.  It seems to me that Appcelerator still has some kinks to work out.  If anyone has a workaround, I am open to suggestions.</p>

										<p><p>I realize that this isn&#39;t what is causing your issue specifically, but Abe is correct - you are not using the Ti API correctly. See <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Working+with+Local+Data#WorkingwithLocalData-Storingdata">Storing data</a> for the correct way to run a query on the database.</p>

							<p>After much trial and error and some very helpful posts, I found the problem - so here is a long winded summary of what I have learned.</p>
<p>The original error:<br>Cannot call method &quot;isValidRow&quot; of null</p>
<p>This simply means the rows variable I am looking at is null so the isValidRow method fails.  You can check if &quot;rows&quot; is ok by an if statement:<br>If (rows!=null){ &#x2F;&#x2F;go on with looking for row counts and data</p>
<p>In my case rows was null which meant the query failed.  Turns out there is a nice Android monitor app called DDMS.bat.   It is located in the android\android-sdk\tools folder.  If you are on windows7 you have to run it as an administrator for it to work.  You can look through all the android processes and select the appcelerator process.  It tells you what appcelerator is doing in the emulator.  It said the table I was querying was not found.  Since I could see the table in the SQLite editor, I figured there was a caching problem.</p>
<p>The post below solved the problem.  If you change or add a table in your installed DB, you have to remove the old DB, then reinstall it in order to unload it.  I had tried this by deleting the virtual machine and changing paths and file names - nothing worked until I removed the old one.</p>
