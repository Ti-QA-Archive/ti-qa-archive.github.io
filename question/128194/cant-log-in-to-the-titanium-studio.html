<p>If you have an Internet connection then you ought to be able to log in, so I am sorry that you are having this issue. Would you confirm that the proxy settings are configured correctly?  If you don&#39;t use a proxy, make sure they are blank.</p>
<p>Also, type your password into a text file (no need to save it), to ensure that what you are intending to type (that is obscured in the password field) is what is actually being input.</p>
<p>Let me know if there is any improvement.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>I wouldn&#39;t do that just yet, Eshani.  What operating system are you using?  If you are not worried about losing any previous Studio settings, you could close Studio, delete the directory named <code>.eclipse</code> (see Software Locations for your OS in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Configuring+Environment+Variables">Configuring Environment Variables</a>) and restart Studio.</p>
<p>Let me know how you get on.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
