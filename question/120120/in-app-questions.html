			<p>I have two questions about in-app purchase, I am trying to set up Auto-Renew Subscriptions</p>
<p>1: I get the module to load my products fine…After I confirm purchase through my test account I get an Error:  </p>
<p>Purchasing product: Error Domain=SKErrorDomain Code=2 &quot;Cannot connect to iTunes Store&quot; UserInfo….</p>
<p>Can someone please help me figure out what the problem is…It appears that it is actually purchasing the product even though i get the error.</p>
<p>2: What is the use of the Shared Secret??!?  The itunesconnect site states this:<br>A shared secret is a unique code that you should use when you make the call to our servers for your In-App Purchase receipts. Without a shared secret, you will not be able to test auto-renewable In-App Purchase subscriptions in the sandbox mode. Also note that you will not be able to make them available on the App Store.<br>Note: Regardless of what app they are associated with, all of your auto-renewable subscriptions will use this same shared secret.</p>
<p>Then it gives me a shared secret code that I have no idea where to put it.</p>
<p>Any help an advice would be great! I am an indy account holder.</p>
<p>Thanks…Also I cant figure out how to post this in the premium support portal</p>

							<p>After reading EVERY single post about the storekit on this forum AND the help desk over the past week, I have learned one thing.</p>
<p>Appcelerator does not know how to use the storekit module.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not going to pay 2,500 every year for the rest of my life just for a few answers about an extremely undocumented module … Why would i pay for such a horrible pricing model that if i used your module I feel like i am selling my soul to Appcelerator…..If my license expires the agreement says basically I am supposed to remove my app from the store and &quot;return&quot; the module. WTF??! Is this a joke? Obviously it was written by an idiot legal team.</p>
<p>YOUR PRICING MODELS ARE SO FREAKING AWKWARD.</p>
<p>So far my experience with the rest of the API has been fantastic, I have released 26 Apps Using it so far.  </p>
<p>But integrating storekit with any of my apps has been a nightmare. No support, No examples, No documentation, Very little testing done.</p>
<p>All i want to do is integrate in-app auto renewing subscriptions…How is it that Nimblekit has it figured out?  I hate to say it, appcelerator has been great but without in-app purchasing It is worthless.  Unless I hear something in the next week I will start migrating my code to another platform because I have to Apple has recently changed policies and has forced me to change the way i release my apps to include in-app purchasing rather than a full and lite version.</p>

										<p><p>I am a strong supporter of Titanium, and i understand they have their hands full with all the developing and other stuff, but i hope they dont forget their way.<br>The company is expanding, and probably its understandable, but they kinda give the feeling that if you are not a &quot;big payer&quot;, you get ignored. I also understand that there are a lot fo developers to please, but if you do something, stick to it. They made a habit in releasing stuff without testing, without documenting, and thats not very professional. Lets take the QA system for example, its full of bugs, errors, links that dont work anymore, paging system that doesn&#39;t work…and so on…<br>I hope they will realize at some point that success cant be achieved this way.<br>Money is important, so i understand that too, but they should forget that without all these people that use and support titanium, this will bot be possible for them.<br>So APPCELERATOR, try to be more understanding and more concentrated on helping and doing stuff the way it has to be done, not just to put it out there.<br>Thank you.<br>Alex</p>
