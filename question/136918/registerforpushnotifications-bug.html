			<h1>registerForPushNotifications bug</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>A number of threads on this forum appear to suggest that the behavior I have seen with registerForPushNotifications is an Appcelerator bug.</p>
<p>a. I have configured the AppID correctly, then created the provisioning profile and installed it.<br>b. I request the Push notification registration and wait…. . Nothing happens, no errors, no success… .<br>c. Curiously enough when I run the app again it reports remoteNotificationsEnabled is <strong>true</strong> and at the same time the remoteDeviceUUID string is <strong>null</strong>.</p>
<p>I have spent hours going around in circles on this one and am slowly coming around to the idea that there might be a bug here after all.  The idea that somehow I have blocked a port on my WiFi router is hard to buy - I checked to ensure that it allows all TCP&#x2F;UDP traffic.</p>
<p>Perhaps someone here knows what the issue might be and what can be done about it?</p>

										<p><p>Before you can get to the UA stage you need to successfully register the device to receive Push, get the remoteDeviceUUID etc.  Are you doing this in a way that is somehow different from what is described in the Kitchen Sink example?  If so I would much appreciate a code snippet showing what you are doing.</p>
