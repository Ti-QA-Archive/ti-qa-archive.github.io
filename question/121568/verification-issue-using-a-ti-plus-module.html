			<h1>Verification Issue using a Ti+ Plus module</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am trying to compile the example Ti.Barcode app, and upon startup, I get an error dialog with says &quot;Verification Issue: Unlicensed module(s) detected. You must be a subscriber to use…&quot;</p>
<p>However, I am an Indie subscriber with a paid annual subscription. I should be able to use this module. </p>
<p>Also, I notice that even though this screen says I&#39;m a premium customer and that I should post my issue on the premium support portal, I only read only access to that. </p>
<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>Dan</p>

										<p><p>Can you elaborate on this a little?  Do I replace the guid in my tiapp.xml with the manifest guid or is there an xml node i need to put in containing the guid?  I have a purchased module that I can not get to work at all without it telling me the license is invalid</p>

							<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Indie members can only submit issues in this Q&amp;A. I get the same message re premium, which for an Indie member is a bit misleading. I just make sure I follow any issues in the premium support that are of interest.</p>
<p>Do the other modules work?</p>
<p>I created a new app and added the barcode example without a problem.</p>
<p>You may need to logout out and back in of TiStudio.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Mark</p>

										<p><p>You might also want to check that the app was created using the account that has Indie membership. If an app was created using a different account you will get that message I believe.</p>
<p>I got the same issue when I tried it with an old app created with a different account.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Mark, that could very well be it. I created the project using my own personal community account, and imported it here at work on the Indie account. I&#39;ll recreate the project and see what changes. Hopefully your suggestion will be the answer I&#39;m looking for. Thanks!</p>

										<p><p>No, creating a new project did not solve anything. I still get this in the output:</p>
<p>2011-06-27 08:44:06.788 BarCoder[13894:707] [ERROR] License violation detected. Unlicensed module(s) detected.  You must be a subscriber to use one or more of the modules included with this project.. Please contact Appcelerator Support.</p>
<p>Where are the Appcelerator support people with answers?</p>

										<p><p>Hi. When you created the new project did you replace the tiapp.xml or any parts of it.</p>
<p>This contains a guid which I think is what gets tied to a particular account.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not too happy with Indie&#39;s only having Q&amp;A support. There needs to be some level of professional support for us too.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Mark</p>

										<p><p>Mark, I didn&#39;t, I created a whole new project, and only added the module line.</p>
<p>What I did find, from viewing some of the support tickets on the premium side, was suggestions for dealing with the problem in Ti Developer. I created a new Ti.Dev project and copied just the resources folder over, and now it works from there. It would be nicer if this all just worked from Studio though. There has to be a bulletproof way for them to do this.</p>

							<p>I also get this, although I am a premium member. I am not using TiStudio for development, I didnt have any idea that it could be obligatory condition.</p>

							<p>Yeah, I did open the ticket… it really helped, so I had to close the ticket :))) The trick was that after changing your credentials in TiDev, you had to CLOSE the TiDev, then it gives you a login window, when you open it again…</p>

							<p>You have to change the value of <code>guid</code> to something which is created by using the right account in the <code>tiapp.xml</code>.</p>
