			<h1>Recreate Window Each Time Tab Clicked</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m using Ti Developer 1.6.2 and IOS 4.3.</p>
<p>I have a window that is launched by a TabGroup tab. The code inside the window works perfectly, but I would like to completely replace the content each time that tab is clicked.  The code inside the window only executes one time, when the window is opened the first time.</p>
<p>In my app.js, I defined a window focus event for the win variable created in my CreateWindow, and attempted to reload controls when that fires, but it doesn&#39;t seem to affect my content even in the simplest of examples. I tried other events, all defined in my app.js for the tab and win variables used to create the tab, and although they fire when expected, don&#39;t seem to have access to the controls.</p>
<p>I also tried closing that window, in a blur event defined for that same win variable, and that doesn&#39;t seem to do anything.  I thought that perhaps if I closed the window, the next time the tab was clicked the code inside that window would run again.</p>
<p>Since my content may vary quite a bit each time the tab is clicked, deleting the window and recreating may be a good option.  I&#39;m just not sure what the best way is to achieve that. </p>

							<p>I solved this problem by defining an App event listener in the window that is to be refreshed and in my app.js created an event listener for the tabgroup click and specifically the tab of the window to be refreshed. When that fires, I do an App level fireEvent and launch the entire refresh process.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I subscribed to the Indie plan last night and watched several training videos, learning about app level events in one of the videos. </p>

							<p>Another solution:</p>
<p>you connect your window with an event listeners. If the window receives an event (&#39;myevent&#39;) you rebuild the content with an functuion populateData(). On other event (setInterval, HTTPClient get response, changing of tab) you fire this event (&#39;myevent&#39;).</p>
<p>Hope it helps</p>

										<p><p>Our solutions are very similar.  I didn&#39;t want to unconditionally fire the event that replaces the content each time data changed in another screen, as this would consume resources unnecessarily. Tying the refresh to the clicking of the tab that renders this data restricts this longer-running httpclient call (which brings back history) to only when the user wishes to view it.</p>
<p>Thanks …</p>

										<p><p>Yes, because of memory restriction it need a smart architecture. In bigger projects we plan a storyboard for resources …<br>Best regards<br>Rainer (from Hamburg)</p>

							<p>Hi, I&#39;m working in a news reader and is very similar, the simplest solution is using a focus event listener. Is not the optimum but it works. The best solutions is add a reload&#x2F;refresh button so the user can refresh the page&#x2F;info when he need or using a time out verification.<br>In any case every time you add info to the win, you will add more and more layers, try using transparent background and you will see all the added content inside the win, I don&#39;t know about performance but that don&#39;t looks good to me.</p>
<p>Here is my simple code</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">win.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-symbol">'focus'</span>, function<span class="hljs-literal">()</span> 
{
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> ( <span class="hljs-type">Titanium</span>.<span class="hljs-type">Network</span>.networkType != <span class="hljs-type">Titanium</span>.<span class="hljs-type">Network</span>.<span class="hljs-type">NETWORK_NONE</span> ) {
    actInd.show<span class="hljs-literal">()</span>;
    xhr.setTimeout(<span class="hljs-number">10000</span>);     
    xhr.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"GET"</span>,urlchannel);
    xhr.send<span class="hljs-literal">()</span>;
  }<span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>{
    var alertDialog = <span class="hljs-type">Titanium</span>.<span class="hljs-type">UI</span>.createAlertDialog({
    title: <span class="hljs-symbol">'Atencion'</span>,
    message: <span class="hljs-symbol">'No</span> hay conectividad',
    buttonNames: [<span class="hljs-symbol">'OK'</span>]
    });
    alertDialog.show<span class="hljs-literal">()</span>;    
}  
});
</code></pre>
