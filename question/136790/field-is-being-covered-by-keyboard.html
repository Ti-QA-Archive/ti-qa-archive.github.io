			<h1>Field is being covered by keyboard</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>One of the input fields in my iPad app is towards the bottom of the page:<br><img src="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;img.skitch.com&#x2F;20120510-xq57cygg789uw3h21usw3aktku.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>So when you tap into it, the keyboard covers it:<br><img src="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;img.skitch.com&#x2F;20120510-rq6t2wcrmq1j6nfhiijqnw8fkq.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The white box with the red border and the toolbar at the bottom is a view in the black window.</p>
<p>Can I do anything about this, or does the screen design just have to take the keyboard into account?</p>

							<p>It is a wellknown problem. You can animate the view with input fields to top. After closing of keyboard you move the view down.</p>

										<p><p>Do you mean to set the top of the view that encloses the field to 0?  Would that slide up the entire enclosing view? Or do I need to move the top-most view (the white bordered box) to a negative number top?</p>

										<p><p>Does anyone have a best practice example?<br>I&#39;ve tried to implement this workaround. Basically it works but I&#39;ve a few problems. I have three editboxes in a vertical view. I&#39;ll move my view up when an edit get the focus and moves it down when the blur-event is fired. I do this for all three edits. When i change the focus from one edit to the other i have a bad effect. The view moves down and up again. It looks bad. Another problem is, that i don&#39;t know the height of the keyboard. It would be nice if anybody can post a good emaple to handle this. Maybe someone implemented this workaround and can help me. Thanks</p>
