			<h1>iPhone 5 splash and app not filling up screen</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>My app runs just like it were a pre-iphone5 app in the iPhone 5 simulator. It doesn&#39;t use the Default-568h@2x.png that is saved in the resources&#x2F;iphone-directory. Instead it uses the regular splash image. I have tried removing the entire contents of the build directory manually, and cleaning the project several times. Why is my app running in &quot;letterbox&quot; mode? SDK version is 3.1.1.GA</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The only requirements to enable Retina Tall (iPhone 5) are as follows;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Default-568h@2x.png</strong> file<ul>
<li>Must be placed;</li>
<li><strong>{appname}&#x2F;resources&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;</strong> folder (non-alloy)</li>
<li><strong>{appname}&#x2F;app&#x2F;assets&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;</strong> folder (alloy)</li>
<li>Must have the resolution of 640x1136</li>
<li>Must have the exact spelling and case as used above.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your SDK must be set as Ti SDK 2.1.3 (but you really should always be on the latest version).</li>
<li>You should be using the latest xcode (or at least a more recent branch 4.5 or higher)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thoughts;</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are creating an alloy app not correct location above.</li>
<li>Edit your <strong>tiapp.xml</strong> file manually and check your SDK version entry for confirmation</li>
</ul>
<p>Create a new default classic project and without making ANY changes compile for simulator - what happens?</p>

										<p><p>Very good answer! Unfortunately nothing worked for me. I have checked the file name multiple times and made sure it is correct. The resolution is correct, and the format is PNG (not just the file extension). I have cleaned the build folder but no success. If i create a new classic project, it runs as supposed to, but my app is running letterboxed. I have tried updating to latest Xcode and latest Titanium SDK.</p>

										<p><p>I haven&#39;t been able to solve this. Really frustrating. If someone would like to help me take i quick look at it, i&#39;d could send you a dropbox-link to the project. Email me at anton[at]slashdev.se and i&#39;ll send you the link :)</p>

										<p><p>Solved it.</p>
<p>The &quot;default*.png&quot; images are being cached in the resources folder and not being overwritten when re-compiling.</p>
<p>Solution;</p>
<p>Delete the ENTIRE contents of the resources folder.  This will remove the files that are not being overwritten from the assets folder.  I have tried this from scratch twice and worked both times.  When I first started the app was letter-boxed, now fills the entire iPhone 5 (retina tall) device.</p>
<p>Let me know how it goes.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you Malcolm for looking into this! This works perfectly fine! Didn&#39;t think about that i&#39;d have to clean the resources folder, only the build folder. Big thanks!</p>
