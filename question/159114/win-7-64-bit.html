			<h1>Win 7 64 bit</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>New to Titanium, but looking good. I reinstalled my win 7 to 64 bit version to utilize more ram.</p>
<p>Does Titanium support the 64 bit version of JDK? I downloaded ver JDK 6 u37 <strong>64 bit</strong> and struggled a few hours trying to figure out what could be wrong, because It gave me the typical &#39;couldn&#39;t find JDK&#39; type error.</p>
<p>Eventually I got the JDK 6 u37 <strong>32 bit</strong>… and it worked. (had the same issue with the android SDK).</p>
<p>Obviously I&#39;d like to have the machine using anything 64 bit for improvement. I guess I just need confirmation that titanium works with the 32 bit version, or?..</p>

							<p>Hello Mario,</p>
<p>Titanium only supports 32-bit for Android development. That goes for the Android SDK as well as the Java Development Kit. Even if you are using a 64-bit machine, you will need those 2 with 32-bit versions.</p>
<p>Hope this clears that up for you.</p>

										<p><p>hi guys, apologies for the late reply, I had some other things to take care of too. I&#39;ve got Titanium downloading the node.js (it prompted me) and mobilesdk 3.1.3GA, but I have a slower internet connection and it&#39;s taking a while.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll check the BB links too as soon as I can, thanks for that.</p>
<p>I will most definitely mark the question as answered or give feedback as I get to it.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

							<p>Hi Mario Igrec,</p>
<p>It&#39;s no problem your PC 64bit or 32bit you just installed Oracle JDK 32bit. I also use 64bit Win7 and still no problem. And follow this link for <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;titaniumsolution.blogspot.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;11&#x2F;installed-titanium-studio-in-windows-pc.html">Installation Titanium</a> and follow this link for <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;titaniumsolution.blogspot.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;11&#x2F;to-installed-titanium-studion-path.html">Environment Variable Path</a> and this is important.</p>
<p>note: You don&#39;t set your work-space name space.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>Seems I got a -1 vote LOL… it&#39;s ok, I&#39;ll just refer to it as &#39;tax&#39; for late response&#x2F;payment haha.</p>
<p>Ok, android appears to be working fine, I ran a test project I created previously and it ran in my browser :) (anyone reading this and doing the android SDK install .. ensure you have the Android 2.3.3 (API10) and Android 2.2 (API8) installed too, over and above any other SDK version you want.. I battled originally with this and read a post somewhere about this and it worked after I installed those two).</p>
<p>Also to confirm, Node.js did put the path in the windows PATH, thanks for the tip on checking that it has done so.</p>
<p>Will do the BlackBerry SDK and I&#39;ll create a new topic if I run into problems.</p>
<p>So the final verdict for anyone following this thread, don&#39;t try get the 64 bit java JDK working, unless you have hours of time spare, just go straight 32 bit Java JDK 6. read all the article links that the guys posted in this thread too.</p>
<p>Thanks to Mostafizur and Christian for all their input and valuable links in this thread, you guys were most helpful. :)</p>

							<p>Thank you.. you guys have been most helpful.</p>
<p>I followed the &quot;Titanium With Android on 64 bit windows 7&quot; link that Mostafizur posted and it&#39;s quite a valuable article. I&#39;m just waiting for some platform packages to download.. restart my machine and I&#39;ll see. I have however left the 64 bit JDK on my machine to see what happens after boot and the environment variables get set, but if it doesn&#39;t like it, I&#39;ll take it off.</p>
<p>Just another question, I also do BB10 native dev and BB legacy dev (in Momentics and Eclipse IDE&#39;s respectively). Any useful links for those two for Titanium? I suspect the BB10 may be a no-go?</p>
