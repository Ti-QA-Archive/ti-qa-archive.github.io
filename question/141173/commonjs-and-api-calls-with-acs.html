			<h1>commonjs and API calls with ACS</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am just getting started on converting some apps to the commonjs method, as well as writing a new one, and am starting to get the hang of it. However, my newest app will make use of ACS and I have a concern about API calls, as they are limited and I don&#39;t want to be wasteful.</p>
<p>On an old app of mine, I created a tableView window in one of my tabs as soon as the app loaded. I grabbed the rows from my server, and appended them to the tableview. Viola! it was done. I would not make another request to the server again UNLESS data was being changed (add&#x2F;delete&#x2F;update). Otherwise, the tableView would just stay how it was.</p>
<p>With commonJS, it seems that the window is being created every time it is viewed. So say I do a:<br><code>var tvWindow = new tableViewWindow();</code></p>
<p>and inside tableViewWindow.js, I create a tableview and get data for it from ACS…</p>
<p>That means EVERY time the user goes to this window, a tier 1 API call is used. Having never used ACS, I can&#39;t quite grasp how quickly those will be used up, but it seems like there would be a more efficient way.</p>
<p>Is there?</p>

<p>Can you confirm that this is ACTUALLY the case? That there are multiple API calls being made?</p>
<p>With a new instantiation, this might be occurring as you are are creating a new object.</p>
<p><code>var tvWindow = tableViewWindow();</code> </p>
<p>is not the same as </p>
<p><code>var tvWindow = new tableViewWindow();</code></p>

										<p><p>No I can not confirm that, like I said I am both new to commonJS and to ACS, so I am guessing a bit on the matter. Furthermore, it does not appear that my cloud usage will update when in development, so I can not personally check the amount of calls made. If I am not looking in the right place, I would appreciate a point in the right direction.</p>
<p>Also, regarding the difference you are pointing out. I have been using a new instantiation every time I navigate window to window within a given tab, which I see may not be the best option. I have been basing my app at a basic level on the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator-developer-relations&#x2F;Sample.Todo&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;app.js">todo.sample</a> that floats around here as a starting point to commonJS. The only way it shows to open a window is using <code>new listWindow();</code></p>
<p>How would I go about opening a window as a new object the first time, but not for all remaining times(as I assume it won&#39;t be and shouldn&#39;t be globally available), and if an update were made to the data, is it a better practice to update the tableview directly AFTER a successful API call, or would it be better to create a new window, so that the tableview is rebuilt from the new data?</p>

							<p>Your tableView window can always be architected in a way such that it only retrieves data from the server when  you want it to. There is nothing preventing you from caching the data that is a result of the API call</p>

										<p><p>By caching, do you mean saving the data to a sqlite db? I am just trying to get an idea in my head how all of this will work.</p>
<p>1)API CALL-get tableview data (row 1, row 2, row 3, row 4)</p>
<p>2)save data to sqlite db</p>
<p>3)create tableview from sqlite db each time window is viewed</p>
<p>—User deletes row 4—</p>
<p>4)API CALL-delete row 4</p>
<p>if successful…</p>
<p>5)remove row 4 from sqlite db</p>
<p>6)refresh tableivew(how?)</p>
<p>if failed…</p>
<p>5)alert and error or &#39;sorry cant save your data&#39; message</p>
<p>Is this a sensical way? I know it would result in less API calls, but it sets up a far more complicated architecture where both a local db and a remote(ACS) need to be maintained.</p>
<p>Is there an easier way to cache this data, or is it typical to just use an API call each time the page is constructed?</p>
<p>Also, what are your thoughts on Stephen Feather&#39;s response above, somehow using <code>var tvWindow = new tableViewWindow();</code> the first time and just <code>var tvWindow = new tableViewWindow();</code> after that? Is this bad practice? Should a window always be newly constructed before viewing? Prior to commonJS, my tableView window would have been global, available at any time and already constructed when the app started.</p>
<p>Thanks for any direction you can provide</p>
