			<h1>Problems with Android SDK after install Ti 3.2.1 on windows? Solution here</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I had some Android SDK problems today in 2 different computers (where I&#39;ve updated from 3.1.3 to 3.2.1) but I found the right solution to solve it, confirmed with the second computer after do the same things that on first.</p>
<p><strong>The problem</strong>: Studio cannot find Android SDK but the path is right and your API levels are there, on the disk.</p>
<p><strong>The solution</strong>: Just go to &quot;SDK Manager&quot; on your Android SDK folder and update the &quot;Android Support Library&quot;. I&#39;ve updated also all the components suggested, but I think it&#39;s only that.</p>
<p>Just after the update of the SDK Manager, magically, Studio detected all my old AVD Machines.</p>
<p>But this got me stuck for 3 hours, looking in forums. I hope this can help others to don&#39;t waste their time.</p>

							<div><p>@Santhosekumar, supposing windows, just go to your android SDK folder and you have the &quot;SDK Manager.exe&quot; in that folder. If you are in Linux, type &quot;sh android&quot; in the terminal.</p>

							<div><p>When you execute it, it will detect changes automatically. At the bottom you will see something like <strong>1 package to update, 2 to delete</strong>, just proceed with the &quot;Install packages&quot; button.</p>
