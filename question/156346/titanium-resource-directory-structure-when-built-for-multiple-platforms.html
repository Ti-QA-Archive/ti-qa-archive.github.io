			<h1>Titanium Resource Directory Structure when built for multiple platforms</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi Guys, I am planning to build an app targeting Android, Iphone and Ipad devices. Hence can you kindly briefly explain and give me a clarity on how to make use of the directory structure in resources after creating a project?? Where should the JS Files regarding their respective platforms be placed so that Android devices and tablets as well as Iphone devices and Ipad will pick them up automatically??<br>Also give a small explaination on Common, handheld and ui folders ??</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Good question;</p>
<p>I will answer the last question first;  <strong>Common</strong>, <strong>handheld</strong> and <strong>ui</strong> folders are part of examples and NOT part of the Titanium system.  They are great when you are playing around with system in the first few test apps you put together - personally I find them limiting as newbies believe they must be used and then spend too much time trying to get apps to work with them.  </p>
<p>Firstly your question is very much non-alloy related and the answer will be the same.  A (partially) different answer to an alloy based question.</p>
<p>When you first create a new classic default app you end up with a few default folders and a few default files - this is the real starting point.</p>
<p>I am going to limit the answer to Android and iOS, however it will logically extend for the other platforms, but dealing with more in every example will simply be typing for the sake of typing.</p>
<p>The first thing to understand is Android is one thing and iOS is another.  We do not deal with; Android, iPhone &amp; iPad.  I mention this distinction because people say and think that Android and iPhone are the same thing, one is an operating system the other is a device.  So you should think it terms of operating systems only.  Thus Android and iOS.  This simplifies things that come up in your planning - except for one thing, in Titanium ios folders are written as <strong>iphone</strong> - annoying, but historical.</p>
<p>So to the folder layout; a default project provides two folders; <strong>android</strong> and <strong>iphone</strong>.  These are the folders you use to place platform specific code and assets into.  If something is in one of these then the other does not see it.  That last point is important.</p>
<p>The best way to understand how these folders work together is already answered (by me - big head sorry), review this answer to someone else&#39;s question previously now before reading on.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;148337&#x2F;how-to-achieve-same-layout-for-android-and-iphone-using-titanium">How to achieve same layout for Android and iPhone using Titanium</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So now you understand more about how files can be placed within the platform dependant folders and for images how you place them for different resolutions.  Once you have nailed this you have the basics sorted.</p>
<p>You can also have platform dependant code as well.  You may know about the property <strong>Ti.Platform.osname</strong>, this returns which operating system you are running on.  So from this you can create <strong>if</strong> statements as say if android do this, for ios do something else.</p>
<p>However sometimes you need more separation, so you can add javascript files inside their respective platform folders and when the app runs the correct one works.  The reason you would do this is the logic of the code is so different it is simply too messy to have lots of if statements.  A good example of this is navigation controllers in iOS and their lack of existence in Android.  So you might create a handler that wraps up the support for each.</p>
<p>In an ideal world you would not place all your code inside a single folder and certainly not in the root of resources.  Break your code and assets into well considered folder names.  This helps you decide how one thing talks to another.</p>
<p>I would strongly consider using <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;CommonJS_Modules_in_Titanium">CommonJS</a> methods.  By doing this you manage one thing in one file.  I have the experience of previously trying to put all the code in a single file - a bad idea, a very bad idea.</p>
<p>Think about your project in terms of tasks, this could be a single window or a group of windows that fulfil a single task.  Then make sure you do not repeat code, if you do - wrap it up in a new commonjs module and reference that code everywhere else.  This way you can fix&#x2F;improve one thing and everything else improves.</p>
<p>That is a lot of info, see how that helps you.</p>

										<p><p>Just thought of a follow up;  tablets.</p>
<p>One distinction between Android and iOS is how tablets are handled, for iOS the difference is defined, iPad is not iPhone, but on Android there is no true distinction between them.</p>
<p>With iOS you are expected to provide a different interface to your app if it runs on iPhone and iPad, but for Android whilst it is encouraged - it is not always performed.  It is made more difficult because there is no easy way to determine if the device you are on is a tablet a phone a phablet or something else.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that whilst you can (now you know how) break up your assets&#x2F;imagery for many different resolutions they are all bundled with the app, so Android users with small screens gain the larger assets.  I say this so you understand - I offer no recommendation as there are many ways to improve this and each one has a bad side.</p>
