			<p>Hello. I&#39;m curiouis as to why no one chose to respond to my     questions regarding module project problems. When I initially asked the first question, I did get a reply which referred me to a piece of documentation on the subject. I read this and found many issues with it and asked for further clarification. Then all comm stopped. I&#39;ve asked a few other questions but no response. Anyone know why? Thanks.</p>

							<p>Hello Doc Jump,</p>
<p>Would you mind providing a bit more information about your correspondance and who it was with (a particular team eg. sales, support, etc)?</p>
<p>A general response to your question would be that correspondance with the support team about particular implementations are generally reserved for paying support customers. All inquiries fall under a queue and paying support customers get first priority. Have you paid for a support subscription? If not this could be the reason for the fall off in communication. Again though, please let me know of the team you were speaking with and I can provide more information about what might have happened.</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience,</p>
<p>Carter</p>

										<p><p>Carter. Thanks so much for your reply. I was beginning to think no one was there anymore!<br>I don&#39;t know what &#39;support team&#39; was involved. This goes back a couple of months at least. I sumitted the original question and received two replies. One referred me to a Titanium Module document which I read and followed, but I not only got errors but strange results. I posted another question describing my results and how different they were from the documentation and asked for some help in correcting these issues. I never heard back from anyone. I&#39;ve read basically everything ever published on Titanium Android Module Project creation, but still see different results from the documentation. Since that time, I have posted 3 slightly different questions with the same theme, thinking this difference might get someone to respond.These posts were at least 2 weeks apart.<br>I definitely don&#39;t feel that this falls into the category of a &quot;particular implementation&quot;. Judge for yourself. To paraphrase my inital question; &quot;how do I create a Titanium Android Module Project and include a .jar file in it for access by my another Project?&quot;<br>I don&#39;t have a subscription with you folks. I looked up terms of support on your site and only found support for $995!~. If there is some other less expensive support offering, I would be interested to hear about it. In the mean time, I will look for my appcelerator posts so I can give you the names of the two respondents.<br>Thanks very much for your prompt reply.<br>Regards,<br>George Jump</p>

										<p><p>Was your correspondance on QA board, where we currently are now? Or was the correspondance over email? The QA board gets hundreds of posts a day and it is very hard to be able to answer every inquiry in a timely fashion (it is a free service after all). For this reason other community developers have the ability to respond and thus help each other out. Correspondance with a team member is only guaranteed if you have a paid support subscription. </p>
<p>As for your question, from what I can tell, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;11&#x2F;integrating-an-external-library-in-an-android-module.html">this article</a> should tell you everything you need to know about how to use an external .jar library for a titanium module. You said you have read pretty much everything about this topic, have you read and understood the article? If not, what is confusing you?</p>

							<p>Hello Carter. Yes, all my correspondence has been in the Q&amp;A forum. My status on this issue, after questioning, trying out contents of some documentation several times and a lot of reading, is at a standstill.<br>I know that all of you are very busy and sometimes I&#39;ve gotten responses from subscribers. I have asked many questions before and always got a response at least within a few days. For my repeated question I have received no responses for well over a month , maybe two. I haven&#39;t been able to find the initial posted questions yet. Don&#39;t know how to search the Q&amp;A. What is the cost of a paid support subscription? As I mentioned, I only saw some support for $995! Too rich for me. Is that all that&#39;s available?<br>Thank you for the link but yes, I have read that article several times. I understand that article and my only question regarding that content was whether it made a difference if the jar file I needed to use was custom, not a third party like Google. But my more basic question has always been regarding problems creating the Module Project&#x2F;Android&#x2F;ti. As I explained in one of my posts back then, I used both the command line and the Ti Studio to create a module project. The command line approach resulted in errors. The Ti Studio approached appeared to work, but the project folder contains less than half of the files&#x2F;folders shown in the documentation including .classpath file which I understand is associated only with Eclipse projects?  Also, documentation on module project creation always refers to Eclipse. &quot;If you are using Eclipse&quot;? Why is it telling me that. I&#39;m not using Eclipse although I tried that as well with negative results.<br>This is getting large so I&#39;ll end it. If you want more detail I can recreate my post that describes these problems.<br>Thanks for your response.</p>

										<p><p>It should not matter if the .jar is custom made, that is why the guides say you can use eclipse to make the module. You can use eclipse to make an android module (in java) and port than into a titanium module to use in your app. Is this what you are trying to accomplish? <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Android_Module_Development_Guide">Here</a> is a great guide that if followed will show you how to create a module in this fashion. If you have read through this guide and you are having issues please let me know where you are confused. </p>
<p>And yes I believe the $995 is the cheapest support subscription we have but it allows unlimited correspondance with our professional support team and generally used by teams of up to 5 people. For most company&#39;s this is highly useful and provides support on any issue one may run into with using our service.</p>
<p>Hope this sheds some light on your project, let me know again where in that document you are running into trouble. </p>
<p>Regards,<br>Carter</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your response Carter. Yes, I&#39;m simply trying to create an Android module project with an embedded .jar file whose functionality I can access from another Android project.<br>I understand that Eclipse can be used, but my question is why do I want to use it? I understand that I can create a project (not sure if I would be creating a module project or not.. And then I can import it into Ti Studio. Why bother when Ti Studio supposedly handles all that?  I&#39;m working in Ti Studio. Why should I be interested in using another IDE?</p>
<p>Yes, I have read this article many times. However I tried the command line create since you sent me the link and feel so highly about the article. I entered:<br><del>titanium.py create –platform=android –type=module –name=mod2 –id=net.cyberwurks.mod2 –android=c:\androidsdk`</del> And here are the results:<br><del>Traceback (most recent call last):<br>File &quot;C:\Users\G Jump\appdata\roaming\Titanium\mobileSDK\win32\3.0.0.GA\module\module.py&quot;, line 387, in &lt;module&gt;<br>main(sys.argv)<br>File &quot;C:\Users\G Jump\appdata\roaming\Titanium\mobileSDK\win32\3.0.0.GA\module\module.py&quot;, line 384, in main<br>module = ModuleProject(config[&#39;platform&#39;],project_dir,config)<br>File &quot;C:\Users\G Jump\appdata\roaming\Titanium\mobileSDK\win32\3.0.0.GA\module\module.py&quot;, line 63, in <strong>init</strong><br>self.platform_delegate = ModulePlatform.create_platform(platform, project_dir, config, self)<br>File &quot;C:\Users\G Jump\appdata\roaming\Titanium\mobileSDK\win32\3.0.0.GA\module\module.py&quot;, line 34, in create_platform<br>return platform_module_class(project_dir, config, module).<br>Many weeks ago, when I received similar errors using the command line create, I posted a question asking for help on understanding why it isn&#39;t working. I posted another question after creating a module project didn&#39;t work with Ti Studio either. But I didn&#39;t get any responses to either post.

										<p><p>You need to use eclipse to develop Java based Android code. If it isn&#39;t clear in the directions, the general idea is that you should create a module project in Titanium studio and then import that project into eclipse. Here you will have native java code that you can change around or check out the examples in the link I posted. </p>
<p>Essentially, the modules that you create are supposed to be written in Java and you can&#39;t develop native android code (Java) in Titanium (which is only Javascript) this is why it says to use Eclipse. As for using this Titanium module with another android project, I am not sure if that is possible since I don&#39;t have experience with Modules for android. You would have to do a google search to check out the differences between the two types of modules but my guess is you would need to do some tinkering to each module to have it work for an Ti and Android app.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the comments Carter. The question of how to access functionality from the jar file embedded in the module project doesn&#39;t appear to be an issue. In all the documentation I&#39;ve read, one common statement is that by using &quot;require(moduleproject.xxx&quot; in the required project file, you gain access to all functionality of the module project. From that point, you can simply call a method or ? by regular name.</p>
<p>You have cleared up one point for me. You stated that &quot;you need to use Eclipse…&quot;. All of the documentation on the subject said, &quot;if you are using Eclipse…&quot; and of course I attempted to ignore that because I was using Ti Studio. You made some interesting and educational statements regarding the module project and jave &#x2F; javascript. I will re-read, but for now, I need to figure out how to create a Ti android module project. In my last post, I included the resultant error stream I got when trying from the command line , again. It wasn&#39;t formatted well, sorry. Also, when I try creating a module project from inside the Ti Studio, it appears to work (no indication one way or the other). However, as I have mentioned, the file&#x2F;folder structure contains less than half of the files&#x2F;folders indicated in the documentation. This is where I&#39;ve been stuck since my second post on the subject around 2 months ago.</p>

							<p>It says &quot;if you are using eclipse&quot; because you can essentially use any Java development IDE (such as Ant which is stated in the documentation) to create an Android module but the directions provided are just for the most common one (for android), which is eclipse :) I can see how that would be confusing. I would follow the directions from Ti Studio and not the command line directions as they may be simpler and easier to understand the process, once you get a hang of it you can move to command line development. </p>
<p>So pretty much once you create the Titanium module project, your next step is to import that project into Eclipse. Then the rest should be smooth sailing. Refer to the docs I posted before for more detailed guidelines.</p>
<p>Hope I could answer all your questions and feel free to respond if you have any other questions, I will do my best to respond in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Carter</p>

										<p><p>Thanks again Carter. This is the best information I&#39;ve every had on this subject. It clears up many issues in my head! But did you read my last post where I indicated that both methods of creating a ti android module project fail. The command line method has errors and the ti studio method results in a partial file&#x2F;folder structure. Of the files&#x2F;folers listed in the documentation, these are missing; android, assets, build, build.properties, build.xml,dist, hooks, and platform. I tried imortinug to Eclipse with this inferior file&#x2F;folder structure many times without success but I i will try again. Maybe all these files and folders aren&#39;t necessary? In fact, one document I recall indicates that it is okay to create the lib folder to put the .jar file in.</p>
<p>One other thing, the resultant ti android module project is in Eclipse? Is that correct?<br>Thanks again.</p>

										<p><p>Doc,</p>
<p>First of all, apologies, I misstated before about not being able to develop modules in Titanium Studio. You can develop modules in titanium studio if you download the eclipse plugin. Have you done this? I have got it working with all files and .jars included by following the guidelines <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;tis&#x2F;Creating+a+New+Titanium+Module">here</a>. You need to install the java eclipse plugin so that you can view the folder tree necessary to develop. If you follows these directions exactly you should your modules project look like <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;yZ5jlPk">this</a> in the projects explorer. Please let me know where you are having issues with this process. Additionally, you can also develop titanium modules in eclipse (it is essentially what you are doing here, just with in Titanium studio).</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Carter</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Carter. The bottom line is that, as I have said, I have performed the procedures outlined in documentation including your latest reference and have either gotten errors (command line results) or incomplete project folder (Ti Studio results).<br>There is not much to the process of creating a module project either from the command line or from studio. So I&#39;m thinking that perhaps something is missing. You mentioned Eclipse Plugin. I googled that and got nothing specific. There are references to Titanium plugin to Eclipse and other such things similar. I have Eclipse installed but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what you mean? Please advise.<br>Thanks again</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Carter. Not sure why you mentioned &quot;writing java code&quot;?I&#39;m writing in javascript with Titanium Appcelerator. However, I followed the instructions in the documentation until I got an error. When I reach the &quot;Install Details&quot; window it displays the error message &quot;Cannot complete the request. See error log&quot;. Well, I don&#39;t know what this means and looking in the Eclipse folder I see no log files. Everything was selected correctly per the instructions for &quot;Indigo&quot; so not much of a chance of creating an error with erroneous selections. Can you help with this? Thanks</p>

										<p><p>Doc,</p>
<p>Just to clarify that we are on the same page, are you wanting to create a module or a mobile application? A module is an add-on to an app to give it more functionality, for example a storekit module allows an app a simple way for users to make purchases from inside the app. A module MUST be written in either Java (for Android) or Objective-C (for iOS). A mobile application is an app written with Javascript (Using Titanium&#39;s SDK) that can have modules attached to it for further functionality. Have you created a few mobile applications using Titanium already? If not I would recommend starting with that before trying to develop modules. It is hard for me to know your intentions without some more information. I would love to help you reach your goal, if you could provide an example of what you would like to develop I think I can help you get started much faster. </p>
<p>And if you are indeed making a module for Android, you cannot write a module in javascript. You have to write it in Java. </p>
<p>Please fill me in on some more details so I can further assist you.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Carter</p>

							<p>Carter. Sorry for not giving you the complete picture. I did all that and more when I first submitted the questions, but I keep forgetting that was a while back and to a different audience.</p>
<p>Here is exactly what I&#39;m trying to do: I&#39;ve written and debugged a Titanium Appcelerator Android Mobile project to parse data on a driver&#39;s license mag stripe or barcode.  All I need is the functionality to read a mag stripe reader output and put it through my parser engine. There is a .jar file created by the manufacturer of the mag stripe reader used with Android that performs this task. So, I&#39;m trying to create an Appcelerator Mobile Module Project in order to include that .jar file and link that to my mobile project that&#39;s already written in order to gain use of the functionality contained in the .jar file. From the documentation, I believe that simply adding a &quot;require&quot; statement in my android mobile project, once the module project is complete with .jar file, will give me that access. If this isn&#39;t clear, please let me know.</p>
<p>Do you have any idea about the error I posted last time? Thanks again.</p>

										<p><p>Great, thanks for that info. Unfortunately, simply adding a &quot;require&quot; will not simply give you access to the android functionality. You will have to write an API of sorts to translate what is exactly going on in the external .jar so that the javascript can make sense of it. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides2&#x2F;Android+Module+Development+Guide">This</a> guide shows you how Java Proxys are needed for that task among other things. </p>
<p>Your task right now is to get the eclipse plugin downloaded for Titanium. </p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;tis&#x2F;Installing+the+Java+Development+Tools</p>
<p>From the issues you are describing about not being able to see all the correct folders, it is leaving me to believe that you have not successfully installed the eclipse plugin. The image that I posted (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;yZ5jlPk.png) is what your projects explorer should look like. If it is not like this then you have not downloaded the eclipse plugin. The guide I posted here takes you step by step on how to do this. Under the &quot;src&quot; folder are two java files (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;KsdV5YB.png) called ExampleProxy.java and ModuletesterModule.java (its called moduletestermodule because that&#39;s the name of my project), this is where you will have to develop your code for the module (in Java).</p>
<p>This should answer all your questions. If not let me know.</p>
<p>Good luck,</p>
<p>Carter</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Carter. There is a lot of information here. I will only comment on a couple of points until I have had a chance to absorb all of it. First, I have several pieces of documentation that indicates that a the functionality contained in a .jar file within a module project is acessible by an android project with use of the &#39;require&#39; statement from within the function that needs to use that functionality. I will look into this more. Secondly, as I indicated in my last post, I ran into an error in the Details screen while following the directions to create the Eclipse Plugin and I have no idea what it means? Thanks again.</p>

										<p><p>You can&#39;t add attachments to QA posts, you can however use a link to an image uploaded to <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;">imgur.com</a>. And yes, you need to use the require to load the module into your app, what I was referring to is that you might still need to write some code to ensure the functionality works as expected.</p>

<p>there is a chance this could be a bug, in which case I will write up a ticket for you and engineering will take a look at but it will be hard to find a resolution without being able to reproduce the problem. The logs might be enough to see the problem though. </p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t know that I&#39;m qualified to determine that. However, I can tell you that I loaded all that was in the instructions and I set the environment accordingly. But as I said before , based on the behavior I believe there is something missing. That&#39;s why I reloaded everything last week which produced no change.</p>

							<p>I was also missing the folders and had the exact same folder layout as you have provided in the screenshots before I downloaded the eclipse plugin. Once I installed the eclipse plugin, everything was generated as expected once I made a new project. You need this plugin installed to get the correct folder creation for a module project, this is my belief. Please send me the log files associated with not being able to install the plugin and I will take a look at them. </p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s very interesting that you saw the same folder structure as I am before the plugin. Sounds like I might be getting close! However, the error in the plugin has changed since I last tried it. Now it&#39;s &quot;Cannot complete the install because some dependencies are not satisfiable&quot;. Sound to me like something additional is missing since the last time I tried the install. Thanks</p>

										<p><p>I was successful in installing the plug-in. The problem was operator error. Then I re-installed Eclipse.  I was confused concerning the different types of Eclipse downloads. I found eclipse-java-juno-sr1-win32, eclipse-jee-juno-sr2-win32, eclipse-mobile-juno-sr1-win32 and eclipse-standard-kepler-R-win32. Initially I chose juno but this time I chose Kepler. I don&#39;t know if it makes a difference or not. However, with the plug-in installed and Eclipse re-installed I created another Appcelerator module project but the folder structure is still the same. Does the download type of Eclipse matter in this case? Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>Juno, Keplar etc are just the names of the eclipse releases, I believe Keplar is the most recent one and should be fine for our purposes. I don&#39;t know how I didn&#39;t see this video earlier but it outlines how to create a module. http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;31868247 have you watched this? If your folder layout is still not right then you are missing one of the prerequisites. You need to verify that every prereq is installed and that you have the correct version. Can you confirm that you have ALL of these prereqs installed?</p>
<p>Titanium Mobile SDK 1.5.0 or above<br>A recent version of Python (&gt;= 2.5) on your PATH or configured with PYTHONHOME.<br>In Windows, Titanium Developer &#x2F; Desktop ships with Python 2.5, so no extra configuration is needed.<br>Oracle JDK<br>Android SDK, in accordance with the Prerequisite Android SDK and Android SDK compatibility matrices<br>Ant 1.7.1 or above in your PATH<br>If you don&#39;t want to install Ant separately, you can optionally use Eclipse</p>
<p>Reinstall or get anything that you do not have. You can use either the command line or through titanium to make the project but since I do not know the command line for windows as well as mac, thats why I recommended it through titanium. My only idea as to why this is not working for you is that you still do not have one of the dependencies properly installed. Maybe the android SDK is in the wrong path? Are you referencing it correctly?</p>

										<p><p>I believe I have everything referenced okay. I just went through the environment variables and paths. All looks okay. However, I did not chose the default path in either Titanium or Eclipse. I used c:\titanium studio and c:\eclipse respectively , instead. I like to keep paths simple.<br>I am reinstalling mobile-juno Eclipse although now I know it doesn&#39;t matter.  I believe you are correct in your assessment and I will spend the time double-checking the prerequisites for Titanium Studio. Thanks so much again for spending so much time for my problem.

										<p><p>That middle paragraph I just copied from the prerequisites needed for mobile developing. They are the same thing but they actually might have been deprecated (though I assume they are now package with studio). As a precaution I would install python as well (2.5 or above) but I am pretty sure it isn&#39;t making a difference. I&#39;m almost positive it comes with Titanium now.</p>

										<p><p>Unfortunately, I still have the problem module project folder not containing all files&#x2F;folders. I&#39;ve installed Python 2.7.5.  I&#39;ve reinstalled Eclipse and Ti Studio.

<p>One strange thing: while checking the path I noticed that OS was Windows NT (I&#39;m running Win 7) so I changed it. Also, it defined HOME as c:\eclipse? I&#39;ll go back through tracing my steps. The problem has to be related to paths, environments or installations. Thanks.</p>

<p>Question: I am only building a Ti module project to include a .jar file to be able to access it&#39;s functionality in my main Ti Project. My question is, since there are many sample Ti Module projects, can I simply use one of those and follow the procedure to include the .jar file I need?</p>

<p>To answer your question, no there are many other files and folders that the module needs in order to work, try downloading a module from the module market place to see what this file&#x2F;folder structure looks like, there is a .xml and manifest file that are needed and are created when the module is packaged.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your replay Carter. This is just going on and on! So you are saying I cannot take an existing module with all its files and folders and integrate a .jar file? </p>
<p>Please read two posts ago for my current problem following the instructions for &quot;default android sdk&quot; when you have time. I&#39;ve reinstalled everything for a second time and now I&#39;m having this problem which I don&#39;t recall having ever before. I&#39;m following the directions in the document at http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Quick_Start-section-29004949_QuickStart-LaunchingTitaniumStudio. Just to restate, the trail of menu selections according to the document should be window&gt;preferences&gt;Titanium Studio&gt;Titanium. My version of Ti studio which is 3.1 has &quot;studio&quot; not Titanium Studio and platforms , not Titanium as stated in the document. So I&#39;m at a loss with this. Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>Lets create a small checklist of things that I have done to get the modules to work, this way you can see what I am doing and hopefully it will help you. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Install Titanium and dependencies (Android SDK) in their default paths</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go to File-&gt;new Titanium Module Project-&gt; we try to create an android module but it gives us an error saying we need Java Development Tools installed first.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Install Eclipse if you haven&#39;t already. (I have Juno but anything should work)</p>
</li>
<li><p>In titanium: Go to Help-&gt;install new software-&gt;click &quot;available software sites&quot; -&gt;check the &quot;eclipse indigo update site&quot;-&gt; click ok-&gt; under programming languages select &quot;Eclipse Java Development Tools&quot;-&gt; click finish</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ensure again that your SDK path is set correctly, go to window-&gt;preferences-&gt;Titanium Studio-&gt;Titanium and make sure that under the Android section, your path is set correctly to where your android SDK is located.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create a new Titanium Module project. If all the files are not there try refreshing your explorer within the app explorer (right click-&gt; refresh)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you follow all these steps then you should be in the clear I will look around to see again if this has come up before and if there is anything we are missing.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Carter. I installed and re-installed Ti, android, eclipse and Oracle java three times in the past week, but I&#39;ll gladly try it again if it means a chance at solving the bothersome issue. Just a couple of questions. 1. Are you suggesting deleting everything and starting from scratch? 2. When I install the Android SDK, it does not have a default path so I having been using c:\androidSDK. 3. I don&#39;t have the window&gt;preferences&gt;Titanium Studio&gt;Titanium as I mentioned in a previous post today. 4. I&#39;m not sure I understand what you mean by my &quot;explorer within the app explorer&quot;? Thanks again</p>

										<p><p>Sometimes the names are not the same from Mac to Windows though I am sure studio and Titanium Studio are synonymous in this case. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;uXYDyKk">This</a> is the app explorer, inside this tab group are the app explorer and project explorer. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;dcmRWda">This</a> is what your preferences window should look like, does it point to your SDK?</p>
<p>Also I recommend not having your SDK in the root folder of your hardrive. Instead create a folder called Development and place the SDK in there. </p>
<p>I asked before but never for a response, can you please confirm that you have all the SDKs AND the Google API installed? Please refer to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Installing+and+Updating+Android+SDK#InstallingandUpdatingAndroidSDK-SummaryofInstalledAndroidPackages">this</a> link.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

										<p><p>Carter. After all your help, I wish I could tell you I&#39;ve solved the problem, but not true. Same results.<br>Here are the steps I followed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Downloaded&#x2F;Installed Titanium Studio, used suggested path for Ti Studio and workspace</li>
<li>Checked for updates; one –NodeJS</li>
<li>Installed Android SDK, used C:\Ti Android Development\ directory</li>
<li>Installed Android SDK Manager Package &quot;Tools&quot; and &quot;Android 4.2&quot; with Google APIs.</li>
<li>Installed Eclipse Plugin&#x2F; JavaScript Development Tools selected.</li>
<li>Added &quot;%systemroot%, %systemroot&#x2F;system32&#x2F;wbem and %systemroot%\system32 in PATH</li>
</ol>
<p>Things I noticed, still didn&#39;t have a Titanium&gt;Titanium Studio selection or full module folder. Also, you mentioned &quot;Eclipse Java Dev Tools&quot;. My only choice was &quot;Eclipse Indigo&quot;. Lastly, after I deleted all files associated with Ti Studio and sdk via &quot;uninstall.exe&quot; and then reinstalled it, I noticed that the TitaniumStudio.exe was dated June, not today. Don&#39;t know if that&#39;s an issue or not.<br>I don&#39;t know what else there is to do. I&#39;ve been working on this off and on for two months. It shouldn&#39;t be this difficult. Perhaps back to Java or maybe Phonegap. I initially selected Appecelerator because both iPhone and Android could both be created. I guess I will try the procedure once more. You can view a screen shot of the &quot;windows&#x2F;preferences&quot; screen and the module project explorer screen of the project I tried to create at www.cyberwurks.net&#x2F;transfer&#x2F;Ti Studio screen shots.docx. Thanks for your help.</p>

										<p><p>I was finally able to create a full-folder Ti module project, but I don&#39;t know why. The only thing I changed from when this process was unsuccessful was an install of the Android ADK for java development, which included java tools, eclipse and android sdk.  However, I still don&#39;t see the correct choices under windows&#x2F;preferences, but perhaps I can proceed with adding my .jar file to the project and start using the functionality in my main project. Any comments ?</p>

										<p><p>I have added my .jar file to the module project, modified the .classpath file accordingly and added require (themoduleprojectname) to my main project. However,when downloaded into the Android phone, it says it cannot find the module project file. Any ideas as to what I&#39;m missing.? Thanks for the help.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the information Carter.<br>I&#39;ve seen the document you mentioned before but I had questions then as I do now because it differs from other documents on the subject. First of all, the .jar file is assumed to be in a .zip file (some other documents do the same, but the majority just refer to the .jar file) by the document. Secondly, it shows that TWO require statements are needed like this:</p>
<p>var Module = require(&#39;$MODULE_ID&#39;);</p>
<p>&#x2F;&#x2F; For example, to load the greystripe module:</p>
<p>var greystripe = require(&#39;ti.greystripe&#39;);</p>
<p>All other documents on the subject indicate that one require file is needed (one that &quot;requires&quot; the module project. Any help with this would be appreciated.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks again Carter. Unfortunately I still haven&#39;t solved the riddle! First, the document you referenced talks about a module.zip file which I don&#39;t have. Secondly, I don&#39;t know why the example change to tiapp.xml shows two &#39;require&#39; statements as follows:</p>
<p>var Module = require(&#39;$MODULE_ID&#39;);</p>
<p>&#x2F;&#x2F; For example, to load the greystripe module:</p>
<p>var greystripe = require(&#39;ti.greystripe&#39;);</p>
<p>The one I&#39;m familiar with is the module_id entry. But why the &quot;ti.greystripe&#39; which is a file or a module or what? I added this to my tiapp.xml file:</p>
<p>&lt;modules&gt;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">module</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">version</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"1.0"</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">platform</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"android"</span>&gt;</span>                         

net.cyberwurks.mod30<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">module</span>&gt;</span>

<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">modules</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>where net.cyberwurks.mod30 is my module project&#39;s ID.  But when I load my program to the device, I still get the same &quot;can&#39;t find net.cyberwurks.mod30 file&quot; error.</p>
<p>I think I&#39;m very close with this. A little more help would really be appreciated. Thanks in advance. Hope you are having a nice weekend.</p>
