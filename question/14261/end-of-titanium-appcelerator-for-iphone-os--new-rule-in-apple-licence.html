			<p>3.3.1 Applications may only use Documented APIs in the manner prescribed by Apple and must not use or call any private APIs. Applications must be originally written in Objective-C, C, C++, or JavaScript as executed by the iPhone OS WebKit engine, and only code written in C, C++, and Objective-C may compile and directly link against the Documented APIs (e.g., Applications that link to Documented APIs through an intermediary translation or compatibility layer or tool are prohibited).</p>
<p>Does that mean its no longer possible to use Titanium?</p>

							<p>From Jeff Haynie&#39;s blog:<br>&quot;Titanium takes your Javascript Titanium API code usage and builds what we call an inverse symbol dependency matrix. Simply put it allows us to resolve all the APIs being used into a set of native symbols (slightly different between platforms, but in iPhone this is a object file). These symbols boil down to compile code that only matches the code your application needs and only those dependencies that you’re using in your application. Once we do this, we generate a bunch of Objective-C code from your code, take those symbols and then shove them into GCC to have him produce the final native application — as if you could have hand written the Objective-C code yourself… But highly optimized. Got it?&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m no genius (or lawyer) but it seems to me that the compiled code from a Titanium project is Obj-C.</p>

							<p>I hope Appcelerator has already talked to Apple about this item. I think we&#39;re OK though, right?  We&#39;re writing in Javascript executed by the WebKit engine, no?</p>

							<p>I guess the key phrase is:  &quot;Applications must be originally written in Objective-C, C, C++…&quot;  So technically, Titanium may not follow the law.  But then again, what does originally really mean?  Would using a code generator violate this?</p>
<p>I seriously doubt this is going to be a problem for Titanium.</p>

							<p>for those interested, this is the corresponding part of the agreement in the &quot;old&quot; sdk 3.2:</p>
<p>3.3.1    Applications may only use Documented APIs in the manner prescribed by Apple and must not use or call any private APIs.<br>3.3.2    An Application may not itself install or launch other executable code by any means, including without limitation through the use of a plug-in architecture, calling other frameworks, other APIs or otherwise. No interpreted code may be downloaded or used in an Application except for code that is interpreted and run by Apple&#39;s Documented APIs and built-in interpreter(s).</p>
<p>for me it seems that this was changed on purpose …</p>

							<p>Clint, is seems that Adobe uses the similar scheme as Titanium, aren&#39;t they? But instead of JS they use AS…</p>

							<p>As I understand Titanium, it bridges JavaScript directly to Apple APIs… circumventing the WebKit engine. So this is a nogo according to latest Apple directives. </p>
<p>It&#39;s a real shame that Apple excludes developers who are coding&#x2F;wanting to code in JavaScript - and at purpose not care wether WebKit or a direct bridge is involved executing their code. Stability&#x2F;Quality issues are the same compared to coding in C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;ObjectiveC.</p>
<p>Maybe they do not have the infrastructure to handle the amount of apps which would be submitted if technologies like Titanium&#x2F;PhoneGap etc. were allowed.</p>
