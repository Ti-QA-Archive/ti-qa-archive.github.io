			<h1>Android app not installing on Emulator - Anyone able to advise?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been working with Titanium for a while now, on iOS exclusively, but need some guidance on getting my app to launch in the Android emulator.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve got the latest Google&#x2F;Android SDK&#39;s all installed correctly, along with the latest version of Studio and the up to date v3.0 SDK.</p>
<p>Now, running iOS apps has never been an issue on my Mac, but when it comes to running an Android one in the emulator mode, all it does is take a while to build the app, launches the emulator but it just sits on the lock screen, if I open it up manually, no app has installed.</p>
<p>Can anyone give me a real simple breakdown of how to set this up correctly?</p>
<p>I&#39;m using the same code for an iOS app I&#39;ve already written, I just want to be able to publish it on the Google Play store too (with some obvious changes).</p>
<p>Anyone able to help?</p>
<p>Simon</p>

							<p>Check the contents of the build.log file that should have been created in your project folder. It may give some more clues to help us</p>

							<p>I Also faced this issue when upgraded to 3.0, but I deleted my previous emulator and created new one with a fresh app, so it resolved my problem.</p>
<p>though it was a test only, as till then I am not working on android app, but just thought that it may resolve your problem as well so try this.</p>
