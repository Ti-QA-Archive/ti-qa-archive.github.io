			<h1>Installed Alloy - No App will run in Android Emulator</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m on a Mac OSX 10.7.5. While working earlier today I allowed the install or update of Alloy as it flashed across the bottom of my screen notifying me one was available. Immediately following none of my Android apps will run in the emulator. I&#39;ve tried just about every SDK &#x2F; API combination and nothing works. They all end with:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[<span class="hljs-link_label">INFO</span>][<span class="hljs-link_reference">PackageManager(   60)</span>] No secure containers on sdcard

</code></pre><p>How can I uninstall the Alloy update and undo whatever was done?</p>
<p>Any help would be great! Thanks.</p>

							<p>Though the alloy update coincided with the problem, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s actually associated with alloy. It looks to be a configuration issue or corruption of your android emulator. </p>
<p>Are you able to get the android emulator running at all? You may want to delete the emulator you use for titanium apps (they will have a &quot;titanium&quot; prefix) from the AVD listing by manually running <code>android avd</code> then delete it from the list and let TiStudio create a new one for you when you attempt to run your android app again. Or you can target a different emulator, if you have more than one, by going to <strong>Run</strong> -&gt; <strong>Run Configurations…</strong>. In there, expand the list under <strong>Titanium Android Emulator</strong> in the left pane. Select your app and in the right pane select a different google API, click &quot;apply&quot;, and then &quot;run&quot;. This should attempt to launch your app in a new emulator.</p>

										<p><p>You may even want to start simpler by killing the emulator and restarting the adb server</p>

										<p><p>Yes, the emulator launches. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve deleted the emulators and re-launched. I still get the same messages as shown above. The emulator process continues to end at [INFO][Launcher.Model(  120)] not binding apps: no Launcher activity.</p>
<p>Here is a scenario&#x2F;question: I&#39;ve been rebuilding the app by creating a fresh app in TI and then adding all my other data to it, little by little. I&#39;ve managed to add everything except my android folder with my android-sized images. When I add that to the project, it fails. I was not doing any work here when the emulator started to fail. Is it possible that I&#39;ve hit some sort of size constraint?</p>

										<p><p>you may want to log this particular test case as a <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC">Titanium Community Jira ticket</a> so that the platform engineers can take a look, cause it seems to be a low-level android issue that is specific to your resources. For this reason, be sure to include a test case, with resources, that reproduces your error. Also make sure to include the versions of the TiSDK, TiStudio, and Android SDk that you are using.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, Tony. Just for my own further troubleshooting, I&#39;m adding images back in little by little and having success. Unless there is a corrupt image in here it looks to me like it is coming down to a size issue. Of course that&#39;s all speculation thought. Anyway, I will put a link to the Jira ticket here before I lock the question. Thanks again.</p>
