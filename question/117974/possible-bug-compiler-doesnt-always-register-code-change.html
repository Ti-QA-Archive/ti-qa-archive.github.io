			<h1>Possible bug. Compiler doesn&#39;t always register code change</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello. I discovered a possible bug with the compiler. I saved some changes to my app, but the compiler ran my old code.</p>
<p>I&#39;m running with Titanium SDK 1.6.1 and Android SDK APIs 2.3.</p>
<p>Details:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I had a tableView, with one tableViewSection, with 5 textFields, each inside a tableViewRows.<br>The emulator showed the five rows.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I then changed so that I would have two tableViewSections, each with one textField inside a tableViewRow. (I also changed the text in the textfields.)<br>The emulator still showed the earlier five rows with the same old text.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I made some further changes, and still the emulator showed the same five rows.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I then discovered that I had forgotten to add the second tableViewSection to the tableView&#39;s data field (this means that I should have gotten one row earlier). I corrected this, and still got the same five rows.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I then changed the text in the two textFields.<br>Now the emulator showed correctly only the two rows.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I then undid the changes to the two textfields so that the code was exactly the same as in step 4.<br>The emulator showed the two correct rows.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I tried to reproduce this, but the emulator showed the correct rows.</p>
<p>The only alternative to a bug that I can see, is that I didn&#39;t save once between step 1 and 5. However, I&#39;m certain that I saved between each step.</p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid the only way that a bug can be made official is if the behavior it causes can be reliably reproduced with a usecase. Otherwise, the core developers will have no way to confirm that their subsequent fix actually resolves the bug.</p>
<p>A usecase is a self-contained piece of code that demonstrates the bug in the <strong>least possible</strong> number of lines and that runs <strong>without modification</strong> when pasted into an empty <code>app.js</code>. You can read more about this subject in the official documentation, under the section <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Contributing+to+Titanium#ContributingtoTitanium-CreatingGoodUsecases">Creating Good Use-cases</a>.</p>
<p>Note that, if the code is long, you may want to create a <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;">Git Gist</a> or <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;">pastebin</a> rather than paste the code here directly.</p>
<p>I will check this thread later and test your usecase on my system, after which we can raise a ticket.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

										<p><p>Tanks for the reply.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t been able to reproduce the bug.</p>
<p>I have experienced similar behaviour earlier (such as replacing a line of code with an identical line and then getting the program to work), but I didn&#39;t think much about it then.</p>
