			<h1>Can&#39;t publish app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I updated Titanium Studio to the new Appcelerator studio and I selected the &quot;Indie&quot; plan (which is free for me).<br>When I try to publish my Android app I see the &quot;Plan&quot; page and I can&#39;t do nothing.</p>
<p>I have installed the new version of SDK (4.0) and selected it in the tiapp.xml file. I tried to reinstall the entire app, including JDK and Android SDK.</p>
<p>What should I do for publishing? Should I rewrite the app in another framework and leave titanium forever?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>I also had the same issue, and have also thought about leaving Titanium (and made my thoughts clear to the client), but it&#39;s a hassle at the moment, so eventually I was able to resolve it. What I did was:</p>
<ol>
<li>We &quot;invited&quot; members, despite being told that we will be on the Indie plan, are actually on the Development plan, which does not allow publishing the app, but we can upgrade to Indie plan for free. To do that: <ul>
<li>Go to platform.appcelerator.com and login into your account.</li>
<li>In the drop down menu on the top right, where your name is, choose Manage Billing</li>
<li>In the window that opens, click on Change Plan and click &quot;Choose This Plan&quot; on the Indie plan.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, I would try to see if you can publish your app, but if you still can&#39;t…:</p>
<ol>
<li>Apparently, the link to the Appcelerator Studio on their website links to a &quot;wrong version&quot;. Go to http:&#x2F;&#x2F;preview.appcelerator.com&#x2F;appc-studio&#x2F; and download from there. I downloaded the Release Candidate and then was able to publish.</li>
</ol>
<p>Good luck.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t answer if you should stay with Titanium&#x2F;Appcelerator though. I know I would feel uncomfortable recommending it to new clients (it&#39;s up to my current clients to decide what they want to do).</p>

										<p><p>Hi Golan,<br>I have similar problem with publishing to Google Play Store, Appcelerator Studio always opens Plans website, even if I&#39;m currently on Indie plan. If I right click on my project and choose Publish, modal window opens so I enter all necessary data and click Publish, modal windows closes and nothing happens. Please can you help me? Thank you.
