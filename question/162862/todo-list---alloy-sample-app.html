			<h1>Todo List - Alloy sample app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, I&#39;m trying to understand alloy. I look at the Todo List sample app and I wonder: if the app is made as a sample, why is it not build to be easy to understand? They use &#39;todo&#39; so many times in the app that I don&#39;t understand which one it came&#39;s from where. It could come from todo.js (controller filename), or is an arbitrary name established at createCollection, or it could come from collection_name in the model file… Can anyone change this words to distinct ones so it&#39;ll be easier to distinguish which is which? Put it beginner-friendly! Thanks! </p>
<p>For example, the line: Alloy.Collections.todo = Alloy.createCollection(&#39;todo&#39;); found in alloy.js. Where it came from the first &#39;todo&#39;? The second one, is it the name received at this moment?</p>

							<p>I suggest you take a step back and read the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Alloy_Concepts">Alloy Concepts</a> documentation.</p>
<p>The reason you see so many references to &#39;ToDo&#39; is that Alloy, like many other frameworks uses the notion of Convention Over Configuration.  Once you understand the convention, then the code becomes far easier to understand.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you. I haven&#39;t read that article until now. It&#39;s useful. </p>
<p>I understand the concept, Alloy uses the file and directory structure to establish the configuration. That&#39;s the thrill of Alloy: less coding and more magic behind the curtains.<br>But even so, they claim that alloy has a very steep learning curve, therefore it&#39;s easier for beginners. If they think of us too, they might change, for example, the todo.js model filename into todoMF.js (MF = Model File). So every time they have to refer to it, it appears as &#39;todoMF&#39;, a unique identifier. That way we can not get confused.</p>
<p>Also can be:  &quot;collection_name&quot; : &quot;todo_col&quot;, or var todoVar = createCollection(&#39;todoMF&#39;)&#x2F;(&#39;todo_col&#39;).. I&#39;m not even sure which one of this two is…for that reason….</p>

										<p><p>And if we added &quot;MF&quot; to the end of all model files, how would people know what that meant? By reading the documentation. I highly suggest that instead of suggesting arbitrary naming conventions that you keep reading the rest of the Alloy documentation, particularly the sections on models. It will become much more clear.</p>
<p>After that, we&#39;d be happy to answer any specific questions you have.</p>
