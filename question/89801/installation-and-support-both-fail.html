		<section>
			<p>Your rubric asks me to be kind and thoughtful in posting my question. I&#39;m thoughtful, but see no reason to be particularly kind.</p>
<p>You have banked several hundred dollars of my money, and despite carefully following your (now out-of-date) documentation and verifying paths, android list etc, <strong>I cannot get a working install on Windows 7 64-bit</strong>.<br>And when I search this forum for help I don&#39;t find anything useful. What I do find is unresolved questions from others who are similarly frustrated. Just what are you doing with the 9 mil?</p>
<p>On XP (after a lot of frustration) I had a working install.</p>
<p>After installing on Win7, when I try to open the Kitchen Sink I just get &quot;Loading…&quot;, as several others have reported. No definitive fix that I can find in this forum (I don&#39;t have a week free for an exhaustive search).</p>
<p>On Dec 14 you emailed me that </p>
<p>&gt;Titanium Mobile 1.5 is here with lots of great new features and improvements. Android support is greatly expanded, and you&#39;ll find new features, performance and quality improvements throughout.</p>
<p>I thought maybe you had made some fixes, so I installed it. I then tried to create a new project, as per http:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;GettingStartedTitanium_Windows.pdf but this errored with &quot;No android-4 or android-1.6 in the Android SDK&quot;. True enough, but whose fault is that? Mine? So I ran the SDKSetup, which prompted me to install release 8 (rather than what was missing), and this errored with &quot;Failed to rename directory…&quot;, although the only application running was the SDKSetup and I had (as requested) switched off my anti-virus (Kaspersky).</p>
<p>I have little confidence that an environment so brittle can be a safe platform for development, but I might be reassured if </p>
<ul>
<li><p>your team could come up with an install procedure and development environment that isn&#39;t littered with confusing version numbers and registry hacks (y&#39;know, like everyone else) which WORKS</p>
</li>
<li><p>your documentation matched</p>
</li>
<li><p>this forum was a place I could come and actually find useful assistance. (Bleating that &quot;we work our asses off, jeff works Sundays&quot; [http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;38831&#x2F;dont-download-appcelerator] does NOT fix the problems. It exposes that you&#39;re overstretched.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please <em>at least</em> produce an up-to-date, <em>tested</em> install&#x2F;get started guide for Win7. If developers can&#39;t get started, the rest doesn&#39;t matter.</p>
<p>And please don&#39;t suggest that I should renew my Pro subscription to get better support - that is, just to get a working install.</p>

							<p>Good clear post of your problems, it baffles me that even after the premium support didn&#39;t help you at all.</p>
<p>I find this very concerning indeed, I&#39;ve been having issues too with development stuff and bugs, but that&#39;s a whole point later in problems and can mostly be solved through users.</p>
<p>Now i&#39;ve seen this whole win7 64-bit problem arise a lot on the forums and I will see if I can install it on my Computers when I get home just to try and see if we can figure this out together (i&#39;m at work atm, using an mac) i will try it later today (which for me is in 9 hours (travel time included)).</p>
<p>If you can and if it&#39;s no big hassle, what exactly is the problem youre experiencing, does it error straight away?<br>is the install canceled at some point during installation.<br>I ask because if I don&#39;t get errors, maybe I can reconstruct the error then and look for fixes</p>
<p>Now i&#39;m no way related to Appcelerator as a dev, and do agree on alot of points you present here.<br>But I do feel like I should help people here, seeing as help is already hard to come by, and as you paid for help and didn&#39;t even fix it.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,<br>Patrick van Zadel</p>

							<p>Thanks Patrick</p>
<p>May not pursue this diligently now: after posting retired to duvet with flu symptoms.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know what versions of what are required for an up-to-date Win7-64 install. If they&#39;d tell us that&#39;d be a start. Then I could uninstall everything and try again. Without that knowledge and in my current state I&#39;m not going to try.</p>
<p>Long live your generosity.</p>

<p>I can sympathise with the frustration, but bear in mind that Titanium unavoidably relies on a number of third party components, so it is quite a complex setup.</p>
<p>When you were getting this error, &quot;No android-4 or android-1.6 in the Android SDK&quot;, you were most likely choosing the old Android SDK (1.6).  You should choose 2.2 (2.3 is not yet supported), as in this screenshot:</p>
<p><img src="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;assets&#x2F;images&#x2F;guides&#x2F;start_here&#x2F;troubleshooting-missing-options-normal.png" alt="screenshot">.</p>
<p>Regarding the &quot;loading…&quot; menus, ensure that your Android SDK path is set correctly on the profile page, for example:</p>
<p><img src="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;98ryL.png" alt="screenshot"></p>
<p>You can often deduce what is going wrong with an installation by recognising the hints that Titanium Developer gives, but you have to try to understand the mechanics of how it works.  Try the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;troubleshooting_your_installation.html">Troubleshooting Your Installation</a> which gives a better insight.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

							<p>I just tried to install it on windows 7 in Boot Camp on the mac (which isnt really a good reference because of the environment its running on).</p>
<p>The Titanium Install went fine, afterwards I had to install Java so Android SDK could run (which didnt work with the 64 bit Java client, uninstalled that and installed x86 Java SE SDK) and then the Android SDK did want to install.</p>
<p>Android SDK Installed, created a Virtual Device.</p>
<p>Had the same android error, also did what Hal just noted I specifically told Titanium to use 2.2 or 2.3 and still got the same error.</p>
<p>I&#39;m still gonna try it at home on a real Windows Computer, where the Android SDK is already installed and working but that is only possible later today.</p>
<p>(both windows running 64 bit)</p>

							<p>Since you&#39;re paying support customer, I think at this stage someone in Appcelerator who knows Windows 7 should be getting onto your machine in a remote control session and having a look. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;join.me would be a good start.</p>

							<p>This is going to sound completely off the wall, but what Python install do you have? I had this similar &quot;Loading…&quot; issue previously (with the Blackberry preview) and it occurred with Python 2.6, but not Python 2.5. I was told by Appcelerator that Titanium should work fine with Python 2.6, but so far, with Windows 7 (32-bit though) I haven&#39;t been able to get them to play nice.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Tony,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve emailed community@… and am waiting for a reply.</p>
<p>Tell me, if the documents I&#39;m referencing are &quot;woefully out of date&quot;, why are they still accessible? If they need to be kept available, why do they not contain a prominent announcement that they&#39;re obsolete, with links to the current versions?</p>
<p>It&#39;s clear that many people stub their toes trying to find the &#39;right&#39; versions of various components. You guys must know what these are. So why on earth don&#39;t you publish a compatibility matrix? (And better, also build parts of it into your software so that the SDK&#x2F;AVD Manager checks for working configs… y&#39;know, like yum?)</p>

							<p>I think he shouldn&#39;t have had to pay for premium in the first place.</p>
<p>An application which advertises to work on practically All Operating systems should work anyway.<br>It&#39;s already a bad thing that he dit pay for the support and didn&#39;t get further.</p>
<p>if in any case, he should get his money back…<br>But that&#39;s my opinion.</p>
<p>As for the real problem, it seems that alot of things could be the issue.<br>Will still try to install this later tonight…</p>

										<p><p>@Patrick van Zadel The user in question did in fact pay for premium support, however it doesn&#39;t appear as though he entered any type of support ticket for any issues that he was having. I&#39;m awaiting confirmation from the user in regards to that but we can&#39;t be expected to respond to issues that we haven&#39;t been notified of. We are going to make this right by him though.</p>

										<p><p>Ok, As i said it was my opninion and I do haven&#39;t a clue how the actual process had been going between the 2 parties.</p>
<p>But then again, this problem seems to be rising on the Q&amp;A numerous of times, and mostly all of them haven&#39;t either been anwsered at all or people didn&#39;t get further.<br>I&#39;d say its a serious issue for most people and should be handled with more priority.</p>
<p>I know appcelerator is busy and is making alot of progress in short times but even with that you guys are losing alot of customers in these couple of months were promised stuff were delayed for more then 6 months.<br>As I said in a different topic I still think you guys should make the marketplace available now.<br>This will make youre problems alot less…</p>

							<p>I definitely understand, you have to be really stubborn and persistent to get through all of the hurdles setting things up in the beginning. And even after that, it still isn&#39;t easy because there may be 10 ways to do something that should work according to the API but only 1 or 2 out of the 10 will actually work (1.5 improves this a little.)</p>
<p>That being said, I&#39;m running android simulator fine on Windows 7 x64 so it&#39;s definitely possible. You have to follow the steps in the getting started for windows PDF exactly, if you didn&#39;t install things in that order then I would uninstall and try again. APIs 1.6 definitely isn&#39;t the issue (if you have it installed), as I switch back and forth between 1.6 and 2.2 all the time.</p>
<p>It will take some time and persistence, but think about the benefit: one code base that compiles into native android, iphone, and blackberry apps. In my opinion, that is worth putting in the time…</p>

							<p>To come back on that promiss.</p>
<p>I installed it on my Windows 7 64 bit, had the android SDK installed and updated.<br>Did a instal of titanium (wasn&#39;t ever installed before) And the program runs fine it finds the Android SDK and can Compile and test apps.</p>
<p>So it&#39;s a rather strange problem which must be depending on different software or hardware.</p>
<p>(my Pc is a 2.94 GHz Quad-Core, 8GB Ram) if you want the full specs let me know I&#39;ll list them when I&#39;m home again</p>
