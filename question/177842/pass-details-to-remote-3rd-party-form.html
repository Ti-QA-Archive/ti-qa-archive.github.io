			<h1>Pass Details to Remote 3rd Party Form</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey folks,</p>
<p>I&#39;m doing some research on trying to pass data to a form. What I am hoping to do is pass some data from my app into a remote webpage that I don&#39;t control. The remote page is a third party booking form which I would like to prefill with some of the users data stored in the app.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve looked into EvalJS a bit and from my research I can&#39;t see any reference to this being possible. I was hoping someone could maybe throw some light if this can be done either using EvalJS or some other way. If its can&#39;t be done the use can just add their own data but it would improve the user experience if possible.</p>
<p>All suggestion and help appreciated.</p>

							<p>I see here ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use a server side component -  your app sends to your server and this sends to the 3rd part webpage</li>
<li>Do it in the app</li>
</ol>
<p>Both solutions would send the same data  the form sends to the <strong>action</strong> url of it and respecting the method and params naming.<br>Then the resulting page would be parsed (scrapped) for the information you want to get from it, like &quot;success&quot; or &quot;error&quot; etc.</p>
<p>I&#39;d do it servers side because if anything changes in the webpage you cannot udpdate yours fast enough, while the server side can be done very quick.<br>Another aspect is that it&#39;s way easier to parse a webpage on a server - there are already modules to do this in different languages - than to do it in Ti.</p>

										<p><p>Cheers Dan, </p>
<p>Using the my server does sound like the best solution as any change to the 3rd form could potentially stop the app from working.</p>
