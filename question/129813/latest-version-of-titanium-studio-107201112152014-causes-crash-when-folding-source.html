			<p>If you fold source code at all levels it causes the Titanium Studio to lock up.  Have uninstalled and reinstalled and tried it on different pieces of source code.  ugh.  worked fine until i updated today</p>

										<p><p>This is a really frustrating issue.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t have a specific repro yet, but I&#39;ll share whatever details I come up with. What I have so far is:</p>
<ul>
<li>the freeze happens not just by folding all your code, but can happen when just folding one code block</li>
<li>it only happens if you fold or unfold a block of code</li>
<li>it sometimes occurs when scrolling through code <em>after</em> folding a block somewhere</li>
<li>it may have something to do with how you format your code blocks; it seems to happen often when I have blank lines in a function, and I fold the function; however, this is not a reliable repro.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m using Studio 1.0.7.201112152014 on OSX 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard).</p>
<p>I&#39;ll post more when I get more certain details.</p>

										<p><p>You are correct. Even folding one chunk of code and scrolling to the bottom is enough to crash.  It seems that if the code is only 100 lines or so it doesn&#39;t cause the problem. But if you start getting closer to 1000 lines of code it happens for sure. You can take any bit of code and repeat it a bunch of times to reproduce. I am wondering if it has something to do with code that has block comments within a function.  In the meantime, as a workaround I have reinstalled 1.0.6. That is working fine!</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m in the same boat.  Have one particular file that will freeze 1.0.7 every time.  I&#39;ll go look at the ticket to see if I can contribute, Ingo.  Is there a way to send you the source file privately as it contains IP?</p>

										<p><p>Our file in question is 1363 lines.  If folding is disabled, then I can scroll through the file, edit, save, etc.</p>
<p>If folding is enabled, can scroll to the bottom of the file, but as soon as something is folded or unfolded (depending on the state set in Titanium Studio&#x2F;Editor&#x2F;Javascript settings) the editor window for the file freezes.  I cannot open any other editor.  I can perform git commands, enter preferences, make changes.  I just can&#39;t edit anything.</p>

										<p><p>We haven&#39;t seen that exact issue, though it&#39;s possible (the fix for the freeze was related to line number painting). Do you have steps to recreate the issue?</p>
