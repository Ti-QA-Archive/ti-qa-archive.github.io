			<h1>Distributing your IOS mobile app to Testers (via TestFlight)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve learned A LOT about using Titanium over the past two months here in the Q&amp;A and thought I&#39;d write a quick guide to help out others with something I learned to do and noticed there was not much information available.</p>
<p>This guide focuses on the process using Testflight to get your app into the hands of testers. </p>
<p>Disclaimer: I am in no way associated with Testflight, I just love their product and will always support those that come up with innovative solutions to real problems.</p>
<p>To send the app to a user.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Invite a team member</p>
</li>
<li><p>Once they get the invite they will need to click on the link in the email on their iphone&#x2F;ipod touch or ipad. </p>
</li>
<li><p>TestFlightApp.com - You will see them show up as a teammate. You can then click on their name and copy their Device ID and paste it into the Device ID section in the Apple IOS Provisioning Portal. You MUST still add their device ID  there in order for this to work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Apple IOS Provisioning Portal - Add the new device to the App provisioning profile.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Download the new App provisioning profile with the device you just added and load it into Titanium.</p>
</li>
<li><p>DELETE all files in your &#x2F;build&#x2F;iphone directory and rebuild your app with the new provisioning profile.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Upload your apps IPA file to TestFlight</p>
</li>
<li><p>Follow the directions to distribute the app.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The important thing to remember is that your app must be built with the Device ID embedded in the provisioning profile, otherwise TestFlight will not allow that device to install the app.</p>

							<div><p>i have a question.. if i have 100 testers, does that mean I have to re-build 100 times and have different build for each user? i thought the whole point is to simplify the process and that I don&#39;t have to rebuild for each user. forgive me if this is a dumb question as I am not experienced in iOS dev.</p>

										<p><p>Honestly, I haven&#39;t looked into any distribution applications for android as I&#39;m working on an app that is targeting IOS only. Hopefully someone else knows.</p>

										<p><p>great guide - thanks for posting this. Testflight is very impressive in it&#39;s simplicity and ease of use.  It just works and it simplifies what is a very painful process otherwise.</p>

										<p><p>for Android, you just need to create the APK file and put it up on any website.. from android, the user can click on the APK and it will download and install automatically.. testflight is only a work-around for appstore and iTunes.</p>
