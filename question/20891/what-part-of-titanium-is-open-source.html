			<p>I understand that something gets sent to a server when you build an iPhone app.  Since the SDK asks for your user id and password, I guess this is happening.  So what happens on the server, and what happens in the SDK?  Why do our apps get sent to the server, or am I confused?</p>

							<p>For developing mobile apps I&#39;m assuming no data is being sent when you build the app, but unfortunately Titanium Developer is set up to try and log in on startup, so if their servers go down we are no longer able to develop our projects. I assume we can&#39;t do development on a plane or other place without internet access either, which is pretty annoying.</p>

							<p>Damien - hehe, no.<br>Why not plug out your network and test it.<br>You can start titanium. (Display: You are offline)<br>Open your project.<br>Open your editor.<br>Scribble in your error-loaded javascript code.<br>Start the android emulator.<br>And debug your app.<br>Good luck,<br>rudolf</p>

							<p>Titanium is not really open source. If you look through the source code you will find some pages of source code that say they cannot be changed without express permission from appcelerator. That tells you that its not really open source.Open source is defined that you can take the source code and do with it what you want but may never charge for it. FOSS is investigating this to see if it falls in with open source guidelines.</p>

										<p><p>Heh, that&#39;s a pretty wrong statement. &quot;Open source is defined that you can take the source code and do with it what you want but may never charge for it.&quot; ;&gt;</p>
<p>Hopefully in the months since you posted that, you&#39;ve gotten your head around it more. :)</p>

							<p>r b: that&#39;s good to hear. Last time Appcelerator&#39;s servers were having problems, I was unable to access my projects as it asked me to log in. I did not try unplugging the cable, though I wonder if that would work from a logged-out state.</p>
<p>Sherman: can you point to a particular file?</p>
