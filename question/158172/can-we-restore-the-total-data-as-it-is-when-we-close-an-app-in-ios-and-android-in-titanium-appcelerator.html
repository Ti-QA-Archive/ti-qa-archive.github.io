							<p>you didn&#39;t mentioned which platform you are working on ? android ? ios ? </p>
<p>for Android .. you can listen to the application back button on your top-level activity ( main window ) and then you can save the whole data you want by using <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Working_with_a_SQLite_Database">SQLite DB</a> or using <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Filesystem_Access_and_Storage">Filesystem</a> and save the data as json text in case it&#39;s small amount of data<br>and when the app open you can check if there is a file or records in db so you can restore them </p>
<p>on iOS you can listen to the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.App-event-resumed">resumed</a> &#x2F; <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.App-event-paused">paused</a> events but be-aware they may not fire if the game interrupted by notifications or phone calls</p>

<p>Be sure to mail him <strong>CASH</strong> as well. Once you leave the Q&amp;A you need to see it as a business relationship, not a &#39;beggar on a street corner&#39; relationship.</p>
