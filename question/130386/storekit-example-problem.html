			<h1>Storekit Example Problem</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve installed storekit module 1.3 and am using Studio Version: 1.0.7.201112281340 and SDK Version: 1.8.0.1. I am attempting to use the example provided with the module.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve configured in-app purchases in itunes connect, created a provisioning profile with all of my devices, created a test user, and created test products.  Ran in the simulator once, as directed.</p>
<p>But, when I open my app.xcodeproj in xcode and change the scheme to app.IOS device (as directed), I always get the message &quot;No provisioned iOS devices are available. Connect an iOS device or choose an iOS simulator as the destination.&quot;  My provisioning profile is definitely associated with several IOS devices and one of them is connected via USB.</p>
<p>I would greatly appreciated any assistance available …</p>

							<p>are you using ios5 simulator?<br>if yes, you dont need the xcode mess. ios5 simulator can work with storekit! </p>
<p>so.. if you can use your provisioning profile in titanium (when you build to device).. then it will be OK.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you!  I was using ios 4.3 and upon installing ios 5.0 I can run from the simulator now. I&#39;m having problems with my product IDs still, but have gotten much further.  </p>
<p>My provisioning profile is having problems, so I&#39;m going to re-create that.<br>How far can I go with the ios 5.0 simulator?  Should I be able to make purchases?  I noticed that it is pointing to the &quot;sandbox&quot; environment. The Ti docs said that the simulator points to &quot;Live&quot; environment, but maybe that is out of date and applies to the ios 4.3 simulator.</p>
<p>Thanks again …</p>

										<p><p>yes, you can test the whole process in simulator! (and i think, in simulator dont need prov. profile, just make sure bundle id is correct)</p>
<p>if you use the sample app, i think there is a bug in it. </p>
<p>checkprudoct method.. or something like this:</p>
<p>it use evt.invalid in if statement, but it always true. you should use evt.invalid[0]. or just write the evt object out before the if statement, so you can check the whole object.</p>

										<p><p>I am now getting the error message shown above.  Tried 3 different versions of the SDK, but the problem continues.  I am using storekit 1.4 and don&#39;t have 1.3 available any longer.</p>

										<p><p>This morning, both of my projects using storekit 1.4 are working again. Perhaps this was a problem with iTunes connect or something. I&#39;ve seen this behavior occur several times, where it works, doesn&#39;t work and issues error messages, and doesn&#39;t work but w&#x2F;o an error message. This has happened without my changing any code.  I hope this doesn&#39;t happen in production.</p>

										<p><p>Sample code from Storekit module –&gt; app.js works. Here are the items to be wary about (to avoid getting invalid product errors) for others to save time:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The name of the in app product ie. the product id should be applicationid.productid example: com.aurus.sampleapplication.sampleinappproduct</p>
</li>
<li><p>Remember to fill in your bank details and get your contract on itunes connect before attempting the example</p>
