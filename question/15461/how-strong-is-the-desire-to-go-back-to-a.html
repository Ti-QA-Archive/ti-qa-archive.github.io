			<p>… CLASSIC FORUM. (Sorry, my title got cut).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve noticed that a fair amount of people say they don&#39;t like the style of Q&amp;A forum here – i.e., the &quot;stackoverflow&quot; style as opposed to the old, &quot;classic&quot; style.</p>
<p>Of course, it could be that loads and loads of people are absolutely thrilled with this current format, but we don&#39;t hear from them since they are pleased with the status quo.</p>
<p>As there is no way to put a poll up here, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;suchfuncoding.com&#x2F;102">I put one at my website</a> if anyone cares to vote on it.  Totally unscientific, of course, but I&#39;m interested nonetheless.</p>

							<p>I am actually working on this as we speak!<br>I have noticed the frustration of some users here, as well as my own, so i have taken it upon myself to set something up.</p>
<p>It is based on Vanilla (www.getvanilla.com) and i am looking into setting up syntax highlighters and the like so that it can be used properly without looking a mess.</p>
<p>I could be mad for taking this on but i think the community needs it! I don&#39;t want to take away any credit from the Appcelerator boys, because after all they are doing a fantastic job, but the users seem to crying out for a standard forum.</p>
<p>A standard forum would also allow for discussion, whereas on here its more structured for Q&amp;A.<br>I am open to thoughts and feedback on this, we shall see what comes of it.</p>
<p>…await another post on here about this in the near future with a URL.</p>
<p>Cheers<br>Sam</p>
