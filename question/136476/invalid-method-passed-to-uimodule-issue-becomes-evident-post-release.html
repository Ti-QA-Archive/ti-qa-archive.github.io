			<h1>Invalid method passed to UIModule issue becomes evident post-release.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I submitted an app to Apple (the Android version works perfectly) which had been tested on a simulator and real device without issue and it passed review. When users launched the app after downloading from the appstore the splash screen appeared and nothing else. After connecting to Xcode and watching the logging I saw this error</p>

</code></pre><p>However when I install directly to a test device and monitor the console logging I see no such error. I&#39;ve seen similar posts with the &#39;Invalid method passed to UI&#39; error and people suggest a clean build, and this has worked for me in the past, but in this case I did submit a clean build. I believe a solution to this may be to make dummy UI calls in app.js rather than making the first call to a create function in an included file.</p>
<p>Can anyone verify the exact nature of this behavior (there doesn&#39;t seem to be full certainty in any posts I&#39;ve found), as there are other UI calls before the call to createTextField() which do not cause this issue. Also I&#39;ve seen similar behavior with createTabGroup() and createTab() before.  </p>
<p>Also is there any advice on what the best way to catch such an issue pre-submission is as there was no sign of it in dev….?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>p.s. I have not included code here as the behavior does not occur on test devices when installed attached to the computer, but will be happy to do so if somebody thinks it would help</p>

							<p>We test using Testflight, which essentially loads a production build onto the devices having passed through Xcode out to the Archives.  In the end, the only difference between our test binary and the one that gets uploaded is the cert that was used to sign it.</p>

										<p><p>Matthew,</p>
<p>I found a similar problem listed in the JIRA as <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-2600">TIMOB-2600</a> <em>(wickedly cool ticket number for us old schoolers)</em>. Take a look and see if that matches what you have experienced.  The ticket was closed due to incomplete information but the problem not be reproduced on 2.1.x.  You can create an account on the JIRA and add your data to the ticket if its the same problem.</p>
<p>Also missing from your question are a number of important pieces of information.  I&#39;d suggest you take a look at the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Using+Questions+and+Answers">Using Questions and Answers</a> article, specifically the Q&amp;A Question Checklist.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Stephen - test flight does what I would I need (and more) but essentially this is the same as sharing the archive form Xcode. I made the thoughtless assumption that the build that was deployed directly from Titanium onto my phone for testing was the same as the one that gets built and sent to Xcode. To resolve I include dummy calls to all Ti.UI.create* calls I make in the app in app.js and that works.</p>
