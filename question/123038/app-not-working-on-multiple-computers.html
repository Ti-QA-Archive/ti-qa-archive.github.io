			<h1>App not working on multiple computers</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have created an application and it works great. Compiles fine on Android and on iPhone. Ive tested it on multiple computers, compiled and it works fine.</p>
<p>When i send it off to my client, it fails. It just crashes at the beginning of the application. The beginning of the application downloads a number of &#39;assets&#39; from a website, but it just crashes on the clients computer. There running the same SDK as myself. We&#39;ve cleared and reset the iPhone simulator and erased the build directories, but no luck. Does anyone know where i should start to troubleshoot this? The emulator or Titanium dosent provide any useful debugging as to the crash! :(</p>

							<p>Have your client try to run it with the debugger and set a break point in the beginning of the app to see where exactly it fails. </p>
<p>Also have a look at the log files. Still not sure how to do that on iPhone, but for Android it&#39;s (Window =&gt; Show View =&gt; Other =&gt; Android =&gt; Logcat).</p>

										<p><p>Yes, it&#39;s in Titanium Studio. You can use it if you install the latest release (1.0.2).</p>
<p>This is how to do debugging:<br><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;#debugging">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;#debugging</a></p>

										<p><p>BTW, are the computers were the app runs fine on the same network? The cause of the crash could be a bug in the app when downloading assets, and then you got lucky that by testing on a different environment the bug was triggered. Of course, the debugger in Ti Studio could be of great help. Otherwise, you could post some code for us to see…</p>
