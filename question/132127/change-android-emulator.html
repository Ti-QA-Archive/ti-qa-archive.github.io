			<h1>Change Android emulator?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Why is it so difficult to use Android tools? :S</p>
<p>My app uses WebView and uses events in it (WebView.evalJS() and Ti.App.fireEvent())</p>
<p>On iOS it works, on Android it crashes and this <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;5253916&#x2F;why-does-the-webviewdemo-die">stack</a> says that it is 2.3 emulator bug.</p>
<p>My tiapp.xml is configured to use Google API 2.3.3.<br>I changed to use Google API 2.2 but the same error is showing and app crashes.<br>I am not sure if this is the place to change emulator or somewhere in ddms?</p>

							<p>The tiapp.xml is the api that it is compiled against, to change the emulator click the &quot;play&quot; button in TI Studio, then click Run Configurations.  From their choose the android emulator and you select the Android version (and screen form factor).</p>

										<p><p>Thanks.<br>It is confusing, it should be written there &quot;Emulator version&quot; not &quot;Android API&quot; like in tiapp.xml.</p>

							<p>Yes, that&#39;s the place. </p>
<p>IMO, emulator is buggy, I think it&#39;s better to use real device (although, debugging and fastdev can&#39;t be used on device yet). It&#39;s slower route, but much more stable.</p>

										<p><p>Tried it, but Frank&#39;s answer was correct. In tiapp.xml you change API version, but in Run Configurations you change Emulator version.</p>
<p>It is better on a device but I don&#39;t have now any so.. :(</p>

										<p><p>Ah, yeah, I misunderstood the question.</p>
<p>Device (even the cheapest one) is the best investment (tell that to your boss, except &quot;cheapest&quot; part :) ).</p>

										<p><p>Yeah, I know what you mean, I worked almost half a year using emulator (and I&#39;m developing app for tablet only :) ).</p>
<p>Development on device can be slow because of compilation step. To avoid re-compilation, something like this can be implemented: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;titaniumninja.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;10360108035&#x2F;titanium-hack-fastdev-for-ios&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;titaniumninja.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;10360108035&#x2F;titanium-hack-fastdev-for-ios&#x2F;</a> for Android devices. </p>
<p>I don&#39;t have much time and option currently to play with that, but it seems to me that should be relatively easy to implement. Are you maybe interested in help? :)</p>
