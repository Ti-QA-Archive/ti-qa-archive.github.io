			<p>Hello! My app is complete. I tested on the device and no problems. Then I ran the build with the button &quot;Distribute Apple itunes store&quot; of Appcelerator, and now my app is located in the archive of xcode, ok perfect. I created a description of the app and everything you need via itunes connect, and now my app is in a state of &quot;waiting for upload&quot;, ok perfect.</p>
<p>I open xcode, I go Organizers &#x2F; archive and my app is there. I press validate and I get this error: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;d.pr&#x2F;i&#x2F;dpfz">errore</a>, what can I do?</p>

							<p>Hi Nicolò</p>
<p>When you first started creating your app, you need a certificate otherwise it would not work.  You will have create a development certificate to achieve this.</p>
<p>Now you are ready to distribute your app, you need to create a different certificate - specifically to distribute, this allows your app to go through the app store and onto other peoples devices.</p>
<p>You create this in the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;">developer.apple.com</a> site, under the distributions certificate section once you have logged in.</p>
<p>Tip:  It will ask you to name the new certificate, you will be tempted to name this exactly the same as your development certificates.  Do not do this; firstly it will throw up an error that does not really make sense and also it is easier to find the certificates on your own machine if you suffix them &#39;dev&#39; and &#39;dist&#39; or &#39;test&#39; and &#39;live&#39;.</p>
<p>Remember you will need to do a Project &gt; Clean and rebuild your project selecting the NEW distribution certificate.</p>

										<p><p>Hi</p>
<p>When you installed your developer profile certificate - did you only tell Appcelerator about it, by choosing it using Appcelerator windows?</p>
<p>If so, find the developer profile certificate or re-download it, then from within the finder on the Mac - double-click it so it gets added to KeyChain&#x2F;Xcode.  Once you have done this go back to creating your certificate, double-click that on the mac, Project &gt; Clean and try again.</p>

										<p><p>solved everything! you know what was the problem? then, the problem was in the certificates. I created certificates with a mac, and I had used them themselves certified in another mac, so there the problem of Keychan. because it was necessary to recreate the certificates through the keichan of the second mac. thanks to all.</p>
