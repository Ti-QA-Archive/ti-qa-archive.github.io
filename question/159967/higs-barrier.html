			<h1>HIGS barrier</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have an iOS radio app with 3 windows and 3 tabs to switch between each. My client wishes their user to be able to click a button in the &#39;Stations&#39; window to select an audio stream and have the app immediately move back to the &#39;Player&#39; window without the user having to click on the &#39;Player&#39; page tab that would otherwise do the same job. Where this is perfectly possible using setActiveTab I was wondering if this would get passed at Apple as it would seem to take the responsibility for moving between tabs away from the user. The Human Interface Guidelines are quite complex, but also vague in some areas and I did have app rejected once for not following the HIGS. Has anybody had a similar issue - or any thoughts on this?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Mobile &#x2F;Titanium SDK version 3.1.3.GA&#x2F; iOS 7&#x2F; Mac OSX 10.8.5</p>

							<p>I wouldn&#39;t worry about it. Doesn&#39;t sound that bad  </p>
<p>Or maybe you could come up with a better usage flow&#x2F;design? (And charge for it) :)</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Kosso - yeah in fact it looks like they now don&#39;t like Apple&#39;s new &#39;white-look&#39; tab bar and want to get rid of tabs altogether and move between windows by various buttons. I wonder how many others don&#39;t like iOS 7 tabs?</p>

										<p><p>There&#39;s a lot I don&#39;t like about iOS7 (especially the mess the&#39;ve made of Mobile Safari with too many gestures etc.). I had to totally redesign a few apps and moved away from using tabs at all if I can. Also, since the iPhone5 came out, the screen real estate taken by tabs on the smaller iPhone4 screens seems ludicrous.</p>
