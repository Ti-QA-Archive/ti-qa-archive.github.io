<p>I&#39;ve been able to install the application on my device, which is a lot faster than on Emulator. </p>
<h3 id="info-printlines">Info Printlines</h3>
<p>I would like to use the Printlines for debugging purposes, as Appcelerator does not support debugging just yet, unfortunately.</p>
<h2 id="question">QUESTION</h2>
<p>How am I able to Debug on my device the most proper way?</p>
<h2 id="additional-comment">Additional Comment</h2>
<p>Why is there so little feedback while installing the application on the device? It is really annoying when it fails, to not see why and how to prevent it from happening!</p>

							<p>Your only option at the minute is to use Ti.API.debug() and Ti.API.info() calls, and examine the output. I would recommend running DDMS, connecting to emulator or device and using that to examine the output from those calls.</p>
<p>This is hopefully going to improve very soon when the Ti-integrated version of Aptana is released.</p>

										<p><p>What does DDMS mean?<br>Do I understand correctly, that you are able to retrieve Ti.API.info() output even if you are running it on your own device? </p>
<p>I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;s probably a very stupid question..</p>

										<p><p>In your android sdk there is a <strong>tools</strong> folder and inside there is <strong>ddms</strong>. Run it and you will be able to catch the emulator or device console logs,make screenshots, see memory&#x2F;cpu consumption, etc</p>
