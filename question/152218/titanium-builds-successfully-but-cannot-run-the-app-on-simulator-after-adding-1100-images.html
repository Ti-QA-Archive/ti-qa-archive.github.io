			<h1>Titanium builds successfully but cannot run the app on simulator (after adding 1100 images)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>My app was working smoothly until now. After adding into the resource a new folder containing 1100 images (sizes from 20K to 100K), Titanium is no more able to launch the app. Build and deploy is terminated but the simulator does not start. Console does not show any error.</p>
<p>It builds without any problem and I can start it successfully from XCode. Also I can create the IPA file and run this on the device.</p>
<p>The binary final size is 32MB. Titanium 3.1.0 GA, Mac OSX Lion</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Really, you have 1100 images, which I guess your now trying to load at some point.</p>
<p>This will not work. Sorry but an app with that many images built in, I cannot even imagine why you would want that.</p>
<p>MY guess without any code to explain … is that the app is literally just running out of resources…</p>
<p>T..</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for reply Trevor. I&#39;m sure it is not a resource issue. These images are not loaded at startup. Further, they are categorized by means of a database and displayed through a kind of photo gallery (less of 100 per category). Anyway this window is not created when the app starts. </p>
<p>As I wrote, XCode runs the app on the simulator smoothly. And the ad-hoc distribution works well even on my iPad.</p>
<p>Titanium simply does not launch the Simulator. It seems more related to the size of the binary.</p>

							<p>More likely the time it takes to setup the symbolic links to all the resources means that the build&#x2F;deploy script times out and gives up.</p>
