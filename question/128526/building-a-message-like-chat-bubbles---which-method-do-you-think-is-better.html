			<h1>Building a message like chat bubbles - which method do you think is better?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I need to build a message like bubble chat (like iphone sms). The bubbles have a nice designer made by our companies designer.</p>
<p>I was thinking about 2 ways to build this… </p>
<p>The first is to build it with native Titanium controls (view, imageViews, labels…).</p>
<p>The second way I was thinking of is building it as an HTML string and put that string into a webView control.</p>
<p>Which method do you think is better? which is the fastest and most responsive at the user end? any best practices?</p>
<p>any other ideas thoughts you might have on the subject will be highly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>I am also looking at building something like this. </p>
<p>If you go the webview route i feel it will be less intense on the client side and better for battery life but I feel like you want have as much control and it wont look as native..</p>
<p>If you go native (views,imageviews,labels) you will be able to achieve more control but what if you have lots of images&#x2F;long conversations? will you have the client constantly hitting server for the data or will you have push functionality? </p>
<p>If you have a webview I would assume you could create an ajax site and auto update the content (not sure about this as i haven&#39;t tested it yet).</p>

										<p><p>Why would webView look less native? I think it&#39;s transparent to the user - it&#39;s just to format the messages on the screen according to the design.</p>
<p>what control do you mean by using the native controls?</p>
<p>as for the data - it&#39;s coming from a local database (in my case). if going on the webview option I would build a html string and put it in the webview.</p>

										<p><p>Well lets say you want to add extra functionality later down the road, say you want users to be able to click on the text, or possibly a username in the webview that would popup a profile window with user info. How would you go about that since you cant put a click event on that user icon? with native controls (labels,buttons,images,views,etc) you could add handlers for everything and add more functionality down the road where I feel you would be limiting yourself with a webview.</p>
<p>I originally thought webview at first but have now decided to go with native controls although my situation is slightly different than yours (.net web service and remote data vs your local data).</p>

										<p><p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>Up until this point I built my app natively. Because of complexity of the bubbule design (and limitation in the platform) I started thinking about a webview…</p>
<p>As far as limitations in the platform I found that the biggest one I have is that I&#39;m unable to know the height of an object (lets say I put text in a label and the text wraps into more then one line - I need to know the height of the label so I can place graphics correctly - but I found a workaround for that).</p>
<p>As for the webview - I read a bit about it - it seems that you can call methods from webview in Titanium enviorment.</p>

										<p><p>You can use .9.png graphics that will stretch for background images of your bubbles. And as far as calling methods from a webview I believe the only thing you can do is fire an event via ti.app.fireevent which may be enough for your needs. good luck!</p>

										<p><p>.9.png graphics are special png images used in android that allow certain areas of the png to stretch one way or the other. Here is a link to read up on it: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;guide&#x2F;topics&#x2F;graphics&#x2F;2d-graphics.html#nine-patch">Patch Nine images</a></p>
<p>I also have a bunch of them if you want ill zip up a few and send them to you so you can try them out..</p>
