			<h1>Android SDK not recognized, tried replacing android.py and still does not work </h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am new to using titanium. I recently install Titanium 1.2.1 and it will not recognize the android SDK. It says that it has found it, but does not give me the option to the launch the AVD. </p>
<p>I read the thread about replacing the android.py. I did this and still no dice. Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Also is there an uninstall program for mac for titanium. I noticed that titanium put files in all kinds of places, how can I fully uninstall it?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,<br>Patrick</p>

							<p>Make sure you&#39;ve pointed at the root of the ADK, not into a subdirectory of it. You can check that setting on the profile page in TiDeveloper. You also need to insure that you&#39;ve downloaded the 1.6 (API Level 4) platform using the <code>android</code> command. If you look in the Guides section of the documentation, you&#39;ll see a HowTo for OS X. The first part of the building document is general setup.</p>
<p>We should be releasing 1.3.0 shortly and that will fix a lot of the android issues.</p>
<p>As far as uninstall, it should just be in &#x2F;Library Support&#x2F;Titanium, ~&#x2F;Library Support&#x2F;Titanium, ~&#x2F;.titanium, and probably &#x2F;Applications&#x2F;Titanium Developer.</p>

							<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I also had problems on Windows 7 with emulation. Try these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Download and unpack Android SDK.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Run Android SDK update (it&#39;s SDK Setup.exe file in the unpacked SDK folder). Select Available packages. Select and install SDK platform ANDROID 2.1, API7, rev1 (and others if you like).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Setup JDK like described here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;doc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;get_started</p>
</li>
<li><p>Setup Titanium developer and download Titanium Android SDK 1.3 (dont know the link…)</p>
</li>
<li><p>then run titanium and point to the sdk and create new mobile project (1.3 version, because 1.2 did not work for me).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have any troubles let me know.</p>
<p>Kind regards, Miha</p>

							<p>Thanks so much for the fast response.</p>
<p>Don, I did what you told me. I checked where TIDeveloper was pointing to for the SDK. I am pointing it at the root of the android directory. I have also ran and installed all updates and packages from the AVD manager. I have experience with developing for android and have built application on the computer I using now with eclipse. I am also able to the AVD from the AVD manager. Any other thoughts?</p>
<p>Miha, thanks for the response, but I don&#39;t use windows, so much of that doesn&#39;t relate. Also why are you using android SDK 1.3. Titanium requires 1.6 or higher.</p>
