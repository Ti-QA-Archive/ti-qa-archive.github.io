			<h1>® character in a text file breaks Ti.Filesystem.FileStream</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I found a strange issue: when reading a text file with multiple occurrences of the ® character, a piece of the stream with this ® character breaks the Ti.Buffer.toString() method. It only returns &quot;undefined&quot; and no string. </p>
<p>Example: create a text file &quot;test.txt&quot; in the App&#39;s temp directory with this content:</p>
<p><code>test®test
test®test
test®test
test®test
test®test
test®test
test®test
test®test
test®test
test®test
test®test
test®test
test®test
test®test
test®test
test®test</code></p>
<p>Then try this code:</p>
<p><code>var xhrData;
var xhrBufferSize = 10; 
var counterOK = 0;
var counterNull = 0;
var xhrFile = Titanium.Filesystem.getFile(Ti.Filesystem.getTempDirectory() + &amp;quot;test.txt&amp;quot;);
var xhrBuffer = Ti.createBuffer({
    length : xhrBufferSize
});
var xhrStream = xhrFile.open(Ti.Filesystem.MODE_READ);
var xhrBytesRead = 0;
while (xhrBytesRead &amp;gt;= 0) {
    xhrBytesRead = xhrStream.read(xhrBuffer, 0, xhrBufferSize);
    xhrData = xhrBuffer.toString();
    if (!xhrData) {
        counterNull++;
    } else {
        counterOK++;
    }
}
Ti.API.log(&amp;quot;read test finished, ok=&amp;quot;+counterOK+&amp;quot; null=&amp;quot;+counterNull);</code></p>
<p>In my case, I had 14 pieces of data that returned a string and 5 pieces of data that returned &quot;undefined&quot; for the xhrBuffer.toString() call. </p>
<p>This does not happen when the file does not contain the ® char.<br>Can I open a Jira ticket for this? Can anyone confirm?<br>Thanks!</p>

							<p>I solved it myself, and I was totally wrong. The ® character caused the problem only by accident. The reason was quite simple, and I found it as I had a look at pieces of the stream with an Hex editor: the buffer size was even, and that could cause that one unicode character (which consists out of two bytes) could be torn apart. </p>
<p>And if that happened, the toString() method of the buffer could not translate it to a string anymore, which is quite understandable. </p>
<p>So an odd buffer size of 11, 4097 (instead of 4096) etc. work fine with the code above. Any even buffer size can cause this problem.</p>

										<p><p>In fact, the problem is quite more complicated. The text file is encoded in UTF8, which uses one byte per ASCII character, but two (or even more) bytes for non-ASCII characters.<br>Therefore it can always happen that reading a stream chunk by chunk splits two bytes of a non-ASCII character and causes trouble. </p>
<p>At the moment the only idea I have is to encode all data so that only ASCII characters are used. This is unfortunate because encoding and decoding costs time, but perhaps it&#39;s the only reliable solution.</p>
