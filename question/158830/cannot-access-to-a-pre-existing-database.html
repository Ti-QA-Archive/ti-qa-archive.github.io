			<p>Hi,<br>I&#39;ve created a database with sqllitestudio.<br>One database, one table, one record.<br>I add it on Resources&#x2F;mydata&#x2F;myDB</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> db = Ti.Database.install(<span class="hljs-string">'/mydata/myDB'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'myDB'</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> myRS = db.execute(<span class="hljs-string">'SELECT id, name, surname FROM friend'</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> myRSCount = myRS.rowCount;
Ti.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">'count: '</span> + myRSCount);
</code></pre><p>Count is 0.<br>I tried to execute an insert from code, and it worked.<br>Now the result is 1.<br>But if I try to open db from sqllitestudio, I cannot see the new insertion.<br>I cleaned project and rebuild, but no solution.<br>It seems that app looks in one other database.<br>So .. how can work on my db stored on mydata folder?<br>Where am I in wrong?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>When you use the <strong>install</strong> method the app copies the DB into its internal storage and from that point forward is accessible via the app only.  This is perfectly normal and only partially due to the resources folder not being &quot;writeable&quot; when the app is running.</p>
<p>So the file you are editing after your app has performed the insert is no longer the latest copy of the file or the one the app will use.</p>
<p>If you run the app again and run the install code again - the version that had the data will now be replaced again with the version you just supplied - which is empty.</p>
<p>You can check the documentation to see where the &quot;copied&quot; version is stored depending on which target platform and sdk you are using.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Database-method-install">Titanium.Database install</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This also suggests how to manage the install process so you do not accidentally update the database.</p>

							<p>Hi,<br>thanks a lot for your answer.<br>But about &quot;If you run the app again and run the install code again - the version that had the data will now be replaced again with the version you just supplied - which is empty.&quot;<br>It isn&#39;t true. Because, I&#39;ve also clean and rebulid all, but data were not replaced.<br>Because now I&#39;ve update data on sql database through SQLLiteStudio, but they are not replaced on device simulator.<br>I&#39;ll try to check better documentation, but database is not updated :-\</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

							<p>Just to clarify.<br>At the beginning I&#39;ve created a database with no data on table.<br>I know that it was copied on application database folder.. but there&#39;s no way to replace the existing one?<br>I  belive that with clean procedure I could fix it… but it doesn&#39;t.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
