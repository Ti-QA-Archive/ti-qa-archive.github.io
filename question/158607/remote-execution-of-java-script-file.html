			<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>I want to build one app where all the UI is dynamic. And these UI will change based on the type of user.Based on the web service response we are drawing the UI control. But if we follow this approach then web service will be heavy as it needs to send all the UI control name, its validation rule etc for all the UI control(Currently we have 20 UI and 20 user so all together 400 UI) . So is it possible to have any other approach of the same.</p>

							<div><p>I have thought of remote executing of the Java script file. Means web service will return the entire java script file having all the logic and UI implementation and we execute that java script. But as per <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;4802859&#x2F;titanium-mobile-execute-code-loaded-from-network">this blog</a> we can&#39;t then put this app in App store as remote code execution is against the Apple Terms of Service to download code remotely and execute it.</p>
<p>Is is so. Or any other workaround for the same.</p>

							<p>The short answer is: <strong>No you cannot</strong></p>
<p>A longer answer might be to have some sort of mechanism where you still build your UI based on files that you access remotely (JSON files where you describe your objects as well as their properties). Then your code will have to <em>interpret</em> those description files and build the interface. Although I sincerely think that will have issues on your app&#39;s overall performance.</p>

							<p>Is this possible? I download a JS file (Appcelerator code) from remote server and save it in a file in SD card. Then load the JS file and execute it? Will it violate App Store or Google Play Store terms of use.</p>

<p>No matter where you store your file and no matter how clever your idea may be. They made very sure that you cannot get around this.</p>

										<p><p>Hmm, interesting. Then I guess the JSON approach is the only viable way in which the UI can be implemented.</p>
