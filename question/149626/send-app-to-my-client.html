							<p>For Android There are two apk files in the build folder one is signed and one is unsigned! you can send un-signed apk to client. But for Appstore you need to sign your application with your clients credentials and you will upload the app to itunes connect using application uploader.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The easiest and quickest way - with the added advantage of being able to monitor installs and potentially being able to add extra feature inside is simply - TestFlight.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;testflightapp.com&#x2F;">TestFlight</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Very easy and free, you can send by email and the end user does NOT require a computer to install the end app.</p>

										<p><p>I may have read your question incorrectly.  Are you saying the client wants to upload the apps themselves into the respective stores (App Store and Market Place)?  I read the question as testing to the client for review.  </p>
<p>It is more common for you to upload the apps to the stores using their credentials.</p>
<p>The answer is very different for testing and for uploading to the stores.  Please let me know which of these it is and will offer more advice.</p>
<p>To put apps into either store you will need to sign the apps first.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, the client want to upload the app to store and sign with his signature.<br>For sample, in Java Android app i send UNSIGNED app to my client, he sign with his keystore and then publish to store. Is it possible in Titanium ? iOS ?<br>I can ask credentials to my client, but i I&#39;m looking for other solutions.</p>

										<p><p>It is possible to use the unsigned apk found in the build folder for Android.</p>
<p>iOS is harder though as this requires the certificate to sign the app during the build process itself when preparing the app for the store.  This is one of the reasons that it is common for the developer to manage the store submission process.</p>
