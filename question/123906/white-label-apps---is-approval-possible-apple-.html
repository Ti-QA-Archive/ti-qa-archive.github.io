		<section>
			<p>Is it possible to submit different versions of same App to Apple Appstore? </p>
<p>To clarify, we would create a framework with Appcelerator, but content (images) would be different for each App. Think of Car image App. One App shows images about Audi, another one shows images about Toyota.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help</p>

							<p>In my opinion yes, but they would need to have a different ID for each application.</p>

										<p><p>And don&#39;t submit them all at the same time.  Apple has rejected batch submissions because they don&#39;t represent uniqueness.  Couple of guys made  &quot;college&quot; apps, with information about various schools.  They were not rejected for copyright issues (which would have been my first thought), but that they were too similar.</p>

							<p>In my previous job last year, I did exactly this. We built an app concept with a core set of features and re-branded it for different clients in the same type of business. There are at least 3 apps in the App Store based on this and I had no trouble getting them accepted.</p>
<p>They DO have unique IDs, of course.<br>And we did submit them over a period of a few months, but I do feel like Apple allows these in certain contexts.</p>
<p>THere is another app developer group who has done the same thing and I found at least 50 iterations of their app, rebranded for a client each time.</p>
