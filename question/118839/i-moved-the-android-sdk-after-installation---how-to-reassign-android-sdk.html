			<h1>I moved the android SDK after installation - How to reassign Android SDK</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>MAC OSX 10.6 Snow Lep.</p>
<p>I had to assign the location of the android SDK while I created my first mobile app.</p>
<p>I created the sim link and everything was fine.</p>
<p>I deleted the android sdk and reinstalled it under my Developer folder so all my SDKs would be in one location.</p>
<p>How can I reassign the location of the Android SDK in Titanium.</p>
<p>Titanium cannot find the SDK. </p>
<p>It is not complaining about the adb file. It cannot find the SDK because I moved it.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help.</p>

<p>I had to download AppDelete to find all the files that were associated with Titanium and delete them.</p>
<p>One file I found was interesting and it was a .db file.<br>I opened it with textmate and found that this is where the SDK is stored and where the errors come from.</p>
<p>NOTE *: Running AppDelete in the trial mode did nothing for me. I had to delete them manually.</p>
<p>I deleted all the files associated with titanium and reinstalled and it worked fine.</p>
<p>You have to find all files. You cant just delete the &#x2F;Library.. and ~&#x2F;Library… titanium application support folders. There are more files that have to be deleted in order to get a fresh install again.</p>
<p>Hope this helps someone out.<br>5hours to find this answer.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
