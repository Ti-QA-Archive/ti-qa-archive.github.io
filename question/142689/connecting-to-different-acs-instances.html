			<h1>Connecting to different ACS instances?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am looking at developing an app that would have a user interface and an admin interface. Users simply consume information and admins can change&#x2F;update&#x2F;add&#x2F;delete information. Though admins can change&#x2F;update&#x2F;delete&#x2F;add, I want someone to review their edits prior to moving them into the production ACS.</p>
<p>So my idea was to develop two systems, the admin users would log into ACS app #1 and do their edits. Someone else would come in and review and approve them, then they would run a &#39;POST CHANGES&#39; to a second ACS application.</p>
<p>I know that by default Apps developed with Studio connect to the ACS instance defined by the connection strings in the tiapp.xml file. I am wondering if there is a way to override that so that for the &#39;POST CHANGES&#39; function I will run I can connect to the other ACS app, post the changes. Is there a way to do that?</p>
<p>Ray</p>

							<p>Ok, I won&#39;t give the entire store away, but if you read the docs, burried deep in there, you will find that property entries in the tiapp.xml become Ti.App.Property entries when the app is installed.</p>
<p>This means if you set those as properties, instead of loading them in the tiapp.xml, then you can CHANGE them during runtime to be which ever instance you want them to be.</p>

							<p>I am always one to look for the simple solution or hack to solve a problem until it really needs to get complex.. basically build it and then make it better.</p>
<p>SO… why not just add a custom property to all of the objects which indicate if the object has been reviewed or not and only display reviewed objects? This will allow you to keep all of you content in one instance, you dont need to worry about managing multiple instances, paying for multiple instances and moving data between multiple instances.</p>
<p>so what do you think??</p>

										<p><p>awe, geez, pops, I answer a question exactly as its asked no one likes it. <em>kicks dirt pile</em></p>
<p>then again, I answer for the end result, ignoring the question, no one likes that either, oh well.</p>

										<p><p>i guess that practical lost out over more technically complex…<br>I think in the end he will fall back to my solution or give up. The overhead of managing to separate instances and migrating the data back and forth will make that approach difficult to maintain… IMHO :-)</p>

										<p><p>The reason I wanted multiple instances is that the data is &quot;live&quot;in the user ACS instance and I need the current &quot;approved&quot; data to be visible. If I allow admins to make changes I have to make a copy of the data so that can be reviewed before I can replace the data. So it&#39;s not as simple as a review flag. </p>
<p>The other thing I want to avoid is worrying about who has rights to update production data. The way I work the updates is that a single ID is used to update production…no worries about someone deleting our changing something they&#39;re not supposed to. </p>

										<p><p>I make these comments because we have already built a system that does basically what you are trying to do and we took the less complex approach after weighing the edge cases that you mentioned against the design, development and testing costs.</p>
<p>ACS now has ACL to control access to objects which you mentioned as a concern.</p>
<p>Either way, best of luck I will be interested to see how this turns out for you.</p>
