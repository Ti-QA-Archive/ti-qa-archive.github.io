<p>I am not sure asking the exact same follow up question not directly rated to the original <strong>FOUR</strong> times is going to win you any favours here.  And means you are unlikely to get anyone else notice your extra question.</p>
<p>If Trevor has answered your original - mark it as answered and start a new question that everyone can see.</p>

							<p>There are two sizes for this. The size of the viewable area (height), which I would set within the screen, and the size of the content (contentHeight). Now if you using a scroll view and a layout of vertical, it will just keep adding the views into it.</p>
<p>So a very simple answer is that if you add to many then it will become very slow and possibly crash the app because of lack of memory. You really need to make sure that the content of a scrollview is relevant and obvious to the user. </p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>T.</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve developed a form in a scroll view with more than 21 textfields and this is not a problem on Apple nor Android. I&#39;d suggest you specify height&#x2F;width of the textfields to accelerator the rendering of the views.</p>
