							<p>You will probably be best off using <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phonegap.com&#x2F;">Phonegap</a> (as much as I love titanium) because their framework is essentially a web view that reads a directory of files.</p>
<p>You could do the same using appcelerator by putting</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">window</span> = Titanium.UI.createWindow();
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> webView = Ti.UI.createWebView({ url: '<span class="hljs-keyword">file</span>/<span class="hljs-keyword">in</span>/resources.html' });
<span class="hljs-keyword">window</span>.add(webView);
<span class="hljs-keyword">window</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>();
</code></pre>

							<p>well, i didn&#39;t want to use a web based program.  i guess i am afraid of the application no longer being mine.</p>
<p>i do want this to run locally on device and not the web.  i wish i understood what the second part of your message was, but that&#39;s just an indication of my ignorance. </p>
<p>thank you for your input.</p>

										<p><p>I am not sure what you mean by &quot;didn&#39;t want to use a web based program&quot;.  With either titanium or phonegap, it will run locally on the device unless your web pages are referencing images or other things using external links.</p>
<p>However, if what you want is to take your HTML code and have that be the cornerstone of the UI, then you will essentially still have a &quot;web application&quot; albeit it one that runs locally.</p>
<p>In regards to &quot;I am afraid of the application no longer being mine&quot;, again it may depend on what you mean.  If you mean you don&#39;t like the fact that people can see your javascript then a &quot;web app&quot; may not be your cup of tea.  You can do a certain amount of obfuscation and minify but a determined user can still reverse to some extent.</p>
<p>Normally titanium projects do not have any javascript visible in the compiled app resources.  But I don&#39;t use webviews and I don&#39;t know how that would impact the compiled program.</p>
<p>YMMV.</p>

										<p><p>my site is very simple.  basically it is very simple html and amounts to no more that say flash cards. and, one just scrolls to the next page via arrows or goes back one or directly to the main menu.  i found a site called iwebkit.  i used that to create a site that looks nice in a mobile phone or tablet pc. seems to work in all the browsers i guess because it&#39;s just basic html. looks best in chrome though. i guess since i used the iwebkit though, it&#39;s html5.</p>
<p>anyway, i was thinking about charging for access to the site, but i think it would be better to have these flash cards run independently and not require web access.  so, i have been looking for a way to take my html files and some how package it as a standalone app.<br>i found titanium via a search and thought maybe it could help me achieve making a stand alone app.  </p>
<p>i am somewhat skilled with joomla! administration&#x2F;html and thought i could accomplish this myself somehow. i know it has nothing to do with anything, just that i am not a complete flashing 12.  the more i try to get my feet wet, the more moronic i feel.  i really appreciate the responses and more so not being insulted which i have noticed happen in a few forums, so thank you so much for your patience.</p>
