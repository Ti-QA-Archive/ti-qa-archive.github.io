			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Unfortunately there was a design change ages on this forum, and this message would have gone somewhere discreet. </p>
<p>Due to my upbringing, I cannot help but give credit to a few people on this forum whose contribution has been amazing and extremely beneficial. I won&#39;t let their efforts go by uncredited.</p>
<p>Mitul Bhalia,<br>Minh Nguyen,<br>Stephen Heather,<br>Josh Lewis</p>
<p>Just to name a few! </p>
<p>Thank you for responses. You never had to answer any of my questions, yet you provided me with a lot of guidance that I&#39;m coding now without any documentation and just typing the stuff up.</p>
<p>I guess a small thanks should go to Appcelerator, but that will happen when they solve my GUID issue.</p>
<p>I suggest we meet up for a few beers when I get through the Android version.</p>
<p>Thanks, from all my heart.<br>E B</p>

<p>Mitul, Minh, you&#39;re just indispensable.</p>
