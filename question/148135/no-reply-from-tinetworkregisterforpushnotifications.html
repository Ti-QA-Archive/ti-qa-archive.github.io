			<h1>No reply from Ti.Network.registerForPushNotifications()</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I know this has been asked a few times, but a working answer never seems to be provided. When using the Ti.Network.registerForPushNotifications() function, I never get a reply. No callback, no Success, no Error. Nothing. Here is my code:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">  Ti.Network.registerForPushNotifications({
    types: [
      Ti.Network.NOTIFICATION_TYPE_BADGE,
      Ti.Network.NOTIFICATION_TYPE_ALERT,
      Ti.Network.NOTIFICATION_TYPE_SOUND
    ],
    success: <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span></span> {
      Ti.API.<span class="hljs-built_in">debug</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"token: "</span>+e.deviceToken);
    },
    <span class="hljs-built_in">error</span>: <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span></span>{
      Ti.API.<span class="hljs-built_in">debug</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"error: "</span>+e.<span class="hljs-built_in">error</span>);
    },
    callback: <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span></span> {
      Ti.API.<span class="hljs-built_in">debug</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"callback: "</span>+e.data);
    }
  })
</code></pre><p>I am using Titanium 3.0 running on OSX and testing on a physical iPhone over WiFi. I know that I have read on here that you may need a 3G&#x2F;4G connection for this to work. But I am sure that could not be right, could it?</p>
<p>As best I can tell I have everything set up properly in the Provisioning Portal <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;Uqapapo.png">image</a> and I have the certificate&#39;s installed on my keyring.</p>
<p>One thing I have noticed is that my phone has never asked me  if I want to allow this app to receive push notifications, and I guess iPhones are supposed to do that? My app also does not show up under Settings-&gt;Notifications. Maybe I missed a step somewhere that tells the phone my app supports push notifications?</p>
<p>I hope I am just missing something here, I really need to get this working ASAP.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>You do not appear to have an errors in your code and as it is very basic code designed to set things up I would have been surprised if you had.</p>
<p>Just in case this is a simple problem with the debug output (it has been known to happen), change your code as follows;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Ti.Network.registerForPushNotifications({
    types: [
        Ti.Network.NOTIFICATION_TYPE_BADGE,
        Ti.Network.NOTIFICATION_TYPE_ALERT,
        Ti.Network.NOTIFICATION_TYPE_SOUND
    ],
    success: <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">e</span>) </span>{
        alert(<span class="hljs-string">"success: "</span> + <span class="hljs-built_in">JSON</span>.stringify(e));
    },
    error: <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">e</span>) </span>{
        alert(<span class="hljs-string">"error: "</span> + <span class="hljs-built_in">JSON</span>.stringify(e));
    },
    callback: <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">e</span>) </span>{
        alert(<span class="hljs-string">"callback: "</span> + <span class="hljs-built_in">JSON</span>.stringify(e));
    }
});
</code></pre><p>Do you get different results now?</p>

										<p><p>I believe so. If you look at my original post above I have a link to an <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;Uqapapo.png">image</a> of my certificates. The app ID I entered into the Provisioning Portal is &quot;net.geddex.alert&quot; so there are no wildcards there. The app installs and launches fine on the phone. Could I have something else messed up with my certificates?</p>

<li>Have you run the certificates on your Mac?</li>
<li>Made sure you have the same app id in your <strong>tiapp.xml</strong> as you do in the certificate</li>
<li>Make sure you are compiling for the device using the same certificate</li>

<p>We have done this again ourselves just today for a new app, it should be this simple.</p>

										<p><p>All look good.  A couple of stupid suggestions, but that is where we are now.</p>
<ul>
<li>confirm you are getting to this block of code by adding an alert ABOVE it and BELOW it, saying above &amp; below.</li>
</ul>
<p>Seems stupid, but at this point we need to make sure the code is running.</p>
<ul>
<li>create a brand new default app and add MY code at the very bottom of the <strong>tiapp.xml</strong>.  Edit the app name to match your certificate.  You will need to close your current project while you try this.  Compile for device and try again.</li>
</ul>
<p>This will out any code issues you MAY have elsewhere.</p>

</code></pre><p>Would actually give you feedback as you device would note be connected to your computer whilst you are doing these tests so that would have been impossible.</p>
<p>You ARE compiling for device and transferring the app over to the device using Xcode or iTunes?  You cannot do this by connecting the device and doing remote debugging.</p>

If the app is running all works as aspected, but if the of is in background and I send the notification from console then I see the notification on status bar. But If I start the app then I cannot read the payload because the event is not fired. I dont understand the parameter &#39;inBackground&#39; ;-))</p>
