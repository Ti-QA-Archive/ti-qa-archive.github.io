			<h1>Google play services out of date. Please update google play service.</h1>
		</header>

			<p>Before asking the question let me share you background of the issue.</p>
<p>I had titanium version 3.2.1GA but in that version google map was not showing in Google Nexus 5. I have researched this issue and found that I need to upgrade titanium studio to make it work.</p>
<p>I have upgraded titanium to 3.4.1GA and upgraded Google Play Service to Rev 21. </p>
<p>Now my issue is when I am trying to check map on Samsung GT-N7000 its showing error message that google play services out of date please update update google play service, but when I checked on Samsung S4 its working. </p>
<p>The blogs which I found about this issue are all telling to upgrade google play service on device, which doesn&#39;t make sense since I cannot force user to upgrade google play service in order to avoid crashing the app because how come they identify the issue and fix it can by upgrading services- assuming users have basic or no knowledge.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I checked it on device and its already updated to Google Play Services 6.1 which is the latest. </p>
<p>I am not sure what am I missing please let me know at your earliest. Thankyou</p>
