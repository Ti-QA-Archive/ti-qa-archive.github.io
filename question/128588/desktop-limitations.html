							<p>Titanium Desktop does have printer support, but it is basically a single function that will pull up the printer dialog on a system through the webkit. I have not used it to date, so not sure how well it works, but my experience in the past working with printers says that it is sometimes difficult to get the output exactly as you want, and requires dwiddling to get how one wants it. I don&#39;t know how difficult that would be or if it would work well as-is, since I haven&#39;t used it much at all.</p>
<p>The webkit has some graphics capability, such as SVG. Currently we use 3 flavors of the webkit on osx&#x2F;linux&#x2F;win so that type of graphics could take some tweaking to get correct also.</p>
<p>Any devices you might want to talk to that are not available would need a module written for them.</p>

										<p><p>One last thing…I&#39;m looking at swapping out the cairo port of webkit for the chromium embedded on Windows. If that goes well, I would probably take the other platforms to chromium embedded as well. That way we would have the same build system for webkit on all platforms and can move towards have the exact same features on all platforms.</p>

<p>Yes, I think you&#39;ve summed it up pretty well…it can be done, but it <em>might</em> not be easy. Keep in mind I have very little experience with printing out of Titanium Desktop, I need to test that out when I get time. For the time being I&#39;m going to be focused on replacing the webkit with chromium embedded though.</p>

<p>Have you ever had any progress on chromium embed? Do you any half-completed code. I also just started to port chromium embed, would you mind share some information?</p>
