							<div><p>I will be re-releasing my modified Titanium Developer app (called IRONti Developer) in February. In addition to its CoffeeScript support and a built-in IDE it has 3 enhancements you might be interested in: 1. Working offline, 2. No tracking, 3. No Ads.</p>

										<p><p>after updating this property AND deleting the &#39;build&#39; directory it turned it off. I verified this through the Debug option as well as through my personal firewall filter. for those who may not know, the simulator will rebuild the &#39;build&#39; directory upon clicking Launch.</p>

							<p>I&#39;d like to know how to disable tracking in Titanium Developer as well. I don&#39;t want apps I create sent to Titanium servers. Right now all apps I create show when I log into the appcelerator network. Also can we get a confirmation from a Titanium employee that code is not uploaded to the servers for mobile apps. Thanks.</p>

							<p>For mobile development anything you are coding resides on your computer without being sent to their servers. The only code built on their servers is the desktop one( as far as I know ) for platform targeting.</p>
<p>But you better ask a member team, to be sure.</p>

										<p><p>From playing with the ide and watching network traffic, it sure seems like every little move I make in the ide appears to be sent to their servers! I realize that in this day and age of social networking and foursquare privacy is dead, but I&#39;d like to know how and to what extent my activities as a developer are being monitored! Thanks!</p>

										<p><p>I just had a thought.  Isn&#39;t Ti Developer itself open source?  I have had no need or inclination to download the source for Ti Developer – only for the SDKs – so I have not looked at it.  But if it is open source, then it seems like all one has to do is examine the source for &quot;call home&quot; reporting and disable it.  If I am not mistaken, the source is <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_developer">here</a> should anyone care enough to investigate.</p>

							<p>Privacy was a issue for me too, but I recently found out that when you add this line:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">127<span class="hljs-class">.0</span><span class="hljs-class">.0</span><span class="hljs-class">.1</span>               <span class="hljs-tag">api</span><span class="hljs-class">.appcelerator</span><span class="hljs-class">.net</span>
</code></pre><p>To your hosts file the analytics as well as all the other tracking in Titanium Developer isn&#39;t working anymore.</p>
