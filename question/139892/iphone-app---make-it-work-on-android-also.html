			<h1>iPhone App - Make it work on Android also??</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>We have an iPhone App, which is working fine and its on the Apple Appstore, but now we need to make it also work on Android devices.<br>Initially, we created the app explicitly for the iPhone, and now we would like to expand our customer base by adding Android accessibility.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>How do you make an iPhone App also work on Android devices??</p>
<p>We are currently trying to import our iPhone app into an Android project and trying to run it in the Android Emulator, but with no success.</p>
<p>Any help&#x2F;advice&#x2F;support appreciated..</p>
<p>Thanks guys…</p>

							<p>Easiest way: create new project and copy your Resource folder in the newly created project.<br>The recent TiStudio updates also allows you to enable android support afterwards.</p>
<p>Dont expect to run the app without any issues on android, it depends on your&#x2F;devs experience of cross-platform coding. If your app was developed targeting iOS only you may run in some issue on android, since its a different platform with different controls etc.</p>
<p>Therefore you will need to fix the code &#x2F; write new &#x2F; extend whatsoever.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks!!  Are these cross-platform issues documented anywhere?? I have already: </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">"<span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">create</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">project</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> copy your <span class="hljs-keyword">Resource</span> folder <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> the newly created <span class="hljs-keyword">project</span><span class="hljs-string">",</span></span>
</code></pre><p>and now I have run into errors which look like the database connection is one such cross-platform issue..</p>
<p>Also, things like:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-attribute">transition</span>:Ti<span class="hljs-class">.UI</span><span class="hljs-class">.iPhone</span><span class="hljs-class">.AnimationStyle</span><span class="hljs-class">.FLIP_FROM_LEFT</span>
</code></pre><p>need to be replaced with the Android equivalent.<br>If there are any more cross-platform issues that you can think of please feel free to mention them here;)</p>

										<p><p>It depends on the code, there are many of them. Also android behaves in somecases different than iOS does. You will need try &amp; see.</p>
<p>Basically as you can see you used iPhone namespace <code>Ti.UI.iPhone.AnimationStyle.FLIP_FROM_LEFT</code> which wont work on android or other platforms.<br>If you checkout the API docs you will notice there are small icons which tell you wheter this API is avaible on desired platform or not.</p>

										<p><p>You&#39;re going to have to do a lot of detection using<br>(if Titanium.Platform.osname==&#39;android&#39;)<br>{<br>code<br>}</p>
<p>Also, I dont think Android supports somethings like borderRadius.</p>
<p>And finally, where you&#39;ve set all of your left,right,width, etc, if you&#39;ve used an integer, you need to change it to something like &#39;15dp&#39;, so it scales correctly.</p>

										<p><p>Are you better off having separate projects - one for iPhone, and one for Android??  What do you think??  I know Titanium is specifically designed for building apps which are cross-platform, however, when you are taking over a project which has been completed for iPhone, and now needs to be made for Android, there is a lot of backtracking to be done in order to remove iPhone specific code.  Separate project for Android or modify iPhone app??</p>
