			<h1>In-app AirPlay button</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Is it really true that Appcelerator doesn&#39;t support an in-app AirPlay button for <strong>streaming audio</strong> to airplay on iOS?</p>
<p>I know of the TvOut module, but thats only for Video. And I know that you can use the Native airplay button support when you slide the menu up from the buttom of your screen, but I want it to be a in-app button which does this.</p>
<p>Anyone?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Nope it is not true.  There is a third-party module free module that performs the task you are after.</p>
<p>To clarify;</p>
<ul>
<li>Support is most commonly provided via the buttons found on system components such as the video player.</li>
<li>Those components have system provided UI&#39;s and automatically show&#x2F;hide the button as it becomes aware of suitable AirPlay devices.</li>
<li>This is how most apps get around the issue of course.</li>
<li>The TVOut module does not support video, it actually allows you to define a view and assign it to the module.  Whatever you then place within that &#39;AirPlay view&#39; is shown on the Apple TV.  Please note that the AirPlay mirroring option must have been selected before this &#39;AirPlay view&#39; is shown.  From there however you can do whatever you like with the contents of that view and they are updated in real-time (give or take a few frame rate buffers).  I use this a lot and it works very well.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can download the module via;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitt.io&#x2F;component&#x2F;com.karaoak.airplay">gitt.io</a> (good place to make sure modules are 64 bit)</li>
<li><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;karaoak&#x2F;TiAirPlay">github.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It has been recently updated to 64 bit by the looks of things and I can confirm (just checked) it compiles and works with Ti SDK 3.5 GA and performs correctly when swapping between the iOS device and AirPlay device when swapping between targets.</p>
