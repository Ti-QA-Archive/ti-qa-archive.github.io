			<h1>Entourage Expressions and Scope</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am trying to work with Entourage and the Zend Framework and I have much of it wired up but although I can see that my request goes out, the response does not seem to get consumed. In the request, I see that the Scope is set to &#39;Appcelerator&#39; and there is nothing I can find that tells how to define the Scope when using Expressions.</p>
<p>So, in order to eliminate that as a concern I thought I would ask if Scope matters when using Expressions, and if so how does one go about specifying the Scope?</p>
<p>I hope this is a good place to ask this. It seems that all reference to Entourage is all but gone from this site. If there is a better place to address this type of question, simply let me know and I will take it there.</p>

							<p>Actually, I have seen that in the example code there is a scope=&quot;*&quot; at the end of the &#39;on&#39; attribute.</p>
<p>If I had done these two things the other way around, I would not have submitted the question. I hope someone else at least benefits from the question.</p>
<p>Consider this one closed.</p>
