			<h1>C2DM deprecated - New Android Push solutions?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>Today i noticed, that the C2DM-service for Android, which is used for push-notifications with Urban Airship, is deprecated by Google since last week. </p>
<p>Are there any solutions to implement Android push-notifications with UA, yet? </p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

							<p>Doesn&#39;t look like UA has started to work with GCM, yet. They haven&#39;t even released a guess at a timeline. However, if you have an app currently working with UA doing C2DM, it will continue to work. </p>
<p>In short, you can&#39;t do a new app with UA that does android push-notifications. However, any existing apps will continue to work. There&#39;s no set date when C2DM will stop working, though. My guess is, from looking at the steps to migrate, that UA will be ready to switch to GCM before C2DM stops working.</p>

										<p><p>If you&#39;re creating a new app, there&#39;s a couple of options.</p>
<p>1) Wait until UA adds support for GCM. The problem with this is that you&#39;ll be waiting an unknown amount of time for a 3rd party to complete something. That&#39;s the problem you get when you rely on a 3rd party, though.</p>
<p>2) Use Appcelerator&#39;s cloud services to do push notifications. This is great if you also want to do things like have them manage your users, etc. I&#39;m not sure what they&#39;re using for their Android backend, or whether it works or not, so that would require some research, first.</p>
<p>3) If you have access to a server, you could do the server component yourself. I&#39;m using <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Redth&#x2F;PushSharp&#x2F;">PushSharp</a> for my server part. I also plan on using <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Kuraturpa&#x2F;titanium-c2dm">Kuraturpa</a> as my Titanium component, and then converting that to GCM. Not sure how that&#39;s going to go, though.</p>

							<p>Hi all, there&#39;s a new GCM module in the Marketplace called uPush for Android push messages, got it working with my project today in about 10 minutes, saved me so much time.</p>
