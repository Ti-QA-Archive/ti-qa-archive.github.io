			<h1>scrollTo used on blur event crashes on device</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, I have a tabbed application for iOS.<br>One of the windows in the stack is a scrollview that contains a table view. In the main view of the app there is a table and when you click a row in the table it goes to this scrollview. As the scrollview opens it populates its table view with a number of rows. So the table could have 2 rows and other time it could have 20 rows. The contents of the scrollview live in a view container so the scrollview can extend its height as needed. All that is ok.</p>
<p>My problem is that if you scroll down, go back to the main view and select a different row it opens the scroll view and scrolls it to the point where the previous one was left. I&#39;ve tried adding scrollTo(0,0) in the open event as it opens the view but it starts scrolling to the previous point and then to 0, so it makes an ugly movement.</p>
<p>The only thing I managed to get working was adding the scrollTo(0,0) in the blur event when the scrollview is left while going back to the main view. That works great and as it closes you can see how it scrolls back to the top. Except that is crashes on the device…</p>
<p>I have the latest SDK, XCode and all that.</p>
<p>Any hints? I though I could detect the back button and try how the the scrollto 0 behaves there, but I should then create a custom button so I can attach the event listener, and I&#39;m afraid it might crash the same way…</p>

							<p>Hi, I created a reduced example of my app and I&#39;ve been able to reproduce the problem also there. It is either a bug in my code or in Titanium.</p>
<p>The problem is that it only happens on the device, not the emulator. To reproduce it you must enter a list from the main view, scroll down then leave the view with the back button and enter the other view. Usually when opening the second view it crashes, if not the first time then the next one. No crash if you don&#39;t scroll down.</p>
<p>The line that crashes the device is: </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">scrollView.<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">scrollTo</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">0</span>)</span></span>
</code></pre><p>When used inside the blur event of the window.</p>
<p>I pasted the whole code here: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;3535865">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;3535865</a></p>
<p>Any hints would be welcome.</p>
