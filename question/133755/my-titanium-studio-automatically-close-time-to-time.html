							<p>Hi Arun,</p>
<p>it losing connection when it is in idle, after for an idle time restart your emulator and try run your application when your emulator load successfully and get installed SD card. if every thing is ok and there is still error then run again but do not restart the emulator. sometime It does not responds while installing SD card and starting services.</p>

										<p><p>It may be a problem of memory, corrupt installation file on disk, physical media problem where your software installed, internal error of Fast Development Environment or os did not allocate enough space for emulator at that time. you have to check it step by step first and diagnosis the problem.</p>
<p>Hope you got the solution soon.</p>

										<p><p>You are using android emulator, and it has default services to run and those all services do not require for your project so those services are found in your emulator which is enabled by you, so some services are not responding in call so some error generated.</p>
<p>It may be that kind of error but it does not interfere in your execution.</p>

										<p><p>one another cause for force closing of process by emulator or user also be a reason for this kind of error, it may be process terminated by android when it getting low memory, but first you have to know which process is this?</p>
