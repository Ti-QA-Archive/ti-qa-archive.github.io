			<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>Can somebody tell me what does a module price by $29.99 &#x2F;Seat &#x2F;Month mean? Is that for support? Is that the license fee? Is it compulsory to have this subscription fee? </p>
<p>thanks,<br>George</p>

										<p><p>Its per account, when using Ti.Studio you Login with an appcl account. Per Seat means per account, the Module is tied to the account which you used to buy a module.</p>

							<p>George,</p>
<p>Per seat is tied to a user account.  We have more than one dev in our office.  If I pay for a single per seat, then the account I assign that too is the only one that can build out a project using that module. I can buy multiple seats and assign them to other devs.</p>
<p>Per month is the billing cycle for a module.  Some modules are a one time payment.  You pay once, and can compile forever (or at least as long as the module is kept up to date).  If its a per-month billing, you can only build out an app using that module in months that your subscription is current.  So lets say I pay for CoolModule that has a per month billing. I can build with it, put it in the stores, and stop my subscription.  However, should I want to release an update, I have to pay for the subscription again to build out the project using that module.</p>
<p>You are paying for access to the module.  Support quality varies by module developer.  I&#39;ve had good experiences with nearly all my purchases, even to the point contacting a mod developer to contract for custom module work.</p>
