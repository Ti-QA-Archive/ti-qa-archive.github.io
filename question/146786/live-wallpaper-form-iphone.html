							<p>The iOS SDK doesn&#39;t provide any way to get the user&#39;s current wallpaper. There is no API for setting the wall paper for either the home screen or the lock screen. They also do not expose an API for programatically locking or unlocking the iphone.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The short answer is &quot;no&quot; (same one Josh Lewis gave).</p>
<p>The slightly longer answer is that Apple simply does not allow it.  Apple do not allow access to operating system wide base functionality, you will notice there are no live wallpaper apps for iOS (ignoring any jail-broken ones).</p>
<p>The Apple world is purposely sand-boxed, your app cannot directly access or interact with another app on the device.  There are good reasons for this even if some people do not agree with them.  Any interaction your app has with another app is by APIs and at a push URL schemes.  You cannot access the images held in the gallery directly nor the videos this is so one app cannot negatively affect another.</p>
<p>So when you are left with APIs and URL schemes, you have to work with those actually available to you and there isn&#39;t one.</p>
<p>As I mentioned there are no live wallpaper apps for iOS, some love them (I am not one of those people) but as they are so prevalent on Android and other platforms it is likely that this is not some over site on app developers minds it is because that access is not available - at least not on the non jail broken devices.</p>
