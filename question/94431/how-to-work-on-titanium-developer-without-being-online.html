<p>You should not have to re-enter your email and password every time you start Titanium Developer - it should save your details and log you in automatically.</p>
<p>Is this not happening for you?  If not, what OS are you using?</p>
<p>Please remember to use question tags, to categorise your question. The <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;contribute.html">Participating in the Q&amp;A</a> guide describes how to use the Q&amp;A in a way that is best for everyone.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>Don&#39;t worry, Amarjeet, we were all noobs once :)</p>
<p>To answer your question more specifically, you have to log into TiDev <strong>at least once</strong> but thereafter it should remember your email and password and not ask you for them.</p>
<p>The only thing I can think of is that your Titanium home directory (in your user profile) is corrupted in some way. Try shutting down TiDev and deleting this Titanium directory and running TiDev again.</p>
<p>Note that you can find your user profile by running <code>%HOMEPATH%</code> from the run dialog. There should be a Titanium-related directory inside of it.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
