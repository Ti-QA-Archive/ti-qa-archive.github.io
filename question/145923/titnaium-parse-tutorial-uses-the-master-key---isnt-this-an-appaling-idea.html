			<p>The titanium parse tutorial seems to indicate that the Ti guys don&#39;t know how to hook up to parse. </p>
<p>In the tutorial on github, which was my first stop (and probably others as well), they indicate that one should use the MASTER_KEY when talking to the parse rest api.<br>One should, in fact, use the REST_KEY for this. In fact, the master key should never be put in anybody else&#39;s hands… it  can do anything!</p>
<p>Just thought i&#39;d put that out there… </p>

							<p>So….<br>What was your question again?</p>
<p>While I can understand <strong>the venting</strong> part of your post. But I tend to disagree with the <em>Ti guys don&#39;t know how to…</em> part of it. Keep in mind that this tutorial was released more than a year ago and that the way to access Parse might have changed considerably over that time.</p>
<p>Now <strong>if</strong> you have a better way to suggest on how to do this, I&#39;m sure everyone here will be more than happy to hear it. (hell, you can even fort the tutorial and modify it using the new and improved way)</p>
<p>But please, don&#39;t use the Q&amp;A just to vent when you are displeased with something. And don&#39;t come here a year later saying that what was done at that time was wrong. (do you actually know how things were back then? Did you use the Parse API back when the tutorial was made). This only makes the whole site harder to read for everyone.</p>
<p>Believe me, I have plenty to vent about just like many of us here. But doing it here is not the right medium.</p>
