			<p>iphone<br>1.7.2 SDK<br>Mobile</p>
<p>I am having huge troubles with tableviews<br>What i have is as follows:<br>When i login i access a service based on the username and password and load each item into the DB. I can see that before the process there are 0 records and after there are 24 records. But when i view the table view its empty. I close the simulator and relaunch and the table view is populated….</p>
<p>Further to that I have made it that when I logout all database data is deleted. When i logout of account &#39;A&#39; and login as account &#39;B&#39; the table view still shows the data of Account &#39;A&#39;. I close the simulator and re-luanch and the list is populated properly…</p>
<p>I reckon its the same problem…can anyone help me here.</p>

							<div><p>There have been a ton of bugfixes related to TableViews since 1.7.2. You should upgrade at least to 1.7.5, which was a big step forward, but ideally to the latest stable version.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a waste of time to debug things that could have already been fixed.</p>

							<div><p>Stephen, updating from 1.7.2 to 1.8x didn&#39;t do anything really. The app look like its running faster but my problem isn&#39;t solved. It seems that the table view is created and then data is loaded from a service. I need the tableview to be created after the data is loaded into the DB…<br>Either that or every time the tab is click the tab should query the DB to see it is missing any records. I prefer the first option…</p>
<p>Anyone?<br>Ilan</p>

							<p>So I solved my problem by using a fireEvent only after the data had been inserted into the database.</p>
