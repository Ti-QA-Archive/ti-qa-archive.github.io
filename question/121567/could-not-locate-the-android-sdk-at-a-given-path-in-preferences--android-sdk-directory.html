							<p>For Mac Os X users. None of the solutions above helped me. So, I opened Applications&#x2F;Utilities&#x2F;Console and then Titanium-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Titanium Studio-&gt;Titanium. After clicking &quot;browse&quot; for &quot;Android SDK Directory&quot; and seeing an error I found out an error in Console which said that Titanium was looking for the file &quot;avd.py&quot; in my sdk directory. So, copying the &quot;android&quot; directory from &quot;mobilesdk&quot; to my sdk directory fixed the problem.<br>In any case, if you still have this error, I suggest looking what console shows, it really can help.</p>

							<p>Same issues - so just an idea, next time start giving some sensible error messages about exactly what can&#x2F;can&#39;t be found? I&#39;ve wasted almost two days trying to set up Titanium with various versions of the APIs etc. Some decent error messages - not just &#39;can&#39;t find&#39; or &#39;unable to install&#39; etc. would go a long way.</p>

							<p>Creating an empty $ANDROID_SDK&#x2F;platforms&#x2F;android-7 directory worked for me too, even though I already had android-8 and android-12 in there from the installer.</p>
<p>Adding &#39;tools&#39; and &#39;platform-tools&#39; to my path didn&#39;t make any difference.</p>

							<p>Steps to get it running on MacOS X for fresh install of Titanium Studio and Android SDK: Open Android SDK&#x2F;tools folder, run android executable from there. Install packages for Android SDK 2.2 and&#x2F;or 2.1 - propably only one needed., and also Android SDK Platform Tools. This includes the adb executable that Titanium Studio needs to run the emulator. After those steps, without adjusting any path, it did work fine for me. Also keep in mind that there is a bug in android emulator, that will make any app running on android sdk &gt; 2.2 crash if it uses a WebView.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the reply, Gregor. Unfortunately that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;ve got installed. In fact, I even downloaded the SDK again. I still get the message when browsing to the android-sdk-mac_x86 directory, and there&#39;s nothing in the default android SDK drop down. I REALLY need to resolve this! Anybody?</p>

							<p>Still having the problem - trying to post here to get some help. Changes above (adding to path) did not work for me either on OSX 10.6.7 and build 1.0.2.201107071912 Modified the path to include both tools and platform-tools, reinstalled titanium, rebooted a dozen times, still getting this crazy message. Ensured SDK Platform Android 2.1-update(x), API 7 is installed.<br>I have been trying to resolve for a week. Does anyone have any ideas?</p>

							<p>I am hoping now that somebody from Appcelerator is going to takeup on this one.  The only other suggestion is to checkmwhat java version you are running.</p>
<p>then we can compare to the ones that are working.</p>

							<p>Ok, I found a solution to this problem that worked for me on windows 7:<br>Go to this page and get the latest build of the mobile SDK: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;index.html</p>
<p>Worked perfectly for me (I also added the Path&#39;s and stuff before, so you might need to do that too!)</p>

							<p>Resolved on OSX! John Mohan actually posted the answer that worked above, but misunderstood it as meaning resinstall studio (which didn&#39;t fix it on OSX). Later I realized that it was the</p>
<p><strong>\library\application support\titanium\mobilesdk</strong> that needed to be renamed. </p>
<p>When I did that, Titanium auto-updated the SDK and the issue was resolved!<br>I agree with him though, I still don&#39;t know what happened or why I had to do that - especially when I fully reinstalled studio. Thanks for the help everyone!</p>

<p>OSX 10.6.8, TiStudio 1.0.1.201106171427.</p>
<p>I tried adding the paths, but that did not work.</p>
<p>Installing the Android Platform 2.1 API 7 did work, after I did that TiStudio accepted the path to my Android SDK as valid.</p>
<p>Now to test the emulator…</p>

							<p>There are some workarounds in these answers that seem to work for some people, sometimes.  If you try them and they don&#39;t work, it looks like you might be out of luck until Titanium Studio 1.1 comes out:<br><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TISTUD-422">jira bug TISTUD-422</a></p>

							<p>For Window 7 user. Navigate to the Titatium Studio installation directory and rename the &quot;mobilesdk&quot; directory to &quot;Mobilesdk&quot;. Make sure your android sdk is installed properly. Restart Ti and then configure it again. It works like spell. Hope it helps.</p>

										<p><p>Sean,</p>
<p>Just follow this instruction step by step and see if it work.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to http:&#x2F;&#x2F;builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;index.html and download the latest build of mobilesdk for Window. Extract it, navigate to your Titanium studio installation directory and do either of;</li>
</ol>
<p>IF (mobilesdk OR Mobilesdk directory exist in Ti installation dir) THEN<br>    Delete existing one in Ti dir<br>        Extract the latest build to Ti dir<br>    Rename the latest build from &quot;mobilesdk&quot; to &quot;Mobilesdk&quot;</p>
<p>ELSE<br>    Extract the latest build to Ti dir<br>    Rename the latest build from &quot;mobilesdk&quot; to &quot;Mobilesdk&quot;</p>
<p>ENDIF</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Locate your Android SDK installation directory. Navigate into &quot;platform-tools&quot; directory copy both adb.exe and AdbWinApi.dll. Go out of that directory and navigate to &quot;tools&quot; directory. Paste both file into the &quot;tools&quot; directory. Navigate to &quot;platforms&quot; directory. If empty just create a empty folder called &quot;android-7&quot;, &quot;android-8&quot; e.t.c, this depends on Android platform(s) you installed through the Android SDK Manager.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make sure your environment variable is set for both &quot;tools&quot; and &quot;platform-tools&quot; directory. To do this you have to edit the Path variable.</p>
<p> i) Go to Start and type &quot;system variable&quot;</p>
<p> ii)It will open a window, towards the bottom you will see Environm       ent Variables, click on it. Locate Path under the System variab           les pane&#x2F;window. Click on it once, you will notice 3 buttons be           low, Click on Edit. Type the following (Make sure the path                conforms with the way it is on your system as the one here is t       he way it on my on system) ;C:\apps\android-sdk\platform-tools\       ;C:\apps\android-sdk\tools.</p>
<p> iii)Just hit OK(s).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Restart your Titanium studio and configure it this time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope this help. Keep me posted. Cheers</p>

										<p><p>It might be because you&#39;re running on Windows 7 x64. My study partner, who&#39;s learning Titanium with me, just could not get Titanium installed and running correctly on her machine. She ended up getting a 32 bit machine and installed Windows 7 x32 on it. Now everything works. If you take a look at the compatibility matrix, Android dev on Titanium will only work on Windows 32 bit. http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Titanium+Compatibility+Matrix</p>

<p>Figured it out by using Process Monitor watching processes TitaniumStudio.exe and python.exe. There I saw that phython is trying to access C:\…\necessitas\gdb-7.2\python\DLLs. Then typed &quot;set&quot; to see where this path is coming from.</p>

							<p>For Mac Os X users. None of the solutions above helped me. So, I opened Applications&#x2F;Utilities&#x2F;Console and then Titanium-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Titanium Studio-&gt;Titanium. After clicking &quot;browse&quot; for &quot;Android SDK Directory&quot; and seeing an error I found out an error in Console which said that Titanium was looking for the file &quot;avd.py&quot; in my sdk directory. So, copying the &quot;android&quot; directory from &quot;mobilesdk&quot; to my sdk directory fixed the problem.<br>In any case, if you still have this error, I suggest looking what console shows, it really can help.</p>

										<p><p>I wonder whether anyone at Appcelerator things it might be a good idea to document this. It seems completely arbitrary and random, but this worked for me as well. The criticality of this particular SDK should be documented or, just in case it is and I missed it, documented more prominently.</p>

<p>-Run Titanium Studio as Administrator</p>
<p>-Select the main directory of your Android sdk installation using the Browse button</p>

							<p>Yep windows 7 64bit . Ties EVERYTHING above and no joy. COME ON Appcelerator please help out this topic! You&#39;ve got (currently) a stellar reputation for support, why is this thread so long? If I can&#39;t get this going as a single developer, I can&#39;t recommend it to my company to adopt! A little help?</p>

							<p>Hey,</p>
<p>I had the same problem in Windows 7. It seems that Titanium is trying to read from android-7 directory.</p>
<p>Method 1 :<br>Go to you Android installation folder (e.g. C:\Android\android-sdk\platforms).<br>Create and empty directory under platforms folder and named it &quot;android-7&quot;. </p>
<p>Method 2 :<br>Open SDK Manager and install Android 2.1(API 7)</p>
<p>Restart Titanium studio and go to configuration…it should pick up the api&#39;s.</p>

										<p><p>have you added the android-sdk&#x2F;platform-tools directory to the path… as per last post?… If so then you may also need to copy adb file into the tools directory as well as the platform-tools directory.</p>

										<p><p>Are yes the old unix &#x2F; osx conundrum.</p>
<p>You need to apply the .profile. Easiest way restart the computer then when it logs you in it will have the path. Hopefully this is all it is.</p>

<p>I made sure that my android package versions matched up with the original poster. I had placed the paths in PATH in my profile file but I didn&#39;t do a restart. After these steps and restarting my computer I was finally able to successfully point to the android sdk.</p>

										<p><p>I misunderstood this comment when I first read it as meaning to reinstall all of studio, which I did and which didn&#39;t resolve the issue for me (on OSX). Rereading it, I just realized that it was the<br>\library\application support\titanium\mobilesdk that you renamed. When I did that, Titanium updated the SDK and the issue was resolved!<br>I agree, however, I still don&#39;t know what happened or why I had to do that - especially when I fully reinstalled studio. Thanks for the post!</p>

							<p>It&#39;s most likely the bug described here and fixed for the next release http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TISTUD-422</p>
<p>It&#39;s throwing this error because Studio expects the directory $ANDROID_SDK&#x2F;platforms&#x2F;android-7 and its contents to exist.</p>
<p>To fix this, install &quot;SDK Platform Android 2.1, API 7&quot; using tools&#x2F;Android.bat (on windows. There should be a similar tool on the Mac as well). I had this issue, and this fixed it for me.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m using Titanium Studio on OpenSuSE linux 11.3 (KDE, 64) atm and ran into the same issue, though I never had this particular problem on my Win Vista64 setup or on my Mac OSX 10.6. Creating an $ANDROID_SDK&#x2F;platforms&#x2F;android-7 worked for me too. Think its safe to say that this fix works.</p>

							<p>I have the same problem on Windows 7.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have added the Variables (PATH to the SDK, tools and platform-tools and I created a variable android_sdk with the Path to the sdk).</li>
<li>I installed the sdk for 2.1 (android-7) and above, so the android-7 platform folder exists.</li>
<li>I even tryed to copy adb (and the corresponding dll files) to the tools directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>I had no luck to get this running on my machine. Any further ideas?</p>
