							<p>When asking a question like this, you really need to provide information about your development environment. OS and version, platform and version, mobile sdk version, studio version, etc. This will help you get an answer to you question, much much faster.</p>

							<p>Anthony is correct, need some details.<br>In a general answer, if you have loaded your project down with mp3s, video, or even just left extra .PSDs sitting around in there, when the final file is built, the emulator will refuse to accept it.  In reality, large data should be downloaded separately, on first run, after the initial installation.</p>

							<p>Assuming you are trying to run on android here….</p>
<p>I had this when my app size went over the 64mg which is the default sdcard size created by titanium. You can use the tool @ &lt;AndroidSDK&gt;&#x2F;Tools&#x2F;mksdcard to create a larger sdcard and replace the default one created by titanium in &lt;user&gt;&#x2F;.titanium&#x2F;android2.sdcard (on os x, not sure where it is on windows). Alternatively you could probably hack the android source to create a larger one.</p>

										<p><p>Try deleting the android2.sdcard and recreating the emulator machine. Other than that we&#39;ll need more info to get any further.</p>

										<p><p>check you have the correct Android SDK&#39;s installed and selected in TiStudio (open tiapp.xml and select configure down the bottom), other than that not enough info to help. but sounds like you managed to go backwards a bit:)</p>
