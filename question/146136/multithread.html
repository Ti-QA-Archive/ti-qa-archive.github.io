							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I do not think this possible - a quick check of the docs did not show anything, plus having asynchronous db calls would become very fractured and possible break or corrupt the database.</p>
<p>I would imagine the issue is one of two things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Not actually the db but what you do with that info, place a console log above and below the execute line to include the current time with seconds, does this show a large difference, if no then it is what you are doing with the data .  If yes see next point.</li>
<li>ask for less data and page results, if you have so much data returned that you have to noticeably wait for it then you are returning too much data, if you are returning less than a hundred rows and it is slow see next point.</li>
<li>Any columns that appear in a where clause MUST be indexed in the database.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all standard questions and points for any language on any dev system for any platform.</p>

										<p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I saw this response : </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">
See <span class="hljs-keyword">http</span>://www.sqlite.org/faq.html<span class="hljs-comment">#q6 for limitations on using an sqlite3 * database handle from more than one thread. Effectively, you are allowed to reuse a database handle and statements across threads but one thread must be completely done accessing the database before the other thread starts (i.e. overlapping access is not safe). That sounds like what's happening for you and is consistent with the SQLITE_MISUSE error code.</span>

If you need <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> access <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> same database <span class="hljs-built_in">from</span> more than <span class="hljs-constant">one</span> thread, I recommend instead opening <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> database separately <span class="hljs-built_in">from</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">each</span> thread <span class="hljs-operator">and</span> setting <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> timeout <span class="hljs-keyword">using</span> sqlite3_busy_timeout(). Sqlite will <span class="hljs-keyword">then</span> handle contention <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> you, blocking <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">short</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">time</span> <span class="hljs-operator">in</span> <span class="hljs-constant">one</span> thread <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> other thread is writing data <span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> still allowing simultaneous reads.
</code></pre><p>so i see that we can use multiple thread in objective-c to open connection and exectute request to not block the UI.<br>is it a limitation of titanium ?</p>
<p>thanks</p>

										<p><p>I still have the same questions as asked before which you have not answered yet.</p>
<p>What are you doing that causes the app to stop when accessing the DB?</p>
<ul>
<li>How many records are in the database table&#x2F;select you are accessing that will cause this problem?</li>
<li>If you are accessing so many at once WHY?</li>
<li>Database access is fast on most devices so what sort of delay are you seeing?</li>
</ul>
<p>Async access is not actually recommend with SQLite due to the way the database is accessed, which is likely there is no current support for it here.</p>
