			<h1>XML_RSS Question</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am trying to pull data from an RSS feed into a tableview, just like the kitchen sink example (XML_RSS.js), however when I change the feed to my feed (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sfbay.craigslist.org&#x2F;apa&#x2F;index.rss), it gives me an alert with a typeError. As far as I can tell, the craigslist RSS feed is standard and exact to the kitchen sink source. I&#39;ve been trying to figure out the problem for hours, but I can&#39;t seem to find it. I saw a similar thread earlier where the new feed did not have images, but this one does.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>Yea, the 2 sources really aren&#39;t all that alike. From the kitchen sink demo you have a channel with a number of items in it. With CL, you have a channel with a list of item links in it, then the channel ends and you have a list of items and their descriptions. So the list of items you are probably accessing are just the rdf links, you need to access the items after the channel closes.</p>

<p>Thank you for that, I am now getting the feed! Just one more question: In the feed, I&#39;m getting a bunch of CDATA for the description. Do you know of a way to strip down this HTML code inside of the CDATA easily?</p>

										<p><p>You just need some crafty regex to pull the cdata out of there. Probably would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">/<span class="hljs-special">&amp;</span> lt;!<span class="hljs-command">\[</span>CDATA<span class="hljs-command">\[</span>.*?<span class="hljs-command">\]</span><span class="hljs-command">\]</span><span class="hljs-special">&amp;</span> gt;//g
</code></pre><p>I supposed translated to javascript, it would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">htmlstring.replace(/<span class="hljs-special">&amp;</span> lt;!<span class="hljs-command">\[</span>CDATA<span class="hljs-command">\[</span>.*?<span class="hljs-command">\]</span><span class="hljs-command">\]</span><span class="hljs-special">&amp;</span> gt;/g, "");
</code></pre><p><strong>NOTE: REMOVE THE SPACE BETWEEN THE AMPERSAND AND THE &#39;lt&#39; &amp; &#39;gt&#39;, I HAD TO PUT THEM THERE BECAUSE THE POST WAS TRANSLATING THEM TO &#39;&lt;&#39; &amp; &#39;&gt;&#39;</strong></p>
<p>Breakin&#39; it down Barney style, that should take your html description string and replace anything found within cdata tags with an empty string, globally (the final &#39;g&#39; in the regex).</p>
<p>If you need further insight into all that, I&#39;m going to tell you what I would tell anyone else, head over to w3schools and get skool&#39;d on some RegEx. Heres the link:  http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3schools.com&#x2F;jsref&#x2F;jsref_obj_regexp.asp</p>

										<p><p>All right, I marked it as best answer, but then I realized I have onneee more (albeit it quick I think) question on this topic. I have a different type of feed now:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sfbay.craigslist.org&#x2F;search&#x2F;apa?query=hello&amp;srchType=A&amp;minAsk=&amp;maxAsk=&amp;bedrooms=&amp;format=rss</p>
<p>For reference, this was the old feed:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sfbay.craigslist.org&#x2F;sub&#x2F;index.rss</p>
<p>How would I adapt the first thing to grab this? To me, it seems like the only difference from A to B is that the beginning starts with an XML tag, but how do I accomodate this?</p>
<p>Thanks man for all your help!</p>

										<p><p>Ok, so for future reference, just remember that the following will get you the document object of any xml response within your onload event:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">document</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.responseXML.documentElement;
</code></pre><p>From there, now all you need is the xml node that is the top level node of each &#39;thing&#39; that you want out of the xml. In your case, in both instances, that node is the &#39;item&#39; node. So all you need to do is query for any node named &#39;item&#39;.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> itemlist = <span class="hljs-built_in">document</span>.getElementsByTagName(<span class="hljs-string">'item'</span>);
</code></pre><p>Now you have an array of all the items you need. From there you just drill down into each item just like you are already doing. The idea is that as long as the list of &#39;things&#39; you need are within a node that has the name &#39;item&#39;, it doesn&#39;t matter where they fall in the xml, you will get an array of all of them returned. This works the same way in html, if you do a <code>document.getElementsByTagName(&amp;#39;a&amp;#39;)</code>, you will get an array of every link in the document, regardless of the structure of the DOM. </p>
<p>In the end, as long as you have any number of &#39;item&#39; nodes, you can loop through them and access the nodes within in the same manner as you have been using the existing nodes within each item (ie: title, description, etc.)</p>
<p>Make sense?</p>

										<p><p>Yeah, I thought I understood that, but when I load the new feed, it gives me an error at that line (var doc = this.responseXML.documentElement;)</p>
<p>Did you check the second feed? For some reason, Google Chrome does not recognize it as an XML feed like the first one, and that leads me to question whether or not that is the issue. Because it looks like, structurally, it is the same as the first feed, but Ti is throwing up errors left and right when I substitute the first feed with the second feed. </p>
<p>Again, here are the feeds in order:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sfbay.craigslist.org&#x2F;sub&#x2F;index.rss">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sfbay.craigslist.org&#x2F;sub&#x2F;index.rss</a></p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sfbay.craigslist.org&#x2F;search&#x2F;apa?query=hello&amp;srchType=A&amp;minAsk=&amp;maxAsk=&amp;bedrooms=&amp;format=rss">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sfbay.craigslist.org&#x2F;search&#x2F;apa?query=hello&amp;srchType=A&amp;minAsk=&amp;maxAsk=&amp;bedrooms=&amp;format=rss</a></p>
<p>Thanks Man.</p>

										<p><p>Yea, I had looked at both of them but not side by side. In looking at the source of the second one, it looks as though it coming back as plain text, even though its formatted as XML. The problem is with the way that CL is servings its dynamic RSS feed. I&#39;m guessing that they build out search results RSS dynamically with PHP and don&#39;t set the content type on the response. Knowing how CL is about their content and data, I would not be surprised if this was not an accident. They may do this on purpose so that developers like you wanting to extend their service, have a hard time doing so.</p>
<p>So while the error you are getting is not your fault, there is also not much you can do about it unfortunately. You can try setting the content-type on your xhr object (see docs for all the possible properties) but thats about it without creating some server side service to pull the CL feeds and re-serve them to yourself properly.</p>

										<p><p>Naturally this isn&#39;t built into Ti as this functionality comes native with properly formatted xml documents. But almost anything that you can do in javascript can be done within your app. That said, there is a reason that xml processors like expat are done in server side languages like PHP, Perl, or Java. This is a load that will probably weigh heavily on your app if done often. Thats not to say that a javascript processor doesn&#39;t exist, but you&#39;d have to find and test those to see if something worked for you. </p>
<p>In this instance, you may be better off using YQL to fetch and parse the data for you. It would be fast, simple, and the core functionality comes baked into the API at <code>Titanium.Yahoo</code></p>
<p>If you don&#39;t know about the Yahoo Query Language, then you can learn more about it here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.yahoo.com&#x2F;yql&#x2F;<br>You can also do live querying using their console here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.yahoo.com&#x2F;yql&#x2F;console</p>

										<p><p>Well I have been looking at the XML in my Chrome XML viewer, so I understand the structure. But, I don&#39;t see how I would change the code sample from kitchen sink. It looks to me that my only difference is my items are not children of channel, but siblings. However, the code sample only mentions channel once? If someone could just point me to one of my issues, I&#39;m sure I could get it from there.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>So I&#39;ve looked again, and it seems that the only major difference (there are a few structural difference but I&#39;ve accounted for those is that my feed is RDF and this is RSS. Does the kitchen sink not work for RDF? How can I accomodate RDF?</p>
