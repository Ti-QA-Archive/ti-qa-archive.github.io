							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I believe the official Appcelerator Sales Force&#39; module is licensed under commercial terms - so you would need to contact Appcelerator Sales or your Appcelerator representative on the assumption you have a commercial account directly with Appcelerator.</p>

										<p><p>My mistake - the original launch of the Salesforce solutions were Enterprise only and as the module does not appear on the Titanium modules list or the 64 bit modules list I assumed that it was still Enterprise only.</p>
<p>As you did not provide a direct link I did not take the extra time to manually search for it due to the reason above.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;836#!overview">SalesForce Toolkit for Appcelerator</a> for everyone else&#39;s convenience </li>
</ul>
<p>At this point you should be using the market place supplied support information.  This directs the question specifically to Sales Force as noted.  This is a job for the module provider and would then obviously appear as an update to the product you have already downloaded.</p>
<p>As I mentioned it does not appear on the modules that Appcelerator themselves are in control off.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-18092">Rebuild modules for 64-bit architectures</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I suggest you get in touch with them as soon as possible as all new apps need to support 64 bit by Feb 1st and updates by June 1st.  Very little time to waste.</p>

										<p><p>There is another version of the module, this time listed by Appcelerator themselves.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;6746#!overview">Salesforce Mobile Pack Connector</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This might be closer to what you were referring too.  Again; as no links were provided I am left simply guessing.</p>
<p>This is also marked as free but this time it is supported by Appcelerator themselves.  Which makes it more curious that it has not made it to the 64 bit conversion list or the;</p>

										<p><p>As I listed two different modules, please confirm which. </p>
<p>I have contacted someone in Appcelerator engineering the same question.  I will let you know if I hear anything back, given it is the weekend they are not working of course.</p>
