			<h1>Alloy - Can&#39;t find files in &#34;lib&#34; folder on Android, but iOS works fine</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi!</p>
<p>In one of my controllers I include a file like so:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Ti.<span class="hljs-keyword">include</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"common.js"</span>);
</code></pre><p>The file is located in <code>&amp;#x2F;app&amp;#x2F;lib</code></p>
<p>This works fine in iOS. On Android, however, the file isn&#39;t found.<br>LogCat show me that the app is looking for the file in <code>Resources&amp;#x2F;alloy&amp;#x2F;controllers&amp;#x2F;common.js</code> so obviously Android handles folders differently and doesn&#39;t look in &#x2F;app&#x2F;lib&#x2F; by default as on iOS.</p>
<p>Thus, I change the reference to:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Ti.<span class="hljs-keyword">include</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"../lib/common.js"</span>);
</code></pre><p>But the app still can&#39;t find the file!</p>
<p>If I check the generated Resources folder, there is in no <code>lib</code> in <code>alloy</code>.<br>In fact, if I search for common.js in the entire project, the file is nowhere to be found!</p>
<p>It seems that Titanium Studio isn&#39;t including the file in the build at all! I&#39;ve tried this both in Mac OS and in Windows and the result is the same.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

							<div><p>I mostly use the CommonJS way already, but I had a couple of libraries that were already written the include way, and it was simply easier to include them rather than rewriting them.</p>
<p>But is there any particular reason why include shouldn&#39;t be used?</p>

							<div><p>CommonJS offers speed benefits, because your modules are read, syntax-checked, and evaluated only once then cached for future reuse. They offer scope advantages (you won&#39;t accidentally overwrite variables defined in your calling file). And they let you create objects with explicitly exposed properties and methods. Thus, it&#39;s relatively easy to create reusable &quot;black box&quot; components that can be dropped into multiple projects.</p>
<p>Included files are re-read, syntax checked, and evaluated each time you call Ti.include(). There is no caching. Variable scoping within the include file is confusing. Plus all variables created in an include file are exposed to the calling context, leading to possible naming collisions. It&#39;s much harder to create reusable components that are truly independent of their original project using the include file pattern.</p>

							<div><p>Sounds reasonable.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#39;ll take the time to port the old files over, then. They aren&#39;t very large so it should be done fairly quickly.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>The contents of the lib (and assets) folder are copied to the root of your project. You should see your common.js in the generated Resources folder. On Android, it helps to add the leading slash to all local file paths (doing so will still work on iOS). Have you tried using <code>Ti.include(&amp;#39;&amp;#x2F;common.js&amp;#39;);</code>?</p>

							<p>Nevermind.</p>
<p>After spending hours on this problem I finally solved it right after posting this question, and it was embarrasingly simple.</p>
<p>Apparently files in &#x2F;lib&#x2F; are copied straight to &#x2F;. However, on iOS, if you use <code>Ti.include(&amp;#39;file&amp;#39;);</code> it looks for <code>&amp;#x2F;file</code> while on Android it will look for <code>.&amp;#x2F;file</code>.</p>
<p>Thus, I simply had to add a forward slash before the filename like so: <code>Ti.include(&amp;#39;&amp;#x2F;common.js&amp;#39;);</code></p>
<p>And now it works!</p>
