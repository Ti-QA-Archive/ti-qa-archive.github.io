			<h1>Titanium Modules with Alloy?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I have a very basic question on understanding Titanium modules. My company is currently working on something that I would call an &quot;App Suite&quot;. The &quot;App Suite&quot; is a whole bunch of apps, all of which implement different parts of a business process. Some of the components we need to implement will be used multiple times in the same app, some others are needed in more than one app or even throughout the whole suite (e.g. adding events to a calendar). We know that this could be done using Alloy Widgets. However, on the one hand, we consider some of these components to be worth being implemented as modules and distributed via the marketplace, on the other hand we think that Alloy Widgets bear the disadvantage of storing the same source code multiple times (correct me if I&#39;m wrong as I haven&#39;t yet developed a widget). So we&#39;d rather go for Titanium Modules (i.e. packaged JavaScript modules), but as we value the benefits of using Alloy and wouldn&#39;t want to develop half-classic, half-Alloy style, we would only do this is if Titanium Modules could be implemented using Alloy. Is this possible?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Thomas</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Titanium JavaScript modules are built using Titanium not Alloy and you have to package up your module twice - if you plan on one for Android and one for iOS.</p>
<p>Widgets are useful as they are re-usable - but as you say they cannot be compiled so less suitable for sale to others.</p>
<p>The other thing to keep in mind is that a packaged module would not have access to the parent apps Alloy style sheet even using <strong>createStyle</strong>, <strong>addClass</strong> or <strong>removeClass</strong>.</p>
<p>Compiled modules (native or JavaScript) are for those things you want to separate out of the main app and maintain separately from everything else.</p>
<p>My suggestion is - focus on the benefits to your own project first and then look to see if there is any merit on building versions for sale.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your thoughts on this. The fact that you can&#39;t build modules using Alloy seems like a substantial disadvantage to me. We will then go for widgets, not modules.</p>

										<p><p>It really depends on what you would use compiled JavaScript modules for as most or for business rules and logic, methods, functions - rather than full UI.  So for that reason the lack of Alloy is irrelevant.  If however your use case is a feature rich UI in the module then I fully understand how you can miss the benefits of Alloy in the module creation process.</p>
<p>Widgets are great though (although not the ideal for your specific needs), we use them to section off logically app sections - they are always stand-alone and have no dependencies beyond the use of very generic styles that we would always add to our app.tss and optionally link to CommonJS modules that are shared across the project.</p>
<p>Very easy way to split up app development over a team as well.</p>
