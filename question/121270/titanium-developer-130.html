			<h2 id="this-is-a-tidev-1-3-0">This is a TiDEV 1.3.0</h2>
<p>If you are wondering &quot;why should I switch to Titanium Studio is the only thing interesting in this new IDE is debugging (which is not free)&quot; or is one of several people who did not like the Titanium Studio, for whatever their reasons, and want to continue using the TiDev but should have read this: &quot;Titanium Developer has Been Replaced by Titanium Studio. Although the source code remains open source, we will no longer be Maintaining this code or releasing any new versions.&quot; do not worry because the community should continue the project.</p>
<p>I decided to start it, and I&#39;m making big changes.</p>
<p><img src="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.dropbox.com&#x2F;u&#x2F;12145036&#x2F;tidev130a.png &quot;Titanium Developer 1.3.0a&quot;" alt="Titanium Developer 1.3.0a"><br><em>Open image in new window to see in 100%</em></p>
<p>I&#39;m working on it, and i will put all changes in this repo very soon:</p>
<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;adrianopaladini&#x2F;titanium_developer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;adrianopaladini&#x2F;titanium_developer</a></p>
<p><strong>Some of the improvements:</strong></p>
<p>-No Community Perspective (useless)</p>
<p>-No Ads (All advertisements are old and not good for anything)</p>
<p>-Universal Build</p>
<p>-works with mobileSDK 1.8.0</p>
<p>-Device selector to run</p>
<p>-button to launch forced full compile</p>
<p>-a File list of project with code editor</p>
<p><strong>and a lot of more!</strong></p>
<p>if you want help, just giving ideas or even making updates to the code, is very welcome!</p>

<p>I&#39;m working on TiDev Community 2.0.</p>
<p>It is being done from scratch.</p>
<p>Completely reworked, very small, fast and easy to use.</p>
<p>I will put some screens soon.</p>
<p>So that is already usable, I will post a link to the source code.</p>

							<p>I have been involved in reworking TiDev into TideSDK-Developer with the necessary changes to accomodate the breaking changes in TideSDK-1.3.0-beta. This will be offered with the downloads of the TideSDK together with the TideSDK documentation. </p>
<p>The updated TideSDK Developer is available for developers <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;TideSDK&#x2F;TideSDK-Developer">here</a></p>
<p>Or you can wait the short wait until the official <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tidesdk.org">TideSDK</a> release :)</p>

							<p>Adriano, I really like to work with you on this in terms of design. I have already started working on some new design ideas but can&#39;t fully implement it myself. I also have a new icon. If you have Twitter, contact me at @VorteXLP please. If not, please reply with your e-mail address :)</p>

<p>I do not believe that removing the require of online use would be an improvement, since the analitics and especially the compilation of a desktop application require this.<br>we can maybe think about how to make a choice for users…</p>

							<p>Looking good thus far, except for one rather important thing.<br>I can&#39;t comment on the Linux&#x2F;OSX versions, but the current Windows release is sluggish to the point of frustration. Anyone else noticing this?<br>One of our other in-house developers had the same problem during testing. Simply couldn&#39;t get anything done. It was simply too heavy.<br>Could well be the new graphics added to it.</p>

							<p>One of the reasons me (and my company) chose Titanium Developer was that it didn&#39;t try to be anything more than it needed, no editor, no IDE. Too bad appcelerator is forcing us to use their studio, as I prefer editing my code on my own terms, as I&#39;m sure many others do.</p>
<p>That said, thanks for this. Though I&#39;m not sure if this is &quot;future proof&quot;. Will the changes appcelerator makes to their APIs be available in TiDev Community right away?</p>

							<p>I think it is not in the interest of Appcelerator to treat the TiDev Community as second class citizens, and I dont think they will, you can check the evolution of the API on the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;index.html">continuous build page</a>.</p>

							<p>Is there a way to have one project which is universal for iPhone and iPad and also has ability to build for Android?</p>
<p>At the moment if I create mobile project I see small iPhone app when running on iPad simulator.</p>
<p>If I create universal iOS project iPad app looks fine but there is no ability to run for Android.</p>

							<p>Thank You. After struggling to get the Java Monster to behave (500MB+ of memory and growing) I had a look around and found the old Developer still alive and kicking.</p>
<p>Personally I think that the Eclipse route was a big mistake for Appcelerator. It would be nice if they could explain the thinking behind the move.</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve been absent from the Titanium Community for the past half-year or so. Is it correct that currently TiDev Community is available in Version 1.3.03 and that this version does not support iOS 5.1? TiDev 2.0 does not yet seem to be available and in 1.3.03 I cannot select 5.1 from the iOS SDK pulldown.</p>
<p>I am running OS X 10.7.3 with XCode 4.3.2 and Titanium SDK 2.0.1.GA2.</p>

										<p><p>Nevermind, my bad. It works when you change the XCode location.</p>
<p>For those having the same problem, the XCode location changed for 4.3.2 (Lion release) because it&#39;s installed by the App Store into the &#x2F;Applications directory. Run this command in your Terminal (and maybe restart TiDev) and you should be good to go:<br><code>sudo xcode-select -switch &amp;#x2F;Applications&amp;#x2F;Xcode.app&amp;#x2F;Contents&amp;#x2F;Developer</code>.</p>
<p>Thank you Adriano for your work on TiDev Community, I&#39;m quite happy not to use the Studio as I never code in an IDE. Keep up the good work, can&#39;t wait for 2.0.</p>

							<p>TideSDK does not allow for building mobile apps. Tidev 2 would have done desktop + mobile. That is what I&#39;m waiting for. Plus: Tidesdk in this 1.3.x version does not do anything more than the feature of Tidev 1.3 building for desktop. A shame.</p>

										<p><p>Well, <em>theoritically</em>, you could re-wire the existing code to make use tf the Titanium Command Line Interface CLI. This would probably  be the best way to have access to all the latest titanium feature set.</p>
