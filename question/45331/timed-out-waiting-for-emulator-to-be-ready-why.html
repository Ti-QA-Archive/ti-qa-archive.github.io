		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I get this error:</p>
<p>[ERROR] Timed out waiting for emulator to be ready, you may need to close the emulator and try again</p>
<p>When I try and launch the Android emulator, it can take 10 attempts then it will work and carry on working, it just seems to take half my life to get it started!</p>
<p>Anyone come across this before?</p>
<p>It often comes up before I even get past the text Android logo &#x2F; black screen.</p>
<p>Doesn&#39;t seem to happen if I get as far as the locked screen and never seems to happen if I have swiped or pressed menu on the locked screen to unlock it. But I often don&#39;t get even that far!</p>
<p>Very frustrating, your help appreciated. I&#39;m out of ideas. Yes I have re-installed and updated the Android SDK.</p>

							<p>If this happens, let the emulator start up and unlock the screen.  Once the emulator is started up and ready, hit &quot;Launch App&quot; in Titanium Developer to relaunch your application to the running emulator.  Unlike iPhone, you can leave the Android emulator running while you edit code, and then just hit the &quot;launch&quot; button in Developer to deploy your changes.  This is quite a bit faster, because as you noted the Android emulator can take a while to start up.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, I had the same problem on Windows 7 Home Premium, worked like a charm. I think the problem might have started when I didn&#39;t close the emulator correctly because I had forgotten to install Java, and the emulator may have been running. Not sure, but whatever caused it, this definitely helped.</p>

							<p>Found the problem, the android tool creates the AVD in the E:\.android when it should be in C:\Documents and Settings\{user}\.android</p>

										<p><p>Found a fix, create a global environment variable called ANDROID_SDK_HOME and set it to C:\Documents and Settings\{user}</p>
<p>Ir Worked for me, you can check in the android AVD tool where it show in which directory it is looking for AVDs.</p>

							<p>Not as brutal as killing processes, but still a little annoying, open your AVD manage (I used Eclipse to get to mine) and delete your listed devices EXCEPT the one Titanium generates automatically and then try to launch again from the Titanium developer.  </p>
<p>Fixed things nicely for me in terms of an emulator error, but now I get a &quot;[ERROR] Failed installing com.appcelerator.kitchensink: pkg: &#x2F;data&#x2F;local&#x2F;tmp&#x2F;app.apk&quot; error.</p>
<p>Moving to the next level of debugging.</p>
