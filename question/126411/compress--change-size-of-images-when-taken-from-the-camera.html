			<h1>Compress / Change Size of Images when taken from the camera</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>According to this Jira issue, Appcelerator are&#x2F;will be working on a module to support resizing&#x2F;compressing images taken from the camera.</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-4141</p>
<p>I know about the mostly undocumented methods on TiBlob, but looking for a cross platform solution, that will allow images to be resized&#x2F;compressed.</p>
<p>Anyone know if it&#39;s possible to gain insight into when Appcelerator might be working&#x2F;releasing these things?</p>

							<p>OK I have been looking at this today as well.</p>
<p>Firstly to get an issue higher up the fixing order, you need to have people watch it. The more people watching and chasing the quicker it will be fixed.</p>
<p>Secondly I saw a post it was from a while ago now which said if you created an image view you can then specify the sizes of the image and either save out or post up to the server the variable which the image was created in.</p>
<p>Haven&#39;t tried it yet but it does sound quite feasible.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>T.</p>

							<p>I have resized images by adding them to a imageView that is smaller than the image and the converting the imageView to a blob. It did not compress the image, but it made it small enough for me to upload the images without a timeout</p>

										<p><p>Did this work on Android as well as iOS?  I seem to remember reading on this Q&amp;A that it didn&#39;t work on Android, and I&#39;m sure I tried it myself at one stage and the blob I get back from the imageView is always the same size as the original image? When you say you convert it to a blob, do you mean you just call toBlob on the imageView?</p>
<p>Thanks<br>Martin</p>

										<p><p>Actually, maybe I had that the wrong way around.  Using ImageView.toBlob on iOS seems to return the original sized blob, but you&#39;re right, on Android, it seems to return a TiBlob with the same dimensions as the ImageView.</p>
<p>On iOS, toImage seems to return a TiBlob with the same dimensions as the ImageView.</p>
