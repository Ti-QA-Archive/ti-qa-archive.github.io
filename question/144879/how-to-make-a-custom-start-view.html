							<p>You can make a splash screen that has the components in the image. The components won&#39;t be usable, but it will look like they are actually there. But you can&#39;t actually make components display during or before the splash screen.</p>

										<p><p>This will work great in iOS with its (relatively) uniform screen densities and strict component look&#x2F;feel.  I can&#39;t imagine trying to make this work on android, though, where you have a plethora of screen sizes and densities, and manufacturers&#39; skins on the UI components.</p>

										<p><p>Jason makes an excellent point here. Bottom line, there is a splash screen for a reason. Its to load everything you are going to need for that main screen. As I said, you can try and fake it, but in the end, its all just going to be a work around solution to what you are trying to do. Embrace the splash screen, keep your load times low and the splash screen will barely be noticeable.</p>

							<p>You can remove the splash screen and design a separate window put your component in there and show that window, now after some delay open your main window. This is the way to have a custom start screen and it gives the feeling of a splash screen.</p>

							<p>You can remove the splash screen and put your component in your main window and after some delay hide them and unhide everything you want to show in your first window. This way you have a custom start screen and it gives the feeling of a splash screen and you do not need to create multiple windows.</p>
