			<h1>Networking 2 (or more) devices</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hi all! I&#39;d like a bit of advice on connecting devices together to perform certain actions… This could be applied to a variety of features… i.e. a multiplayer game, a &#39;chat&#39; system, a media sharing system (like bump).. etc.</p>
<p>Really, I have ideas about how this could be done, but I&#39;m unsure as to what the best way would be.</p>
<p>Is there a way to connect devices just using the carriers? so the devices talk to each other, without a &#39;middle-man&#39;, and any transferring information is stored in each device individually? or is a better way going to be to actually set up a remote server to sit between the 2 devices, for example, a LAMP based web-hosting server, which stores information in a MySQL database, and then receives requests and sends data from and to both devices?</p>
<p>If anyone has attempted this type of connection before, any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>i will tell you my option.</p>
<p>I make a project similar to your request for a client.</p>
<p>I build iPhone and android app that use webservice for sync with his website. this means if you enter data from client web site that data will be reflected to the mobile app when you login with your mobile app. to build good connection between your app and your server you should be good at web services for security and performance issues.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you Emrah! that helps! I am a web developer by trade, now getting into app&#39;s, so web services for me are not a problem :)</p>
<p>I notice you are talking about remote data, from a web service to 1 device. Would you do the same for 2 devices talking to each other? so: device 1 needs to send some data to device 2…. first device 1 would send data to a web server, then the web server sends that data on to device 2 who is &#39;listening&#39; for data from the web server?</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Dan! It looks like that is to connect two devices within a local network? I&#39;m looking to connect devices around the world. A good tutorial to read through though! Thanks!</p>

										<p><p>There is also a bump module for iOs only, within the Ti+ modules, but for a cross-platform solution I think Emrah gave u the perfect idea :)<br>And yes, the server would be the middle-man.</p>

							<p>I just found this video that may help.  It uses nowJS to communicate between browsers and devices:</p>
