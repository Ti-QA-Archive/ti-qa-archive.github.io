			<h1>Modal calling a modal</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>I&#39;m hoping someone can help me out with my problem.</p>
<p>My app is made up of a tab group with 4 windows.  These windows use the &#39;url&#39; property to get the code for each of the windows.  Once one of the windows is loaded the user can click on a button to add a new record.  This causes a new window to load as a modal.  The modal is nice because it provides the &#39;back&#39; button without to much effort.</p>
<p>On this modal if the user clicks a button it will open another modal.  When the second modal is launched it causes the first modal to automatically close.  This is my problem.  I wanted the second modal to overlay the first modal and when the second modal is closed then the first modal will be displayed.  This is similar functionality to the adding an event to the calendar on the iPhone.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried everything I can think of to prevent the first modal from closing when the second is opened, but I can&#39;t stop it.</p>
<p>Is there an issue of having a window modal call another window modal?  If so is there a work around available?</p>
<p>I&#39;m using titanium sdk 1.6.0, but I&#39;ve tried other versions and they all have the same problem. </p>
<p>Thank you for help.</p>

							<p>Well, isn&#39;t that the way it goes?  Once you post something you find the answer.  </p>
<p>I believe I&#39;ve figure out the functionality that I wanted without using modals.</p>
<p>This came from finding some similar functionality in the Kitchen Sink app.</p>
<p>The trick is to use Titanium.UI.currentTab.open(w,{animated:true}); The animated:true is just for fun.  This gives me the functionality I was looking for without having to use modals.</p>

										<p><p>ha! glad you found that. I was about to suggest &#39;normal&#39; window opening. Modal windows, by definition, can&#39;t have other windows opened over them. ;)</p>
