			<h1>takePicture with overlay is slow -- maybe focus related?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve got a camera app where I want to allow the user to snap off a bunch of photos in a row.  Currently testing on iOS.  It has a custom overlay, autohide: false, etc.  When you hit the Take Picture button instead of snapping the photo the app instead seems to start focusing.  This delays the picture up to 5 seconds.</p>
<p>Any suggestions on speeding up the picture taking?  Is there a way to take multiple pictures in a row with the standard UI (instead of a custom overlay?).</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;ve tried looking at the Kitchen Sink app and that seems to not do the focusing after the Take Picture button is pushed.  I&#39;m wondering if this is a bug when using an Alloy view as the overlay?</p>

							<p>Quick update for anybody else having this issue - I tried using Titanium code to make the overlay instead of an Alloy view and it appears that actually fixed the issue?</p>

										<p><p>Sorry, I stand corrected… I now see that its the stuff I&#39;m doing after the takePicture, in the success method of the showCamera.  If I take out that code I can take many pictures in quick succession.  Add the code back in and there&#39;s a long pause in between each picture.</p>

										<p><p>Anybody looking for an answer - I reasked this again in a different way recently and finally figured it out.<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;161888&#x2F;photo-taking-and-upload-speed</p>
<p>Basically just store the photo in memory and don&#39;t do anything else with it.<br>Then have a timer running in the background that constantly checks in memory for photos to process.</p>
