			<h1>Distributing an iOS app internally for testing</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have an app that I&#39;d like to distribute to several testers so that they can install it on their iPhone. On the Android side, it was as easy as putting the .apk file somewhere and sending them a link. I can&#39;t find any such process for iOS. I know Apple is more strict about what can make it onto their devices and how, but is there anyway to give my iPhone users a copy of the app to test on their devices?</p>
<p>I don&#39;t have an iPhone, myself, so I can&#39;t do it locally. Plus, I&#39;d like other eyes.</p>
<p>Do I have any options?</p>

							<p>I&#39;d suggest you look at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.testflightapp.com&#x2F;">Test Flight</a> and Appcelerator integration of it documented <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.0&#x2F;index.html#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;TestFlight">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can do it without Test Flight (and in fact I do), but you need to be more familiar with the hoops Apple makes you jump through.  </p>

										<p><p>Seconded.  We used our own test system for a while but settled on Testflight as it was just easier to collect device ids and add to a profile enmass.  </p>
<p>But distribution is only one leg of Testflight.  We use their SDK during testing to see if testers are accessing all areas of the application.  Access to crash logs has been invaluable for us as well.</p>
<p>They were recently bought by an analytics company and are rolling out their TestFlight live.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure Apple will be thrilled if we submit an app and forget to turn off some of the analytics (Appcelerator, Google, TestFlight)</p>

										<p><p>Should mention that there is a <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;744?1012577690">Testflight Module</a> in the Marketplace if you don&#39;t want to roll your own.</p>
<p>Ruben has been great with updating his module when Testflight changes their SDK.</p>

										<p><p>And as an aside regarding paid modules, for $10,  it would cost me a heck of a lot more to write it myself or put one of my guys on it.</p>

							<p>There is also an easier solution:<br>You copy your ipa file and a manifest on a web server. Then you make a QR code with URL.<br>The tester starts a QR-Reaqder and scans the code. If you install a little Javaqscriptcode in your index.html, then a popup appears &quot;Do you want install?&quot;</p>
<p>Ist all-</p>

										<p><p>you can also use &quot;iOS Beta Builder&quot; to generate html code.<br>In this HTML is link to manifest (&lt;a href=&quot;&quot; &gt;).<br>In body you insertz &lt;body onload=&quot;self.location=&#39;THIS PATH TO MANIFEST&#39;;&quot;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
