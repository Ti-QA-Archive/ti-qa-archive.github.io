			<h1>Handling input from multiple views in Android</h1>

		<section>
			<p>I am trying to have two buttons on my screen with different things happening depending on the combination of presses on these button (eg, one button pressed or both buttons pressed). However, when one button (lets refer to it as button1) is pressed and I press anywhere else on the screen, it is still button1 that fires its event for button presses.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve even tried writing my own module to get around this, but I just don&#39;t think I understand enough about how titanium work to find the solution.<br>And so I come to you to hear if anybody know the solution?</p>

							<p>Eventhough I posted this question earlier today, I&#39;ve been without a solution to this for about 3 days, searching the internet thin. As I&#39;ve been unable to find the answer, I will answer the question myself as I now have a solution.</p>
<p>The problem is due to event ownership. In early versions of Android, the default behavior was that the first touched element reserved the screen for other input, thus making it possible to make gestures on small elements, as long as they were the first to get touched.<br>In honeycomb (API level 11+) this changed, and the default became that every event, no matter if other fingers are touching the screen, is executed on the touched element. It is called SplitTouch on the window. More can be read about it <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;reference&#x2F;android&#x2F;R.attr.html#windowEnableSplitTouch">here on the Android Docs</a></p>
<p>In order to change this to be on by default, we need to change the targetSdkVersion to 11 or higher. A targetSdkVersion is not defined by Titanium, and as such it defaults back to minSdkVersion, which Titanium by default sets to 10.<br>By adding </p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">manifest</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">uses-sdk</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">android:minSdkVersion</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"11"</span>/&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">manifest</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>to the android element in the tiapp.xml, we will get the desired behavior.</p>
<p>You are now able to have multitouch on different views (eg. buttons) in a window.</p>
