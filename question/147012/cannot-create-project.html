										<p><p>Yes I&#39;ve been trying to create it in studio. I installed node.js 0.8.17 and tried to create a project in the command line, I get &quot;…&quot; and pressing enter, or typing something in just results in &quot;…&quot; appearing on the next line. I did add node.exe in preferences in titanium studio.</p>

										<p><p>By that you mean add -v to the shortcuts comments? If so that doesn&#39;t work. If you mean type titanium -v into command prompt that returns &quot;3.0.22&quot; if you mean run that in node.js it says titanium is not defined.</p>

										<p><p>I meant at the command line, but this is good! You have 3.0.22 installed. That means you have node.js installed properly and your paths are working.</p>
<p>So, now you should be able to run <code>titanium create</code> to create your new app.</p>

										<p><p>We&#39;re a little puzzled as to what is going on. What version of Titanium Studio are you using?</p>
<p>One idea, if you&#39;re using Studio 3.0 or newer, is to use the new bug reporting feature. It&#39;s in Studio&#39;s menu under Help &gt; Titanium Studio &gt; Submit a Ticket. This will send us some diagnostic data along with the bug. Please add the URL for this Q&amp;A question to the &quot;steps to reproduce&quot; so that we can follow up.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

										<p><p>…..<em>sigh</em> so the ticket tool crashes. I have at this point done a fresh install of Titanium as well as installed it my other computer, that computer has the same error except instead of C:\&gt; its E:\&gt; as it is installed on the E drive. The error message I receive when attempting to submit a ticket is:<br>{&quot;errorMessages&quot;:[&quot;Unrecognized character escape &#39;&gt;&#39; (code 62)\n at [Source: org.apache.catalina.connector.CoyoteInputStream@72103ae; line 8, column 161]&quot;]}</p>

										<p><p>Ha, wow. Epic Studio fail.</p>
<p>OK, so we need a little bit of info.</p>
<p>What version of Titanium Studio are you running?</p>
<p>Are you running Windows Vista or XP or older? Titanium 3 only support Windows 7 or newer. It may work on older OSes, but it&#39;s not supported.</p>
<p>From the command line, find out the version of node.js installed. It should be 0.8 or newer. 0.6 won&#39;t cut it.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">node</span><span class="hljs-identifier"> </span><span class="hljs-title">-v</span>
</code></pre><p>Next run the following:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">titanium <span class="hljs-keyword">status</span>
</code></pre><p>This will tell us 3 important pieces of information. The first line says what version of the CLI you&#39;re using. It should be 3.0.22. Directly after the CLI version is the active Titanium SDK version which is probably 3.0.0.GA. If it does not output the Titanium SDK version, then see below. Lastly the status command indicates if you&#39;re logged into the Appcelerator Network. You must be logged in to create projects or build.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re not logged in, then run:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-title">titanium</span> login
</code></pre><p>If it did not show the Titanium SDK version, then you need to select an SDK. Start by running:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-title">titanium</span> sdk
</code></pre><p>This will print out all SDKs that are installed. To activate a particular SDK, run:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">titanium</span> <span class="hljs-tag">sdk</span> <span class="hljs-tag">select</span> 3<span class="hljs-class">.0</span><span class="hljs-class">.0</span><span class="hljs-class">.GA</span>
</code></pre><p>You can only select 3.0 or newer SDKs. Don&#39;t worry if you still have 2.x projects… the 3.0 SDKs will detect your project is a 2.x app from the tiapp.xml and automatically switch to the old 2.x compiler.</p>

										<p><p>I reinstalled Titanium Studio v3.0.1.201212181159 on my Windows 7 VM. I logged into Studio and proceeded to create a project. What&#39;s interesting is Studio only looks in your home directory&#39;s AppData\Roaming\Titanium directory for installed SDKs. I had to go into Studio&#39;s preferences and change this to &quot;C:\ProgramData\Titanium&quot; for Studio to see 3.0.0.GA in the list of installed SDKs. After I set that up, I was able to create and build a project just fine.</p>
<p>Verify that you have a &quot;C:\ProgramData\Titanium&quot; directory on your computer and that it contains &quot;mobilesdk\win32\3.0.0.GA&quot;, then set the Titanium Home SDK in the preferences to &quot;C:\ProgramData\Titanium&quot; and see if that fixes it.</p>

										<p><p>My SDK was in AppData, and thats where studio was looking for it. I put it in ProgramData and made the studio look for it there but nothing changed.</p>

							<p>We could turn on logging to see the exact command Studio is calling to create the project and check if running the same command from the command line works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Preferences &gt; Titanium Studio &gt; Troubleshooting page, change Debug Level to All, and make the entry com.aptana.core&#x2F;debug&#x2F;core checked;</li>
<li>Hit OK and restart Studio;</li>
<li>Try to create the project again to generate the error;</li>
<li>Open the Studio log file via Help &gt; Titanium Studio &gt; View Log File;</li>
<li>Look toward the end of the log to find the command to create the project; it should be something like &quot;node &lt;titanium_path&gt; –no-banner … create …&quot;. Then copy-and-paste the command into the command line to see what output it generates.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
