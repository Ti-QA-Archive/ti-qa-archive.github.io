			<h1>Request for ability to exclude files/folders from packaging</h1>

		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m building a Titanium Desktop application and using CVS as a source control system. Of course, there are CVS folders sprinkled throughout my code directory structure.  Unfortunately, those folders are included when I package my application.  It would be great if those folders were excluded automatically or, better still, a mechanism could be added to specify files and&#x2F;or folders to exclude from the distribution package.</p>

										<p><p>I did take a look at tibuild.py.  It appears there are options for excluding files from packages when you use the command line utility for building.  I use the Cloud Packaging utility in Titanium Developer (which uses tibuild.py) and it definitely does not exclude CVS folders.  I don&#39;t really want to get into using the command line utility because I want to target both Windows and Mac which would require having Python available for building from two environments which is very inconvenient.</p>

							<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Till today 29th Oct 2012 is there any option provided in Titanium for the project configuration settings or in the command line build script for excluding some of the un-required project folder&#x2F; files from the Final Installer Package Build (App.msi) file, when packaging the Windows Desktop Application Build in Titanium? </p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
