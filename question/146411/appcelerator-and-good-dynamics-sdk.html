							<p>I just briefly looked at the Good Dynamics developer site, but it looks as though they have a native sdk. So, using this SDK you can build a native Titanium module. See the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Extending_Titanium_Mobile">Module Development Guides</a> for information on how to do this.</p>

							<p>Hi Jon, I have looked for Good Dynamics SDK their use case implementation… though they have native SDK available but, they require everything to be done with their customized window object.</p>
<p>So mainly Titanium Developer will be using Either Titanium window or Good Dynamics Module Window.</p>
<p>Rest one more thing is, they require Core Data Functionality…which needs to be done using programmatic approach.</p>
<p>SO yes there are possibility to make native module, but in that case actually Titanium SDK will be modified.</p>
<p>did not get much time to go deeper.. but yes i will look for more details as i get time.</p>
<p>though you can try, and update me also if something better approach you have.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for looking at this.  What do you mean by Titanium SDK will be modified?</p>

										<p><p>Titanium and Good Dynamics both have customized the native window object and there could be two possible ways…</p>
<p>1: Create a parallel window proxy for Good Dynamics Window and use it, also add this reference in Tiapp.h&#x2F;.m file and thus titanium sdk modified.</p>
<p>2: remove the already added window reference and provide the Good Dynamics Window reference only when Good Dynamics module is used again titanium sdk is being modified.</p>
<p>3: adding Good Dynamics Window as root without modifying Titanium Implemented Window(Native iOS or Android)—- I am working on it.</p>

										<p><p>Is it advisable to modify the SDK?  Where would I get the source from?  I haven&#39;t seen a link on your website to download the SDK source.</p>
<p>Your option 3 so if you can figure that out that would be helpful.</p>
<p>Thanks…</p>

										<p><p>Titanium SDK source is available at github <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_mobile">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_mobile</a>.</p>
<p>and it is not advisable to modify SDK as, no other developer will get benefit out of it until either Appcelerator Ship it also or Developer download from some web source and keep it parallel to Titanium SDK.</p>
<p>that is a difficult to manage if appcelerator does not provide it directly.</p>
<p>for option 3, i am trying some ways and that will be best.</p>

										<p><p>Bolo Ashish, app kaise hain?  Also wondering if you&#39;ve found a way to wrap a Titanium app with Good Dynamics SDK without mods to the SDK itself?  Or if anybody out there has a downloadable module which can do this?</p>

										<p><p>Hi William and Jon,<br>                                  Thank you for waiting so long, and sorry from my side to kept you guys waiting…<br>I found a way for Good Dynamics module also, actually two ways.</p>
<p>1: Shared Already by modifying SDK of Titanium.</p>
<p>2: Normal Module Development Approach, which needs Good Time efforts for complete SDK functionality support and Normal Time Efforts for Limited functionality support.</p>
<p>If you guys are still interested then do let me know using devmail, i can discuss this further .</p>
<p>I was quite busy and did not get time to work on this and reply here.</p>
