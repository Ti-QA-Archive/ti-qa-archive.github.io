			<h1>How to modify a DOM document?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Traversing the XML-Tree is no problem, this works fine.</p>
<p>I try to modify a DOM documment, which is created from a XML-File using &quot;parseString&quot;. I tried to change the node-text of a node that I read with</p>
<p>var KDNrNodes = DomIni.documentElement.getElementsByTagName(&#39;KDNR&#39;);<br>var KDNrNode = KDNrNodes.item(0);</p>
<p>KDNrNode.text is transfered to a textfield. When I try to store the textfields value to as node tex, that does&#39;t work. I tried</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">KDNrNode.text = EditKundenNummer.<span class="hljs-keyword">value</span>;
KDNrNode.nodeValue = EditKundenNummer.<span class="hljs-keyword">value</span>;
KDNrNode.setNodeValue(EditKundenNummer.<span class="hljs-keyword">value</span>);
</code></pre><p>but afterwords KDNrNode.text is unchanged. Is it possible, that the SOM document is &quot;read-only&quot; or what else I am doing wrong? Because of the VERY poor documentation it is very hard to find out something useful…</p>
<p>second I want to get rid of this stupid &quot;powered by Titanium&quot; window. I read something about removing the &quot;default.png&quot; image, but that didn&#39;t work! </p>

							<p>Maybe something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">//first remove old text <span class="hljs-keyword">node</span><span class="hljs-identifier">
</span><span class="hljs-title">KDNrNode</span>.removeChild(KDNrNode.firstChild);
//create new text <span class="hljs-keyword">node</span><span class="hljs-identifier">
</span><span class="hljs-title">var</span> textNode = DomIni.createTextNode(EditKundenNummer.value);
//add new text <span class="hljs-keyword">node</span><span class="hljs-identifier">
</span><span class="hljs-title">KDNrNode</span>.appendChild(textNode);

										<p><p>I was doing a similar thing, creating and adding textnode to a node and I have been using the code that you have written. While this works perfectly in android i am having problems using it on iphone. The only difference i can see is that while in android DomIni object is shown as Ti.Document and in iphone debugging the object is shown as TiDOMDocument. Also the error message i am given is that DomIni.createTextNode is undefined. Do you think you could help me out.</p>

										<p><p>It&#39;s hard to tell this way. </p>
<p>I think I saw few tickets with similar problem, so you can try to search in JIRA if that is something known.</p>
<p>Or if don&#39;t find anything, try to make minimal test case that shows that issue and report it to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;How+to+Submit+a+Bug+Report">JIRA</a>.</p>

							<p>Maybe I could do so (even if its not going to work exactly the way you suggested, because KDRNode IS the child to be removed). But to be honest, I don&#39;t think that this is a practicable way to go.</p>
<p>I thought of something like that myself as a workaround, but it&#39;s nothing one really want&#39;s to do. It will work (theoretically) with this specific example, but what do you do, if the node to be removed not only contains a node text but child nodes also (that may have child nodes of their own)? Replicating that part tree may be VERY boring…</p>
<p>It would be easier to build a complete new XMl by copying the old one. But building the whole XML again from base to top each time you have to change a couple of Bytes, all that trouble for such an easy thing as changing the node text??? My opinon: NO WAY!!! I think that nowadays XML is such a central feature, that a programming environment that doesn&#39;t support it sufficiently is NOT USEABLE!</p>
<p>I am normally developing windows applications, mainly using Delphi. We are using XML intensively for data exchange. When I builded this part of the program, it was FINISHED within 4 (!!!) days. It took me 4 days with Titanium to find out that it does not work…</p>
<p>Being at that point: it took me 3 Days to get Titanium studio installed and running (i obviously had a time slip back to DOS- and Win3-times), another 2 day to catch a glimpse of the android emulator. I failed to get Kitchen Sink running and slipped it after 2 days. I needed 4 (!!!) days to show my first window on android…</p>
<p>I have to say that my idea of a programming environment is different. Making the same in Delphi would have taken me 2 or 3 days alltogether…</p>

										<p><p>I think that in Titanium XML you can do everything that you can do in some other environment that supports DOM Level 2 methods. So, even your complicated problem can be solved with Titanium.</p>
<p>As for other part of your comment … I totally agree with you and I have passed same road. Titanium lacks quality, but it&#39;s getting better.</p>
