			<h1>HttpClient send is slow</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve done a lot of searching and couldn&#39;t find any reference to XHR being slow… I&#39;m trying to turn to turn on a lightbulb (it has a ip address).  If I run the following from my MAC terminal the light turns on almost instantly (under 100ms):</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">curl -X PUT -d '{<span class="hljs-string">"on"</span>:true, <span class="hljs-string">"transitiontime"</span>:<span class="hljs-number">0</span>}' http://<span class="hljs-number">192.168</span>.<span class="hljs-number">1.115</span>/api/username/lights/<span class="hljs-number">1</span>/<span class="hljs-keyword">state</span>
</code></pre><p>However if I do the same thing from IOS, it ALWAYS takes &gt;1000ms (typically between 1010ms - 1100ms).  Here is the code I&#39;m using:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">net</span>(<span class="hljs-params">obj</span>) </span>{
        <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="hljs-string">'REQUEST START: '</span> + (<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">Date</span>()).getTime());
        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> xhr = Ti.Network.createHTTPClient({
            onload: <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">e</span>) </span>{
                <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="hljs-string">'REQUEST RECEIVED: '</span> + (<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">Date</span>()).getTime());
            }
        });
        xhr.open(obj.method, obj.url, <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>);
        xhr.send(<span class="hljs-built_in">JSON</span>.stringify(obj.obj));
        <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="hljs-string">'REQUEST SENT: '</span> + (<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">Date</span>()).getTime());
    }

    onOffButton.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'touchstart'</span>,<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>)</span>{
        net({
            method: <span class="hljs-string">'PUT'</span>,
            url: <span class="hljs-string">'http://192.168.1.115/api/'</span> + username + <span class="hljs-string">'/lights/'</span> + bulbId + <span class="hljs-string">'/state'</span>,
            obj: {<span class="hljs-string">"on"</span>: onOff, <span class="hljs-string">"transitiontime"</span>:<span class="hljs-number">0</span>},
            });
    });
</code></pre><p>The following is the result from clicking the above three times.  Notice the request received is always &gt;1000ms, and most importantly, the light always takes &gt;1000ms to turn on, unlike curl:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-string">[INFO]</span> REQUEST START: <span class="hljs-number">1354636478142</span>
<span class="hljs-string">[INFO]</span> REQUEST SENT: <span class="hljs-number">1354636478143</span>
<span class="hljs-string">[INFO]</span> REQUEST RECEIVED: <span class="hljs-number">1354636479151</span>

<span class="hljs-string">[INFO]</span> REQUEST START: <span class="hljs-number">1354636479780</span>
<span class="hljs-string">[INFO]</span> REQUEST SENT: <span class="hljs-number">1354636479781</span>
<span class="hljs-string">[INFO]</span> REQUEST RECEIVED: <span class="hljs-number">1354636480838</span>

<span class="hljs-string">[INFO]</span> REQUEST START: <span class="hljs-number">1354636482874</span>
<span class="hljs-string">[INFO]</span> REQUEST SENT: <span class="hljs-number">1354636482874</span>
<span class="hljs-string">[INFO]</span> REQUEST RECEIVED: <span class="hljs-number">1354636483911</span>
</code></pre><p>Any thoughts why I might be seeing this 1000ms delay with EVERY request?  I took a quick look at the Titanium mobile SDK on github and didn&#39;t see obvious reason.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Charlie</p>

										<p><p>I was able to get the fast response time I needed using TCP Sockets as you suggested .</p>
<p>Thanks for your suggestion.  It&#39;s too bad not being able to get the HTTPClient to work as implementing HTTP with sockets is not the easiest.  Thankfully I don&#39;t need to do much with the response, etc.</p>

<p>Have you considered the device is a mobile that does not have a constant connection and needs to gain a connection.  Your computer has a constant connection (albeit slight breaks during inactivity).</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Malcolm, i forgot to mention that this is happening both on the iphone device and the iphone simulator.  But regardless1000ms still seems like a very long time, and it feels fishy that it is always 1000ms plus a few more (almost like there&#39;s some type of hard-coded 1000ms delay in there somewhere).</p>

										<p><p>Can you narrow your tests to the verb PUT.  Are you able to replicate a test with a simple GET on the same IP and check the timings?  Have a simple PHP (or similar) return the time as the only content.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Malcolm.  </p>
<p>From the results below, it looks like Titanium is probably not the cause of the slowness but I&#39;m still unable to determine the cause of my slowness.  I ran the tests you recommended.  </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">From within titanium:
    Local PHP GET/PUT simple <span class="hljs-keyword">script</span>: <span class="hljs-number">11</span>ms
    Remote PHP GET/PUT simple <span class="hljs-keyword">script</span>: <span class="hljs-number">100</span>ms
    Local PHP GET/PUT <span class="hljs-function_start"><span class="hljs-keyword">on</span></span> lightbulb: **<span class="hljs-number">1000</span>+ms**

From curl (didnt <span class="hljs-property">time</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">it</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">but</span> instant means &lt;<span class="hljs-number">100</span>ms):
    Local PHP GET/PUT simple <span class="hljs-keyword">script</span>: instant
    Remote PHP GET/PUT simple <span class="hljs-keyword">script</span>: instant
    Local PHP GET/PUT <span class="hljs-function_start"><span class="hljs-keyword">on</span></span> lightbulb: **instant**
</code></pre><p>So I&#39;m very confused on why the only scenario that is slow is accessing the lightbulb (GET or PUT)from within Titanium!   </p>
<p>I know we may be outside of the realm of Titanium now, but any further suggestions on debugging?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

										<p><p>Malcolm, thanks for the offer, but unfortunately not, there is no simulator for the light bulb.  Now if I could just figure out how to override the &#39;Connection&#39; header, I might be able to get this working … based on the request that is going out from curl vs Ti, I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s my problem…</p>

										<p><p>Matt, thanks for you suggestion.  I installed WireShark and from what I can tell, the PUT using curl vs Ti is very similar, however Ti is setting the header &quot;Connection: close&quot; which curl doesn&#39;t do.  I have attempted  the following to remove &quot;close&#39;:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">xhr.setRequestHeader(<span class="hljs-string">'Connection'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'keep-alive'</span>);
<span class="hljs-regexp">//xhr</span>.setRequestHeader(<span class="hljs-string">'Connection'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'none'</span>);
</code></pre><p>I have also tried keepAlive when creating httpclient:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> xhr</span> = Ti.Network.createHTTPClient({
            enableKeepAlive:<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
        });
</code></pre><p>as well as after I open the connection using xhr.setEnableKeepAlive(true);</p>
<p>Nothing seems to remove or modify the header that is sent out.  Any ideas how I can modify this header?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m just learning Titanium, so I don&#39;t know that I can be much help with what you&#39;re trying to in modifying the header, but you could instead modify the header of the CURL request to simulate what Titanium is doing to confirm if in fact that is the issue (instead of trying to do something that might take more time all for nothing).</p>
<p>With Wireshark, can you see which packet(s) are taking longer with Ti than with CURL?  Is there a delay before the first packet, after the first?  Is it one of the return packets from the lightbulb that is taking a while?</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m at a loss!  I have tried to modify the headers to be the same (thanks for the suggestion Matt, I modified curl header to use &quot;Connection: close&quot; and it didn&#39;t fix the issue.)</p>
<p>The wireshark captures shows that the Ti request is getting sent out in two packets instead of curl sending it in one, despite the size of the overall request being pretty much the same.  I could not find anything on if there is a way to force a single packet with Ti (or to change MTU size).  I have put the capture files online <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;skydrive.live.com&#x2F;redir?resid=7FC629C6DD711FFF!46832&amp;authkey=!ALjfOdK1h3JvuJY">here</a> if that could help.  I&#39;m not that familiar with network captures, so I&#39;m not sure if I should be looking for something else.</p>
<p>I&#39;m very grateful for the helpful comments and suggestions, I just don&#39;t know where to go from here!</p>

										<p><p>It definitely looks like there is an issue with the HTTPClient library, but it doesn&#39;t have to do with the Connection header.  Looking through the code that Ygor linked to and comparing the PCAP dumps, here is what I see:</p>
<p>In CURL, the entire request, data and all, is sent in one TCP packet (line 15).  The lightbulb appears to like this and promptly performs it&#39;s action and sends data back.</p>
<p>In Ti, the request is chunked into two parts (lines 8 and 9).  The first chunk sends the HTTP headers to the light bulb, and the second chunk sends the data.   You can see right after that (line 10) that the lightbulb sends an ACK request back to the Ti script to acknowledge all parts recieved, but the Ti Network client isn&#39;t expecting an ACK so it doesn&#39;t do anything with it.  After about 1sec, the lightbulb doesn&#39;t recieve a response and then continues to do what it&#39;s supposed to do.  I&#39;m not sure if this is an issue with Ti&#39;s XMLHttpRequest coding or the nature of XMLHttpRequest in general.</p>
<p>There is only one way I can think of to possibly narrow it down and that would be to write a quick Javascript script in Greasemonkey&#x2F;Tampermonkey (Firefox&#x2F;Chrome) and test the browsers implementation of XMLHttpRequest to see what happens.  (I say Grease&#x2F;Tamper monkey because those will not obey same-origin policy like the regular browser will).  If it works as expected in that small script, then the issue is with Ti&#39;s XMLHttpRequest implementation.  If you experience the same issue, then it&#39;s a limitation of the XMLHttpRequest protocol.</p>

										<p><p>Matt, thanks for your your helpful comments and your detailed analysis of what&#39;s going on.  I ended up implementing with TCPSockets which solved my issue.</p>
