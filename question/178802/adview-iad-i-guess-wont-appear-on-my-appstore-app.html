			<h1>AdView (iAd I guess) wont appear on my AppStore App</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello friends. I would like to ask you something. I have developed an application using titanium, I used adView on it… I have submitted it and Apple has approved my application. Now I can download it from Appstore, but when I opened it, I realized that there is no IAd…<br>I used &lt;AdView&gt; in several screens, but on my AppStore app only appear a white rectangle there.<br>Have I missed an intermediate step?<br>Thank you very much in advance<br>Regards</p>

							<p>You need to sign up for iAd on the iTunes Connect site.  Once you do that, then you will get advertisements in your app.  It is a separate process from the app submission process.</p>
