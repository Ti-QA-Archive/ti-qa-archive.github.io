			<h1>STILL unable to get studio working - location of Titanium SDK</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>why oh why is this soooo difficult???<br>so i&#39;m trying (have been for a week now) just to get to thepoint where i can even run the development studio. here is my latest issue:<br>when i run the studio……it comes up and a bunch of &quot;prep&quot; stuff happens…..when it reaches the point where it says &quot;searching for titanium updates&quot; and it finds the updates and then it goes into &quot;extracting sdk…&quot; it just sits for a long time and then errors out. when i go into the &quot;configure&quot; screen….i can see that i do not have the titanium sdk loaded. i can navigate to the folder structure:<br>titaniumsdk<br>  –mobilesdk<br>    –win32<br>      –1.7.4.v20111025165811<br>        –all<br>        –android<br>        –common<br>        –iphone<br>etc</p>
<p>but no matter which folder i select, studio always says &quot;titanium sdk not found at location&quot;</p>
<p>if i select the &quot;mobilesdk&quot; folder, i get the message &quot;mobilesdk not found at location&quot;</p>
<p>whatever folder i select, i get a message saying that item is not found at that location</p>
<p>ANY idea what is going on???</p>
<p>why oh why doesn&#39;t the installation of studio keep track of WHERE the sdk is???<br>so far…this product is still completely unusable</p>

<p>Note that the Titanium SDK directory is the one that contains the mobilesdk, modules, runtime and SDK directories.</p>
<p>Before continuing, would you do the following, please?</p>
<p>Check that you have, at a minimum, all the packages shown in the screenshot of the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Installing+and+Updating+Android+SDK#InstallingandUpdatingAndroidSDK-SummaryofInstalledAndroidPackages">Summary of Installed Android Packages</a> section of the documentation.</p>
<p>Install the latest <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;index.html">continuous build</a>, by selecting <em>master</em> from the drop down menu, right-clicking and copying the URL of the archive for your OS, and pasting it into <strong>Titanium Studio&#39;s Help &gt; Install Titanium SDK from URL</strong> dialog. Note that you don&#39;t have to actually use this version of the SDK for your apps; it just needs to exist on your system.</p>
<p>Make sure that Studio is configured with the location of the Android SDK, via its <strong>Preferences &gt; Titanium Studio &gt; Titanium</strong> dialog. See <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;2.+Getting+Started+with+Titanium+Studio#2.GettingStartedwithTitaniumStudio-ConfiguringTitaniumStudiowiththePlatformSDKs">Configuring Titanium Studio with the Platform SDKs</a>.</p>
<p>Then restart Studio and try again.</p>
<p>If you continue to experience problems, please report back with the new details.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Please do not answer your own questions - use the comment facility instead. It will make it easier for others to follow the conversation, and will mean that you will be able to close the thread when it&#39;s resolved.</p>
<p>I included a link to our continuous build site in my previous answer. This is it —&gt; <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;index.html">here</a> &lt;— .  At the top of our continuous builds page, don&#39;t you see a drop down menu, that allows you to switch between different development branches&#x2F;versions of the SDK? The first entry should be &quot;master&quot;. Please let me know if this is not the case for you. Note that version 1.7.0.RC1 is <em>not</em> the version you need.</p>
<p>However, in hindsight, I should have linked to our guide about Continuous Builds, which you may find <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Installing+Titanium+SDK+Continuous+Builds">here</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, as it is clear that your system is experiencing so many problems that the best idea is for us to check your environment.</p>
<p>Please follow the instructions at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Installation+Troubleshooting#InstallationTroubleshooting-InstallDiagnosticsforWindows">Install Diagnostics for Windows</a>. Copy the output and paste it to your preferred <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;">pastebin</a> service, and paste the link to it here. It&#39;s important that you do not modify it <strong>in any way</strong>, as this could mask problems with your configuration. Do <strong>NOT</strong> paste the actual code here! This is because the system will change the formatting.</p>
<p>Also, please create and share a screenshot of your android installed packages, using something like <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;imageshack.us&#x2F;">ImageShack</a></p>
<p>State the processor and RAM installed to your system.</p>
<p>Lastly, run the command <code>systeminfo</code> at the commandline and share it in a pastebin.</p>
<p>Then I will help you further.</p>

							<p>&quot;Note that the Titanium SDK directory is the one that contains the mobilesdk, modules, runtime and SDK directories.&quot; - yes i know that. but when i point tha app at that directory it says &quot;titanium sdk not found at directory specified&quot;<br>(why oh why oh why doesn&#39;t titanium KNOW where the sdk is? - it installed it!)</p>
<p>&quot;Install the latest continuous build, by selecting master from the drop down menu&quot;<br>from WHAT drop down menu??<br>i see nothing called &quot;master&quot; anywhere<br>why oh why is the url for the titanium so hidden? why isn&#39;t it published all over the place?<br>why am i having to spend days looking for it?<br>why do instructions say &quot;put the sdk url in such and such a place&quot; rather that stipulating what the url is???<br>how am i supposed to know it?<br>can you please tell me what the secret url to the titanium sdk is???</p>

							<p>i believe i found the secret url to the titanium sdk:<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;RC&#x2F;mobilesdk-1.7.0.RC1-win32.zip<br>so i pasted it into the &quot;install from url&quot; and received this same ole error:<br>first it says &quot;downloading content…&quot;<br>and after a LONG delay i get:<br>error extracting zip file<br>the system cannot find the path specified</p>
<p>also….every time i try and run studio……it still gets to &quot;updating sdk&quot; and i see several windows with progress bars where it is updating the sdk. but once it gets to &quot;extracting…&quot; it always bombs with:<br>the system cannot find the path specified</p>
