			<h1>Install on Device - Android - never works</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve spent quite a bit of time running through the posts here and I&#39;ve seen a few hints of people having problems, but no real conversation on the topic.</p>
<p>Running Titanium 1.2.1 and attempting to get KitchenSink (or anything) to install on an Android device fails every single time.</p>
<p>There is no error returned. According to Titanium it works. However, nothing ever shows up on the phone.</p>
<p>Tried this from a Mac and from an XP machine. Same result.</p>
<p>Device is set to accept &#39;insecure&#39; apps, etc, etc.</p>
<p>Can someone please point me in the right direction to solve this?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>I was having this problem too - trying to deploy from Titanium on a Mac to a Galaxy Samsung S II. Turns out all I had to do was go to Settings&gt;Applications&gt;Development and turn on USB debugging. Titanium found the device like a charm after that.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned on this thread, it won&#39;t launch automatically so you&#39;ll have to do that yourself. </p>
<p>Note that this may interfere with other features on the phone - if you use Kies for example. For full details check this thread:<br><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;androidforums.com&#x2F;samsung-galaxy-s2-international&#x2F;393624-help-samsung-galaxy-s2-wont-connect-kies.html">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;androidforums.com&#x2F;samsung-galaxy-s2-international&#x2F;393624-help-samsung-galaxy-s2-wont-connect-kies.html</a></p>

							<p>Hi I had the same problem.</p>
<p>Make sure that you set the USB connection to &quot;Charge only&quot; or else the application will not install. </p>
<p>This happens because when the USB connection is set to &quot;Disk Drive&quot; the sd card cannot be mounted to install applications.</p>
<p>Hope this helps :)</p>

							<p>Ya, me too. Till date, I can&#39;t get any app to run in the android emulator. My most recent experience is that it will ignore all my splash screen and custom app icon and auto replace with the default Ti ones….</p>

What&#39;s the solution Appcelerator Team?  Titanium to recognize the Android SDK similarly problematic.</p>

							<p>Hey Jason.. we&#39;ve fixed a number of bugs surrounding launching and deployment of android apps in HEAD, would you mind grabbing a recent nightly build of the android mobile SDK, and let us know if that solves your problem? There&#39;s instructions on this post:</p>

							<p>Yeah, USB debugging is turned on.</p>
<p>I have managed to at least get Titanium to spit back an error from the Mac now though. Just says there was an error, nothing really descriptive though.</p>
<p>It appears 1.2.1 is also having issues with java on my machine for some reason. Actually, on 3 different macs I&#39;m having the same java issues. I believe others are experiencing it as well.</p>
<p>The windows machine here does not have those java problems, but still does not install.</p>

							<p>Anyone want to throw any thoughts out there? Is it time to give up on Appcelerator? I really hope not. </p>
<p>The unfortunate thing is that we have already practically finished an app using Titanium, however, now we can get anything to work so all that work may be lost.</p>
<p>We had an app working with 0.8. Then had to re-write for 1.0.</p>
<p>Now that one is failing due to this situation.</p>

							<p>I got this. I was having the same issue.  I downloaded and reinstalled everything. Come to find out that my device was not in the Android&#39;s USB driver install. I have an HTC Eris.   I went o HTC&#39;s website and downloaded and installed the HTC Sync software on my computer (PC running Vista). See if you actually have your device&#39;s USB drivers installed.  Android&#39;s site does not provide all the devices that run Android. Too many are coming out.<br>Also, go to your Build folder in your project, copy the AndroidManifest.xml and create an AndroidManifest.custom.xml and add that in the same place your AndroidManifest.xml is at and changed &#39;debuggable&#39; from &quot;false&quot; to &quot;true&quot; in your AndroidManifest.custom.xml.<br>Finally, make sure you device&#39;s settings are USB debuggable &quot;On&quot;, Charge Only, and Third Party applications are turned on and allowed.</p>

							<p>This thread is 7 months old but I&#39;m having the same problem.  I installed Titanium a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>I&#39;m running 1.2.1 on Windows 7 64-bit.  The HelloWorld app runs correctly on the emulator.  My phone is the HTC Google Nexus One running 2.2.  In Titanium Developer, in the tab Test &amp; Package, in the tab Run on Device, I click Install Now.  It says &quot;Installing app on device…&quot; for a long time, but nothing happens.  </p>
<p>The phone is set for USB Debugging, Stay awake, Allow mock locations.  USB storage is off.  Status shows USB connected and USB debugging connected.</p>
<p>What have I forgotten to do?</p>

										<p><p>Have you added the windows usb drivers. You can also use the <code>ddms</code> tool or <code>adb -d</code> to watch the log during install. You can do <code>adb devices</code> to make sure the phone is visibile to adb before trying to install with Developer.</p>

							<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>10 months later, I still have the exact same problem of the application not starting on the phone and Titanium doing as everything went fine.</p>
<p>My phone is in USB debugging mode, allowing mock installations.<br>I tried to install the app on the phone both with the USB Storage and without, it did not work…</p>
<p>My main concern is that it works perfectly with Rhomobile Rhodes, in USB Debugging + USB Storage mode but just doesn&#39;t work on Titanium…<br>It writes &quot;Installing app on device…&quot; on the top right corner then shows the logo and that&#39;s it. Nothing happen on the phone.<br>I tried all possible settings on the phone and none of them worked (neither the recommended Mock+Debug+not-usb-storage).</p>
<p>Windows 7 x64<br>Titanium Dev 1.2.2, SDK 1.5.1</p>
<p>Any help?</p>

										<p><p>Oh, actually it installs the application successfully, but does not automatically starts the application.<br>And indeed it does not start the application because… it doesn&#39;t work on the device! It works in the emulator though…</p>

										<p><p>We don&#39;t automatically launch the application when it&#39;s installed on device. Use the <code>adb -d logcat</code> command or <code>DDMS</code> utility to look at the log statements to see what the problem is.</p>

							<p>I think your solution works, but actually now it works also through Titanium Developer.<br>The only problem is that the application does not automatically start. But it seems to work now!<br>I needed (and still need sometimes otherwise it just fails at application startup) to delete the android build folder, make a small change to the project settings (Edit tab), save it, and rebuild everything.</p>
<p>Also I installed the 64 bits driver of my cellphone.<br>I think this is not what solved my problems but still may be useful to tell it…<br>So far I had installed only the official driver that came with the phone, but it is only 32 bits. Android SDK and Titanium are also 32 bits anyway (I believe…) so I thought it&#39;s fine but I found 64 dlls on the web. I just copy&#x2F;pasted it into the System32 directory (the dlls in the SysWOW64 were already there and more recent).</p>

							<p>Hey,</p>
<p>I was having the same problem on Mac and the below was what I did to get it working.</p>
<p>I had the following on my Nexus 7:</p>
<p>Unknown Sources on. [https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Deploying+to+Android+devices]<br>Developer Mode on.<br>USB Debugging Mode on.<br>Mock Installations on.<br>It by default was connected as a Media Device.<br>Not locked. </p>
<p>Using terminal in the location of the adb file I ran <code>.&amp;#x2F;adb kill-server</code> wait a few seconds, then ran <code>.&amp;#x2F;adb start-server</code>. You can then do <code>.&amp;#x2F;adb devices</code> to see if your device is being found.</p>
<p>I got info on how to do the above here [http:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.xda-developers.com&#x2F;showthread.php?t=1917237]</p>
<p>After that I just attempted to rebuild the android device on my tablet and it worked fine, it didn&#39;t launch itself and the app I built was the Kitchen Sink, this didn&#39;t work correctly, it freezes and doesn&#39;t load anything. I am not sure if this the that Kitchen isn&#39;t supported well on the Nexus 7.</p>
