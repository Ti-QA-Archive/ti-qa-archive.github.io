			<h1>Can anyone suggest a barcode scanner that will work with titanium and iPhone?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Were evaluating the use of titanium for the basis of our field application where hundreds of barcode scans are required. Can anyone suggest a good barcode scanning solution, scans need to be fast. Camera based scans are only an option if they can scan quickly in low light at 200ms</p>
<p>UPDATE: We require several barcode types, however the most important to start with is U.P.C. and EAN13. Future requirements may need Code 39 and&#x2F;or Code 128</p>

							<p>You didn&#39;t mention which type of barcodes you need to scan.  Personally, I don&#39;t think camera based scans are suitable for high-volume scan environments.  They also seem to have an easier time with adequate size QR codes than say UPC or simulator.</p>
<p>For my purposes, I went with the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ipcprint.com&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;products&#x2F;barcode-scanners&#x2F;linea-pro-4&#x2F;">Linea Pro</a> line of scanners.  If you have been in an Apple store since about Oct 2009, this is the same scanner which Apple now uses in their own stores for POS scans and credit card swipes.  They use the model which attaches to an ipod touch but the company just released 6 different models for the iphone4 as well.</p>
<p>I had to write a small custom obj-C module to integrate their SDK library with Appcelerator Titanium.  But the resulting laser scans are very fast and reliable.  IMHO, laser scans are the only reasonable way to go for high volume environments.</p>

										<p><p>That scanner certainly looks attractive, however at a $499 cost it will be a VERY expensive venture with us requiring ~500-700 units.</p>

							<p>I don&#39;t have any specific metrics, but the recently released Ti+plus barcode scanner module works great and looks quite fast to me. It&#39;s based on the ZXing library, which is kind of standard.<br>You&#39;ll need at least an Indie subscription to be able to test it on device. It is prety straightforward to use. Below is code from the example code:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">
<span class="hljs-comment">// This is a test harness for your module</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// You should do something interesting in this harness </span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// to test out the module and to provide instructions </span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// to users on how to use it by example.</span>


<span class="hljs-comment">// open a single window</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">window</span> = Ti.UI.createWindow({
  backgroundColor:<span class="hljs-string">'white'</span>
});
<span class="hljs-built_in">window</span>.open();


<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> button = Ti.UI.createButton({
    title:<span class="hljs-string">"Scan QR Code"</span>,
    width:<span class="hljs-number">150</span>,
    height:<span class="hljs-number">40</span>,
    top:<span class="hljs-number">20</span>
});

<span class="hljs-built_in">window</span>.add(button);

button.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>,<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>)
</span>{
    Titanium.Barcode.capture({
        success: <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">event</span>)
        </span>{
            alert(<span class="hljs-string">"success = "</span>+event.result);
        },
        cancel: <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">event</span>)
        </span>{
            alert(<span class="hljs-string">"cancel"</span>);
        },
        error: <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">event</span>)
        </span>{
            alert(<span class="hljs-string">"Error. "</span>+event.message);
        },
    });
});
</code></pre><p>At the moment is IOS only. You can implement an Android method using Intents and calling the zxing activity.</p>

							<p>I managed to finally get this one working again. It had been around for a long time. Long before the Ti+ modules came about:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.google.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;tibar&#x2F;</p>
<p>It reads a load or bar types in many different ways. It&#39;s very fast too.</p>
