							<p>I had major issues with this. It was because my credit card would not authorise the payment. It took the site as not valid. It took ages to sort out and I only managed it by using a diferent card who would phone me up to authorise the payment.</p>
<p>Secure verified by visa cards believe the site is fradulant because of its sssl certificate.. I did raise this directly with appcelerator but nothing was changed.</p>
<p>hope this helps.</p>

							<p>Today, I try with another MasterCard (My Company&#39;s card), and I can subscribe to Indie package! I cannot describe the problem, probably my private cards, but I don&#39;t know why.</p>
