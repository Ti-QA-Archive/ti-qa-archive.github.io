			<p>Hi, I am running iOS 7.0.3 and Titanium 3.2.1.  I have what I thought would be a pretty simple task.  All I want is a full-screen view that will contain a video in the middle of the screen and other UI elements at the top and bottom.  But the video will be loaded in dynamically so I don&#39;t know the width and height beforehand.  My plan was to just set the width to 80% of the screen, and let the height be determined automatically:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in">var</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">self</span> = Ti<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>UI<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>createWindow({
    backgroundCol<span class="hljs-subst">or</span>:<span class="hljs-string">'#red'</span>,
});

<span class="hljs-built_in">var</span> tmpView = Titanium<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>Media<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>createVideoPlayer({
    url:path,
    backgroundCol<span class="hljs-subst">or</span>:<span class="hljs-string">'white'</span>,
    width: Ti<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>Platform<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>displayCaps<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>platformWidth * <span class="hljs-number">0.8</span>,
    <span class="hljs-comment">// height: Ti.UI.SIZE,</span>
    autoplay: <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>,
    mediaControlStyle: Titanium<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>Media<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>VIDEO_CONTROL_EMBEDDED,
});
<span class="hljs-built_in">var</span> view = Ti<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>UI<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>createView({
    backgroundCol<span class="hljs-subst">or</span> : <span class="hljs-string">'black'</span>,
    width: Ti<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>Platform<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>displayCaps<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>platformWidth,
    height: Ti<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>Platform<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>displayCaps<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>platformHeight
});
view<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>add(tmpView);
<span class="hljs-built_in">self</span><span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>add(view);
</code></pre><p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;sr5uxlw.png">But this is the result when I run it</a></p>
<p>I chose the background colors for clarity so you can see what&#39;s happening: although the video is displaying correctly, the video player view is taking up the full height of the screen, so the controls appear way down at the bottom.  I need the controls to be directly below the video content.  </p>
<p>I tried setting the height to Ti.UI.FILL and &#39;auto&#39; and saw the same results.  (Ti.UI.SIZE caused the video to not show up at all.)  I also tried other mediaControlStyle settings.  The only thing that worked while testing was setting the height explicitly to a number, which I won&#39;t have for the real app.  I also tried using a &#39;postlayout&#39; event to read in what the height of the loaded in video actually is, but when I output e.source.size.height it just returns 568, the height of the screen.  </p>
<p>Does anybody have any ideas how I could either set the height of the video player correctly, or, if not, at least override the controls to appear below the video?  Thanks!</p>

<li>VideoPlayer has a <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Media.VideoPlayer-event-naturalsizeavailable">&#39;naturalsizeavailable&#39;</a> Event</li>
<li>have you tried setting left&#x2F;top&#x2F;right&#x2F;bottom instead of width&#x2F;height of the VideoPlayer?</li>

							<div><p>I did somehow miss the naturalsizeavailable event in the docs, and that does seem to be exactly what I needed.  Unfortunately, I know I tagged this as just iPhone, because that&#39;s what I have been testing with, but I will need to get this to work on Android eventually.  (The behavior on Android is the same).  It looks like the naturalSize property is not available on Androids; is there any way to get similar functionality?</p>
<p>If I set all four of the position variables, it does work; however it&#39;s the same problem because I need the video to be centered and I don&#39;t have the width and height so I don&#39;t know what to set the top and bottom to.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>
