			<p>Hello,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;<br>for android dev&#39;s (with a fresh &#x2F; new android 2.1&#x2F;2.2&#x2F;2.3 version or higher) it could be a painful disaster, because there are some more updates required. First, the &quot;adb&quot; file is no longer located in the &quot;tools&quot; directory of android (the problematic path should be edited by appcelerator to &quot;platform-tools&#x2F;adb&quot;, or better, use a second search path (&quot;platform-tools&quot;) or use a hard link instead, that means, use the terminal &quot;ln [ANDROID_FOLDER]&#x2F;platform-tools&#x2F;adb [ANDROID_FOLDER]&#x2F;tools&#x2F;adb). You need also a installation &#x2F; update by the sdk tool (&quot;tools&#x2F;android&quot;), the following packages should be installed:&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;</p>
<ul>
<li>Android SDK Tools, revision 9&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;</li>
<li>Android SDK Platform-Tools, revision 2&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;</li>
<li>SDK Platform Android 1.6, API 4, revision 3&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;</li>
<li>Google APIs by Google Inc., Android API 7 or higher</li>
</ul>
<p>The next stuff is also problematic, because of missing write permissions on mac&#39;s. Be sure, that there are these 3 folders in your home directory named &quot;.titanium&quot;, &quot;.android&quot; and &quot;.deltafy&quot;. Use the terminal &#x2F; commandline to solve this problem:&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;<br>sudo mkdir ~&#x2F;.android ~&#x2F;.titanium ~&#x2F;.deltafy &lt;br &#x2F;&gt;<br>sudo chown [YOUR_USERNAME] ~&#x2F;.android ~&#x2F;.titanium ~&#x2F;.deltafy</p>
<p>I hope that this also helps others, because it was like pain in the a** for me xD</p>
<p>But I have still the problem with kitchensink, the emulator can&#39;t install the app, I got only this meaningless message:<br>[ERROR] Failed installing com.appcelerator.kitchensink: pkg: &#x2F;data&#x2F;local&#x2F;tmp&#x2F;app.apk</p>
<p>There are no more tracing &#x2F; debugging messages to solve this last problem :-(</p>
<p>[EDIT]: After a short while I regonized, that there is no API in the package included, this means that I have to download the api with the android manager (&quot;tools&#x2F;android&quot;). In my opinion it could be a little bit more comfortable.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;<br>Pixelmount aka darki777</p>

<p>Most of your post talks about the Android SDK, which is produced by Google. If you think Google should improve its product, then you would no doubt have better success by addressing your complaints directly to Google.</p>
<p>In my opinion, your advice about chowning <code>~&amp;#x2F;.android ~&amp;#x2F;.titanium ~&amp;#x2F;.deltafy</code> is misinformation. If your underlying system is configured correctly, all files created by a user in their own home directory will be automatically owned by that user. Furthermore, if you have &quot;missing write permissions&quot; on your home directory, then it sounds like something is really amiss with your system in general, possibly (although, it&#39;s a guess) with the user&#39;s <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Umask">umask</a> setting.</p>
<p>Yes, I agree that it will be much better when the adb bug is fixed, but the workaround is explained several times in the docs, not least in the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.appcelerator.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;getting_started.html#preparing_for_android_development">Getting Started</a> guide, which I trust you have followed.</p>

							<p>Hi Paul,<br>yeah, It could be really a permission problem on my site, but I never had write permissions directly in the home directory before, only in the subdirectories. I am not sure if that are correct mac settings or not (I have to check this), but still, that&#39;s why I wrote this text down, maybe, maybe it could help someone else :)</p>
<p>Ahh damn, I haven&#39;t seen this piece of text in the docs (the bottom part of the Getting Started guide), I thought at the top, that there is only simple info&#x2F;description text about Titanium after a while I scrolled down ^^ xD Thanks.</p>
<p>Because of Google, it&#39;s maybe only a small idea, to make this kind of suggested packages available, but that&#39;s not too neccessary :)</p>
<p>Have a great weekend,<br>darki</p>
<p>[EDIT]: Sry, I used the wrong button, instead of the comment button xD</p>
