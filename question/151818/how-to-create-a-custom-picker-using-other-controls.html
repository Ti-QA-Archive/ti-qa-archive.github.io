			<p>See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.dropboxusercontent.com&#x2F;u&#x2F;2733882&#x2F;customPicker.png">screenshot of custom picker</a></p>
<p>I know there isn&#39;t a way to style the picker control in Titanium. This picker only needs to work on iOS (iPad only). I was thinking I could hack the TableView control to use instead of the picker to achieve the style desired. Is that reasonable? How would I snap the TableViewRows so one is always in the center like seen in typical picker controls?</p>

							<p>That seems like a cool project however it will be a lil complicated. You will need a class wrapper that will control your columns (tables) and this wrapper will be responsible to know where the middle row is aligned across all tables. The rest is styling it</p>

										<p><p>Styling is easy. I see that TableView controls have a scrollEnd event that I could bind to in order to snap the row closest to the middle to that position. How do I determine which row that is, though? I don&#39;t see any way to handle that.</p>

							<p>Hi Shawn,<br>I would suggest creating a custom solution using scrollViews to display the data, and snapping it to positions on the touchend event,  and using views to display the lines across. It would not be too complex to build using a few arrays to hold the data and matching the data from the arrays by the scrollview positions.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Jamie,</p>
<p>That should work, but I don&#39;t know how to determine which selection (child view) is closest to the center and how I could snap it there. Can you provide any insight into how that may be achieved?</p>

										<p><p>Sorry about the late reply Shawn, been pretty busy. I managed to create a custom picker with scrollViews however it doesn&#39;t work as fluidly as I would like so you might want to tweak it, its just a basic implementation for now but I feel its a solid starting point.</p>

										<p><p>Yes! Thanks so much for being so generous with your time! I&#39;ve actually coded something very similar that I am going to clean up and post also so others can reference. I see you only add the dragend event listener once the view is scrolled. Is there a reason it can&#39;t be added outside of the scroll event?</p>

										<p><p>I was having issues with the logic and even when the view wasnt scrolling the dragend was being called so I had to add it inside. I am sure it is possible, but was just a quick workaround for a little quirk.</p>
