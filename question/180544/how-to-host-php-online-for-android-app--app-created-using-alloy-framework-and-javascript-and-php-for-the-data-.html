							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Your question is clear - the problem is your ability is clearly not up to this.</p>
<p>You have to go and study what goes into a php file, by this I mean the script, the database connection, the user interface to allow it to be edited.  You need web hosting space with database support to then upload those files and database to.  </p>
<p>You state you have created php files - but it is highly unlikely they have code in them or anything else related as otherwise you would know everything I just said in the above paragraph.  Your site or data will NOT be run from your own local files - it will be done via the web host you arrange as will the data - otherwise your users will not have access to it.</p>
<p>You will need to look up how to create a database, connect to it via php, form creation, security layers and encryption - possibly an SSL.  You can find numerous article on the internet, books, how to guides and videos.</p>
<p>This is way too much to provide in an answer here as your question is not only not Titanium related (it is server and php related) but more importantly you have not done anything to correct or review.  You need basic knowledge first.</p>
