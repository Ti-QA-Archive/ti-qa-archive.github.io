			<p>Environment: Mobile sdk, all current versions, testing on iPhone simulator, playing on OSX (current).</p>
<p>I would like to have some dynamic changes made any time the root window (window 0), comes into focus. But the best I can tell the window focus event only fire when window 0 is opened. So it fires once, and anytime navigation removes a window and we are back at window 0, nothing happens. This is not the case with subsequent windows. If 3 windows are opened, and I close window[2], window[1] focuses and a focus event fires as it should. But when window[1] closes, window[0] is silent.</p>
<p>Unless … I force it, with another call to .open(), which does cause focus event to fire. Does anybody have any insight? I&#39;ve tried some variations on how the listener is defined, eg as a global function, to no avail.</p>
<p>Per docs, focus event is defined after window creation, and prior to opening  (same code for all window) …</p>

    alert(<span class="hljs-string">'Boo!'</span>); 
});

							<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I would recommend an App Event, so you know when the user closes which window. </p>
<p>Best,</p>
