			<h1>[WARN] : New layout set while view [object TiUIImageView] animating: Will relayout after animation.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am not sure if I should be concerned, but in my app, I would like to have multiple animations going at the same time. In the current case, I have two imageView&#39;s that I am animating. Once slides down from the top of the screen, the other slides up at the same time. I would really like to have these happening simultaneously. The problem and concern I have is that I get a warning on the console that states:</p>
<p>  [WARN] : New layout set while view [object TiUIImageView] animating: Will relayout after animation.</p>
<p>The warning happens every time that the application is triggered. Which could be several times through the use of the app. I have other similar animations with an imageView that slides to the right while another comes into view at the same time.</p>
<p>Should I be concerned with this warning? Could it cause memory problems? Is there a way to run multiple animations at the same time that is more efficient?</p>
<p>My code below for triggering the animation on an imagaView and a button I have in the app.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var SlideDown_App_Title = Ti.UI.createAnimation({
  top: <span class="hljs-number">100</span>,
  duration: <span class="hljs-number">500</span>
});

var SlideUp_btn_Create_Account = Ti.UI.createAnimation({
  top: <span class="hljs-number">370</span>,
  duration: <span class="hljs-number">500</span>
});

img_App_Title.animate(SlideDown_App_Title); 

btn_Create_Account.animate(SlideUp_btn_Create_Account);
</code></pre>

							<div><p>Where did you put this snippet of code? If it&#39;s in say <code>index.js</code> the animation will start before there&#39;s time for it to finish when Titanium to execute the subsequent code that creates and lays out views, because JavaScript is single-threaded. The warning itself doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s using more resources, just that you&#39;re trying to do something that can&#39;t be done. That&#39;s all.</p>

							<div><p>I have this at the very end of my app.js file. The issue only happens when I add the second animation that I want happening at the same time. If I don&#39;t have the second animation, no warning appears on the console.</p>
