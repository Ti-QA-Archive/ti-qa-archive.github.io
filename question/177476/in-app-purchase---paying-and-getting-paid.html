			<h1>In-app purchase - Paying and getting paid</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, my question is for ios but also android down the line.</p>
<p>If I install an in-app purchase system like storekit, what does it cost me once running? </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Will Appcelerator come and ask me to upgrade to the paying version?</p>
</li>
<li><p>When a user makes a purchase ($10 yearly subscriptions to allow for reports downloads in my case) how is his payment handled? Mastercard? Where does the money go? Apple account?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do I receive 100% of it?</p>
</li>
<li><p>If handling that for a client, do I need to set up a developer account for them so that they can receive payments?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>Gary,</p>
<p>Here are some answers.</p>
<p>1) No. I have published apps with storekit&#x2F;google play integration with the free version.</p>
<p>2) if you are using app storestore&#x2F;google play integration, the payment is handled by apple&#x2F;google. A user says &#39;I want to buy&#39; and the credit card the vendor has on file is charged. You basically just monitor for transaction success. Ie, did the payment go through.</p>
<p>3) Nope. Payment terms and splits are handled by the vendors. Last time I checked, you get to keep 70%, but check with apple&#x2F;google for latest info.</p>
<p>4) whoever is getting paid needs to have their own account. There is paperwork to complete and, for example, in Canada, apple collects the government tax on your behalf and remits to the government, so you need to have the account setup for the business receiving the payment.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
