			<h1>HTTPRequest not working for Enterprise built iOS Application</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have an app that connects to my server using the Titanium.Network.HTTPClient. I call a Web Service that returns data as a JSON String.</p>
<p>When I test this request via the iOS Simulator or via deploying the app to my App as a Developer, it works 100%.</p>
<p>When I create an Adhoc Enterprise Archive for the same app and deploy it to my device, then the HTTP ResponseText returns null. Nothing else has changed. It&#39;s only when I deploy for Enterprise Distribution.</p>
<p>All my certificates are valid from what I can see and I receive no errors.</p>
<p>Is there a HTTPClient restriction that I am not aware of that&#39;s only allowed when testing?</p>
<p>See below example:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var <span class="hljs-keyword">http</span> = Titanium.Network.createHTTPClient();
<span class="hljs-keyword">http</span>.setTimeout(<span class="hljs-number">20000</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">http</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'GET'</span>, url, false);
<span class="hljs-keyword">http</span>.setRequestHeader(<span class="hljs-string">"Content-Type"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"text/xml; charset=utf-8"</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">http</span>.send(params);

<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">http</span>.responseText === null){
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> null;
}else{
    Ti.API.<span class="hljs-keyword">info</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'It Worked'</span>);
}
</code></pre><p>Please assist.</p>
<p>Many thanks.<br>John.</p>

							<p>First: Malcolm is 100% correct, you&#39;re doing it wrong.</p>
<p>Second: Ignoring the fact that your code is lucky to work at all, the symptoms you describe sound a lot like you have an invalid SSL certificate on the server. Development builds of the app ignore SSL errors, but production builds enable strict certificate checking. This could be a secondary issue.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Shannon. I think the problem I&#39;m facing is an invalid SSL Certificate. We are using a self signed Cert which seems to work fine during development testing, but stops working on the Production Version.</p>
<p>Thank you for clarifying this for me.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>There are no restrictions you are just not doing it correctly.  You have not provided any call backs for success or errors in the code above and you are simply lucky that the above code worked quickly enough to catch the answer.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> http = Titanium.Network.createHTTPClient();
http.onload = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(http.responseText === <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>){
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>;
        alert(<span class="hljs-string">'failed'</span>);
    }<span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>{
        alert(<span class="hljs-string">'worked'</span>);
        Ti.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">'It Worked'</span>);
    }
};
http.onerror = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{
    alert(<span class="hljs-string">'failed'</span>);
};
http.setTimeout(<span class="hljs-number">20000</span>);
http.open(<span class="hljs-string">'GET'</span>, url, <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>);
http.setRequestHeader(<span class="hljs-string">"Content-Type"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"text/xml; charset=utf-8"</span>);
http.send(params);
</code></pre><p>The callbacks are designed to wait and listen asynchronously for the data to be returned from the API call you made.  This is very often (depending on many factors) really quick, but you can never expect perfect fast connections.</p>
<p>The callback is there to be fired by the object to say &quot;I now have the response&quot;, this happens when the communication has completed or failed (see the error handler).</p>

										<p><p>Hi Malcolm. Thanks so much for your feedback. The reason I had my code without the onload handler is because I needed the HTTP Request to complete before moving on with the rest of my code. There are other Web Services that I need to call.</p>
<p>Now, I suppose an alternative is to execute all that other code in the onload event as well, but it worries me a bit that this will get messy.</p>
<p>Let me first test and confirm that your example now works when distributing the App for Enterprise use.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>Titanium is an asynchronous, event-driven language. It doesn&#39;t matter how you write it, the methods are not blocking.</p>

										<p><p>To clarify, I mean you must use the event listeners for &quot;blocking&quot; other code from running. There&#39;s no way to structure your code to NOT use event listeners. That it happened to work for you on a couple devices was a fluke.</p>

										<p><p>Be aware that httpClient is asynchronous, you can never assume that your data will be returned straight away or even at all.</p>
<p>Your connection my be slow, broken up or non-existent and you have to handle all of these situations.</p>
<p>Your code should not immediately run on from the call but start again on receipt or failure of the data.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Malcolm and Shannon. Your statement about the http request being asynchronous is a bit confusing when I look at the documentation.</p>
<p>on the &quot;open&quot; method, the 3rd parameter states:</p>
<p>async : Boolean (optional)</p>
<p>Determines whether the request should be made asynchronously. Only used on iOS, Mobile Web and Tizen.<br>Default: True</p>
<p>I set this value to false which forces the request to complete before moving on. This is why I checked for the responseText. If you set this parameter to false though, you cannot use the onload event of the HTTP Request.</p>
<p>I have performed many many tests using my method on multiple iPads and never has it not worked.</p>
<p>Please help clarify the property I&#39;m using? I don&#39;t want to put in place bad practices, but this is a perfect solution for me and allows the Request to complete before I move on with my code.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>Malcolm and I apologize for confusing you. I forgot that property existed for a couple reasonsâ¦</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The entire nature of Titanium is event-driven and async, so using this property would be bad practice. It wouldn&#39;t make sense for everything in the app to follow that pattern, except this http call. I&#39;ve also heard that sometimes it does not work all the time, but again, I&#39;ve never tried it myself.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It&#39;s not cross-platform, so I wouldn&#39;t have really considered it anyway.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Typically, you would wrap the code that needs to happen after you get a response in a function, which not only is what you really need here, but follows the general idea of code reuse. What happens when the client says &quot;ok, if this fails because the user is offline, or their internet glitched, etc, I&#39;d like the user to be able to try again&quot;? Code as you have written it would not be conducive to such a request.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Shannon. I accept what you say. Behind the scenes I have managed the failing and processing of this request. It&#39;s currently been called from another function and returns 1 of many values back to that function to determine the way forward. The example I gave above was just to simplify where I felt the problem was.</p>
<p>Having said that, I do believe the way you suggest to be better and will modify my code accordingly.</p>
<p>Thanks to you and Malcolm for all your help.</p>
