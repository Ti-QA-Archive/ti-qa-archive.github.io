			<h1>Titanium + Windows + Android annoying slowly response</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hi,I&#39;m trying to develop an application for an Android device. I found Titanium behaves with a very slow response in every step involved in the creation of a project and the things go worst at the time one try to launch the application in the Android emulator.<br>I also tested Eclipse+Phonegap (and Phonegap plug-in for Eclipse also)and find it Ok.<br>Nevertheless I strongly want to use Titanium as it uses native UI objects etc. But with such slow response it is almost impossible to work.<br>I saw a lot of complains about this topic in the net. Can Titanium people help us to get this problem solved? Don&#39;t tell me it is a problem of the Android emulator for Windows because Eclipse+Phonegap use the same emulator and has no problems at all.<br>Thaks in advance</p>

<p>How many seconds is it taking for you to launch an app at the moment? What is an acceptable time, in your opinion?</p>

							<p>Mario, </p>
<p>The time it takes to boot an emulator or launch an app in an emulator is almost entirely dependent on Google&#39;s SDK.</p>
<p>However, so that you have a guide:</p>
<p>An application launched in TiDev running locally on an Ubuntu machine (i7 processor, 6GB memory) takes 40 seconds to an already-booted emulator, as <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.dropbox.com&#x2F;u&#x2F;14392713&#x2F;ubuntu-local.ogv">this video</a> shows.</p>
<p>An application launched in TiDev running on a Windows 7 virtual machine (VirtualBox), on the same Ubuntu host machine, takes 120 seconds to an already-booted emulator, as <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.dropbox.com&#x2F;u&#x2F;14392713&#x2F;windows7-virtual-guest.ogv">this video</a> shows. Bear in mind that in this case the guest only has access to a fraction of the resources of the host, and so it is expected that it will take longer to launch the app.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

							<p>One thing that is not clear in the developer tool is that while you need to stop the iOS emulator before launching a new build, stopping the Android emulator requires a full restart – which takes a very long time. But once the Android emulator is started you can just relaunch new builds. This still takes about a minute but is still <em>much</em> faster than stopping and restarting the emulator each time.</p>
