			<p>Are the Appcelerator push servers experiencing outages or limiting use for development Push Notifications? I had everything working perfectly last night from both the Cloud Management web site and from device to device.  This morning, no notifications go through.  I receive success events when sending, but the notifications are not delivered for IOS or Android.  I suspected this was occurring in the past but wrote it off to being caused by problems with my application. Is there a way to verify server status?</p>

							<div><p>I just had about 25 notifications all come in at once that I&#39;ve been sending throughout the day.  It must have been on the server side?  We need some assurance that there will be some reliability for our development…</p>
