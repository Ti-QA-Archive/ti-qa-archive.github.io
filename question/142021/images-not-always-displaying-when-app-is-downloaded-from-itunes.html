			<h1>Images Not Always Displaying When App is Downloaded from iTunes</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>A Titanium Mobile app which I wrote for a client was recently approved by Apple and is now available in the iTunes store (you can <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunes.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;ics-conference-2012&#x2F;id548427423?ls=1&amp;mt=8">download it here</a>). Some users who have downloaded it have encountered some strange behavior and I&#39;d appreciate your ideas on what the cause may be because I&#39;m stumped.</p>
<p>The app features a Ken Burns style slideshow on the front page. The images are bundled within the app package. Some users are reporting that when they install the app, they just see a black panel instead of the slideshow. However, there are two very unusual features about this which are making it very difficult to debug:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users have reported that uninstalling and then reinstalling the app fixes the problem. Sometimes it takes 2 or 3 reinstalls, but the problem does get fixed. <em>But why would the app behave differently on subsequent installs</em>?</li>
<li>There&#39;s some code withi the app which means the slideshow is implemented differently on iOS 5 (where it is composed of Ti.UI.ImageView objects and transforms) and earlier versions (where it&#39;s a webview with an HTML 5 &#x2F; Javascript animation). However, users on both iOS 5 and 4 have reported the problem. <em>Why would two completely different pieces of code exhibit the same problem</em>?</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#39;s also worth noting that this problem was not observed during testing when the app was distributed to testers as an ipa file via TestFlight. My first thought was that it could be a problem with the bundled package which is being distributed through iTunes, but that wouldn&#39;t explain why reinstalls fix the problem.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas?</p>

The missing information is critical to reproducing problems in a test environment and often indicates other factors that cause the undesirable outcome you are experiencing.</p>

							<div><p>In answer to those items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Application Type: Mobile</li>
<li>Titanium SDK: 2.0.2.GA</li>
<li>iOS version: Problem has been observed on 4.3, 5.1 and 5.1.1 but has also been observed on all those versions without problems too.</li>
<li>Device: No problems reported on iPhone 4S. No problems reported on iPhone or iPad simulator. No problems reported on iPad 2. Problem observed on some iPhone 4 and iPod Touch 4th Generation, but some such devices have also exhibited no problems.</li>
<li>Host operating system: OS X 10.7.4</li>
<li>Titanium Studio: 2.1.1.201207271312</li>
<li>Test Case: Download app from iTunes store and install on device. In some cases, a black pane appears instead of the slideshow. Uninstall, reinstall and problem will be gone (may require multiple uninstall and reinstalls… sometimes resolves after 1, one user has reported reinstalling 3 times before it fixed).</li>
<li>Logs: None to share, since problem has only been seen on production downloads from iTunes and not on any test devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Images are 640x480 PNG files. Stored in Resources\images along with other image files used elsewhere in the app. Filenames are slideshow1.png, slideshow2.png etc - 4 images in total.</p>

							<p>My gut says you&#39;re running into a memory issue of some sort… most likely you&#39;re not releasing objects when you&#39;re closing a window.</p>

										<p><p>Memory is my suspicion too because the problem hasn&#39;t been reported on iPhone 4S. However, it is the launch screen where the problem is (i.e. not much has happened or been loaded yet!). Also, killing off all apps on the device and then relaunching doesn&#39;t fix the problem, but a reinstall will.</p>
