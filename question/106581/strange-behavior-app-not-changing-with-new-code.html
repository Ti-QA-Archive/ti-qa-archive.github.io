		<section>
			<p>I am working on my first app and everything was working a couple of days ago, then I did not work on it for a few days.<br>now I am back to it but I&#39;ve run into some strange behavior.</p>
<p>As I am editing the code and launching on titanium to test the app is not changing with the code.<br>I am changing titles on buttons and trying to add labels but the app remains the same even when the code is completely different.</p>
<p>I am saving the project.<br>I have closed the emulator and restarted.<br>Closed titanium and restarted.<br>Deleted project off titanium and imported it back.<br>nothing seems to be working.</p>
<p>anyone have any ideas on what I did to cause this and how to fix?<br>thank you.</p>

							<p>Hi Luke</p>
<p>Remember to set your question tags with your mobile platform, and the 3rd-party SDK and Titanium SDK versions, as you should do with any post to this Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>I would recommend clearing out your build files. Follow the advice in my earlier post <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;104161&#x2F;31-to-42application-stopped-workin#184101">here</a> do find out how to do this.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you have installed new Android packages recently, remember to delete all your AVDs, as explained in the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.appcelerator.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;getting_started.html#preparing_for_android_development">Preparing for Android development</a> guide (around the red box).</p>

							<p>Which platform(s) and SDK levels are you using?  Neither the question nor tags specified.  It sounds as if it is still running an older version of the app which is already on the emulator.  Although titanium should normally be able to just replace an older version, my suggestion would be to force the simulator to delete the prior version before you launch again.</p>
<p>If using the iphone, an easy way to do that is from the simulator menu bar, using iPhone Simulator &gt; Reset Contents and Settings.</p>

							<p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p><em>Problem is fixed</em></p>
<p>I am running</p>
<p>Titanium 1.2.2<br> SDK APIs 2.2</p>
<p>Here is what i did that fixed the problem even though i am unsure why it fixed it.</p>
<p>Inside my resources folder i had another folder called &quot;Main_windows&quot; in which i had more .js files.<br>i was having trouble making my app.js file inside resources open the .js inside main_windows.<br>so i copied all the files from main_windows and put them into resources and did away with &#39;..&#x2F;main_windows&#x2F;filename.js&#39; and replaced it with &#39;filename.js&#39;</p>
<p>this worked for calling the file.<br>this is where i ran into the strange behavior i suppose.<br>i never deleted main_windows.</p>
<p>after deleting main_windows the app started updating after each launch as it is supposed to.<br>I guess simply having duplicate files was for some reason causing this behavior.</p>
<p>problem is no resolved after deleting main_windows folder.</p>
<p>thank you for the reply </p>
