			<h1>Suspected bug with orientation change when using percentage width/height</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Only been using Titanium for a couple of weeks, very impressed so far, but I think i&#39;ve discovered a bug in the orientation handling when switching between landscape and portrait. Only tested this on Android but my app does NOT correctly layout when switching orientations IF i use percentage based widths&#x2F;heights (which I really want to use).</p>
<p>The problem can be worked-around to a limited extent by using &#39;right&#39; and &#39;bottom&#39; properties instead of width&#x2F;height. But this doesn&#39;t work for more complex layouts where width&#x2F;height are needed. I&#39;m not exactly sure how to log this issue with Appcelerator but I though I&#39;d post it up here first in case anyone&#39;s come across the same issue and knows a decent workaround.</p>
<p>The code for a simple demonstration of the problem can be found here (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;2057826). If you try this in the Android emulator and switch orientations you&#39;ll see how the &#39;width&#x2F;height&#39; tab layout gets messed up, whereas the &#39;right&#x2F;bottom&#39; tab is correct in both portrait and landscape.</p>

							<div><p>Have a similar problem, only when I change orientation everything sets properly.  This includes, views, labels and tableviewrows.  No way to rule it as an emulator issue as I do not a device to test on.</p>
<p>I am running: Titanium SDK 1.6.2, Android SDK 2.3.3, Screen HVGA.</p>

							<div><p>At the time of writing I was using 1.7.0 SDK, I just retested with 1.7.1 using the code sample above but the problem is still present. Any help would be much appreciated as I really like the way % width&#x2F;height work generally it&#39;s just the change orientation problem which is causing me a headache.</p>
