			<h1>YouTube malformed embeds</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am using a WebView to display 10 YouTube video players in a what looks like a ListView or TableView, but is actually built in pure HTML. This is to get round issues with YouTube embedded players being displayed in a native ListView where, because of row reuse, they get reloaded each time a user scrolls, plus other issues I won&#39;t bore you with.</p>
<p>This method is simple and works quite well and with a bit of styling you wouldn&#39;t know it wasn&#39;t a real ListView. However I do have an issue - which is that from time to time one or more of the players (the YouTube iframe embeds) loads in a malformed way, that is with a small play button and a large YouTube logo, rather than the normal player with a large red play button and a small YouTube logo button at its bottom right. Clicking on this malformed player opens that video&#39;s playlist page on the YouTube website and loads it into my Webview instead of playing the video. And once it&#39;s done that there&#39;s no way to get back to the list again barring reloading the lot.</p>
<p>Has anybody seen this issue? I thought it may be a consequence of loading 10 videos one after the other and in fact tried using a timer to slow down the loading, but the odd malformed player still appears from time to time.</p>
<p>The embed code simply creates an iframe and sets it&#39;s source to:</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;embed&#x2F;4eXYq-q1Zvs?showinfo=0&amp;controls=0&amp;rel=0</p>
<p>Example screenshot below (if I&#39;ve managed to get the syntax right). The first row is the malformed one, the second row is as the player should be. Any ideas or suggestions?</p>
