			<h1>Android app optimization.</h1>

		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve made it most of the way through developing the basic structure of my android app. On running it, it is painfully slow. Opening the first window for example takes about 5 seconds. And my app isn&#39;t that complex either. 5 windows in total , the most complex being a table view with 9 rows.</p>
<p>Are there any things I should look out for which will slow things down?</p>

							<p>Hmm, this is a year too late but you should post your code on issues like this. It can be many different things. The most common are having too many objects in memory, try only creating objects when you need them and look into closing windows and nulling them and all of there children out when they are not in use. Too many includes also can slow down an app. Only include files as you need them rather than all at the start of your app. And finally, it might just be the emulator, its slow; Try it on a real device.</p>
<p>I know this may seem a little late but at least it may help those who come across this with the same problem.</p>
