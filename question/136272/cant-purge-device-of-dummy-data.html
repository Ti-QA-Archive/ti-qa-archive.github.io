			<h1>Can&#39;t purge device of dummy data</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>While my app was in development I put some dummy data in the database and used it for testing. Now that I am ready to submit it to Apple I got rid of all the data in the original database, but when I push the app to my iPhone, that dummy data is still there.</p>
<p>I already did these things:</p>
<p>1) Went to &#39;MyUser &gt; Library &gt; Application Support &gt; iPhone Simulator &gt; 5.1&#39; and deleted everything</p>
<p>2) In Titanium Studio: Project  &gt; Clean</p>
<p>3) Deleted the app from my iPhone in the usual way</p>
<p>4) Went to &#39;ProjectHomeDirectory &gt; MyApp&#39; where I renamed the &#39;Build&#39; directory (sister to &#39;Resources&#39;) to build_old to force the creation of a new &#39;build&#39; directory</p>
<p>None of those did the trick.  When I fire up the app on my iPhone, the dummy data is still there.  Where else could this data still be hiding or cached?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>I had a similar issue where an updated version of a database wouldn&#39;t be available on the device (the table structure was completely different to the DB in Resources). I tried various things but what finally worked was deleting the appropriate folder under ~&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Developer&#x2F;Xcode&#x2F;DerivedData (there should be one for each app you have built in Xcode). For some reason Xcode was caching the DB (but not any other assets AFAICT).</p>

							<p>hi,</p>
<p>i think you added data to your original database located in your resources folder so just delete data from there</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Mitul.  I had deleted the data from that database, but the original dummy data was still showing up on the device. I figured xCode had it cached somewhere, I just wasn&#39;t sure where.</p>
