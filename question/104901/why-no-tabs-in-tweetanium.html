			<h1>Why no tabs in tweetanium?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m curios why the tweetanium code doesn&#39;t use the standard API for tabs and tab groups?  What couldn&#39;t be accomplished with the tab API?  I ask because I was planning on using the tab API but now am considering following the tweetanium paradigm.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m not sure that memory issues ever were part of the reasoning.  I think they were looking for a common UI across platforms, and native tabs look very different between iOS and Android.  Plus I think they liked the animation and look of their custom tabs better than either platform&#39;s native tabs.  Plus it helped showcase some tricks you can pull in Titanium.</p>
<p>One alternative now is to move the Android tab group to the bottom of the window, in which case it comes much closer to looking similar to iOS tab groups.  Without getting into the religious debates about whether it is kosher to modify Android&#39;s native tabs that way, I&#39;ll just say that if you wanted to do that the easier way is documented <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.mattapperson.com&#x2F;bottom-tabbar-on-android-in-titanium">here</a> (with credit due to Matt Apperson).</p>
<p>In general, memory management is much better now than in earlier SDK levels.  This is especially true if you are using CommonJS style coding.</p>
