			<p><strong> RECREATED FROM STACKOVERFLOW AS THERE DOESN&#39;T SEEM TO BE MUCH TITANIUM GOING ON THERE… </strong></p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;m creating a simple twitter app to learn Titanium. What I have is a tableView populated from a live twitter stream.</p>
<p>What I need to know is how I create clickable links from twitter user names, to be able to open that user&#39;s profile. I can get the regexp&#39;d usernames, but don&#39;t know how to do something with them.</p>
<p>Any help much appreciated.</p>
<p>There doesn&#39;t seem to be much in the way of tutorials for mobile, or am I perhaps not looking in the right place?</p>
<p>Paul</p>

<p>Your question(s) are pretty high level and general so, look though the app provided and when you run into specific problems, post those and then the community can respond</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the answers, however I think this is specific enough to have an answer.<br>All I need is some pointers on making part of the text in a tableview&#39;s entry clickable.<br>I can create the tableview, containing the text from a twitter stream, and can isolate the twitter usernames. What I don&#39;t know is how to add an event listener to part of the text, not the whole thing.<br>Any advice is appreciated.</p>

										<p><p>I am having the same issue. I need to be able to break the twitter text into a series of labels to make them clickable. The only issue I have is that each new line also has to be a seperate label.</p>

							<p>You were right, you are not looking in the right place. Go to the first tab in KitchenSink -&gt; Views -&gt; Table Views -&gt; Table View (Layout 2). There is a layout for a facebook like table, but it will help you a lot. If you click on the title of every row you will see that the app prints a message accordingly.</p>

										<p><p>The Kitchen Sink demo does not do what people are asking for. It creates separate labels for parts of the text which are clickable (this is quite straightforward), but what people actually want (myself included) is one label which is formatted and wrapped accordingly but which contains individual pieces of text that are clickable.</p>
<p>Is this at all possible without making it a WebView?</p>
