			<h1>Creating Splash screen and Icon</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Good day,</p>
<p>I am currently creating my first titanium-powered mobile app(s). One tedious thing that I did find however is the creation of splash screens and icons (i.e. I create one, and I have to copy that in different locations and different filenames and in different dimensions).</p>
<p>Does anybody have a tip easily do this?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Franz</p>

							<p>Franz,</p>
<p>This is really just the nature of both android and iOS individually, and exacerbated collectively with cross-platform development.</p>
<p>iOS itself requires 3 icons, and possibly 6 splash screens.  This doesn&#39;t account for the various mini-icons that are used through out that OS for searching, file associations, etc. Apple has minimum requirements just to submit.</p>
<p>On android you can get away with a single icon and a single splash screen because there is little or no oversight on submissions.  The icon will look &#39;ok&#39; about 90% of the time, but the splash screen will be stretched out worse than a tattoo on a senior citizen.</p>
<p>Our graphics guy has gotten pretty good at working his magic on the (pardon the phrase) crap that we programmers send over to him:</p>
<p> &quot;Can you make this pile of elephant dung shine, in multiple sizes, and have it by 2pm? Mkk, thanks&quot;</p>
<p>For iOS two tools have been useful: </p>
<ul>
<li>icons - which takes a 512x512 image and generates iOS and Android sized icons.  Quick, dirty, fast.</li>
<li>ShipIt - takes your @2x graphics and makes non-retina sizes. This is great for all your iOS graphics, including your splash screens</li>
</ul>
<p>Android splash screen sizes are so weird, thats its difficult to take a single graphic and automate the creation of all the various sizes and orientations. </p>
<p>My process (before getting smart graphics guy) was to to create a graphic at the lowest common denominator and pad the outside to match the various sizes.  That was great until hi-density screens and tablets came along then a logo was &#39;wittle itsy bitsy&#39; in the middle of the screen.</p>
