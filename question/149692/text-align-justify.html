		<section>
			<p>Is Text align (justify) supported in Titanium? If not, what is the reason why justifying is not supported? I am using Titanium to develop an application for enterprise and the UI looks not so professional with only left, right, center alignments. Any milestone date when this feature would be available?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>There is no support for <strong>Justify</strong> as an alignment choice.  There is no milestone for inclusion and I would not expect anytime soon.</p>
<p>Many studies have shown that left aligned text in paragraphs allow the reader to quickly read content and especially on small screens or narrower paragraphs.  I agree that justified text appears neater but it is harder to read as there are no visual breaks between lines to indicate the difference between one and the other.</p>
<p>Having developed many apps for many levels of target audience I can assure I have never been asked by a client to justify the text, or by any user experience testing to do the same.</p>
<p>A good quality well built app with care taken on the visuals and user experience is a good app - justifying the text is not part of that process in my opinion and 25 years of software development.</p>
<p>Justified text text is a hang over from newspapers, see how many books and websites avoid justified text - significantly more than actually use it.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>parsad there are only three features for text alignment but you could always adjust the text by using left right and other properties and i dont think which you are saying is ever gonna added by titanium because i think you are the first one on this forum to complaint about this</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
