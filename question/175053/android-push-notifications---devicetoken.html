			<h1>Android Push Notifications - deviceToken</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi to all,</p>
<p>I have struggling to test the android push notification system through ACS but weird things happen.<br>I test the following scenario:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I have installed the app and using Ti.CloudPush.retrieveDeviceToken() I get a deviceToken, let&#39;s call it <strong><em>deviceToken1</em></strong>. I then register a channel, e.g. <strong>_test<em>channel1</em></strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I delete the app without first deregistering the test_channel1 above so the respective record stays in ACS admin panel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I reinstall the same app (same id, same device). In this case the app may or may not acquire the same token as above**. I consider the case which a different token from Ti.CloudPush.retrieveDeviceToken() is retrieved, let&#39;s call it <strong><em>deviceToken2</em></strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This time I only register to a different channel, e.g. <strong>_test<em>channel2</em></strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Concluding:</strong></p>
<p>I have <strong>2 records</strong> in ACS for the same app id and same device. Although my current installation has not registered for push notifications in test_channel1 but only in test_channel2 I still get push notifications for test_channel1.</p>
<p>I have tested all these in production version of the app.</p>
<hr>
<p>What is a deviceToken? I mean is this something that every time has to be populated as the same result or not?<br>Documentation for Ti.CloudPush.retrieveDeviceToken() reads<br><code>This token is unique to each application and device.</code><br>What do we mean by &quot;each application&quot;? The app id, or it is a combination of other factors too (e.g. app version)?<br>I have noticed, as mentioned above, to get a different deviceToken in the same device installing the same app id. Is this normal? Am I missing something?</p>
<p>Any advice appreciated.</p>

<p>1)  Delete that subscribe device from push_notification —&gt; subscribed_devices</p>
<p>2) Uninstall App and than again install with clean project.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Dharmik</p>

							<div><p>Patel thanks for your answer.</p>
<p>Actually what you are proposing works well when in development but what about in production?<br>There is no way to track the problem and of course no way to manually delete subscribed devices without making things worse.</p>
<p>Do you have any opinion about my device token related questions? </p>
<p>This is what actually confuses me. If the device token was always the same then my problem would never exist.<br>I have implemented a cleanup mechanism on app startup so that any previously registered channels would be wiped out for this specific token before registering any new ones.</p>

							<p>After some experiments it seems that there is problem when a device registers for push notifications in both development and production environment without first unsubscribing from one of the two.</p>
<p>I am not 100% that there lies the problem but for now I have followed this rule and every time I freshly reinstall the app the device token seems to be the same, so the previous subscriptions are wiped out correctly. </p>
<p>Please feel free to deposit your own experience just to conclude if that&#39;s the case.</p>
<p>Maybe it is a bug which would be nice to post in jira for everyone&#39;s concern.</p>
