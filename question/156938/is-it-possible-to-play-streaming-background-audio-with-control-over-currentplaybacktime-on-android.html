			<h1>Is it possible to play streaming background audio with control over currentPlaybackTime on Android?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>On Android, is it possible to play streaming background audio with a scrubber&#x2F;slider to control play position?</p>
<p>VideoPlayer: Has scrubber&#x2F;slider but stops when home button or power button is pressed.<br>AudioPlayer: Plays in background but loses it&#39;s place when connection is interrupted and has no seek&#x2F;setCurrentPlaybackTime, so the stream starts over.</p>
<p>I am open to 3rd party modules and native language solutions if anyone has one.</p>

							<div><p>Alternately, I would be partially satisfied with the ability to start a stream in AudioPlayer at a given time. This would allow me to record playback time and re-launch the stream from the last known position. No control over playback but at least it wouldn&#39;t need to start over.</p>

<p>right now you can&#39;t with the audioplayer. The option would be to create a custom native module. </p>

										<p><p>I had come up with an extreme work around by placing a VideoPlayer in a Window and moving it off screen 99.9% but it would only allow background play when the app was focused, so the device could sleep but if you tried to use other apps it would stop.</p>
