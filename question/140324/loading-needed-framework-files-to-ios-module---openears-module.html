			<p>Hello,<br>I am working on developing an openears titanium module, the framework needs some files to run. where should I add these files? I created a stand alone application that uses openears and all I had to do is add the files to Copy Bundle Resources.<br>Thanks</p>

							<p>Have a look at the module.xcconfig file.<br>You will need to also add the framework to link to in there.</p>
<p>It has some commented-out examples.</p>
<p>Also, have a look around github for some examples of how others have done similar things. </p>
<p>hth.</p>

										<p><p>I already added the framework to the module.xconfig file. I can build the project without any errors and I can even run it, but it cashes. the problem is that  openears framework needs some crucial external files to run.</p>

										<p><p>Hmm.. I&#39;m still learning this too ;) </p>
<p>Have you also made sure that the files you need are also included in your Resources folder? </p>
<p>I spent a day trying to get a module to work recently, thinking the problem was in the code, only to find that all I needed was to copy a special file in to the Resources folder! :) </p>
<p>Also, naturally, make sure you do full rebuilds each time to try a new way to make it work. ;)</p>

										<p><p>resources folder? do you mean the assets folder or the copy bundle resources in build phases? well I have the files in both.. I know for sure that I can use the files in the assets folder as I print a file&#39;s content from there.. as for files in the copy bundle resources, I cant read from them, which expected as its not the documented way to use files..</p>

							<p>I solved the problem by passing the directory of the assets folder to the framework.. and tweaked the framework such as it uses the files in that directory</p>
