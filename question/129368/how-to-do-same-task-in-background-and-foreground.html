			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have an app in which I want a beep sound every 10 seconds, no matter whether my app is in the foreground or background.</p>
<p>I have used timers to play the beep sound every 10 seconds when my app is in the foreground. What is the best way to keep the app beeping exactly every 10 seconds no matter whether the app is in the foreground or background?</p>
<p>I know I can call Titanium.App.iOS.registerBackgroundService and use that to run a background script but is that the best way to accomplish what I am looking to do?  Lets say the user opens my app at T=0s.  At T=10 seconds, my beep sound plays.  At T=14 seconds, they put my app in the background by pressing the home button.  At T=20 seconds, my app should play the beep sound again, which is 6 seconds after the app has been put into the background.  What&#39;s the best way to accomplish this?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help!<br>Arvind.</p>

							<p>you should count every second when your app is runnning, and every 10 seconds beep.<br>When the app goes in background, you should check how many seconds have gone by when the app was active, and count for the remaining time.<br>When the app is active again you should make the same difference in the other way round.</p>
