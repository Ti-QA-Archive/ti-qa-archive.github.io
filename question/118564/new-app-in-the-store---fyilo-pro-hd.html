			<h1>New App in the Store! - fyilo Pro HD</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Just thought I&#39;d let you know about a new iPad app built on the Titanium Platform that is now live in the App Store.</p>
<p>It&#39;s called <strong>fyilo Pro HD</strong>, and is the first fully featured, personal organiser to be available for the iPad. </p>
<p>###It has a pile of features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating Events</li>
<li>Note taking, audio recording and drawing</li>
<li>RSS&#x2F;Atom Reader</li>
<li>Managing ToDos</li>
<li>Reading and updating your Facebook and Twitter feeds</li>
</ul>
<p>####<br>We also have the ability to download packs of Events and rich content from the fyilo Store.</p>
<p>###fyilo has integration with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook (using a custom module, we don&#39;t like having to use Safari to log in)</li>
<li>Twitter timeline</li>
<li>Instapaper</li>
<li>Google docs for uploading your notes as PDF or RTF</li>
<li>Urban Airship Storefront</li>
<li>Flurry Analytics</li>
</ul>
<p>###Some dev statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Around 25,000 lines of code</li>
<li>9 Custom iOS modules</li>
<li>Took around a week from submission to approval (including some In-App purchases)</li>
<li>Lots of coffee…….</li>
</ul>
<p>####<br>We have a lot more in the roadmap for this product, as well as complementary products.</p>
<p>We are also looking for commissions, so please send me a message if you could use some help (we are UK based by the way)</p>
<p>Using Titanium for this has been fantastic, and we&#39;re now working on the Android version - we hope to get around 70-80% code reuse. So thanks for an excellent dev environment.</p>
<p>Also thanks to the forum, this is my first post, but a lot of active users have helped resolve issues without even knowing it!</p>
<p>All comments or suggestions are gratefully received.</p>

<p>Question about your in-app.  Are they the Apple approved ones, or did you use some 3rd party method, or what?</p>

							<div><p>Thanks all.</p>
<p>Josh,<br>To answer your question, we are using the Urban Airship StoreFront system to host our in-App purchases and are using their drop-in library within fyilo to allow purchases and downloads.<br>We went down this route, as being our first app we felt we didn&#39;t want to go the whole hog and put in our own store system. It&#39;s something we will probably look at later on.</p>
<p>For free content we can just add it to StoreFront without using the Apple app review process.<br>However, we have initially gone live with some paid diary activations that we needed to get approved.  These went in with the fyilo app submission, and were thankfully approved at the same time.<br>Cheers</p>

							<div><p>Well, I would be very interested in seeing some code or documentation about the in-app purchase system. If you are ever in a sharing mood, please paste away! :) Congrats on the app, it looks awesome, very well done.</p>

							<div><p>Absolutely! We learned a lot along the way, especially where it comes to integrating with third party SDKs (UA Storefront and Dropbox were particularly fiddly).<br>I&#39;m going to put some &#39;How Tos&#39; together shortly on our site and share them for anyone who is interested.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Paul.<br>I wasn&#39;t entirely  sure about the etiquette for letting people know about the app, and as I mentioned I&#39;m a first time poster (long time listener!) and wanted to thank everyone.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll check out the Ti Success Stories.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
