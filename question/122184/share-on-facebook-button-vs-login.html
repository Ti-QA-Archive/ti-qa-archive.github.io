			<h1>Share on Facebook. Button vs Login?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey! I&#39;m adding a &#39;share this app on facebook&#39; button to an iphone app, but I&#39;m just wondering what you think would be the best way to tackle it?</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to decide between having a button that simply opens safari to the facebook share url, vs the actual facebook api where the user logs in to their facebook account within the app?</p>
<p>I&#39;m thinking the facebook api is a bit much, just to &#39;share on facebook&#39; and do nothing else, but it might be a nicer user experience without having to exit to safari and then open the app again?</p>
<p>What would you do?</p>

							<p>Is it possible to embed a &quot;Like&quot; button? That would be easy as the user probably wouldn&#39;t need to leave the app. A like is as good as a share. Have not tried it myself, but worth a shot?<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.facebook.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;reference&#x2F;plugins&#x2F;like&#x2F;</p>

										<p><p>Thats not a bad idea, although I do think a share would be better than a like, as a share will display a larger area on the facebook users profile, whereas a like only shows minimal text.</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion! I&#39;ll check out the plug and see if it can be embed!</p>

							<p>On looking into it further, you can only use the facebook api by first registering your app with facebook. You cant register with facebook as a business, and I dont want to use my personal account and dont want to give all new info and credit card details to them (which you have to do to become a developer now). So looks like using the api is out of the question.</p>

							<p>Was just thinking, why not make a simple fan page, you won&#39;t need to register that with facebook. The &quot;Like&quot; will be attached to the page and from there you can direct people to the app store.</p>
