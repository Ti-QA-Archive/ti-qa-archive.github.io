			<p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>So I&#39;ve looked at a whole range of &#39;answers&#39; to this question, but unfortunately, I&#39;m getting errors and am not sure why. </p>
<p>So I&#39;ve added two files to the directory app&#x2F;lib&#x2F; called underscore.js (has the latest underscore code) and ti.parse.js (has the latest code from the Parse website).</p>
<p>In the file I am wanting to call Parse objects and play around with them, I use the following lines (please note, this is what many of the sites who give tutorials etc use):</p>
<p>var _ = require(&#39;lib&#x2F;underscore&#39;);<br>require(&#39;lib&#x2F;ti.parse&#39;);</p>
<p>Parse.initialize(&#39;xxxxxx&#39;, &#39;xxxxxxx&#39;); &#x2F;&#x2F; the x&#39;s i&#39;ve changed to the correct keys needed.</p>
<p>When i run the iphone simulator, I get the following errors:</p>
<p>[ERROR] :  Script Error = Couldn&#39;t find module: localStorage at ti.parse.js (line 0).</p>
<p>[ERROR] :  Script Error = Module &quot;lib&#x2F;test&quot; failed to leave a valid exports object at theFileIvePutTheLinesAboveIn.js (line 0).</p>
<p>What am i doing wrong? I am fairly new to this so fair enough, but I feel like i checked everything and this is my last resort. One further thing: I&#39;ve seen some places mention the fact that you need to include &#39;something&#39; in the tiapp.xml file. Did that, didn&#39;t work.. so I took it out. Also, none of the tutorials stating this had any edits to the tiapp.xml file either. Not sure if it helps, but I&#39;ve also tried adding those lines to my app.js file with the same errors occurring. Any help would be great!</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Gere</p>

										<p><p>No it really doesn&#39;t. I&#39;ve been there before and I can see you didn&#39;t read my thread properly. (sorry its just that its a very frustrating error). In addition, that guys code has an error in it. Once you fix the error.. his code does work but its missing sooo much functionality of the parse model. It&#39;s like I can &#39;get&#39; and object (table) but I can&#39;t do much with it (it&#39;s definitely not the same as the parse.js file available on the parse.com website).</p>
<p>Any continued help would be so greatly appreciated.</p>

										<p><p>i should also mention that this guy really pulled it together nicely (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;juanbermudez&#x2F;Ti.Parse&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;example), but I&#39;m having the same problems with this code, which i dont think he was having. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve just missed or overlooked something… or possibly even forgot to set up something. I&#39;m just not sure.</p>

							<p>Could always try this one, talks to the REST api. Not as full featured as the other one, but then, it works (in our production apps now) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;4400387">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;4400387</a></p>

										<p><p>Hi Stephen, theres a small error in your code, just where you&#39;ve referenced appID and not appId (easy to fix either way). Stephen how do you iterate through the results once you call the getObject function? Thank you for your suggestion anyway. I&#39;ve tried using it and it just doesn&#39;t suit my needs for my project. Hence the want to try and get the actual parse.js module up and running with titanium. </p>
<p>There must be a reason I&#39;m getting those two errors and thats what this post was about; investigating and seeing if anyone had been successful in diagnosing the cause of the problem. If someone has a solution to the problem I&#39;m having that references either of the problems above, or if someone knows how to fix it directly, that response would be be greatly appreciated.</p>

										<p><p><code>theres a small error in your code, just where you&amp;#39;ve referenced appID</code></p>
<p>yeah, comes from transposing our code over.  We dont actually put the appId in that file in the project, is pulled from a config.js file.</p>

<p>It depends.  Sometimes we cache the results to a file first:</p>

exports.myObjects = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(_callback)</span></span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> f = Ti.Filesystem.getFile(Caching.cachedPath(<span class="hljs-string">'data'</span>),<span class="hljs-string">'myObjects.json'</span>);
    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">callback</span><span class="hljs-params">(success, data)</span></span>{

        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (success){
            Ti.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">'SUCCESS: '</span>);
            f.write(data);
        } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
            Ti.API.error(<span class="hljs-string">'ERROR: '</span>+ data);
            f.write(<span class="hljs-string">'{}'</span>);
            alert(<span class="hljs-string">'We had an error fetching the list of myObjects.  Long press the tab bar below to refresh when you have Internet access.'</span>);
        }
    _callback();
    }

    <span class="hljs-comment">// Call Parse</span>
    Parse.getObjects(myObjects<span class="hljs-string">', callback);

}</span>

										<p><p>but the results from the query are a string, so it always comes down to <code>JSON.parse(myResults)</code> whether those come from the local file system or straight back from the getObjects query.</p>

										<p><p><code>try and get the actual parse.js module up and running with titanium.</code></p>
<p>Well, ti.parse is not an appcelerator product, its a end user&#39;s project and if you are looking at juanbermudez&#39;s repo, 7 months old. He said in the parse <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.parse.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;official-titanium-api">forums</a> that he was going to post an update, but thats been a month.</p>
<p>If you are looking at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;iantearle&#x2F;Ti.Parse">Ian Tearle&#39;s repo</a>, it was updated 16 days ago but hadn&#39;t been updated for 5 months before that. If you are using his, suggest you ask him technical questions, seems to me to make sense to talk to the original developer.</p>
<p>I wrote the REST wrapper because the other 2 implementations were large and excessive and broken?? at the time.  Take it or leave it. I&#39;d like to think that I stepped on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;StephenFeather&#x2F;status&#x2F;288646686492995584">someone&#39;s toes</a> and thats why one repo was updated after nearly half a year.</p>

										<p><p>I should say that competition is good. not everyone needs the entire parse api with underscore embedded in it.  at the same time, mine doesn&#39;t implement everything  as I haven&#39;t needed it all when working with parse. Ian is approachable, you can find him on twitter via the lnk above.</p>
