			<h1>New Push Pricing Concern</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi Everyone.</p>
<p>I received notification of the new pricing put in place for Push notifications and i&#39;m actually quite shocked at the new pricing structure. Let me provide some calculations if you don&#39;t mind…</p>
<p>If I have just under 25,000 downloads of my app (not unreasonable) which is based on 0.69p unit price the total (before tax but with Apples 30% taken is) £12075 total. Push with ACS over 4 years to support this App would be £9532 if all instance of the app are active.</p>
<p>Now am I missing something here because, based on my calculations above, its darn expensive… I don&#39;t know too much about Urban Airship but it appears they have up to 1 million per month which does not cost anything on a basic service. And even if you do go over 1 million the costs are still manageable.</p>
<p>Thoughts or have I slipped up here in my calculations?</p>
<p>Regards, Steven</p>

							<div><p>Try PushWizard. No limits with devices, however they are limiting the number of push you can send. For example if you have 5 million users, then you can send a message to all your users for free 4 times every months. If you need more it is also possible for cheap.</p>

							<p>Hi Steven,</p>
<p>i agree with your remark or i also made an error in calculation.<br>Another example, if an app gets between 1000 - 5000 registered push users, sending notifications cost 99 $ &#x2F; month or 1188 $ &#x2F; year which is quite expensive regarding the app cost. My client (and some quite over 5000 registered users) will never accept these prices. </p>
<p>Indeed, Urban Airship leds to 1 million free push &#x2F; month.</p>
<p>It becomes realistic to use an other solution, even building my own notification server.</p>
<p>I understand that Appcelerator must find a way to be profitable but I dont understand their prices.</p>
<p>If someone from Appcelerator could answer to this post and give us some clear details, it would be very nice.</p>

										<p><p>Hey Jean. Thanks for this. Am I right in thinking that Urban Airship only charges per notification received by the device and does not charge you for the device to be registered on their system in the first place?</p>

										<p><p>I agree…base plan is not based on the number of registered users.<br>If based on registered users, how can you handle with the evolution of the cost while you were telling your client that notifications are an affordable way to reach your customers (by comparison with SMS)</p>

							<p>I totally agree. I have an app with 110 users or so. It is quite small at the moment. And just for that I have to pay $ 99 a month! It is very expensive.</p>
<p>I wish someone Appcelerator team read this and comment on something. These prices are prohibitive.</p>
<p>What can we do? Unsubscribe Push notifications on our Apps?</p>
<p>Is there any alternative?. Urban Airship had thought but I have no clear function in Android with Appcelerator. Has anyone gotten and can give an example?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

							<p>I think it is crazy to pay for registered push devices instead of sent pushes. I mean, what if my app gets a lot of downloads (if I am lucky), perhaps 10.000 then I will have huge costs right away (even if I do not send any pushes) and I have to upload a new app to Appstore and hope that people will update to it to stop the costs from growing. I do not trust ACS, it changes to often. I LOVE Titanium of course :)</p>

							<p>I received the following email from appcelerator clarifying some pricing points:<br>Thanks for your feedback. To answer your first question, we are charging for push based on the number of devices that actually receive notifications during the month. We will not charge just based on the number of devices actually registered, as other push services do.</p>
<p>I received this from Mike Goff, director of product management….</p>

										<p><p>But I must add that I suspect most applications would take receipt of their push notifications. Even if you said that 70% received them it&#39;s still a huge cost. This pricing model does serious damage to smaller developers who rely on push as a feature but could hit them hard as their respective applications increase in use.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong I agree that the push feature should generate revenue for Appcelerator. Nobody would dispute this but the current structure does absolutely no favours in encouraging developers to grow with the platform. Titanium is really starting to bring plenty to the table but this is a real kick in the teeth.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks to James above and Matt below I was also not aware of StackMob or Parse options. Just reviewing the pricing for these two services it totally re-enforces the argument to how Appcelerator have come up with their pricing.

										<p><p>Parse.com looks really good, thanks for this tip. I have just switched from UA to Parse.com (very easy, no extra Titanium module needed btw) and I am saving about 1300 USD each month as I have about 150k active devices (iOS). ACS Push is really expensive if you have a lot of users. But Parse or UA doesn&#39;t provide an Android push solution the way I need it, so I have to stay with ACS.</p>
<p>BTW: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appoxee.com seems to offer unlimited pushes for free.</p>

										<p><p>Yes I hope so Jean. Still nothing of any substance yet from Appcelerator but I believe this is worth some explanation to the model they have introduced. Like others have also said this latest setup is not going to do them many favours.</p>
<p>But certainly since I started this thread I have learnt plenty about other options available which I did not know about. I am still bemused over the pricing of Appcelerator compared to other solutions.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, I didnt know about these interesting alternative solutions before this post !<br>If Appcelerator could provide something similar for community (which is an important part of their users), this problem could be solved (for them).<br>This price variation makes me think about the dependancy of our developments using frameworks. Framework such as Titanium makes us gain time for our development but if we do native apps directly, dont we fully master our process without such problem.</p>

							<p>I was in shock as well when i received the e-mail. I have over 13000 unique registrations and that will cost me at least $320 &#x2F; month…. And i expect more users of my dutch weather app when the new release is ready. The app is free in the appstore and it has a banner, but i only earn about $80 &#x2F; month with my app. I have a temp. version send to apple of my app, so push notification is removed…. Too bad. I hope i won&#39;t loose users of my app….. THANKS APPCELERATOR (NOT!!!!)</p>

							<p>The prices of Appcelerator are really inefficient!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve thought about to use ACS including the Push service, but now, i&#39;ve decided to use another Push Notification service like Parse or UrbanAirShip. </p>
<p>Are there any &quot;current&quot; tutorials on UrbanAirShip integration?</p>

										<p><p>I think the point with Urban Airship is purely on 1 Million pushes per month. If you believe you are going to always be under this then UA is a good choice. Other alternatives mentioned on this thread have different levels too but also very comparable and equally good options. </p>
<p>The key point is that we all have a choice. I would just like Appcelerator to voice their take on the benefits of paying a massive premium on using ACS Push over other suppliers. I may accept their argument but just one response which we can all understand and we can all make a choice going forward.</p>

										<p><p>Yes UrbanAirship does appear to work nicely with minimal fuss but Matt I would really appreciate taking a look at your JS Library because Parse does provide additional features that could be useful. Appreciate it buddy!</p>

							<p>Hi, I use the upush module in the Marketplace, took me 10 minutes to get it working, cost $30 but has saved me so much time.<br>They also have a push service that costs $5 per month for unlimited messages, works really well for iOS and Android.</p>

							<p>Alan. Looking at the Marketplace this appears to be a solution for Android only. Please confirm. I could also find no details on the web related to their $5 per month unlimited notifications. Please confirm.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Steven,<br>The module is for Android only, iPhone push is much easier to do, just search on the Q &amp; A&#39;s.<br>Their website is www.upush.co.uk, the documentation in the module gives easy instructions how to use their service.<br>Hope this helps.<br>Alan</p>

										<p><p>Hi Alan. Just signed up and things looked good until I quickly found out that the api allows me to specify a device id but what about 1000&#39;s of device ids. Surely I would not want to invoke the web service 1000&#39;s of times to send the notification. Is there any grouping?</p>
