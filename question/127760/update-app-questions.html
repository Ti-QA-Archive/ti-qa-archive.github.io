			<h1>Update App Questions</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve been reading whatever posts I can find, but was hoping that somebody might be able to offer some clarification on this matter.</p>
<p>I have an app on Android MArketplace and App store that I&#39;d like to update. Am I right in assuming that I just rebuild my updated app for distribution using the same methods as I originally built the file, and then just upload this as a new version in Android Publisher and iTunesConnect?</p>
<p>I know that I have to increment the Android versions in the Tiapp.xml, do I have to do anything similar for the iPhone version?</p>
<p>Also am I missing anything from this process?</p>
<p>Any help would be massively appreciated…</p>

							<p>You are assuming right. On ITC (iTunes Connect), go to the app you want to update and select &quot;Add version&quot;. ITC will ask you for the new version number (which must be the same as in your tiapp.xml file), revision notes and new screenshots. So you must increment iPhone app version as well in Tiapp.xml, and the same for android. Remember mark the app as &quot;ready to upload binary&quot; on ITC and send de ipa file from xCode organizer, as you did the first time you published the app.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a safe process, I mean, you can&#39;t &quot;broke&quot; anything, but be sure you upload the right file and that you have tested it deeply, because revision time for ios is about 7-10 days.</p>

							<p>Hi Dan and Javier - thanks for your responses.</p>
<p>Just to double check on the IoS side of things, I know on Android I add this:</p>
<p>android:versionCode=&quot;3&quot; android:versionName=&quot;1.0.2&quot;&gt;<br>            &lt;uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion=&quot;8&quot;&#x2F;&gt;</p>
<p>For IoS am I just changing the &lt;version&gt;&lt;&#x2F;version&gt; in Tiapp.xml? And then making sure that version number in ITC?</p>
<p>Many, many thanks for all of your help…</p>

										<p><p>Yes, that&#39;s it. But be sure the new version is higher than the old one and that you can only use one &quot;dot&quot; in your version number. 1.2 is correct, but 1.0.2 is not. </p>
<p>At least when I&#39;ve tried to update an app with more than one dot, upload to ITC fails saying the new version must be higher than the old one. Solution, increment always in one (1.0, 1.1, 1.2 …)</p>

										<p><p>Yes true, don&#39;t use 1.2.x, ITC will fail, so versioning should be<br><strong>one_digit_major_version[dot]one_digit_minor_version</strong></p>

							<p>Hi Javier and Dan - having a few problems, and hope you might be able to help.</p>
<p>I changed the &lt;version&gt; to 1.2 in Tiapp.xml, but got the following error when trying to validate in ITC:</p>
<p>This bundle is invalid. The key CFBundleShortVersionString in the info.plist file must contain a higher version than that of the previously uploaded version.</p>
<p>Checked the info.plist in the build directory and it&#39;s labelled correctly as 1.2. My previous version of the app is 1.0?!?</p>
<p>Little stuck and would really appreciate your help…</p>
