			<h1>ti.android.useLegacyWindow not working after receiving titanium update</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,<br>I am facing a very strange issue. Till today morning I was able to run mobile application for android and iphone using titanium classic framework 3.2.3GA properly, but after receiving notification that new update 3.3 is available. I just check for updates to see new additions under 3.3 and saw support for lightweight winsdow is removed so didnt update. But since then when I am running the application it is creating heavyweight window even though ti.android.useLegacyWindow is set to true. Any idea what is the issue? Is it a Titanium Studio bug?</p>

							<p>As you can read in the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;release-notes&#x2F;?version=3.3.0.GA#lightweight_windows">Release Notes</a> lightweight windows were dropped in 3.3.0:</p>
<p><em>&quot;As of this Release, support for lightweight windows (windows without an Android Activity) is removed and using the ti.android.useLegacyWindow property in the tiapp.xml file has no effect.&quot;</em></p>

										<p><p>Actually there should not be a problem when compiling with different SDKs. Sometimes cleaning the project helps when you&#39;ve changed the SDK.</p>

										<p><p>You want to update to Studio 3.3.0. Just compile with 3.2.3 of the SDK until you are able to remove them. But, correct, lightweight windows are removed in 3.3.0 of the SDK.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks @manuel and @Ingo for your inputs. I finally removed light weight windows in order to solve this issue. Still don&#39;t know why it happened in the first place. Will update it to 3.3</p>
