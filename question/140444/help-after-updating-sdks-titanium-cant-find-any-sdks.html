			<h1>HELP! After updating SDKs Titanium can&#39;t find *any* SDKs!</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>When I started Titanium today I got a notice that new SDK updates were available along with an application update to Titanium. After downloading these I&#39;m unable to run my app. When I open tiapp.xml there is no SDK selected and when I click the SDK dropdown I get nothing.</p>
<p>I made sure the preferences were pointing to where my SDK files are located. Still nothing.</p>
<p>I&#39;m in the middle of a large project with some serious deadlines and need to get this resolved ASAP.</p>

							<p>The desktop SDK is no longer supported by Appcelerator.</p>
<p>It has been spun off to an open source project <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tidesdk.org&#x2F;">TideSDK</a>.</p>
<p>This occurred quite a while ago in the grand scheme of Net time with the last Appcelerator desktop SDK being released over 9 months ago.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you. Somehow I missed the memo on that one. I&#39;d noticed there hadn&#39;t been updates to desktop sdk in a while and I was curious about it but not curious enough to dig into it until it quit working altogether.</p>
<p>Now this problem is a minor inconvenience not a major issue. Thanks again.</p>

										<p><p>Good to hear. I&#39;m looking at it now and it looks like a relatively simple conversion. Thanks for the info &amp; I&#39;ll definitely start getting comfortable with the tSDK community.</p>

										<p><p>If that&#39;s an answer, I need more explanation.</p>
<p>I have no such directory on my machine. My SDKs are installed at ~&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium</p>
<p>Further, since my app is a desktop app it would have nothing to do with the &quot;mobilesdk.&quot;</p>
<p>Are you saying that&#39;s where my SDKs <em>should</em> be located? If so then why am I given the option in TItanium preferences to point to where my SDKs are?</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s where your SDK&#39;s are stored, not where they should be. The folder is hidden, you have to go online and find a tutorial on how to show hidden folders. A dot before a folder name indicates the folder is hidden. Inside of this file path, you should see SDK&#39;s. If you see none, you need to download them. Otherwise, point your SDK to that path</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m well versed in finding hidden folders. That folder doesn&#39;t exist on my system. However, the answer by Stephen Feather answered my question. Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>It also doesn&#39;t help that with the change from Snow Leopard to Lion, the default location changed from &#x2F;Library to ~&#x2F;Library</p>
