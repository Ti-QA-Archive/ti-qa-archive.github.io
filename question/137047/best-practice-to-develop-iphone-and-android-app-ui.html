			<h1>Best Practice to Develop IPhone and Android App UI</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>We are starting the development of an Android and IPhone app and wanted to know if the best practice on developing the UI for both environments.</p>
<p>We have developed the core (functionality) for both the environments as common classes. The core does not have dependency on the UI at all.</p>
<p>Is the best practice to have separate UI code for IPhone and Android or should they be combined together and where required conditionally written?</p>
<p>I would like to understand this as you may have come across situations like this.</p>
<p>Thanks and Regards<br>Abishek R Srikaanth</p>

							<p>If you use commonJS modules for you GUI you can easily substitute components that do not work in Android.<br>In a Folder structure like: </p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">/Resources</span>
-<span class="ruby">- app.js
</span>-<span class="ruby">- <span class="hljs-constant">MainView</span>.js
</span>-<span class="ruby">- <span class="hljs-constant">SettingsView</span>.js
</span>-<span class="ruby">- <span class="hljs-regexp">/iphone
</span></span>-<span class="ruby"><span class="hljs-regexp">-----/ui</span>
</span>-<span class="ruby">-------<span class="hljs-constant">GuestView</span>.js
</span>-<span class="ruby">-------<span class="hljs-constant">FriendView</span>.js
</span>-<span class="ruby">-------<span class="hljs-regexp">/compontents
</span></span>-<span class="ruby"><span class="hljs-regexp">------------FriendSelector.js
</span></span>-<span class="ruby"><span class="hljs-regexp">- /android</span>
</span>-<span class="ruby">-----<span class="hljs-regexp">/ui
</span></span>-<span class="ruby"><span class="hljs-regexp">-------GuestView.js
</span></span>-<span class="ruby"><span class="hljs-regexp">-------FriendVeiw.js
</span></span>-<span class="ruby"><span class="hljs-regexp">--------/components</span>
</span>-<span class="ruby">------------<span class="hljs-constant">FriendSelector</span>.js</span>
</code></pre><p>I w MainView, and SettingView.js are used both in android and iPhone but GuestView.js, FriendView.js and the FriendSelector.js component use platform specific interfaces. </p>
<p>This also helps when an iOS updated is underway, you just go to the files for the specific platform and make any adjustments.</p>
<p>In General, I start with the Iphone version of everything, then step on modules that need to be replaced for android. </p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

										<p><p>This is a nice approach.</p>
<p>Do you find that you have to use a different require path? Or does it automatically do that for you, based on the platform (as with images)?</p>

										<p><p>You set the path as if it was in the root (Resources).  The files should act as if they were the files outside of the platform specific folder (stepping on or taking precedence). </p>
<p>I keep using<br><code>ui = require(&amp;#39;&amp;#x2F;ui&amp;#x2F;components&amp;#39;),</code><br>Even when calling from a platform specific directory.  (supposing components was a folder in Resources&#x2F;ui&#x2F;components.  </p>

							<p>I think it depends on the complexity of your user interface.  In our app, we&#39;ve been able to use a single codebase for the UI with a few conditional blocks here and there.  If I found that more than 10% of the code in a particular class was platform-dependent then I might consider breaking things out more.</p>
<p>On approach we&#39;ve taken is to build components that isolate the main program code from any of the platform-specific stuff.  For example, we have an image gallery view that&#39;s defined in a separate class.  That class does have quite a bit of platform-dependent code.  But the main UI just instantiates a GalleryView and uses a single set of functions to interact with it.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of our application&#39;s complexity, it&#39;s about 23 class files with about 4000 lines of javascript.</p>

							<p>While it&#39;s naturally possible to do both builds in the same project Resources with platform-conditional blocks etc., I have found that due to the various differences in UI and functionality for both platforms, that I find it easier to have two separate projects for each.</p>

							<p>One other thing:  make sure that each time you add new UI components and&#x2F;or application logic, you do some basic testing on both platforms.  Don&#39;t let yourself go too far down a particular path without ensuring that you can make it work on android and iphone.</p>
<p>It seems like a lot of the people who say that Titanium isn&#39;t good for cross-platform development seem to build the entire app for iOS and then start thinking about how to make it work on android.  That would not be fun.  Titanium is very cool, but it&#39;s got a lot of hidden gotchas.  It&#39;s easier to work through them one at a time rather than an entire app&#39;s worth of issues.</p>
<p>I do most of my debugging in the iphone simulator for speed, but I make sure to run the android emulator at least once a day to minimize the nasty surprises.</p>

										<p><p>For Android testing I find it a LOT faster to test&#x2F;deploy to the device each time.</p>
<p>I find the emulator is painfully slow. Also, real-world testing is much safer. ;)</p>

										<p><p>Some great suggestions in this thread,  Abishek. </p>
<p>If you are going to use TiShadow, you will HAVE to use commonJS to load your files. Juans advice for using the platform specific folders is great.  </p>
<p>Ivan&#39;s recommendation to use TiShadow is spot on.  We use TiShadow to load our tests onto hardware, both locally and over the net.  It will require some work, including building a custom SDK build, but its worth the time.</p>

							<p>I depends from budget ;-)<br>If you avoid device related GUI elements you can use one ui and switch in parts.</p>
