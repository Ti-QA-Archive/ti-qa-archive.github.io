			<h1>Feature Request: Add &#34;current titanium version&#34; in forum posts</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Here is a feature request that some of us have been wanting for a while. Please vote this UP if it makes sense so we can get some visibility to the Powers That Be. </p>
<p>These Q&amp;A Community Forums are so well laced with great answers and bits of knowledge often critical to success, that they are the primary documentation in some ways for people. When searching for answers, we get some 2+ year old questions and responses in here, which is generally great once you know to look at the &quot;posted 2 years ago&quot;, before you jump back and start changing your code. ;)</p>
<p><strong>So The Feature:</strong><br>What would a GREAT HELP would be to have the webserver here dynamically add a &quot;<em>Posted when current Titanium release was 1.2</em>&quot; to that date when displaying the articles. </p>
<p>This would help you determine at a glance how relevant a certain bug or behavior is, to give some context for the answers. Seems like a simple lookup thing to add on server side to the date formatter code.</p>

							<p>You make a good point when it comes to finding relevant issues to the version of Titanium your using. For this we do provide, and encourage the use of tags.</p>
<p>Im not sure how good a system that used dates to determine Titanium version would be, as not everyone is using the latest released version… as an example, the current version is 1.7.2, we are about to release 1.8 (that some users are using) and yet some people are still posting about 1.6 (that we still support).</p>
<p>But you do make a good point that tags (or some slightly altered system) is needed to help users find the content they need.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Matt, you&#39;re right of course about the inexactness of the suggestion. </p>
<p>But I&#39;d still lobby for doing it automagically at point of display, and maybe revising the text to say <strong>&quot;<em>Posted around when Titanium 1.7.2 was current</em>&quot;</strong> or something. </p>
<p>I believe even though not everyone is <em>coding</em> at the same version, most people are <em>aware of</em> the then-current release, and would at least be able to judge their own relative time-frame better like this. </p>
<p>Tags would be putting the burden back on the posters, and also most importantly wouldn&#39;t help for all the existing posts. The point is to be more of an &quot;area code&quot; rather than the exact version that we are working&#x2F;fighting with. </p>
<p>Of course, this request is only if it doesn&#39;t slow down anybody&#39;s &quot;day job&quot; on the core platform we love and are thankful for! ;)</p>
