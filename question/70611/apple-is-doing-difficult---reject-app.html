		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>This morning I got a mail :<br>2.12   Apps that are not very useful or do not provide any lasting entertainment value may be rejected</p>
<p>They are really holding down new apps that they think that are not usefull. With their new rules they can crack down any program, although you did a fine job.</p>
<p>Johan</p>

							<div><p>Sorry to hear that, short of some offensive I&#39;m not sure how they can fairly apply such a subjective rule. If you are comfortable doing so can you share what your app did?</p>

							<div><p>My app is playing a soundfile to help people with hypnosis to get rid of smoking in 14 days. I have made a website for this : http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quitsmokingnow.tk&#x2F;   and I also participate in a contest with this design and program.</p>
<p>They also hammer a lot on HTML5.</p>
<p>Extra Reply from Apple:<br>Thank you for your reply. It would be appropriate to incorporate additional features within your application to enhance the user experience. </p>
<p>Alternatively, you may wish to consider building a web app using HTML5.<br>HTML5 is the major new version of HTML and enables audio and video to play<br>natively in the browser without requiring proprietary plug-ins. Using HTML5,<br>a web app looks and behaves like native iPhone and iPad applications, and<br>using HTML5&#39;s Offline Application Cache, your web applications work even<br>when the device is offline. With web apps, you have flexibility to deliver<br>as much or as little functionality as you desire.</p>

							<p>If all your app does is play a file, then no, its not going to get approved.  It has to have actual functionality.  They&#39;re not allowing anymore apps like that, along with fart apps, or things that are just plain dumb.</p>
<p>Spice yours up a little, have it read some RSS feeds, a contact page, SOMETHING besides just playing a file.</p>
