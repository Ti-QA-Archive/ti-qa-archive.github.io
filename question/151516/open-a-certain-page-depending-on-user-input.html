			<p>Hi!<br>I&#39;m working on Ti SDK 3.1.0.GA, trying to code a app for iOS. Using a iOS sim on OSX 10.8.3.  </p>
<p>Problem: I have a textfield, and it has a type of num pad (so only numbers are allowed) and I want to open a window based on user input. As in if I input &#39;1&#39; –&gt; go to win1. &#39;2&#39; –&gt; win2</p>
<p>I have created the var txtfield = Ti.UI.createTextField and then I have a button created and an eventlistener.<br>I have also created a test window, var win1.</p>
<p>In the eventlistener I have: navGroup.open(win+txtfield.value);   but it&#39;s not working, I get an error saying missing variable win. What do I have to put inside the () to get it to work? </p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>You should put your windows into a dict, and use that:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">myWindows = {
  <span class="hljs-string">'win1'</span><span class="hljs-symbol">:win1</span>,
  <span class="hljs-string">'win2'</span><span class="hljs-symbol">:win2</span>,
}

...

navGroup.open(myWindows[<span class="hljs-string">'win'</span>+txtfield.value]);

										<p><p>When responding to an answer, don&#39;t do it by creating an answer. You will have to share more of your code to help us out. The basic answer is, you have a scope issue.</p>

										<p><p>Now that was awkward, I was trying to be extra careful! Thanks a lot for helping me out! I have a small follow up question, when I press back in the new window, the value is still in the textfield. How do I reset it? And also, lets say I have a large amount of these windows (at least a hundred).  Is there any smarter way to create new windows than to copy and paste 100x?</p>

										<p><p>In your event listener, after you open the window, set <code>txtfield.value=&amp;#39;&amp;#39;</code></p>
<p>If you want to have at least 100 windows, then you need to re-think how you are going to do this. You don&#39;t want to create 100 windows that you aren&#39;t using, as you&#39;ll probably run out of memory. You should create the window you need depending on the input in your event listener.</p>

										<p><p>I was thinking about that but: I want to have a small image and some text in each (different img and dif text each) Is it possible in this type of scenario? Or would it be wiser to make the 100 pages as html pages and make a webview type page in the app? I would have one &quot;holder&quot; window and it would pull the wanted data from the web? Would this be the wisest choice?</p>

										<p><p>You are better off putting the image file name and text into a dict (similar to the example I gave you), and create your window in the click handler. Better yet, you would create a window commonjs module that accepts image and text as init parameters.</p>

										<p><p>Allright, I will fiddle with that… Hmm I tried adding another window per your instruction (in the dict piece) but I get error: invalid type passed to function and in console expected TiWindowProxy, was NSNull. And it pointed that the error is in the navGroup.open line. Then I deleted the second window and just tried with one (which worked last time) but now even that gives me an error? Even though I&#39;m quite sure I didn&#39;t change anything. Well I guess I have a typo somewhere again… Better check everything.</p>
