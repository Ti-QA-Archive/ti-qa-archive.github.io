							<p>The problem is that you can&#39;t compile and package for iOS on a non-Mac.  Titanium still uses Xcode to compile under the hood and requires the iOS SDK – both of which are Mac-only.</p>

										<p><p>And even that isn&#39;t compiled under Windows.  You send your source off to them, they compile it (under OSX), and return it to you.    It also suggests you may need to send them your distribution profiles too, unless you have to repackage locally.  That may not matter to you, but I don&#39;t think my clients would be comfortable with sending either the source or their Enterprise Distribution License to an outside party.</p>
<p>Dragonfile is certainly aimed at a different market – namely, the Windows C++ game developer using Visual Studio.  Who isn&#39;t looking for cross-platform either.</p>
<p>Interesting approach to just use a remote OSX box to do the compile.  But one I&#39;m not personally willing to do.</p>

										<p><p>Don&#39;t underestimate the amount of device-specific testing – meaning testing, debugging, fixing, recompiling, and re-testing, over and over again – you&#39;re going to need to do for any new platform.  It doesn&#39;t matter if the toolkit says you can &quot;compile&quot; for a particular platform.  Hey, that&#39;s great, but just because you can &quot;compile&quot; doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;ll &quot;work&quot;.</p>

							<p>Yes I see your point.<br>Maybe someone can offer a cloud service that can remotely do the compile and send it back to the developer?</p>

							<p>We develop on a number of PCs, I don&#39;t think we ever written a single line of code on a Mac. Still, you will need a Mac to test and compile, but that&#39;s because the iPhone SDK is only available for Mac. Besides, a Mac mini nowadays doesn&#39;t cost much.</p>

							<p>I would disagree, there seem to be other alternatives that can do it:<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;maniacdev.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;01&#x2F;iphone-development-windows-options-available&#x2F;</p>

										<p><p>Hogwash.  Note that those are alternatives to compiling natively for iOS, not ways to allow an xcode project (which titanium creates for you) to compile under Windows.</p>
<p>The second paragraph even begins:</p>
<p>  &quot;At this point you will need to compile your app on the official iPhone SDK running on Mac OS X if your goal is to get your app in to Apple’s iPhone app store…&quot;</p>
