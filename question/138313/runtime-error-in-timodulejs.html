			<p>I&#39;m working thru the TiBountyHunter lab running SDK 2.0.2 and everything is working fine up to Lab 250, Local Data.  I made the changes required for the local data exercise and now receiving the above error.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[86,19] ti:/module.js
Uncaught Error: Failed to <span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">load</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">resource</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">java</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">exception</span> was thrown.

<span class="hljs-keyword">Source</span>: <span class="hljs-keyword">source</span> = assets. readAsset(filename);</span>
</code></pre><p>I&#39;ve compared my code with solution and it all seems to match.  I was able to add information to my database, but when I click on a table row entry I get the error.  I also do not have a module.js file in my directory.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help</p>

										<p><p>Dan,</p>
<p>I took the same code and installed to my android phone and it works fine.  I did check my paths thinking that I had misspelled or misnamed but everything seemed correct.  I took a chance to check on my phone and it worked.</p>

										<p><p>If you&#39;re doing cross platform development and are making calls using CommonJS module, then it&#39;s a good idea to have the full path for files. On Android doing &#39;ui&#x2F;common&#x2F;your_file.js&#39; can lead to issues if you are calling from another place. so use &#39;&#x2F;ui&#x2F;common&#x2F;your_file.js&#39; to be on the safe side</p>
