			<h1>Appcelerator Cross Platform Development</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am an Android Programmer looking for an appropriate transition to create cross platform mobile applications. So far, I have done some extensive research on the internet and found that PhoneGap and Appcelerator are top 2 cross platform mobile development solutions. </p>
<p>I am also very much concerned about the performance of my apps and since PhoneGap apps are hybrid and apparently their performance is slower than Appcelerator, I am more inclined to work in latter technology. However, I am also little concerned about the code reusability and ease of cross platform developement while creating mobile apps.</p>
<p>In my research I found that PhoneGap is the choice of the developers who create cross platoform apps and Appcelerator for native apps. But on the Appcelerator homepage, it is mentioned that one can reuse upto 90% of the code and create cross platform apps quite well too.</p>
<p>Finally, now I am looking for the guidance from the community members who have created cross platform apps with Appcelerator. I want to know which platform is best suitable to create cross platform apps - PhoneGap or Appcelerator.</p>
<p>I know Appcelerator has higher performance as compared to PhoneGap but is it really as effective in creating cross platform apps as PhoneGap?</p>
<p>Thanks in Advance for your kind replies and suggestions.</p>

							<p>Phone Gap and Titanium are very different technologies.</p>
<p>Firstly lets cover phone Gap..</p>
<p>It is a wrapper enabling the development of an application using web based technologies. HTML CSS etc.</p>
<p>It is very effective for quick development and easy transition from a web development background. It does have quite a performance hit.</p>
<p>Appcelerator Titanium is very different.</p>
<p>As I am sure you are aware it&#39;s base coding language is JavaScript, with the Titanium name space providing the API&#39;s into the specific platforms requirements.</p>
<p>It uses the platform (IOS, Android) SDK&#39;s to compile into a near native application. Very brief explanation.</p>
<p>It is best described as a code once adapt everywhere platform, which means that all the business logic, data handling etc is fully usable across platforms, and most of the UI code is compatible. </p>
<p>But different platforms have different requirements, so it enables within the single code base the ability to code specifically for the platform and device form factor, normally with a 80 - 90% single code and 10 - 20% being platform or form factor specific. It is however as mentioned a single code base.</p>
<p>Having been developing  Titanium applications for nearly 4 years, I have seen the good and the bad. It is now a very stable platform, ideal for Enterprise applications.</p>
<p>So which is best…</p>
<p>I can&#39;t actually answer that, it depends on your requirements. If you after a quick small cross platform application maybe Phone Gap, but if you&#39;re into full enterprise applications then it&#39;s Native or Appcelerator.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>T.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Trevor Ward for such a detailed answer. As per your answer I understand that for a seasoned Titanium developer, it would be possible to create an application where 80-90% code can be reused as a single code for multiple platforms and rest 10-20% can be platform specific effort which one needs to rework for every platform the app is deployed. </p>
<p>Now, considering that I am planning to create one High End application involving regular data base calls and sometimes bulk local DB updates. I also tend to keep my application secure involving sufficient security features for unauthorized access or hacking. </p>
<p>Which platform would be your choice - PhoneGap or Appcelerator?</p>

										<p><p>appcelerator.</p>
<p>All the data handling is a single code base and totally cross platform.</p>
<p>thats exactly what we do with the platform.</p>
