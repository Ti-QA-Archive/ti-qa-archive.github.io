		<section>
			<p>Hello, I&#39;ve been away from the titanium web site for a while. Could someone give me an update as to how reliable the titanium development as far as apple&#39;s  app store rules are concerned? </p>
<p>I remember there was a concern that apple could reject certain apps due to the way they were developed. does that concern still have some weight? is that completely over? for those who are considering developing apps using a method other than xCode, I think this is a real concern. </p>
<p>I always wondered then and now, if titanium apps eventually compile to xcode at the end of the day, what&#39;s the concern anyway?  where is the issue coming from? </p>

							<p>I think you just answered your question :)</p>
<p>There is no issue with Titanium. No app was rejected( as far as I know)  until now because of being made with Titanium.</p>
<p>Adobe was rejected not with flash, but with their &#39;compile to iphone&#39; CS5 feature.</p>
<p>Everything is a lottery( and the luck is dictated by Apple). Wanna be 100% sure, start using objC and that&#39;s it.<br>Want to take a risk - play with Titanium. If you have some big ideas maybe you can build some &quot;hits&quot; with Titanium that will generate enough revenue to allow you to &quot;loose&quot; several month to learn objC( if this is the issue ).</p>

							<p>There are no issues at the moment. Titanium compiles down to Objective C and even generated an XCode project, so nothing to worry about.</p>

							<p>You will never have an official response or be 100%  assured that an external framework will be fully accepted by Apple( or you can write them :) ). They play the way they want to. Titanium tries to do it the way they ask, but with Apple you&#39;ll never know.</p>
<p>After they removed Adobe form their platform, nothing seemed to be allowed anymore, but after a while LUA was back.</p>

										<p><p>If the whole thing compiles down to objective C, where is the issue coming from? I can see the problem with Flash being not allowed because you can totally by pass what apple has in mind and run the whole app right from within flash.. but with titanium apps? there is no flash and there is no flash like third party environment running within iphone… why is it that this was an issue since day one and it seems like it still is.</p>

							<p>Thank you for your reply. But that&#39;s a weak reply. Titanium always compiled to objective C - since day one. But everybody knows there were issues in regards to this matter. </p>
<p>&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it&quot; type answer is unfortunately does not help. </p>
