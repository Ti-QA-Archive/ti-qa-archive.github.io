			<h1>Unlicensed module(s) detected. On Plus modules</h1>

		<section>
			<p>I am an Indie, trying to add the ti.storekit which I downloaded from the HelpDesk. I added it to my project (same as other modules I use) and when I run I get the following message: &quot;Unlicensed module(s) detected.  You must be a subscriber…&quot;.<br>I have seen that others got the same problem but didn&#39;t understand how to solve this !!!</p>
<p>Please note that I tried to restart the Studio, clean the project - nothing helped.</p>
<p>Please Advise !!!</p>

							<div><p>You need to follow steps as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Terminal and run “uuidgen”</li>
<li>Copy the code you see on the terminal</li>
<li>Open tiapp.xml, replace what’s in the “guid” tag with the the code you copied.</li>
<li>In Titanium Studio, do Project –&gt; Clean</li>
<li>Run</li>
</ol>
<p>Concept is to change GUID of module which is mentioned in manifest.</p>

							<p>I had the same problem on a project I was working on!<br>I followed the suggestion posted here and created a new project as a test and actually the module was working there…<br>So I made a diff between the folders of the test project and my project… and I found that the problem was in the tiapp.xml file… the project was created by one of my colleagues, so in the tiapp.xml file was set my colleague&#39;s guid instead of mine.<br>So when I was trying to build it I was unable to use the module, because my colleague didn&#39;t purchase it on the marketplace.<br>When I changed the guid it worked perfectly!!<br>That could happen if many people are working on the same project!!</p>

										<p><p>Same here. Make sure the GUID in your tiapp.xml file matches what you see when you check out your app by logging into appcelerator.com. Otherwise, even free modules will throw an error as having invalid licenses.</p>

							<p>Resolved. Just to let you know, anyone who encountered the same problem (with other modules as well) -<br>If the Titanium Studio project was created before you signed into the Indie program you would get the &quot;Unlicensed..&quot; msg for every Plus+ modules. You should create a new project (after signing as Indie) and then add your modules to the project.<br>Took me a while to figure this out. Would have been nice to find it on TroubleShooting or Q&amp;A.<br>Anyway, hope that helps.</p>

							<p>The fix for me was to run uuidgen from the terminal to get a new guid and slap that in the module&#39;s manifest file instead of the old guid.</p>
<p>Presumably there&#39;s only so many seats per guid allowed, but I suppose there could be other causes of this error.</p>
