			<h1>Videos Not Showing in PhotoGallery on Device &#34;Works in Simulator&#34;</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Dear Community,</p>
<p>I am trying to open a photo gallery that contains photos and videos that can be picked to be uploaded to a server. Everything works fine when I find a picture and then proceed to &quot;choose&quot; it in the simulator. However upon opening a video &quot;also in the simulator&quot; it gets stuck at compressing video. I have heard this is a problem with apples simulator and that I should test it on a device. </p>
<p>So upon testing my app on an iTouch I find that the photogallery does not populate with videos like it had in the simulator. The photogallery is populated with pictures and they work when being &quot;chosen&quot;. However there are no videos to be seen or chosen. </p>
<p>I know for a fact there are videos on the device, not only in the iOS videos app but also in the iOS photos app. For when I open the iOS photo app I can see the videos along side the pictures. But upon opening the photogallery in my app they are not there with the rest of the pictures.</p>
<p>I would love it if anyone could chime in and send me in the right direction. Let me know if I could provide any code or knowledge that would help you solve my problem.</p>
<p>Thanks, Retrieve Tech</p>

							<p>OK. This is why it&#39;s not working. The device does not support videos in the Album&#x2F;Gallery due to it not having a camera. </p>
<p>Getting video even in to the simulator is possible via a bit of a hack, but it never ever works after selecting them (in my experience).</p>
<p>One thing I would suggest, is not calling a video file &quot;gallery.PNG&quot;. Use .MOV  :) </p>
<p>Another thing which might be worth adding, if you are going to reuse the same filename each time is : </p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// before the f.write(image);</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span><span class="hljs-comment">(f.exists()</span>){
    f.deleteFile<span class="hljs-comment">()</span>;
}
<span class="hljs-comment">// this will remove the previous one to avoid possible file overwrite issues.</span>
</code></pre><p>Also, why are you using popoverView and arrowDirection?  That code is for an iPad popover.</p>

										<p><p>Kosso,</p>
<p>That is good to know that the device does not support video, thus it should work on a capable device. I will find one and test on that.</p>
<p>I agree that the file should be called with a .mov ext. I will change that.</p>
<p>Furthermore the idea for removing an existing image if it exists is a good idea, more so it is proper.</p>
<p>Thank You So much for taking time to identify that problem for me. &quot;Life Saver - Karma will come your way&quot;</p>
<p>Thanks, Retrieve</p>

							<p>Firstly, you&#39;ll always have issues with Album videos in the simulator. I wish they&#39;d fix that. Also I wish Apple implemented some kind of Camera in to the simulator. Most of their machines have a built in camera anyway..   but I digress..</p>
<p>Possibly a silly question, but is the iPod Touch one which has a camera? </p>
<p>I&#39;ve done a few media create&#x2F;select&#x2F;upload apps.</p>

										<p><p>Kosso,</p>
<p>The iPod Touch does not have a camera. I might be able to find an iPhone 4 to test it on but that could prove to be a task. Because you have done a few media create&#x2F;upload apps, do you see anything blatantly wrong that would be wrong with the photo gallery code above.</p>
<p>I can provide any info that would help you help me. ;D<br>Thanks, Retrieve</p>
