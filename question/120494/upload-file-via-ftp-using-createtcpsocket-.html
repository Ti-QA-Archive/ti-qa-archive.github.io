		<section>
			<p>I have used the great example for establishing an FTP connection shown here http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;48441&#x2F;tcpip-sockets-to-do-ftp . The connection to my FTP server is working and can use commands like CWD. </p>
<p>I am looking to upload a file that is located within the local filesystem in the app at images&#x2F;aroundme.png</p>
<p>If I do something like:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">controlSocket.<span class="hljs-keyword">write</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'STOR images/aroundme.png\r\n'</span>);
</code></pre><p>I get a response of 550 No such file or directory.</p>
<p>When I do something like:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> f = Titanium.Filesystem.getFile(<span class="hljs-string">'images/aroundme.png'</span>);
controlSocket.<span class="hljs-keyword">write</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'STOR '</span>+f+<span class="hljs-string">'\r\n'</span>);
</code></pre><p>I then get a file named &#39;[object TiFilesystemFile]&#39; that is of length 0.</p>
<p>Is this possible?</p>
<p>Basically I am trying to get around the unreliability of xhr files for uploads to a server.</p>

							<p>I suspect the path to your file is wrong, leading to the 550 response.  The getFile() will always return an object, even if the file does not yet exist.  It does that so you can use the write() method for example.  A length of zero would be consistent with creating a file reference to a file that does not exist (or does but has a zero length).</p>
<p>Is the images folder a child of the folder containing the currently running *.js file?  Relative paths (i.e. no leading &#x2F; character) are always relative to the current js file.  If that file is in the root of your resources folder then it should be looking here:</p>
<p> (project)&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;images&#x2F;aroundme.png</p>
<p>Is that where the file is located?  If the current *.js file is itself in a subfolder and images is NOT a child of that folder, you may need to alter the path.  For example, if your paths were:</p>
<p>  &#x2F;Resources&#x2F;scripts&#x2F;myWindow.js<br>  &#x2F;Resources&#x2F;images&#x2F;aroundme.png</p>
<p>Then you would need to use ..&#x2F;images&#x2F;aroundme.png</p>

							<p>You may be getting a 0 byte file because the server doesn&#39;t know where to read the data from. When using raw ftp commands, the STOR command must be preceeded by either the PORT or PASV command to let the server know where to read the incoming data from.</p>
<p>&#39;Passive Mode&#39; should work in most cases as it waits for the client to make the connection for the data transfer rather than vice-versa. Of course, your ftp server must support this to work properly. Otherwise you will have to specify the address and port for the data transfer to occur on using the PORT command.</p>

										<p><p>Ok, you&#39;re getting the 550 error because obviously there is no file with the name &#39;[object TiFilesystemFile]&#39; in the local filesystem. When you do a Ti.Filesystem.getFile an object is returned, not the actual file itself. In order to properly run the STOR command, you need to send the path to the local file, but you are currently printing the object to the STOR command. In order to run the command correctly, you&#39;ll need to access the name property of the filesystem object returned from getFile.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">fx = Ti.Filesystem.getFile(Ti.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory,<span class="hljs-string">'fwb.txt'</span>);
fx.<span class="hljs-keyword">write</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'something ddd ddddddd'</span>);

controlSocket.<span class="hljs-keyword">write</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'STOR '</span>+fx.name+<span class="hljs-string">'\r\n'</span>);
</code></pre><p>Depending on how the command interprets the name and location of the file, you may need to try something that includes the path as well. ie:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">controlSocket.<span class="hljs-keyword">write</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'STOR '</span>+fx.nativePath+<span class="hljs-string">'/'</span>+fx.name+<span class="hljs-string">'\r\n'</span>);
</code></pre><p>That may eliminate the path problems you are having, as you will be using a path local to your application and not absolute to the entire filesystem.</p>

										<p><p>The value after the STOR command is what the REMOTE side should use as the filename.  It does not necessarily need to have anything to do with the filename or path in your application.</p>
<p>Typically you would send just a filename (without a path) to have the server store it in its current working directory.  FTP servers will have a default directory (which often varies by login username).  If you include a path in the filename after STOR it is for a folder structure on the SERVER and not your device.  You may also use the CWD command to change the current working directory on the server, if the server does not have that disabled for your login name.</p>
<p>If you are passing a path on the STOR, that is the most likely reason you are getting the 553 error.  The server can&#39;t create the file because you are requesting to put it in a folder which does not exist on the server (or to which you do not have write access).</p>
<p>So pass just the filename without a path, and the server should create the file in its default directory for your login.</p>
<p>I hope you realize the STOR command does NOT transfer the file.  Prior to the STOR you should have issued a PASV command.  You must parse the server response of the PASV command to obtain the IP and port to use for the data socket.  Then you must open a second TCP socket connection to the server on the port it assigned.</p>
<p>Then you send the STOR on the control socket and it will typically send back a response which starts with 150 (instead of 553).  Once you have that, you can start sending the file contents on the SECOND tcp socket you opened.  When you have finished sending the file close the SECOND (data) socket, and you should receive a 226 response code on the FIRST (control) socket.</p>
<p>FTP is not rocket science, but a proper implementation is not trivial either.  When all you want to do is upload a file you can get by with handling only a small subset of the FTP protocol.  But you still have to play by its rules for the commands you intend to use.</p>

										<p><p>The reason the server had a zero byte file was because it was expecting a file to be sent after it received the STOR command, but it never got any data.  It never got any data because you never opened the second socket on the IP and port it gave you in the PASV response.</p>
<p>The PASV response does not have a strict layout but should end with 6 numbers inside parentheses similar to (1,2,3,4,5,6).  You need to extract those 6 numbers out of the PASV response.  The first 4 will be the IP address where it expects you to send the file (1.2.3.4 in the above example) and the last 2 will be the port where the two numbers make up a 16-bit port number.  Thus in the above example the port would be 5*256 + 6 or port 1286.</p>
<p>So you would open a new TCP socket to IP 1.2.3.4 on port 1286, then once the connection is established send the data to THAT socket instead of the original socket connection.  The IP it sends back may or may not match the IP of the FTP server where you made the original control connection.</p>
<p>When it does not, there are two potential reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The FTP server is load balancing across multiple IPs and intentionally wants you to send the data to another IP.  In this case you must send it where it requests or the file won&#39;t get received.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The FTP server is behind a NAT firewall and is sending you its private IP (such as 192.168.x.x).  In this case you CAN&#39;T send to that IP or it will never reach the server.  You must send to the IP of the original socket connection.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>More often than not, the IP received in the PASV command will either match the IP of the control connection, or be a private IP.  So as a general rule, I find that I prefer first ignoring the IP received and just parsing the port and attempting a socket connection to the original server but on the port requested.  When that fails, I will retry with the IP given in the PASV command.</p>
<p>A fully compliant FTP client is much more involved than this â as I said all along, a proper FTP client is not trivial.  And I don&#39;t have an example in Titanium (or any javascript) because I have only done this in other languages.</p>
<p>Are we having fun yet?</p>

										<p><p>First, the file will not write itself.  You must send the contents of the file on the second port after you have received the 150 response on the first port.  That is, at the end of your sample code where you ask what you do after this, is where you send the contents of the file.</p>
<p>Second, paths come into play in two places:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>On local side, where you need to get the file you are sending.  In your example code this is in the <code>fx = ...</code> source line.  The server does not care about the path (or even the filename) of the file being sent.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On STOR command, where you give the (optional) path and filename where it should be stored on the server.  This name does not necessarily need to have anything to do with the local filename.  The server does not care what it was called locally; it only cares what name it should store it with.  Most FTP servers will put you in a default directory based on the login name, so sending just a filename on the STOR command is generally sufficient.  If you want it in a subfolder of the FTP default directory, then you can name that on the STOR command but it has to be an existing subfolder on the SERVER, not the local filesystem.  Typically you would pass the filename used on the local machine (e.g. ss.png in this case) but the server has no way of knowing the difference.  No does it care.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Third, it isn&#39;t clear where <code>rawDestinationPort</code> came from.  As coded, it looks like you have it as a substring of the PASV response starting at just before the last two values.  In my example, that would be <code>5,6).</code>  If so, then that is probably correct.</p>
<p>Lastly, while at the end of your last example code is where you would send the contents of the file on the data port, you shouldn&#39;t just put that after the write of the STOF command.  You really should wait for the 150 response on the control port.</p>
<p>Then when you do send the file on the data socket, be sure to wait until it is complete before doing the close on the data socket.  These operations are async, so you need callbacks to know when operations are complete.</p>
<p>After you have sent the file on the data port, waited for it to complete, and closed the data socket, you should get a completion response on the control socket.  Then you can send it the QUIT command.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, i really understand about the mechanism now. thanks for the explanation. Still, one big question for me is your first point. how to send data over data socket?? what FTP command &#x2F; titanium command should i use?? STOR, PUT, or what?</p>
<p>btw, what it STOF? do you mean STOR?<br>and actually that example code above is only one part of switch case statement. that statement will be executed while server reply 227 which is entering passive mode. i already prepared for case &#39;150&#39; which is server ready to send data. i just dont want pollute this thread with bunch of code lines</p>

										<p><p>Sorry, STOF was a typo; I meant STOR.</p>
<p>To send the data you won&#39;t use a FTP command.  If Titanium had a FTP class, then when you used STOR or PUT it would take care of the rest, including opening the second port, sending the data, etc.  But since it doesn&#39;t, you have to do all that yourself.</p>
<p>You should look at Appcelerator&#39;s docs and example code for more information on sending data over a socket.  In titanium TCP sockets use the IOStream class and buffers for reading and writing.</p>

							<p>hey guys, i already succeed with uploading and downloading file over ftp protocol. But still i got an issue when downloading the file. when i download small file such txt or image file, everything went smoothly, but when i tried to download video file which its size over 1MB i got difficulty because sometimes the ftp server sent the file completely and sometimes it sent not complete file (under the suppose to be file size). any body have idea about my problem?</p>
<p>i already looked around google and i found no solution yet.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

										<p><p>On your control socket ahead of the PASV command, make sure you are sending a TYPE I command. This puts the transfer in image (i.e. binary) file mode.   The alternative is TYPE A (i.e. ASCII or text file) where line feeds, carriage returns, and end of file characters can corrupt your file.  In the case of x1A being present in the file, it can be treated by the server as the end of the file and it will stop sending.  You MUST sent a video file in image (binary) format and not ascii (text) format.</p>

										<p><p>i already use TYPE I from the beginning and using binary mode. but somehow, i received incomplete packet. i read some article and they said its because server&#39;s checksum processor or something.</p>

							<p>Hey, I am trying to upload files via FTP to a server and I have hit a brick wall. I have gotten most of my information from the posts above. I see Wilson has said he is able to upload now. Can you show what you have done or point me in the right direction?</p>
<p>Currently I am able to connect, add my username and password, change directory and use the STOR command to create a file on the server. What do I do once I get that far? How do I fill that file with content ( it currently sits at 0bytes )?</p>

<p>I call the STOR with the control socket and it creates the file on the server then try the connect on the datasocket ( with the ip address and port from the PASV command ) and I get no response on the read event and the file sits at 0kb</p>

							<p>Anyone have a solution to uploading a file via FTP?  Like the other posters, I can issue the PASV command, get back an IP address and port which I use the p1 * 256 + p2 formula to get the new port on the server then when I create a new connection via Ti.Network.Socket.createTCP and run the .connect() method, nothing happens.  It never runs the callback &quot;connected&quot; like it does when I initially connect to port 21.</p>
<p>If someone has a complete working example of connecting to an FTP server, issuing the PASV command and then the STOR command and finally a working connection to the new port that would be most helpful.</p>
