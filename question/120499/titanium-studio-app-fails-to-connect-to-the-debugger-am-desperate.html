			<h1>Titanium Studio App fails to connect to the debugger... (am desperate)</h1>

		<section>
			<p>This is the error I get when I launch my app in either debug or run mode… from Dev Studio… </p>
<p>[ERROR] Error connecting to debugger: Error Domain=NSPOSIXErrorDomain Code=61 &quot;The operation couldn’t be completed. Connection refused&quot;</p>
<p>Strangely up until tonight I could run (commercial version), but without no breakpoint functionality. Now that I urgently needed it, I upgraded to the &quot;Indie&quot; program and now cannot run my app at all!</p>
<p>Info from Help About: (I need to deliver this saturday… grr)</p>
<p>Any iDeas? Am I missing something silly?</p>
<p>Am running Titanium Studio, build: 1.0.0.201106021621<br>(c) Copyright 2011 by Appcelerator, Inc.  All rights reserved.</p>

<p>Would you mind moving your log output to <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;">pastebin.com</a>, or similar service, so that people can understand your problem more easily.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue, please see <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Fastdev+Reference+for+Android#FastdevReferenceforAndroid-AndroidemulatorrefusestoconnecttoFastdev%2Ceventhoughit%27srunning">Android emulator refuses to connect to Fastdev, even though it&#39;s running</a>, which is the same problem that happens with debugging on Android. It&#39;s worth trying, in case this is the case for the iPhone simulator too.</p>
<p>Let me know how you get on.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>James, sorry that my answer was not clear before. I have updated the post accordingly. What I meant was, have tried restarting the simulator and trying again?</p>
<p>Also, what Update Sites are you using; Stable, Beta and&#x2F;or Nightly?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Apparently there was a problem in the continuous build you are using, described in ticket <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-4297">TIMOB-4297</a>.  To resolve this issue, use the SDK with build date Jun 2 2011 11:39 and hash rc9515533, which has been tested and works for the iOS debugger.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>Hi Paul - Thanks for your update…. I have downloaded the version you suggested, but am a little puzzled as to how to force &quot;Titanium Studio&quot; (TS) to use that specific version (seems as though it currently picks up the latest version in the directory). With &quot;Titanium Developer&quot; it was easy, but with TS a little muddy…</p>
<p>My &#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx directory is as follows: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;screencast.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;eoePRERJ8</p>
<p>Now how do I get Titanium Studio to use version 1.7.0-20110602?</p>
<p>Your help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks… James</p>
