			<h1>App getting slow in ipad</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve recently finished develop an iPad app, but still didn&#39;t submit it to the appstore. The app is working flawlessly on the emulator, but when I run it no the iPad itself, it works fine at the beginning, but the more I use it, the more slow it gets, until it actually hangs.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Anil kumar</p>

							<div><p>you asked again the question omitting a number of important things like: iOS version, TiSDK version, what the heck your app does (tableviews, simple windows).. and a little snippet on your code would be appreciated.<br>My suggestion would be: take it one step at a time. Remove all the windows and try just one. Then start adding back all of the components and see if that makes a difference.</p>

							<div><p>I am not sure why this question was down-voted (-2), this is a common issue that is developers do not spend enough time on and then blame the platform.  The author of this question is being pro-active.</p>
<p>If you down-vote at least point out why, everybody can learn from what you believe was a failure of the author.</p>
<p>So I have +1&#39;ed in order to help get the negative vote back to a logical position.</p>

							<div><p>I should have said &quot;I do not think anyone who answered this down-voted it&quot;.</p>
<p>The answer to this is more conceptual rather than finding a specific thing - at least in my opinion.  Your thoughts are good one though.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>This sounds like a memory leak.  You say the app starts off fine but over time appears to be slower - this often means that you are creating new objects but older ones are not being disposed of correctly.</p>
<p>Watch this video explaining why they happens, how to look for them and what you can do to fix them.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;29804284">Rick Blalock: Your Apps are Leaking - Controlling Memory Leaks</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I strongly recommend reviewing this video. It might be the best 38 minutes you will spend improving the performance of your apps.</p>
