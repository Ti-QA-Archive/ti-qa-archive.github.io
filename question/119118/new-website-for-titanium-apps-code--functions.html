			<h1>New Website for Titanium Apps, Code &amp; Functions</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>In the past weeks a common thread seems to be people looking for inspiration, code snippets and ideas for their Titanium Applications. Whether for Mobile or Desktop, we all at times need to help. While the Forums here are awesome, finding completed apps, working code examples, or a list of all the modules available, its over-whelming at times, especially as a new developer… I speak as I was in those very shoes not so long ago. With the help of many people of these very forums, I have been able to successfully release two apps. </p>
<p>So, Ive been tossing the idea around of putting together a place for others to find some of the topics mentioned above. The site is NOT meant to replace the forums, but merely be an additional RESOURCE for others.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;TiAppCafe.com">TiAppCafe</a> TiAppCafe has opened it&#39;s doors … please don&#39;t mind the mess as we are still adding many features (Code Snippets sections and Module Section mainly). Several apps have been added already from those that I had bookmarked when I was looking for the inspiration and motivation. So if you have an app that is in the store (Apple or Android) please submit it and I will see that it gets added.</p>
<p>I welcome all suggestions and ideas. This is just the start, and I hope to see it grow as a great resource for the Accelerator&#x2F;Titanium Community. </p>
<p>Code Strong!</p>
