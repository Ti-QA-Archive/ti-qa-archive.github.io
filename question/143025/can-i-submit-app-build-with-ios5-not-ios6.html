			<h1>Can i Submit App Build with iOS5 not iOS6?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi</p>
<p>I am ready to submit my app to the apple store.</p>
<p>My only concern is that i am building with the iOS5 Xcode SDK. I have the very latest Titanium Updates installed but have yet to update Xcode. I have heard and read many concerns and crashes with IOS6 so have stayed away from updated so far until it&#39;s been out longer.</p>
<p>I&#39;m now worried that Apple might reject as i&#39;m not using their latest build - is this a problem or will it be fine?</p>

							<p>I&#39;m in the same situation and everything I&#39;ve read indicates that we should wait for Ti 2.1.3, and then test under xcode 4.5, and test with the IOS 6 simulator.  I&#39;ve updated my splash screen size, as recommended, and am just waiting for 2.1.3 to be released.  At this point, I&#39;m resisting the temptation to install the RC, and spending my time doing final testing and preparation with the current production build of TI.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Josh, thanks. Does that mean that anyone who has ios6 installed on their iPhone won&#39;t be able to run the app (so the app will not work for anyone using ios6)??</p>

										<p><p>No, just set the minimum build to say 4.3, and then devices from 6 down to 4.3 will be able to run it.</p>

							<p>Hi Javier, i think you can&#39;t submit your app only for iOS 5. As Apple check against iOS 6 and if found any thing not compliant with iOS 6, may reject the APP. so better you test for iOS 6 as titanium has released support for iOS 6.</p>
