										<p><p>have a look at my API library. This is working for me.<br>You are not checking for readyState==4 in your onload. Perhaps its calling this function to early. Also check your validate function. Perhaps this is giving back &quot;undefined&quot; and everything is working fine</p>

										<p><p>checking for readyState didn&#39;t help. It got to readyState 4 and still same error. What do you think your API will help me with? I ask because its weird how my code works on 3.4 and not 3.5, maybe I need to set a request header?</p>

							<p>I&#39;m going to answer my own question here. After the 3.5.0 upgrade, there has definitely been a change to the http client code. Not sure what it was, but it definitely handles requests differently. Maybe an appcelerator rep can expand on that. That being said, its probably not the sole reason responseText is undefined. </p>
<p>With my case, it was two things. One, was that our rest service was used on a desktop platform before being employed for the mobile app, so on positive responses, it would send a redirect and the browser would send the user to the homepage. On 3.4.1, it got the response before the redirect just fine. 3.5.0, no matter what, the redirect screwed up the responseText. So look to see it your server is sending a redirect (302) somehow. I added the &quot;onredirect&quot; function definition to my httpclient object to see what was happening during the request. </p>
<p>Now along the lines of GET working but not POST, check to see if your server side needs to be called with a https instead of http. That also caused problems with some of my httpclient requests. </p>
<p>Hope that helps anyone with this problem!</p>

							<p>Hi,<br>I am facing a similar issue here. I make a restful web service calls to the server and the server returns 302 with a different cookie each time.Because of this new cookie each the session terminates every minute which is frustrating to user, as he has to log in again to establish the session.</p>
<p>Setting the property autoRedirect = true, is causing the above issue and setting it to false is resulting into endless service calls.</p>
<p>Can some one provide a help here ?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
