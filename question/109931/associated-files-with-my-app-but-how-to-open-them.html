			<p>In reference to a <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;109901&#x2F;associate-files-with-your-app">previous question</a> I was able to create the associations but turns out that is only half the battle. That same <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;2774343&#x2F;how-do-i-associate-file-types-with-an-iphone-application">article</a> I linked to says this:</p>
<p>&gt;When the attachment is opened, your application will be started and you will need to handle the processing of this file in your -application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: application delegate method.</p>
<p>Do we have access to this file or this functionality? Maybe the Info.plist or tiapp.xml? The article is geared towards xcode more or less so didn&#39;t know if this was possible and Google isn&#39;t giving me much.</p>
<p>Thx!</p>

							<p>Essentially what you are looking for is the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;latest&#x2F;Titanium.App.getArguments-method.html">Ti.App.getArguments()</a> method.  You can use this in app.js to determine if the program was launched due to a custom URL schema.</p>
<p>However, in practice it is slightly more complicated than that unless you disallow multitasking.  Assuming you allow multitasking, your application will pause and resume when the user switches to another application temporarily.  If your application is paused, when another application (including Safari) calls your custom URL schema, the application resumes processing – just as it does when the user resumes on their own.</p>
<p>Thus you need a way to determine if the resume was due to a custom URL launch or a user action.  The inclination here is to try to access getArguments() during a &#39;resume&#39; event listener.  Alas, that doesn&#39;t work however when I asked <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;93841&#x2F;any-getarguments-equivalent-in-resume-event">here</a> I was told there is an undocumented event called &#39;resumed&#39; which will return the getArguments() value.</p>
<p>Sadly, you can&#39;t tell if the user caused the resume instead of a custom URL.  You will get back the same getArguments() value as the initial launch&#x2F;previous resumed event as explained <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;101691&#x2F;ho-wto-reset-the-getarguments-value">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you disallow multitasking, the application is always a full launch and thus just checking getArguments() during app.js startup suffices.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Doug, both &#39;pause&#39; and &#39;resume&#x2F;d&#39; are firing but <code>Ti.API.info( Ti.App.getArguments() );</code> gives me nothing. Any reason why I shouldn&#39;t be getting some kind of object?</p>

										<p><p>Are you just launching the app from the launcher?  It won&#39;t pass any arguments.  Make sure you are launching from the browser using your custom URL schema, if you want getArguments() to return anything useful.</p>

										<p><p>Aaah, another piece to the puzzle ;) well I was launching from Safari using myapp:&#x2F;&#x2F;?x=1 and got nothing. I&#39;m totally making this up as I go so maybe that URL isn&#39;t legit? This isn&#39;t really what I want to do anyway - my goal is to open attachments from Mail, not Safari - is a custom URL schema applicable?</p>

										<p><p>That would be legit if myapp was the right name in the Info.plist file.  Look in your build folder for Info.plist for CFBundleURLSchemes and see what string value is given.  That is the value you want to use before the :&#x2F;&#x2F; in order to launch the program.</p>
<p>It is the name other apps would use to open your app and pass in arguments.  If you are trying to open other apps, you need to know their URL scheme name.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m using this method to get a file passed in from the Mail app on the iPhone, but I can&#39;t seeme to figure out how to access the file&#39;s local location.  This is the object that I get when invoking Ti.App.getArguments()…</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">{<span class="hljs-string">"source"</span>:<span class="hljs-string">"com.apple.mobilemail"</span>,
<span class="hljs-string">"url"</span>:"<span class="hljs-keyword">file</span>:<span class="hljs-comment">//localhost/private/var/mobile/Applications/1F0557D2</span>
-AA83-4449-BDCF-3751807D5942/Documents/Inbox/<span class="hljs-keyword">test</span>-17.xml}
</code></pre><p>I should be able to access that url, right?</p>

										<p><p>yes you should, but remember the url is only a string so you have to use that url to make an object that Ti can use. for instance, the file passed to my app was a url to an attached audio file, so i passed it to Ti.media.createSound() and created a sound object for playing back.</p>
<p>that&#39;s what i&#39;ve discovered from trying to get audio to work. hope it can be applied to your context as well.</p>
