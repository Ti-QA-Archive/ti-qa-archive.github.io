							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Make sure the emulator is closed and then run the <strong>project</strong> &gt; <strong>clean</strong> option on your project.</p>
<p>Another thing to try is running the uninstall option inside the emulator, this will remove the app in the same way as it would on a physical device.  Keep in mind this will remove any databases, files and settings you created.</p>

										<p><p>What you are experiencing is not usual.  When you re-run an app it should automatically overwrite the previous version giving you a new app each time.  So something must be interfering with that process.</p>
<ul>
<li>do you know how to delete AVDs? If so delete your and try again, if not let me know and I will give you a walk through.</li>
<li>make sure you are on the latest version of the SDK it has some better handling of builds over previous version.</li>

<p>It drops this callstack. Is there anything I need to update in Titanium for the new SDK?<br>Also curious why this stops Titanium being able to connect to my Phone.</p>

										<p><p>To delete AVDs (Android Virtual Devices);</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to the <strong>Dashboard</strong> tab in <strong>Titanium Studio</strong></li>

<li>Choose <strong>Android</strong></li>
<li>Choose <strong>Update Android SDK</strong></li>

										<p><p>I&#39;m wondering about this dashboard. I don&#39;t see any menu options for it.<br>When I go to NewProject-&gt;Titanium Project-&gt;Default I get a menu for selecting platforms and some other settings, in there I can hit &quot;Setup\Configure SDK&#39;s&quot;  On this Preference menu I can click &quot;Configure&quot; next to the drop down box for Default Android SDK: and this opens a tab called &quot;Dashboard&quot; in my fileview. Now I get an error (shown below) I also get this error on startup, and this leaves the dash board page blank.  </p>
<p>&quot;An Exception has occured in the script. Error name: TypeError. Error description: Object doesn&#39;t support this property or method. Error number -2146827850.&quot;</p>

										<p><p>You may be using the simplified interface, can you see a red triangle on the toolbar?  If so press it and you should see the tab I mentioned above.</p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;m in simplified view. On further exploration I have found a faster route to open the dash board, Help-&gt;Tatinum Studio -&gt;Show Titanium Dashboard<br>However I&#39;m met with the same error. No dashboard for me :(</p>

										<p><p>Just to be sure - you have not updated anything before today - for example Java?  If so roll that back as Java HAS to be 1.6.</p>

							<p>Doing project-&gt;Clean does not work. Also how would I do this without having to go through lengthy options on the phone simulator? I want to get the turn around time between testing builds as low as possible.</p>

										<p><p>Quick tip; please comment on the related answer or the actual question if there is no answer - rather than creating a whole new answer which is really a comment - it makes it harder in the future to work out threads if any answers score change or other answers are added.
