		<section>
			<p>hi</p>
<p>The type of application i am building will require a login, kind of like dating apps do and rss etc but cant find anything in the tutorials or docs that relates to this whole field, especially when it comes to things like:</p>
<p>if not logged in dont show home page, show login or register options.</p>
<p>if logged out then redirect the user to the login&#x2F; register page</p>
<p>keep an encrypted login info like a cookie etc that can be passed to external services and decrypted by them.</p>
<p>anyone had any experience with this kind of thing and would be so kind as to give me a little of there wisdom i would be very grateful.</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<p>dave</p>

										<p><p>well done, wicked tutorial mate, i think you need to add on what to do with the session though and then continue to check &#x2F; validate that i have done quite a good class for this now if you would like to see what i have done then email david AT uyrdesign.com  and i will pass it over to you,  you can then check if session is valid with a couple of lines of code throughout, maybe in an include or something, i will mark this as the answer because you are the actual author of the tutorial itself.  quite a good community on here actually can tell your all in america though! :-)</p>

							<p>here is a tutorial that might get you started</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.tutsplus.com&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium-user-authentication&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.tutsplus.com&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium-user-authentication&#x2F;</a></p>
<p>but alot of your questions can only be answered with a better understanding of how the backend server handles authentication and how the services you are going to access function. I think the tutorial will help you start to think about all of these technical issues</p>

							<p>Don&#39;t know if this will help or not, but in my (desktop) app, I did something very similar to what the tutorial above outlines, but instead of storing the username and password in the database (storing passwords locally is a sensitive issue here), I store the username in the database, and a “session_id” field.</p>
<p>If the session_id is null, then my app displays a login dialog, and the username and password are submitted over https to a script on the server that, pending the correct password, responds with a session_id (on the server, the scripts handle session_id handling, timeouts, etc. - if you’re using PHP for example, then its standard session handling methods will suffice).</p>
<p>I then store that session_id locally, and use that for any http connections to my server from then on (either passed in as a url variable, e.g., url = &#39;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;foo.com&#x2F;app.json?sid=&#39; + user.session_id + &#39;&amp;bar=baz&#39;, or set as a cookie in a HTTPClient object, like this: httpClient.setRequestHeader(&#39;Cookie&#39;, &#39;sid=&#39; + user.session_id);, depending on what I’m doing).</p>
<p>If the session_id is not blank in the local database, then on launch my app attempts to authenticate with the server using that first. If the server responds with a “Session expired” error code, then my app displays the login dialog as above, and resets the session_id field in the local database on successful login.</p>
<p>I hope that helps a little!</p>

										<p><p>yeah thats what i was thinking, have built a class that basically deals with all the login now based on the google API login example but was like were do you keep it, wondered if it kept a cookie or a session or something but have decided to keep the session inside a local database, then i can then make calls to the local database for the information to validate against a server, would do it internal but that would be the possibility of the session being tampered with for example on jailbroken phones etc, thanks for your comments.</p>
