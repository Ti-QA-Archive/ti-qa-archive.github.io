			<h1>Submitting to Apple - Error: icons 0x0 insteas of 57x57 and 72x72</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am attempting to submit my application to Apple for review but after going through the entire process, I am held up when I &quot;verify&quot; it which is done right before actual submission.  It gives me an error saying that my icon is 0x0 not 57x57 (iPhone) and another error says my icon is 0x0 not 72x72 (iPad).  The only suggestions I could find on how to fix it was to to A) update Application Loader, which I did.  Although I could not update to the very latest version because it doesn&#39;t support Snow Leopard which is what I&#39;m running.  Needless to say it didn&#39;t work.  The other suggestion was to B) add an array of your icons in the code of the info.plist file.  The problem is that I don&#39;t have an info.plist file anywhere in my project.  I started the project solely testing for Android and then later added the iPhone and iPad tagets which may be why I don&#39;t have that file.  If anybody has any suggestions, they would be greatly appreciated as I spent all summer working on this app and would like to see it through.</p>

							<p>Hi Ben</p>
<p>Can you confirm what version of the Appcelerator SDK and XCode you are using?</p>
<p>This was a problem a while ago but not for some time.  Check to see what version of the loader you are using - if it is not at least 2.5.1 then <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.manbolo.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;02&#x2F;02&#x2F;macosx-10.7.3-update-breaks-ios-app-validation">check this</a>.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, the icons are in the iphone folder and are labelled as such.  They operate perfectly fine when deployed on physical devices for testing.</p>

							<p>I don&#39;t have access to the computer I was uploading with right now because I am telecommuting, but I just downloaded Titanium and XCode on the system last week so they should both be up to date.  As for updating Application Loader, see the original post.</p>
