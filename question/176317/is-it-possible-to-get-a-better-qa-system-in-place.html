			<p>Appcelerator is a great idea and sometimes I love this framework.</p>
<p>Other times I want my company to bail on it and just go native. </p>
<p>Partly, it is because this has got to be the WORST form type system for finding answers to my questions. The search gives no options to sort the search by date, relevance, answered, etc… If I type in &quot;android animation&quot; trying to figure out how others are trying to overcome Titaniums shortcomings in supporting Android&#39;s non-linear animations.  (Come on Ti developers. 4.x has been out how long? It seems Ti support iOS new functionality fast, but lags behind in Android support by years?)</p>
<p>But maybe there are answers to all my questions. This form makes it almost impossible to do good searches though. Heck, even the text editor we use to type in doesn&#39;t wordwrap. I have a feeling this Q&amp;A is just from some open source tool that could be upgraded to offer far better search and other features.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Every once in a while there is a post like this that decides the Q&amp;A is partly or totally to blame for all teir problems.  This one appears to be going in that direction.  However it also includes a bit of general complaining as well.</p>
<p>Your first point I will agree with, search is horrific.  So don&#39;t use it, go to google and enter;</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Appcelerator something&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>You can refine the results, limit the scope to only include a certain period which is useful for newer information or recent SDK changes.</p>
<p>But to suggest the Q&amp;A itself is bad because of search suggests all the questions and answers themselves have no value.  That suddenly all the work people like myself have put in to helping people resolve there so etimes simple but often very complicated problems was a total waste of time,</p>
<p>I wonder if the 2,673 questions I have helped which account for around 1,500 people - would agree that the Q&amp;A is bad?</p>
<p>Many times questions are asked by people who have not yet taken the time to reviews the docs, watch videos or simply play with the feature they want to learn about outside their app.  That last part is so important but so often neglected these days.  Self discovery seems to have taken a back step get some code and it works, not really sure how but no need to understand it </p>
<p>Appcelerator have one of the fastest SDK roll outs around, a new one every 2 months and each packed with more features.  Some features are left to the many module developers to add and there is a massive number of then covering all aspects of features, so e with hundres of variations. This is such a rich evolving platform that your comments fail to take any of that into account.</p>
<p>Your comment about android vs iOS also ignores a very important market factor - new android operating systems take years to become the majority.  Due to the platform model being controlled by the phone networks - the upgrades to devices are extremely slow or simply non existent.  Add to that the often poor quality low spec hardware that was used often means a newer OS could not be used.  Thankfully these issues are going away, but still affects the majority of handsets out there.</p>
<p>So do you add a new feature into an OS that had only 10% or one that has 90%?  This does NOT mean appcelerator will ignore any new features on either platform, they just have to way up; penetration, ease of build, market usage &amp; custom module market.</p>
<p>Let me know your thoughts.</p>

										<p><p>I still maintain that the Q&amp;A system here could be upgraded. The fact that there are thousands of questions being answered doesn&#39;t mean it couldn&#39;t be improved. I am a strong believer in community tools, and of the many various form tools, this one has been lacking.</p>
<p>As to Appcelerator support. Unfortunately, competition forces me to both support the 90% and show that I am delivering the next generation 10%. The sad fact is, if my competition&#39;s Android app has 4.x animation, smooth tweens and an overall modern feel to it compared to what I can do in Titanium, I do run the risk of becoming the obsolete app.</p>
<p>With things like Android Material being pushed, my apps early next year will be expected to look Material soon. I might have until early next year before my competitors going native will have updated their apps in that direction.</p>
<p>Just to be clear though, I&#39;ve watched every video on this site and have gone through the docs extensively. I use modules to help fill the holes, however their support can be (unfortunately) a bit spotty. To use the original case, supporting non-linear Android animation effects that gracefully work on older devices was helped by a module that is now abandoned. I can pick it up, but that means I&#39;m developing in Java and at that point we are just that closer to going native.</p>
<p>I really want Titanium to be the solution for years to come.</p>

<p>I will pass it up the chain as far as I am able.</p>
