			<h1>Titanium.Platform.displayCaps.platformWidth / Height returning incorrect number in simulator</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m outputting to the iPhone 4.2 simulator.</p>
<p>if I call Titanium.Platform.displayCaps.platformWidth, it returns 320 instead of 640.  I was working on an animation to move the window to the left:<br>animation.left = -1*Titanium.Platform.displayCaps.platformWidth</p>
<p>however it only goes half way, so in troubleshooting I output it to the log: ti.api.info(Titanium.Platform.displayCaps.platformWidth) and it returns 320.  Even win.width = 320 even though it is 640.  If I instead use &#39;-100%&#39; in the animation it still only uses 320.  So I have to do &#39;-200%&#39; this is obviously not optimal and probably a bug?</p>

							<p>So people don&#39;t get confused by what display caps returns and think TI is screwed up. displayCaps(width and height) does not return the screen pixel size they return the screen point size. </p>
<p>iPhones are based on a 320x480 point system. that why we have @2x images to scale the points to the right size.</p>
<p>On android you have density&#39;s of low&#x2F;hmed&#x2F;high&#x2F;xhigh this determines the mulitplier to get you to actual pixels. What displayCaps returns is the Display Points that make up the screen. multiple them together and you get the pixel size of the screen.</p>
<p>Is this a convoluted system yes, yes it is. I swear someone at google likes making graphic designers cry.</p>

							<p>I believe the width is correct at 320.  I have done the same type of animation but instead of using &quot;left&quot; I use &quot;center&quot;.  The following works just fine for me and it&#39;s based on a platform width of 320.</p>
<p>view.animate({center:{x:-160,y:240},duration:300});</p>

										<p><p>why is it correct at 320 though?  Isn&#39;t platformWidth supposed to be the pixel width of the screen?  on the iPhone 4 I believe that should be 640 correct?</p>

							<p>I agree, this is wrong.</p>
<p>I am running the Android simulator in WVGA mode at 480x800, and displayCaps is returning a resolution of 320x533. According to the API as I read it, it should return the native display resolution and 320x533 is definitely not it.</p>
<p>Can anyone confirm?</p>

										<p><p>note that 320 * 1.5 equals 480. </p>
<p>Out of interest, What does the Titanium.Platform.DisplayCaps.dpi value tell say? 150? </p>
<p>The issue with understanding the displayCaps has a lot to do with dealing screen .density and .dpi too. Especially when looking at various iOS and Android devices. </p>
<p>eg: If I build an iPhone app with a view positioned at top:10 and left:10, even though I&#39;m saying &#39;10 pixels from the top and 10 pixels from the left&#39; to Titanium, that&#39;s correct for an older iPhone, but it&#39;s actually 20,20 on the iPhone4 with a retina screen. But we still use the lower resolution values to position things. </p>
<p>Trial and error is your friend ;) It&#39;s often better than the docs for learning :)</p>

										<p><p>It&#39;s not actually the DPI I have a problem with, by the actual screen resolution. More often than not when I start the emulator in APIS2.2 &#x2F; WVGA 800x480 mode, the displayCaps property returns 533x320 (heightxwidth) as the resolution. I don&#39;t think this is a problem with Titanium actually, but the Android emulator being rubbish, and for some reason failing on load to render the right resolution.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s some screenshots illustrating that behaviour you should be able to see in the Titanium Developer console log that it&#39;s stating display caps are 320x533 and yet it&#39;s clearly running in WVGA800 mode.</p>
<p>I&#39;m running a Mac OSX Snow Leopoard and Titanium 1.6.1 btw, I haven&#39;t tested this executing from the new TiStudio yet as I just haven&#39;t had time.</p>

										<p><p>I think I can kind of replicate the problem. When I&#39;m using an external monitor, this works fine and the emulator renders in 480x800. On my MacBook Pro 13&quot; screen however, the seems to reduce the resolution. Wondering if anyone else can confirm this happens, maybe its an emulator bug…</p>

										<p><p>I am testing on a Samsung Galaxy S. PlatformWidth and PlatformHeight always return 320 x 533, not 800x480, which is the REAL resolution… Not even trying on the emulator.</p>
