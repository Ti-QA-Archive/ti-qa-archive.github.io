							<p>A majority of these questions can be answered by going to the home page of the wiki, where many of these topics are detailed. For this reason I suggest you go to the following link: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Home">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Home</a></p>
<p>My answers will be brief as you will be better served going to the wiki</p>
<p>1) Titanium for mobile use a pure Javascript API, desktop uses HTML&#x2F;JS&#x2F;CSS. Appcelerator prides itself on the speed with which you can develop an app using Titanium.</p>
<p>2) Yes, you can access wifi, and extend Titanium apps to use bluetooth via native modules</p>
<p>3) Titanium Studio, the sanctioned IDE for Titanium development, has an integrated step debugger. In addition, the <code>Titanium.API</code> module has functions for logging</p>
<p>4) Moodle is a web based CMS if I&#39;m not mistaken. You could replicate much of its functionality in titanium from a front end perspective.</p>
<p>5) At this moment we don&#39;t have a means of integrating flash content</p>
<p>6) Again, be sure to check the wiki and developer blog for info</p>

							<p>Some more stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>While Ti uses JS your &quot;maybe very good js knowledge&quot; won&#39;t be enough if you worked with in an DOM only environment. You will have to forget about DOM and your coding experience will be closer to a server one.<br>The speed you can reach to build apps is amazing. The Ti APIs + some smart autocompletion + using a snippets manager (and of course experience) will allow you to make ready to submit apps in matter of days.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You have access to many features natively and for modules there are few sources you can get them from, like github, appcelerator marketplace(free and $), codecanyon ($) or even create modules by yourself or pay somebody.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Flash, despite is popularity is sort of dying (imho). I wouldn&#39;t rely on it too much.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You will need patience, if you have issues come to QA and ask specific questions  (not like &quot;how to make a rss reader. provide me code. it&#39;s urgent.&quot;) :). the best way to find how to do stuff is KitchenSink where you have virtually all the APIs inside the examples.</p>
</li>
<li>The cross-platform ratio is not quite 100% :) but like 80% , there are differences between android and ios that cannot be normalized. Most of them are on the UI side.</li>
</ul>
