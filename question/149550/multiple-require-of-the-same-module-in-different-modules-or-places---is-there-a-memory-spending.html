			<h1>Multiple &#34;require()&#34; of the same module in different modules or places - is there a memory spending</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a javascript module describing some object. I use this object multiple times in different modules in my project. For example I call var m= require(&quot;module&quot;) in first module and further call the same in other module. My question is: whether module &quot;module&quot; will be loaded in memory twice?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The short answer is no.</p>
<p>CommonJS will load the code ONLY when called the first time and then cache it for re-use later on if required.  It will not be loaded more than once into memory UNLESS you ask it to.</p>
<p>CommonJS used correctly is a very efficient coding pattern.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Malcolm! What does it mean &quot; It will not be loaded more than once into memory UNLESS you ask it to.&quot; How is it possible to ask to load a module in memory again?</p>

										<p><p>CommonJS allows you to create shared functionality and variables that any window or function can access.  OR you can create separate instances of the modules o you can us more than once copy of the CommonJS template where the variables held inside are not shared.  In this case each &quot;new&quot; instance is a copy of the memory footprint.</p>
<p>An interesting article on the subject is here; <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;smorgasbork.com&#x2F;index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=132">Titanium Mobile - CommonJS Fundamentals </a></p>

							<p>Hi vladimir,<br>in the wiki in the caching section is explained really well <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;CommonJS+Modules+in+Titanium">CommonJS Modules</a> , in particular this sentence : &quot; When a JavaScript module is loaded, the object returned by require should be cached by Titanium and provided again to consumers without evaluating the module&#39;s JavaScript code multiple times&quot;</p>

										<p><p>@Mauro, good quote, but it does not have anything to do with memory management - only how the code is not evaluated again.</p>

										<p><p>@Malcolm, I posted this sentence because without this mechanism of &quot;chaching&quot; none of this would been possible, and it seems also obvious that if I put the module in cache do not need to load it into memory again</p>

										<p><p>@Mauro, As I said - good quote, but whilst obvious to you, many out there would not find that as obvious.  My follow-up was only designed add context to those who come later on.  My hope is that You, I and all others that pitch in and help others, think of some of these questions as being re-read by others in the future.  I hope you understand.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Mauro! I read this quote but I was confused with this phrase &quot;the object returned by require should be cached by Titanium&quot;. &quot;Should be cashed&quot; but not &quot;must be cashed&quot; or really &quot;is cashed&quot;</p>
