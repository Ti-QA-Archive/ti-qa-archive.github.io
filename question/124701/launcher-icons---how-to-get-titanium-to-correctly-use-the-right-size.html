			<h1>Launcher Icons - How to get Titanium to correctly use the right size</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>We have developed 3 sizes of our launcher icon (36, 48, and 72), per the Android guidelines.  I have placed them in the low, medium, and high subdirectories under \Resources\android\images\ respectively.  Titanium refuses to build my app unless I place one of these in the Resources directory directly.  In tiapp.xml, I have <strong>&lt;icon&gt;MyAppIcon.png&lt;&#x2F;icon&gt;</strong>.</p>
<p>What is the correct way to set this up so that the correct icon is used on different density devices?</p>

							<p>You will need to put them in the platform&#x2F;android&#x2F;res&#x2F;drawable&#x2F;drawable-DENSITY folders. (e.g. drawable-mdpi, drawable-ldpi, drawable-hdpi). Files under images&#x2F;android&#x2F;[low|medium|high] have their names mangled to prevent collisions and to remove folders if any appear. Which works fine when accessed from a Titanium API, but not from the Android OS.</p>

										<p><p>Don, thanks for your quick reply, and explanation.  I have made those directories, per your instructions.  Now I get this error when building my app:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[ERROR] IOError: [Errno <span class="hljs-number">2</span>] No such file <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> directory:
<span class="hljs-string">u'C:\\Titanium\\Workspace\\MyApp\\build\\android\\bin\\assets\\Resources\\MyAppIcon.png'</span>
</code></pre><p>There is no MyAppIcon.png in my Resources directory.  Does there need to be?  If so, what will it get used for?</p>

										<p><p>Try a clean build. You may have to leave a png there with that name for now. It&#39;s been awhile since we&#39;ve looked at that launcher code so we may need to update it.</p>

										<p><p>Don, thanks for following up.  I did do a clean build (even deleted the &quot;build&quot; directory first.  Still got the IOError.  So I put a modified copy of the &quot;medium&quot; density launcher icon back into the Resources directory, and the error went away, but the device (and emulator) are using the Resources copy of the icon for everything…not the one in platform&#x2F;android&#x2F;res&#x2F;drawable&#x2F;drawable-mdpi&#x2F; or the platform&#x2F;android&#x2F;res&#x2F;drawable&#x2F;drawable-hdpi&#x2F; directory (when run on high-density devices).</p>
<p>Please take a look at the launcher code.  If there&#39;s a workaround or modification I can make, I&#39;ll certainly do it.  We just spent big bucks having these icons developed for our free app, and it won&#39;t look good for me if we can&#39;t use two thirds of the icons (read that as my boss will likely lose confidence that I&#39;m managing development of our first mobile app efficiently).</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

										<p><p>I have verified that the icon in the Resources directory is being used as <strong>the</strong> launcher icon, regardless of the density of the device it is installed on.</p>
<p>I have created JIRA ticket TC-263 for this.  Don, can you promote this to a TIMOB ticket?  Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>@Shawn I just verified on my Nexus one if I created a folder <code>platform&amp;#x2F;android&amp;#x2F;res&amp;#x2F;drawable-hdpi</code> and dropped the icon in that folder, it was correctly selected on my Nexus One running 2.3.4. Looking at my original answer I added the drawable folder in the path and shouldn&#39;t have.</p>

										<p><p>Don, I noticed the extra &quot;drawable&quot; and put the files in the correct folders.  When you tested it, did you also have a launcher icon with the same name in your Resources directory?  I can&#39;t seem to get Titanium to build my project without one there, and it seems to override the &quot;drawable-&quot; versions.  Also, if I didn&#39;t mention it already, I&#39;m running on a Windows machine.</p>

										<p><p>Still having the same problem.  When I try to build the app for Android without a launcher icon in the Resources directory, I get an IO Error that it can&#39;t find the file in the build&#39;s Resources directory.</p>
<p>Has anyone been able to get this to work?  Don, are you still watching this thread?</p>

										<p><p>What I did is put the mdpi icon in Resources&#x2F;, and the hdpi and xhpdi icons in platform&#x2F;android&#x2F;res&#x2F;drawable-{hdpi,xhdpi}&#x2F;. That seems to work for me.</p>

										<p><p>There seem to be two things that are required to make this work:</p>
<ol>
<li>The name of the launcher icons in platform&#x2F;android&#x2F;res&#x2F;drawable… must be <code>appicon.png</code></li>
<li>Whatever the name of your launcher icon is listed as in TiApp.xml, a file with that name must exist in Resources\android (even though it is not used)</li>
</ol>
<p>There is a JIRA ticket for this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-8507">TIMOB-8507</a></p>
