			<h1>ACS unstable and not to be used as production environment</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Firstly, you can&#39;t sync between Prod and Dev, the export functionality don&#39;t export all data which make it useless. We created our own export utility and also own import utility to move this data from dev to prod.  </p>
<p>The problem now is that as we import thousands of records, all of a sudden the ACS decided that it failed to authenticate the user.</p>
<p>When debugging, the user is authenticated correctly, but as soon as it tries to add&#x2F;delete records I get the authentication problem.</p>
<p>Please can you explain why this is happening, this is the second time, the first time took lots and lots of my time and at the end I had to wait a week and a half for it to work again, without changing any code.</p>

							<div><p>Hello Johan,</p>
<p>I&#39;m sorry you are having trouble with our service. Would you mind posting the import method you described? I&#39;d like to run it through some tests and see if I can figure out whats happening. You can email it to me directly if you do not wish you share it here. </p>
<p>Thank you and hope to hear from you soon,<br>Seth Toda</p>
