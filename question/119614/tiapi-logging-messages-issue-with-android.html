			<h1>Ti.API.* Logging Messages Issue with Android</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>For quite some time, I am unable to log Ti.API.* messages to the console. I am on windows 7 with android. I have seen this problem discussed in relation to iPhone development but there is no help anywhere regarding android.</p>
<p>This problem started when I was using Titanium Developer on a Desktop system. I did everything I could think of but to no avail. I changed to Titanium Studio thinking that it would solve the problem but the issue remained the same. I then changed my PC with new copy of windows… problem was still there. The only thing I didn&#39;t change was android SDK but it was 100% up to date. Probably, it is something wrong with my android sdk installation. I reinstalled it as well… that too didn&#39;t work for me. Now, the only option I am left with is to use alerts… very bad.</p>
<p>Can any body guide me why and where the problem is?</p>

							<p>Hi Abdul</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree - alerts are horrid! ;)</p>
<p>Would you please tell me the Titanium SDK version (and date, if you are using the continuous builds), and Android SDK version that is exhibiting this issue?  Really, you should include this information as a bare minimum for <strong>every single</strong> question you post to the Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>Once you have provided this, I will test it on my system.</p>
<p>Remember that you can always view the logcat output directly, using the following command at the command line:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">adb <span class="hljs-operator">-e</span> logcat
</code></pre><p>The <code>adb</code> executable is available in your android sdk directory.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

							<p>I apologize for having missed important info. It is Titanium 1.6.1 and Android 2.2. Date is about 10th of April this year. Since then I am not seeing any message on console.</p>
<p>Thanks for the logcat command. That will help a lot.</p>

							<p>Thanks to Paul Dowsett, my problem is practically over. The logcat command mentioned by him works great. Now, I can not only see Ti.API.<em> messages but I can also format and filter them with logcat command line arguments. So, I no longer worry if Ti.API.</em> does not work inside Ti Studio. However, it certainly is a thing of intellectual interest.</p>
