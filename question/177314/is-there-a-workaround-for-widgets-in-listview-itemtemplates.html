			<h1>Is there a workaround for Widgets in ListView ItemTemplates?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m currently trying to figure out a workaround for this issue: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC-4613">TC-4613</a>.</p>
<p>Items in the ListView should look like similar to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;iLMPOlA.png">this</a>. Therefor, I want to use two widgets: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitt.io&#x2F;component&#x2F;starrating">starrating</a> and <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitt.io&#x2F;component&#x2F;com.baboonmedia.remoteimage">remoteimage</a>.</p>
<p>Alloy does not allow using <strong>&lt;Require &#x2F;&gt;</strong> or <strong>&lt;Widget &#x2F;&gt;</strong> within an ItemTemplate.</p>
<p>Does anybody know a way to solve this or can anybody maybe help me to find a workaround apart from using a TableView?</p>
<p>thaaanks</p>

							<p>Create the widget instances in the controller code, then add them to the listview within the JavaScript. As long as the resulting objects are instances of Ti.UI.View (or its subclasses), then they will work in a listview. It&#39;s just the Alloy doesn&#39;t process those tags in XML when generating the code for your list.</p>

										<p><p>Tim, thanks for your answer!</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t even think of creating the Widgets in the Controller!</p>
<p>But how can I access the ListItems? Should I do this after the data-binding by iterating through the ListSection? Or do I have to fetch the Collection first and create the ListItems manually (without data binding)?</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m not entirely sure I understand what you&#39;re asking. You could use data-binding to populate the listviews. Or, you could populate the list yourself with code in the controller. Which you use is more of a preference than any sort of requirement as best as I can tell from what you&#39;re asking.</p>
<p>Access to list items in event listeners would be handled the usual way you would with any list view – that is, listen on the ListView&#39;s itemclick event.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m using data-binding at the moment. Now my question was, as I&#39;m not able to bind data to the Widget within the View, where in the Controller code should I create the Widget instances? Can I do this at creation time of the ListView? Or do I have to modify the ListItems after the ListView is drawn?</p>
<p>Is it possible to hook into the creation of each ListItem from within the Controller to add those Widgets?</p>

										<p><p>Sorry, I didn&#39;t fully read your original note and my initial reply before adding today&#39;s comment. I got it totally backward!</p>
<p>You should be able to declare your listview and define your template in XML. Make sure to include a View container in that template to hold the view exposed by the widgets. But then, you&#39;ll need to populate your listview in the controller code, instantiating and initializing widgets as part of whatever looping code you use to create your data set. You won&#39;t be able to use Alloy&#39;s built-in data binding mechanisms. </p>
<p>You might need to modify the starrating widget to update how it handles user interactions. It was not designed with the ListView&#39;s eventing model in mind.</p>

										<p><p>Tim, excuse me for being annoying. But there appears to be another problem with that. I was trying to replace the data binding with a manual ListView population but I don&#39;t accomplish to add a View to the container view that is defined by the template. As ListItems are created by passing an Array of ListDataItems, you can&#39;t just add a View to the container by calling <em>container.add(view)</em>. So I tried passing the View as a child to the container but it doesn&#39;t work. You don&#39;t happen to have an example for this, do you?</p>

										<p><p>The more I look at this, the less I&#39;m sure that this can be done. You could try</p>
