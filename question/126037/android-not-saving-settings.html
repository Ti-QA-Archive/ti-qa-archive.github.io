			<h1>Android not saving settings</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am trying to use <em>Titanium.App.Properties</em> to save settings on the device.</p>
<p>This works just fine on IPhone.<br>Trying to achieve the same on Android it will lose these information as soon as I kill the application with a task manager.</p>
<p>Is this behaviour expected or has anyone got a solution to this problem?<br>Thanks!</p>

										<p><p>There is an object in my application named <em>settings</em> and as well two methods for storing and loading information.<br>See my <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;1242319">code example</a>.<br>It all works okay if the application is terminated correctly, but as soon as I use the task manager or if the app crashes all settings are resetted.</p>

										<p><p>Oh, you got the same problem? I have debugged on a galaxy s 9000. did not find a solution until now.<br>Only workaround that I figured out is to <strong>use Ti.Database instead</strong> of the Ti.App.Properties.</p>

							<p>Yes I have had this problem, all studio and project settings were wiped out including previous projects, Android SDK locations, Run Configurations, and Perspective settings. It seems I was just able to get started with things and the next day when I started up the TS everything was as if I just installed it.</p>
<p>Is this a common occurence with this tool?</p>
