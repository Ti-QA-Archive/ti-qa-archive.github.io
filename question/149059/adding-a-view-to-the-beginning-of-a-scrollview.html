			<h1>Adding a view to the beginning of a ScrollView</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a ScrollView with a list of pictures. When a user takes a new picture, I want to add that picture to the 2nd position in the ScrollView (1st has a &quot;your picture here&quot; graphic).</p>
<p>From looking at the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.UI.View">ScrollView documentation</a>, this isn&#39;t possible. I found other questions here in Q&amp;A but they are 2-3 years old without good answers or answers at all.</p>
<p>The only option I&#39;ve seen is clearing the children and re-adding them. That just seems ridiculous and non-performant, especially for longer lists.</p>
<p>Any ideas here?</p>
<p>SDK - 3<br>Alloy - 1</p>

										<p><p>Yeah, I just tried it and it didn&#39;t work either. I realllllly don&#39;t want to use the linked gist but it looks like I may have to: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;iskugor&#x2F;1485751.</p>
<p>I could nix the horizontal layout of my view but that seems to defeat the purpose considerably.</p>

							<p>ScrollView is nothing more than a scrollable content view. Nothing more, nothing less. It has no optimizations for the layout of the views contained within. For this you&#39;d want to leverage something like TableView for which builtin optimizations are performed, and you have the ability to insert rows at arbitrary positions. Trying to do this with a ScrollView you are left to try and optimize it on your own.</p>
<p>I assume you are using the <code>layout</code> property of the ScrollView and it is set to <code>horizontal</code>? If so, you are going to be extremely limited in what would be possible for arbitrary view insertion. You&#39;ll basically be stuck in the situation you are in now where you need to remove and re-add each view on every operation. You could also try wholesale removal of the whole scrollview and replacing it with another that is built behind the scenes, which would be faster.</p>
<p>If it was me building it, I would <strong><em>not</em></strong> use the <code>layout</code> property. I would instead use absolute positioning (left, right) to keep all of my items in order and allow for arbitrary positioning, Doing it this way you could even go as far as to add animation for the insertion and removal of any items from your horizontal list. You just need to develop an equation for the <code>left</code> value of each of your items, based on their width and spacing, that would determine the position of each item whenever another was inserted or removed. This actually wouldn&#39;t be very hard, particularly if the items are a uniform width.</p>

										<p><p>Hrmm…so TableView isn&#39;t for tabular data? Is it another one of those &quot;name doesn&#39;t reflect functionality&quot; pieces in Ti?</p>
<p>Yeah, I have considered rewriting to use my own layout logic (brings back memories to my old Flash days [pre-Flex]; lol)  but seeing as it was done already (horizontal layout) I thought it&#39;d be useful. </p>
<p>Plane is taking off but I&#39;ll peep TableView when I get settled this evening.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to respond.</p>

										<p><p>Ok, after reading it seems my assumption about TableView is correct: it isn&#39;t best for image galleries.</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to look into custom positioning. Thx.</p>
<p>Sidebar: I have a tough time finding relevant (based on how old it is and responses, if any) Ti info when I search Q&amp;A. Are there any solid resources (blogs, etc) for Ti dev? These can&#39;t be new issues never before seen.</p>

							<p>Here is a working insertViewAt method: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;johncblandii&#x2F;5074660. This is far from ideal and I have yet to confirm this as the best, most performant solution but for this original proof of concept…it works.</p>
