			<h1>UI Width Height Problem since Titanium Mobile v2.0+</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am trying to access <code>height</code> and <code>width</code> of my Window but it doesn&#39;t returns the unit number anymore.<br>If I set <code>height = &amp;#39;100%&amp;#39;</code> or <code>height = Ti.UI.SIZE</code> or <code>height = Ti.UI.FILL</code> it doesn&#39;t help and when I try to get it&#39;s value I simply get same like I entered and not the unit number as was before.</p>
<p><strong>It is working on v1.8.0.1 !!! but since 2.0 it stopped :-(</strong></p>
<p>(I&#39;m using iOS but I think it has the same problem on Android.)</p>
<p>I know I can get the full device sizes but I have a status bar and I don&#39;t want to start with those math calculations of height. It should work as before.<br>Btw, I noticed it&#39;s stopped working for <strong>ALL views</strong>!<br>It doesn&#39;t matter if I try to access this values after window opened or rendered.</p>
<p>Does anybody have any idea about it?</p>

							<p>I am able to get the height and width of the window by defining a postlayout event listener and testing it there.  I have found that sometimes I get a call to the postlayout event listener function and when I check height and width, I get values of 0.  When that happens, I immediately return from my event listener; the event will fire again, and I will get the proper values.</p>

										<p><p>Well I tried that too, I get to that event sometimes but the value always 0 :-(</p>

										<p><p>All I can tell you is that I also get the 0 value sometimes, but I always get one or more postlayout events, and eventually, I get a non-zero height.  I use that height to lay out my interface.  If I didn&#39;t get the height, my app won&#39;t build a UI at all, so it&#39;s very important that I get a good height&#x2F;width.</p>

										<p><p>&quot;eventually&quot; ? lol… so it&#39;s like you are waiting until the Height will come so you can start laying-out your interface?<br>;-)</p>
<p>Thanks anyway. </p>
<p>I will keep digging.  I still think it&#39;s a bug, because it worked just fine before 2.0 came out.</p>

							<p>I ran into this problem as well when i upgraded to 2.0. I was able to resolve the problem by using the size.width and size.height properties in the postlayout event. I cannot seem to find a way to determine the dimensions prior to the first postlayout event trigger.</p>

										<p><p>Just to clarify, the size property belongs to the views and is not returned by the event.</p>
