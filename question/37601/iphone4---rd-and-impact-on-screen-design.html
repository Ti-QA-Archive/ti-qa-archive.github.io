			<h1>iPhone4 - RD and impact on screen design</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi there, watching the info from Apple about the iPhone4 and it indicated that the resolution was effectively going to double. Although it sounded like the OS would handle this extra resolution(?).</p>
<p>That could mean we&#39;d all have to cater for two screen resolutions when creating screen objects (i.e. when setting top, left, height and width).</p>
<p>for example, whether Left:10, Top:4, Width:50, Height:25<br>would have to be set to: Left:20, Top:8, Width:100, Height:50 for the iPhone4.</p>
<p>However, Stevie-Baby seemed to suggest the extra resolution would be used &#39;if available&#39; - suggesting perhaps that a 64 by 64 image could be placed in a 32 by 32 imageView and the iPhone4 would use the extra resolution provided. Would be easiest, but sounds a bit nonsensical.</p>
<p>cheers,<br>Chris.</p>

							<p>it seems as if you add &#39;@x2&#39; to the name of your iOS4-image, iOS4 automaticaly uses this pic for the higher resolution that comes with iPhone4, at least that&#39;s how it&#39;s done in the native SDK (i read about this in engadget&#39;s review of the new phone yesterday)</p>

							<p>I was about to ask this question too. </p>
<p>I have elements in my design which are set to be 300px (to give 10px either side - sure I could do this with left&#x2F;right:10 in <em>some</em> cases - but not all ui elements allow this) so, will these 300px elements be half the width? Or display themselves in the same way as the the earlier devices?</p>

							<p>I have the concern but my app, compiled with 3.13, turned out alright on the iPhone 4. It looks exactly the same as far as label, view dimension go. In the future, create UI images and such for the design, i probably go with the same old dimensions 320x480. Let&#39;s face it, the resolution is 2x but the screen is too darn small to see any differences. It&#39;s always good using small images file sizes.</p>
<p>However, will it makes any differences if it were to build with iOS 4?  </p>
