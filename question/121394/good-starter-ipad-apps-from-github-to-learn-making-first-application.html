			<p>Hi all do any of you have any apps on github your aware of that really helped you learn iPad development? I know it&#39;s very similar to iPhone I&#39;ve taken a look at KitchenSink which honestly has a lot going on and also snapost which seems to be a decent starting point although I wish it had more comments.  </p>
<p>I just graduated college with a cpu science degree and I&#39;m really eager to learn this.  Feel free to email any examples as well to tnach44@gmail.com</p>
<p>Thanks for any help in advance.</p>

							<p>If you&#39;ve had a good look around iPhone KitchenSink and had a go at using some of the examples there to try out iOS stuff, I would then advise you to look at the iPad KitchenSink, which doesn&#39;t have a lot going on, but but use that as a basic project to try out adding the things you&#39;ve learned from the iPhone version. </p>
<p>Really, the best way to learn is to try things out :) You&#39;ll be amazed at what&#39;s possible (I know I was!) </p>
<p>One thing that&#39;s definitely worth nailing is handling orientations, since the iPad gets rotated a lot more than an iPhone, in general usage. </p>
<p>Once you get the basics in your head, you can then try out some of the iPad specific things possible. </p>
<p>Everything will all depend on what it is you&#39;re trying to achieve. </p>
<p>We all had to start somewhere! :)  </p>
<p>Good luck! And don&#39;t forget, we&#39;re (usually) always here to help!</p>
