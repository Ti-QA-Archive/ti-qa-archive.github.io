		<section>
			<p>Win 7, Android sdk 2.2, Ti 3.0.0.GA.<br>Earlier I thought the compile&#x2F;run was taking hours, but the window I was viewing, thinking it was build progress, was actually the emulator process. I believe it was tracing the emulator activity. But I noticed the emulator window opens almost immediately after beginning. It&#39;s not clear what&#x2F;where window tells me about compiling progress but evidently the compile was done much sooner than I expected. Sorry for the Dufus oversight!</p>
