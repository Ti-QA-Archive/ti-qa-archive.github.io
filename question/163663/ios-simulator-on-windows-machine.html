							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The answers from both Dan and Muhammad are correct, but to add a little more substance;</p>
<p>In order to develop for iOS you still require xcode on your computer as this is part of the background compile process.  It is also required to assist in certificate management when you wish to get the app onto your device and into the store.</p>
<p>As xcode is a mac OSX only application, it simply cannot be run on anything other than a mac based computer.  As you cannot have xcode on a windows or linux machine - it is not possible to develop for that platform.</p>
<p>There are ways you can achieve this though, they require money and likely neither is suitable for you right now.</p>
<ul>
<li>Get a cheap mac, does not have to be anything special or even brand new - check the link below for minium requirements.  However consider aiming higher than bottom as very soon the needs become greater.</li>
<li>You can rent a mac in the cloud.  These are not cheap and require a very fast connection to mac the most of them.  Often they come pre-loaded with the dev software you need though.  However for the same amount as a few months of renting you could have bought an entry level machine.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find out more here about what is required for each platform and version.  Review this every once in a while as it is updated as things move forwards and as each platform drops support for older versions.</p>
