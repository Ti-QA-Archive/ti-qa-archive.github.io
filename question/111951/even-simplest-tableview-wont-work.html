		<section>
			<p>Hello people, </p>
<p>I am trying to make TableView work, but even simplest example crashes. I must be doing something wrong because KitchenSink works. Here&#39;s the example: </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var window = Titanium.UI.createWindow(); 
var data = [
{<span class="hljs-string">title:</span><span class="hljs-string">'Row 1'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">color:</span><span class="hljs-string">'red'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">selectedColor:</span><span class="hljs-string">'#fff'</span>},
{<span class="hljs-string">title:</span><span class="hljs-string">'Row 2'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">color:</span><span class="hljs-string">'green'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">selectedColor:</span><span class="hljs-string">'#fff'</span>},
{<span class="hljs-string">title:</span><span class="hljs-string">'Row 3'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">color:</span><span class="hljs-string">'blue'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">selectedColor:</span><span class="hljs-string">'#fff'</span>},
{<span class="hljs-string">title:</span><span class="hljs-string">'Row 4'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">color:</span><span class="hljs-string">'orange'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">selectedColor:</span><span class="hljs-string">'#fff'</span>}
];

var tableview = Titanium.UI.createTableView({<span class="hljs-string">data:</span>data});

window.add(tableview);
window.open();
</code></pre>

							<p>I solved it. It was related to <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;62581&#x2F;createimageview-crashes">this post</a>. First I reinstalled Titanium Developer which didn&#39;t help. So I have created a new project. Now it works. </p>

<p>Please don&#39;t answer your own questions; use the comment facility instead. If you post your solution as a comment to Doug&#39;s answer, you can mark it &quot;best&quot; and make it easier for others to find your solution in future.

<p>Well done for resolving it.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

							<p>Can you elaborate on &quot;crashes&quot; and describe what happens or what error message is displayed?  Also, it is helpful to list what platform and SDK level you are using – the tags are typically good for this.</p>
<p>What happens if you change the first line to:</p>
<p><code>var window = Ti.UI.currentWindow;</code></p>
<p>and drop the window.open()?  Unless this code is in your app.js prior to opening any other window or tabgroup.</p>

<p>Please try to think of this from the helper&#39;s perspective. I think Doug has done an admirable job of giving you some reasonable suggestions with barely enough information to go on.</p>
<p>Where in the question have you stated your platform? Your code is not a usecase. Please read <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.appcelerator.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;contribute.html#participating_in_the_q&amp;a">Participating in the Q&amp;A</a> to learn how to get accurate answers more quickly in this forum, and <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.appcelerator.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;contribute.html#creating_good_use-cases">Creating Good Use-cases</a> to find out how to provide code that will allow someone to help you with your issue.</p>

										<p><p>I am sorry, Paul. But I don&#39;t really understand your remark. I wasn&#39;t rude to Doug in any way. I just tried to answer his questions and suggestions. Regarding use-cases this is exact code that won&#39;t run for me. Is it possible to produce less code than that? Next time I&#39;ll write SDK version and mobile platform right away, sorry about that. </p>
<p>BTW Doug, it&#39;s for iPad iOS 4.2.</p>

										<p><p>Eugen, I didn&#39;t take anything as rude.  I guess I misinterpreted your mention of Mac OS 10.6.6 and not mentioning the iPad to mean you were doing a desktop application.  In my defense, it was 4am my time and I may not have been thinking straight.  :)  The code as posted looked just fine, which is another reason I jumped to the conclusion you were dealing with a different platform where I have no experience.  At any rate, glad you got it working.</p>

<p>As I mentioned before I received an error after restarting computer. First then I could see what&#39;s the real problem was. Which has nothing to do with code itself but a strange bug in Titanium. You can see the link I&#39;ve posted.</p>

										<p><p>Eugen, you have missed the point of the &quot;give and take&quot; nature this forum and, hence, it is apparent that you have not read, or not understood, the documents in the links I posted. OK, noted! I will say no more on the matter.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really important to state your mobile OS version and Titanium version, <em>whenever</em> you post a question, otherwise people are only able to make random guesses with their suggestions. The best place for this information is in your question tags.</p>
<p>Indeed, your usecase is good, so sorry if I sounded harsh before.</p>
<p>It seems like a bug, because the code runs fine on Android. The approach I would take is to remove properties incrementally until you find the ones that cause the issue. </p>
<p>Start with this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var window = Titanium.UI.createWindow();
Titanium.UI.setBackgroundColor(<span class="hljs-string">'black'</span>);
var data = [
{<span class="hljs-string">title:</span><span class="hljs-string">'Row 1'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">color:</span><span class="hljs-string">'red'</span>},
{<span class="hljs-string">title:</span><span class="hljs-string">'Row 2'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">color:</span><span class="hljs-string">'green'</span>},
{<span class="hljs-string">title:</span><span class="hljs-string">'Row 3'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">color:</span><span class="hljs-string">'blue'</span>},
{<span class="hljs-string">title:</span><span class="hljs-string">'Row 4'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">color:</span><span class="hljs-string">'orange'</span>}
];

var tableview = Titanium.UI.createTableView({<span class="hljs-string">data:</span>data});

window.add(tableview);
window.open();
</code></pre><p>Then, although it&#39;s a long shot, change the colors to their hex values, ie:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-rules">{<span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">title</span>:<span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">'Row 1'</span>, color:<span class="hljs-string">'#f00'</span></span></span></span>},
</code></pre><p>Once you have found the cause, please report back.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
