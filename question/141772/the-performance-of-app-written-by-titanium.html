							<p>Assuming that you followed best-practices for each programming language &amp; API, You&#39;ll find that apps will perform in this order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Native ObjC or Java: Of course a truly native app will perform the best.</li>
<li>Titanium apps: Titanium apps are also native apps, but you will find there is a small performance penalty when you use any framework, even Titanium</li>
<li>HTML5 apps (I assume you mean an app using something like PhoneGap): I personally feel that HTML apps are handicapped on iOS. Apple doesn&#39;t let apps have access to the same high-performance Javascript engine that Safari has access to. HTML apps on anything earlier than Android 4.1 also, in my opinion, tend to feel sluggish. I believe that between 4.1 &quot;Project Butter&quot; and Chrome, it&#39;s gotten better.</li>
</ul>

							<p>I totally disagree with this answer. To be honest, I&#39;ve never found an HTML5 app that runs that slow, they just seem to be limited in terms of UI and native look&#x2F;feel. On the other hand, every Titanium app I&#39;ve played around with (assume they&#39;re more than just a couple windows) has performance issues. If you&#39;re building a complex app and performance matters, you should definitely stay away for the time being IMO.</p>
