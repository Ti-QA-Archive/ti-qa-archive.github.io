			<h1>Android emulator won&#39;t open any site?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>In my previous version of titanium studio, android emulator was able to open any sites in the emulator&#39;s browser. But as i have upgraded the studio and sdk to 3.0.2, The emulator&#39;s browser is not able to open any site. The browser tries for quite a lot time and then a alert message shows &quot;The connection to the server timed out.&quot; </p>
<p>The emulator is connected to the network, as the &quot;Titanium.Network.online&quot; returns &quot;true&quot;.</p>
<p>Can anyone help me out to know where the problem lies as its very difficult to use the http request while running the application on emulator.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<div><p>why don&#39;t you update at least at 3.1.3 ? that&#39;s the lastest RC before 3.2.0, you might get more support on newer versions. It works on my emulator. Have you tried to open the same url from the Browser in the emulator?</p>
