			<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Is it possible for me to build my full project on a PC and then save all the files and export&#x2F;transfer to a Mac in order to generate the upload files for iTunes?</p>
<p>Thank You</p>

							<p>You will need a Mac to compile the iOS version. This is because the compilation process is ultimately done by Xcode, which Apple publishes for OS X only. You could use a service like MacInCloud or one of the host-a-mac-mini providers out there if you really don&#39;t want to buy one.</p>

										<p><p>Commenting on my own answer because I can&#39;t edit it:</p>
<p>While you could probably do everything on a Windows&#x2F;Linux box, then transfer the files to a Mac and compile, you shouldn&#39;t. You should develop the Android &amp; iOS versions in parallel, testing on both platforms as you go. If you wait till the end, you&#39;re just asking for troubles, incompatibilities, UI&#x2F;UX problems, etc.</p>
<p>Titanium is not a &quot;write-once, run everywhere&quot; tool. The native platforms are just too different to abstract completely (without making a completely minimalistic app dev tool). That means necessary API differences between the target platforms. Besides, you should be developing UI&#x2F;UX experiences that match the respective platforms&#39; UI guidelines and user expectations. Which means different screens, layouts, and flows across platforms. </p>
<p>The differences are likely to be small, code-wise. Some apps can use the exact same code, some have small tweaks here and there to adjust sizes or placements, some apps have significant differences if you&#39;re getting into many platform-specific features &amp; functions.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure if this is a hobby&#x2F;side-thing for you, or you&#39;re going to be doing app dev on an on-going basis. If it&#39;s the latter, you really should make the investment in a Mac. It will make things so much easier in the long run.</p>

										<p><p>The shorter answer is, whilst technically possible - that app will contain a single label and do no more. Anything else requires effort as a programmer to test, verify and manage even the most basic differences like navigation.</p>
