							<p>First of all… Databases are a bad place to store images. Too big, no reason for it. I would suggest that you store your images on the device, with a path in the database to where you find the image. This way, you keep the metadata about the image in the database and you keep the image data on the device. Better architecture and I expect your query times will improve by a whole lot.</p>

										<p><p>Actually I would suggest marking this question back to correct as it very much is and then start a brand new question that includes the actual thing you have a problem with plus the additional requests above.  Otherwise this is going to be very confusing for anyone looking for this answer in the future.</p>
