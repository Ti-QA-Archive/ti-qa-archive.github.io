			<p>Clean install. But now I feel sort of like my new MTB has had its chainstay messed up by a rock or two.</p>
<p>Windows 64. </p>
<p>Android module cannot be created because their is space between the work path please create in check the path or create another workspace(something). </p>
<p>I went in config.ini and directed it to a new workspace in my documents and it did not work.</p>
<p>I then created a workspace directly off of c: and whollla it worked. Interestingly, I imported Kitchensink and it installed to the TitaniumWorkspace I created in My Documents without any problems.</p>
<p>Minor issue and I did not issue a ticket. I am happy to be here. I appreciate Titanium offering their sweat and knowledge for me to learn coding. For free. Having written this, what is this?</p>
<p>I could not get a log file out of titanium studio.</p>
