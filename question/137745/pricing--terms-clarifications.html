			<h1>Pricing &amp; Terms clarifications.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I know there have been some questiones floating around about pricing and I understand that Appcelerator might be working on the best way to charge for their GREAT product but until the pricing is on the site and clear I would just like to know some specifics about the plans and terms that come along with them.</p>
<p>Can you create apps that make revenue using titanium &amp; ACS with a free account? (Either building paid app for appstore or creating a SaaS that hast a Titanium App)</p>
<p>Can you create apps that make revenue using titanium &amp; ACS, paying for your ACS consumption but remaining on a Community Account?</p>
<p>I just want to understand completely the implications of using ACS along with a community account.  I think appcelerator should charge for the service and would gladly pay to use ACS  and Titanium mobile but at the same time I would then compare with all the alternatives (Stackmob, Parse) in terms of pricing and capabilities. </p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>I have talked directly with their sales department and I was told that you can make and sell apps for totally free, no matter if you are an individual or a corporation. The only thing that help them make money (and hence this keep wonderful project alive) is their support plans (you can subscribe and once you have a problem you can open a ticket which they will resolve for you) and also from partnership programs.</p>
<p>If you are not paying for support then the only source for help is the open community … (this Q&amp;A and of course other resources from the web).</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>
