			<h1>ACS Settings not saving..typical?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I created an app in ACS, and when I&#39;m configuring it, I uploaded my dev&#x2F;prod iOS certificates, and I set my Android package name.  When I save it, it says its saved, but the Android section is always blank, ad the iOS defaults to the Development one.  Is this typical, or should it be showing my saved changes?</p>

							<p>Should show the changes. But the ios and android is different section which you save ios part by clicking &#39;Save Push Certificate Changes&#39;, and android &#39;Save Android Push Configuration Changes&#39;. Unfortunately you have to save it by clicking each section&#39;s save button.</p>

										<p><p>Apparently there was a bug in ACS.  My App didnt have a production&#x2F;development toggle, deleteing the app and making a new one made it work, and the settings are saved.</p>
<p>Another question, does push work on the Android&#x2F;iOS simulators?  My Android one is registered (shows one Android app registered, but when I send a notification, the emulator doesnt do anything).</p>

										<p><p>The app which doesn&#39;t have production&#x2F;development toggle, means that the app was created before we had production&#x2F;development feature. So that you had a selection to choose between production&#x2F;development. I asked other dev(push) for the push issue.</p>

										<p><p>Did they just change it today?  Because I made the one without the toggle about 2 hours ago.</p>

										<p><p>No problem.  I also created the app in Chrome (the initial one), the second one I did in Safari, maybe theres something there.</p>
