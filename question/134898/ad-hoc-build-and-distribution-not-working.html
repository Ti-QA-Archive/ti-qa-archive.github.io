			<h1>Ad Hoc build and distribution NOT working?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi everybody,<br>I need to build an app for ADHOC distribution for iOS 5. I&#39;m on XCode 4.2.1 &#x2F; Lion 10.7.3.</p>
<p>I get a weird error when I try to launch the &quot;Distribute - Ad Hoc&quot; function from Titanium Studio (my actual version: 2.0.1.201204021825)</p>
<p>After the initial wizard the build starts and quite immediately stops with this error:</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[ERROR] Error: Traceback (most recent call last):<br>  File &quot;&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx&#x2F;1.7.6.v20111114104114&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;builder.py&quot;, line 759, in main<br>    pp = os.path.expanduser(&quot;~&#x2F;Library&#x2F;MobileDevice&#x2F;Provisioning Profiles&#x2F;%s.mobileprovision&quot; % appuuid)<br>UnboundLocalError: local variable &#39;appuuid&#39; referenced before assignment</p>
<p>It seems a problem with Titanium build script. It happens no matter which mobile SDK i build against (1.7.6, 1.8.1, 1.8.2 …)</p>
<p>I think I correctly made all my homework with certificates and so on.</p>
<p>Is it just me or anybody managed to make an AdHoc build with a similar configuration?</p>
<p>Please help me, this drives me nuts.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Alessandro</p>

							<p>The issue is that any Titanium Mobile SDK less than 2.0.0 does not support the &quot;Distribute - Ad Hoc&quot; function. Titanium Studio should prevent you from using that option if your SDK is set incorrectly.</p>
<p>If you need to do an Ad Hoc distribution on an earlier version, the Xcode approach is the easiest way.</p>

							<p>why don&#39;t you just compile it and distribute it through xcode and the Application Loader? IMO it&#39;s simplier and faster.</p>

							<p>Alberto, thank you for your prompt answer.</p>
<p>This is what I am trying to do right now but in any case manually building from Xcode has some drawbacks (first of all the multi-language resource files don&#39;t get correctly referenced when you directly open the Xcode project file and so on). For my project this way of building requires a lot of manual fixes. I don&#39;t find this process faster and simpler than clicking an icon in Titanium Studio but maybe I&#39;m doing something wrong with XCode. Are you able to directly open a multi-language Titanium generated project from Xcode, build it like it is and ending app with a correctly localized app?</p>
<p>I am very interested in knowing if the issue I have with Titanium Studio is something related to some my misconfiguration or it is (like I think) a bug of the platform.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Alessandro</p>

										<p><p>I actually had some issues in the past with localizing the app, it was kinda random when the different languages were loaded in the app and when they weren&#39;t. I haven&#39;t been using the i18n for a while, so I couldn&#39;t tell you exactly. You&#39;re not alone for sure.<br>For me opening the xcode project and gettin the binary file for the market is a couple of clicks more that just that one click. I don&#39;t have to hack anything manually though.</p>

							<p>For lesser than 2.0.0 Titanium SDK ad-hoc distribution :<br>1) Click on publish menu, select publish to itunes option,<br>2) Distribute window will pop up configure your distribution, provisioning certificate and SDK version<br>3) Now system will ask for user name and password for system to access keychain(Dont panic if it asks for more than once)<br>4) X-code will open automatically, from corner of window go to organizer menu and then archive menu.<br>5) Your new ipa will be visible there<br>6) Now distribute it with the option in right it will ask for three options select ad-hoc for deployment<br>7) Select next to give code signing authority on next it will ask for location to save ipa<br>8) Thats it drop the ipa in itunes under apps sync your iphone and drag the ipa to iphone&#39;s app in itunes.</p>
