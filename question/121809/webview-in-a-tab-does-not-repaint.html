			<h1>WebView in a Tab does not repaint</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve got a BlackBerry app that uses a TabGroup to show a bunch of tabs that contain WebViews.  It all works great on the first pass through each of the tabs.</p>
<p>When you click back to a tab for a second time, the window is blank.</p>
<p>If I use a standard View instead of a WebView (as they do in the Kitchen Sink example), it works perfectly.  The problem is limited to WebViews.</p>
<p>Is there some hack I can use to force the WebView to Repaint once that tab loads?  Maybe an event that triggers the repaint?  I&#39;m just not certain how to implement it.</p>

										<p><p>I wish I could help you Emiliano, but I can&#39;t.</p>
<p>Appcelerator has not fixed the problem.</p>
<p>Appcelerator has not issued an updated SDK in months.</p>
<p>Appcelerator could not give me an ETA for when a new SDK would be made available.</p>
<p>After spending weeks on the problem, and going so far as to try and create my own tab system using buttons that look like tabs, and views I painted myself, I finally gave up and went to <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phonegap.com">PhoneGap</a>.</p>
<p>My personal opinion is that Appcelerator has lost focus on the BlackBerry platform.  They&#39;ve been in Beta for over a year, and don&#39;t seem to want to talk about it publicly.  I wouldn&#39;t use Titanium for a production BlackBerry App.</p>

							<p>Thank you Bryan.<br>I&#39;m valuating myself phonegap because i&#39;m looking for a multi-target development tool.<br>I&#39;ve read in google about pros &amp; cons, titanium VS phonegap.. But i&#39;d like to have my personal experience, starting from titanium.<br>..and it&#39;s not a great start.<br>One week to set a pc and a mac developmemt enviroment and now i&#39;m able to run in emulators a simple app on both hardware.<br>I think titanium it&#39;s powerfull but it&#39;s too hard to setup, docs are outdated and you spend too much time to understand system bugs instead of code bugs.<br>Maybe tomorrow i&#39;ll start the phonegap adventure.<br>I don&#39;t like very much his on-line compiler. Too slow for rapid testing&#x2F;developing in a real workflow..<br>What do you think about?<br>Have you made some test&#x2F;apps?<br>Which development IDE have you adopted?<br>I&#39;ve read that phonegap apps don&#39;t feel so &quot;native&quot; as titanium apps. Are you agree?<br>I appreciate your help and suggestion.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Emiliano</p>
<p>P.s. Sorry for my &quot;italian&quot; English ;)</p>

										<p><p>Titanium is superior than PhoneGap from a technical perspective.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, at least for the BlackBerry, it doesn&#39;t work.  That makes PhoneGap the better option.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, PhoneGap just makes a simple app with a browser window in it.  From there you use basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make the app work.  Anything you can do with the web, you can do in your app.  You make the controls, the content and the navigation.  For me, that was enough.</p>
<p>You can compile PhoneGap locally.  You don&#39;t need their cloud service.  It&#39;s all command line, but it works well.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

										<p><p>can you post the actual code you are using to pastebin or gist? You said it is pretty simple so lets take a look.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;d rather not do that for two reasons.</p>
<p>First, I mentioned PhoneGap because I was not able to accomplish what I want with Titanium.  Continuing to discuss a competitive product on this forums is not appropriate.  There are plenty of other resources if you search the web.</p>
<p>Second, and equally important, the code was developed for a client.  I am not at liberty to share it without their consent.</p>
<p>Sorry I can&#39;t be of more help, but a quick Google search will give plenty of examples.</p>
