			<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been trying to work with Titanium for a couple days now but can&#39;t seem to get it working. (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;96051&#x2F;unable-to-run-apps-on-iphoneandroid-emulators)</p>
<p>Was wondering if there is any tutorial&#x2F;guide on how to properly install Titanium and all the requirements to get it working fine.</p>
<p>Also, I have a couple questions to make:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Titanium for mobile development doesn&#39;t offer an IDE, right? So I should just use Eclipse or something like that to write the JavaScript code?</p>
</li>
<li><p>I&#39;ve seen people answering questions saying things like renaming folders, copying files, creating new projects and pasting files… <em>&quot;dirty&quot;</em> fixes like those. Do I really have to do those to get Titanium working or has anyone managed to get it <strong>working easily on the first try</strong>?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>PS: I&#39;m using Titanium SDK 1.5.1 (1.2.0 has been tried) and iOS SDK 4.0, 4.1 and 4.2 have been tried. None worked. </p>

							<p>For most people the steps are as follows:</p>
<p>*Make sure XCode is installed for osx.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download Titanium from appcelerator.com</li>
<li>Install Titanium.</li>
<li>Run Titanium, it will find an update for the Titanium itself.</li>
<li>It will also download the latest mobilesdk</li>
<li>Create a project.</li>
<li>Compile and run in emulator.</li>
<li>If you want to run on device, this is where you have to follow the on-screen messages carefully. But basically:</li>
<li>Get all your provisioning set up with apple and in your keychain.</li>
<li>Load those files into Titanium via the Run on Device tab.</li>
<li>It will compile and drop in iTunes. For me, I take the .IPA and move it to another computer where I still sync my phone. Sync. </li>
</ol>
<p>Now this is for OSX, maybe someone can chime in for Windows but I imagine it&#39;s very close to the same. Only a limited few have problems getting it working on the first try I would say.</p>

										<p><p>Yeah, I&#39;m using OS X and I have the latest XCode installed (1.2.5). I&#39;m an iOS developer trying to work with multi-platform with Titanium now.</p>
<p>The first time I installed Titanium (I just re-installed it) it updated itself, I created a project and tried to run it, but it gave me an error (detailed on the link in the main post).</p>
<p>I can&#39;t run my projects on iPhone or Android.</p>
