		<section>
			<p>I installed and configured Titanium Studio 1.0.6 with the 1.7.6 SDK.  I can run the TestProject in an emulator.  If I &quot;Install to device&quot; (using my Galaxy Nexus) it does install the app.  But running the app fails with an &quot;Unfortunately, TestProject has stopped&quot;.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve had no issues running an app I built using Corona or running native apps I&#39;ve built.</p>

							<div><p>The challenge I am feeling is whether all this effort just to get Titanium working is worth it.  I don&#39;t have to do ANY of this extra crap in other environments.  I have built several PhoneGap apps which just work.  Nothing special needs done.  Am I going to see something spectacular from Titanium when (if) I get it working on my system?  Does it provide significant performance improvements?  Does it provide a better development API?  Right now, I am really questioning whether it is worth the effort.</p>

							<p><strong>Resolved</strong>: I can now run the TestProject app on both the emulator and on a device (Galaxy Nexus).  <strong>Steps</strong>: I uninstalled Titanium.  I then downloaded the new Titanium and installed it in a completely different location (C:\Titanium Studio).  I ran it and then updated to get the new SDK (1.8).  I deleted the existing TestProject and created a new one.  I made no changes and just ran it on the emulator and then installed it to a device.  And it worked.  <strong>Interesting note</strong>:  The TestProject APK is now twice as large as it used to be.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks to Ben Bahrenburg for suggesting I try the 1.8 SDK.  I wonder why it works but the 1.7.6 would not.  Oh well, it works - that&#39;s what matters.</p>
