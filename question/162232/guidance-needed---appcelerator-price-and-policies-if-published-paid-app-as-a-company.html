							<p>Hi</p>
<p>This question is coming up way too often.</p>
<p>In short;</p>
<ul>
<li>Analytics; free for a period, longer you pay for - if you do not want to pay there are free modules that hook into Google Analytics - which work great</li>
<li>Push - free until you have used 5 million a month, then you pay (at this point you are clearly very successful), but again there are other services that you can use that offer different amount for different values - again via modules</li>
<li>Maps; - nope, the only time you may have to pay is on Android is you use so much you must be raking it in 0 and this is paid to Google - seriously you would have to be using a significant amount</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically if you only want the free version - cool, if yo want or need to extra value that is provided by the paid version - then go for that.  Start with free and go paid later on - or don&#39;t - your choice.  If your app empire is going to be big and you need support and services beyond the standard offering then of course you need paid.</p>
<p>This is one of the many answers I have given on the subject, it is very detailed;</p>

										<p><p>Just as a follow up about &quot;does Appcelerator expect money from our clients&quot;.</p>
<p>There was a very short period when misinformation from a unit of Appcelerator outside of the US made it look like this was the case - this was wrong.  However common sense needs to be in place here as I will explain below.</p>
<p>If you set up shop providing apps to clients and those clients are big, so they need the back end services of Appcelerator Cloud, support and much more then there will be a charge.  Appcelerator work in the same way as many other companies that those services are sold as a licence to the end client - because it is they that require these extra requirements.</p>
<p>So if you have 20 client, 18 small and never get anywhere near the big numbers required to make it a need to swap over to Appcelerator paid - cool no charges.  But those other 2 who are certainly big enough to require these extras then there is a licence required for each separate fro each other as they are two distinct entries.</p>
<p>Nothing will be asked of your clients directly, they are your clients - but if their needs require the change you will be asked to engage with your clients so that they can continue without issues.</p>
<p>Keep in mind we are talking enterprise level needs here.</p>
