			<h1>Performance of ACS Push Notifications Notify</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I wrote a server method to send push notification (with the ACS notify rest api) in C# using HttpWebRequest and another in Sql Server with sp_OACreate &#39;MSXML2.XMLHTTP&#39;.  </p>
<p>I send 100 notifications in a loop, and both have performance that varies between 30sec to 4min.  This is way too slow for us since we will need to send thousands every minute in our peaks.</p>
<p>So I was wondering if there is something on my end that I&#39;m not doing right, or is this the expected performance for the Appcelerator rest api?</p>

							<p>if you want to send to 100 devices at once , you should put them in a channel and push to that channel instead . then it is only 1 api call instead of 100</p>

										<p><p>Well, we will have thousands of different channels with many client per channel, and each channel will need to receive a different message.<br>So I still need to send many different pushes.</p>

										<p><p>the rest api call should be very fast. perhaps you can check the c# implementation and see why it would take up to 4 mins. If you try with a simple curl command, how long would it take?</p>

										<p><p>Perhaps you can provide your implementation. if you can translate them into curl formation, that would really help.</p>

										<p><p>I put this in a batch file, and it took 2.5 minutes to execute.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">curl -b cookies.txt -c cookies.txt -<span class="hljs-literal">F</span> <span class="hljs-string">"login=[email]"</span> -<span class="hljs-literal">F</span> <span class="hljs-string">"password=[pass]"</span> https://api.cloud.appcelerator.com/v1/users/login.json?key=[mykey]
<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> /L %%x <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> (<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">100</span>) DO curl -b cookies.txt -c cookies.txt -<span class="hljs-literal">F</span> <span class="hljs-string">"channel=test5"</span> -<span class="hljs-literal">F</span> <span class="hljs-string">"to_ids=everyone"</span> -<span class="hljs-literal">F</span> <span class="hljs-string">"payload=test"</span> https://api.cloud.appcelerator.com/v1/push_notification/notify.json?key=[mykey]
</code></pre><p>So curl seems to be about the same speed as my C# implementation.  Maybe you can try to see how long it takes on your end.</p>

										<p><p>why do you need to login everytime? once you logged in you can reuse the same session to call notify.json. You can login as an app admin.</p>
