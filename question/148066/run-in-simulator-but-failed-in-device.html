			<h1>Run in Simulator but failed in Device</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m trying to test my app in my device but when I run the app I get this message:</p>
<p><strong>Could not find the file app.js</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;m using the latest xcode version( 4.6 )</p>
<p>my iPhone version is 6.0</p>
<p>I run in both simulators 5.1 and 6.0 and works… only in my device that I get this error…</p>
<p>anyone knows anything about it? Titanium isn&#39;t yet compatible with iOS 6?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>i had the same problem today (also using latest xcode version)<br>i don&#39;t know the reason, why the file app.js was missing. but i recreated it from a new alloy project and now everything works fine again. (simulator and device)<br>so just keep a backup around in case, this happens again.</p>
