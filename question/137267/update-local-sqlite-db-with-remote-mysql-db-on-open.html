			<h1>Update Local SQLite db with remote MySQL db on open</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a number of questions, but if anyone could answer just one of them, it would really be very, very helpful. :)</p>
<p>Okay, I have a MySQL database on a remote server that I would like to use to update a pre-populated SQLite database on the app (for users with no network connection).</p>
<p><strong>My chronological thought process:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Install SQLite database on app (Ti.Database.install)</li>
<li>Make xhr request to a remote PHP script every time app is opened</li>
<li>In script, grab all changed db rows since last update and return them</li>
<li>Parse JSON response containing changed rows</li>
<li>update local db with new rows</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>My questions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Does anything standout as completely wrong from my above order?</li>
<li>How would I know if the local db is already up-to-date? <ul>
<li>Possibly have &#39;version&#39; table with &#39;lastUpdated&#39; column, check for match on server side?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>With the returned data, how would I know whether a row is completely new or has simply been altered?<ul>
<li>Would it be best simply to delete (replace) the row if it already exists?<br>I don&#39;t mean to seem like I&#39;m answering my own questions. These are just possibilities I thought of, but I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m even going about this syncing approach the right way. Any help&#x2F;answers would be greatly appreciated! :)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

							<p>The beste way to find out wheter a record is an update or an insert;<br>Add 2 additional fields in your table &quot;creation_date&quot; and &quot;modification_date&quot;<br>The creation date should be set when creating the record and the modification date should be updated each time the record is changed (duhh)</p>
<ol>
<li>Store the last sync. time  (Return this value from your server as this value can be changed from the users device) in your local database (sqLite)<br>Send this value with the xhr request and fetch the changed&#x2F;created records since the last sync.</li>
</ol>
<p>You could split up the data in 2 array elements &quot;update&quot; and &quot;insert&quot;<br>Convert the data to JSON and return the data as response.</p>
<p>With this method you can process the update and insert queries individually which wil help you for better permormance.</p>
<p>Have a look at sqLite UNION for combining multiple queries at once. This will increase the performance when inserting a large amount of records.</p>
