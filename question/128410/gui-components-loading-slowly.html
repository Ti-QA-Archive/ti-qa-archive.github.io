			<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>So I have that 600 line .js file that loads a simple form within a table view (to have something similar as the contact app when you edit your contact info).</p>
<p>On the simulator, everything works well but once on the device, it takes like 2 seconds to load the window and during this time, nothing happen, it&#39;s just an empty window loading, I didn&#39;t even find a way to put an indicator there.</p>
<p>So here&#39;s my question, is there a way to load the window way faster ? Is it possible to store it&#39;s content in memory once it&#39;s been created ? is there any pattern that I should be using that would help ? I did what it says in the &quot;Forging Titanium&quot; serie with the UI library but it takes pretty much the same time to render.</p>
<p>on an iPhone 4S, it loads as expected, probably because it has more memory and a better CPU than my iPhone 3Gs.</p>

							<p>Think you summed it up yourself. Displaying anything will take time. either reduce the amount of data you process or split it into chunks…</p>

										<p><p>Maybe it takes a lot of time to parse because there&#39;s a lot of line in the same file and that splitting the code into multiple files would help ? using kind of a view and a controller ?</p>

										<p><p>Any suggestion for the android as that take even a lot more time to display the data, I know that using V8 compiler will solve the problem. Can you tell me when it comes with the titanium sdk?</p>
