			<p>Has anyone managed to create a module wrapping ActionBarSherlock for Android?  This is a very popular Android library providing full ActionBar features and compatibility back through version 2.2.</p>
<p>Thanks, John</p>

<p>You are not the first to ask this one;</p>

</ul>
<p>It is also mentioned in a JIRA, in the hopes it would see some traction, but so far nothing.  This ticket has since been closed with no movement on the suggestion.</p>

										<p><p>BTW there is NOTHING wrong with creating an app that has visual differences between Android 2.x and Android 4.x.  This is expected behaviour, some companies try their best to make everything look the same - but you have to remember your 2.x user does not have 4.x so they are expecting 2.x UI not 4.x UI.</p>
<p>This is the same for iOS&#x2F;Android.  The common wisdom is to create an app that performs the same functions but honours the UI of each device.  It is not fair to the Android users to thrust iOS on them and the same is true of iOS apps looking like Android apps.</p>
<p>The same code is used underneath, the actionbar&#x2F;menu code is almost the same.  As long as you create modular code, split up into functions and call as required you really have very little extra effort required.</p>

										<p><p>I agree with everything you have said.</p>
<p>My desire is to try to maintain two UI designs; one for iOS and one for Android. I would rather not have to have a different design for pre-4.0 Android to minimize development and testing. I also don&#39;t want to abandon those that are still on pre-3.0 since they still represent about 1&#x2F;3 of the embedded base.</p>
<p>My feeling is that Appcelerator is not giving Android all of the love that they give to iOS. I know they started with iOS, but Android is clearly as important a target platform as iOS and is likely to be more important in the future. I don&#39;t expect them to support ActionBarSherlock as it is a 3rd party library, but it would be great if they provided significant support for the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;tools&#x2F;support-library&#x2F;index.html">Android Support Library</a>.</p>

										<p><p>I would agree that it appears that Appcelerator does not give the Android side of things the same love as iOS.  However that is only part of the story.  Google have caused a significant number of issues by moving so wildly from 2.x to 3.x to 4.x, really poor compatibility through those UI versions.</p>
<p>Good news, they appear to have their act together with 4.x transitions, so with any luck when the 5.x jump occurs it should be handled better.</p>
<p>iOS has had much softer transitions up until iOS6.x, iOS7.x is a bigger leap, once it is out of beta we will know if it is a gentle jump or something a little harder.  Some basic things seem wrong - but might be a beta issue on either side that will be resolved.</p>

										<p><p>I would say that we can easily ignore 3.x, but I do agree there was a major shift from 2.x to 4.x.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your insights.</p>
