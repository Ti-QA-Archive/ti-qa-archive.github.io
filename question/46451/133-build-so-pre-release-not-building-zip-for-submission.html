			<h1>1.3.3 build (so pre-release) not building zip for submission</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I downloaded the latest continuous build and it seems to work for me in the simulator, installing onto my development devices but doesn&#39;t build the zip at the end of building for distribution.</p>
<p>I know this is pre-release software, but maybe this will help the dev team.</p>
<p>Basically, looking at my build.log</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">** BUILD SUCCEEDED **

+ Looking <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> <span class="hljs-type">application</span> binary <span class="hljs-keyword">at</span> /Users...

Writing archive plist <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span>: /Users...

{'CFBundleIdentifier': 'com....

Finishing build
</code></pre><p>And then no .zip file is made.</p>
<p>The issue is also noted here in one of the comments on a comment:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;46391&#x2F;140-release-date</p>
<p>I shortened the log lines above but would be happy to send whatever is helpful to anyone at appcelerator.</p>
<p>Hope this is helpful info.</p>
<p>Steve</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Daniel. Is that the latest build from here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;index.html</p>
<p>I&#39;d believe I was doing something wrong, but I just don&#39;t know what. Have successfully made many apps before…</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve notice that too, guess it depends which build of 1.3.3 you&#39;re using for whether it creates the zip file or not.  The build I tried a week and a half ago would not create the zip so to get an app update out I ended up just switching to 1.3.2.</p>
<p>Thought I read something about some changes needing to be made to how apps are compiled to conform with some recent Apple changes, but I don&#39;t remember the specifics now.  Try grabbing a new build out of git, it seems to be working okay now.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the input Dan - Here&#39;s a little more info. I was trying with a build from 9am (eastern) this morning. I also just tried with the latest (4:45 pm eastern) and got the same result.</p>
<p>Also, as to what happens: The build happens, takes a minute or two, then the Mac switches focus to Xcode like it&#39;s going to do something. Then the process is over and no app .zip file.</p>

										<p><p>Steve, when all thing failed. I would clear Xcode cache, and restart machine. There&#39;s a lot users complained about that on native build xcode compilation, it&#39;s the Xcode thing not 3rd compiler btw.</p>

							<p>Hi Steve, i really hate this Community Q&amp;A thing, it doesn&#39;t email you if someone reply as comment. So i will just post a new reply… LOL. TI Should not have killed the old Forum support, this Q&amp;A thing is the worst community system, ever! </p>
<p>Anyway,</p>
<p>I grabbed mine from here, it marked 2 weeks ago, a much older build.<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;42891&#x2F;133</p>

							<p>Daniel - Unfortunately I need to use a newer build. It looks like some changes in more recent builds on github are to address issues Apple had when people submitted apps.</p>
<p>But thanks for that link anyway.</p>
