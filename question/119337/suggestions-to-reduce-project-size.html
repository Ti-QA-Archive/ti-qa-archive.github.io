			<p>Hi TItanium Dev team!</p>
<p>It has been noted that even the smallest XCode Project generated by Appcelerator takes 3MB and it&#39;s understandable while it includes EVERY FILE and EVERY FRAMEWORK.</p>
<p>What I would suggest you to split the entire architecture into modules(Similar to DoJoKit etc) where modules are included on demand. There should be a base Module which must be included with every project which contains all the core files required to run the project. Other than that all UI and non-UI modules like Accelerometer etc should be included when needed. This would really help to reduce the project size and decrease build time.</p>

							<p>Is 3mb that big a deal in the end?  My ipad app is about 11 mb, and it takes about 30 seconds to compile initially when testing it, then about 2 seconds after that when testing.</p>

							<p>I think this is a concern, I developed an application with some images and total size of my resources directory is around 6 MB, and the size of build is about 16 MB.</p>

							<p>I experienced such frightning apk-sizes too. A simple webview container with shortcut-buttons, 100kb Javascript + 100kb images files = 7MB apk! Built with titanium 1.8.2 or 2.x<br>I found two packages of the v8 runtime inside apk and tried to build my app for Rhino. This reduced the total size down to 1.6 MB.</p>

										<p><p>do you mean building app using Rhino instead of V8? It is said V8 is much faster in performance(and I tested also)</p>
