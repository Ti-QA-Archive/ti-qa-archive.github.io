			<h1>ondatastream not firing on iOS</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Does anyone know if there are plans to fix the ondatastream event in iOS?  In Android, it correctly reports bytes downloaded though I&#39;d like to see a percentage value as works in posting a file with onsendstream.  However, iOS ajax.ondatastream only fires once, at the end with a value of 1.  So my users sit there looking at &quot;Loading…&quot; for 2 minutes on a larger file with no indication that anything is working.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve seen numerous posts about this issue, some from literally two years ago!  I too, would like to have progress of downloads without having to resort to kludgey workarounds or explicitly controlling the cardinal position of event handlers assigned to ajax object which none seem to work anyway.</p>
<p>My code is exactly like any number of posts asking about the problem in the past in terms of structure.</p>
<p>Any advise?  Thanks!</p>

<p>Um;</p>
<ol>
<li>Is there an open JIRA?</li>
<li>If there isn&#39;t a JIRA open, have you thought about submitting one?</li>
<li>You mentioned &#39;your code is the same as everyone elses&#39;, that seems like an excuse not to actually submit a complete and valid question.</li>
<li>You left out a truckload of information that would be expected with a complete and valid question worth an experts time.</li>
</ol>
<p>–</p>
<p>Missing from your question are a number of important pieces of information. I suggest you take a look at the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Using+Questions+and+Answers">Using Questions and Answers</a> article, specifically the Q&amp;A Question Checklist.  The missing information is critical to reproducing problems in a test environment and often indicates other factors that cause the undesirable outcome you are experiencing.</p>

							<div><p>Really?  And what &quot;truckload of information&quot; is missing?  People have been posting about this bug for two years!  I experienced the problem as described above, searched Q&amp;A and saw post after post describing the same problem, exactly as I am experiencing.  </p>
<p>Just look at any one of post after post going back two years on the subject and you&#39;ll see quite enough code, but no indication of a fix.</p>
<p>I was just curious if anyone knew if Appcelerator thought it was important enough to fix a long standing bug in a very core part of the toolset&#39;s functionality.  I don&#39;t need code snippets showing me how to make it work, I already KNOW it doesn&#39;t work and won&#39;t work without yet another kludgey workaround.</p>
