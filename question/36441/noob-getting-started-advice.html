			<p>I seem to be struggling with development much more than I expected, which is surprising since I am quite familiar with several languages, including java and groovy, and have been developing apps for 30+ years. I am probably a journeyman or less when it comes to javascript, however. Sure, I can read what others have written, can easily write fairly decent, if somewhat simple, functions myself for deployment on web clients. However, I do not have in-depth knowledge of any particular frameworks. When I try things in Titanium and refer to the API docs, it seems information is lacking, and I am guessing it is presumed knowledge. So, do I need to study something else to help me with my Titanium development for mobile phones? Perhaps a general primer on javascript, such as The Javascript Bible? Or, something more specific, like jQuery? I fear the former would be too basic, voluminous and would help me in the end, and that the latter might be totally irrelevant to mobile phone development. Suggestions? Thanks!</p>

							<div><p>jQuery is a close approximation of how coding is with Ti.  The main difference is that Ti uses a factory pattern which often throws people.</p>
<p>As Bryce mentioned - the demos &amp; specifically the kitchensink is a helpful resource.  The API docs are handy mostly for properties&#x2F;params and the namespace.</p>
<p>There are fairly substantial diffs between what works on the iPhone &amp; Android - so if you&#39;re doing cross-platform development ensure you have the KS app available in both emulators as a reference.<br>Trust the KS over the API docs - it&#39;s working code for a start &amp; method&#x2F;namespace casing is correct, whereas there&#39;s a few issues with the API docs which can throw you.</p>
<p>A handy process when you&#39;re starting is to have 2 projects - one of the app you&#39;re developing and another as a testbed.  Use the testbed when you&#39;re having a specific problem that you want to debug - it&#39;ll save you from polluting your app as you figure out the issue.  Building the UI is currently very verbose - so it&#39;s easy to tangle yourself up in JS.</p>
<p>Before you go down inevitable route of creating your own wrappers or building helpers for you app - make sure you&#39;ve built 5-8 screens and feel comfortable with a breadth of Ti elements.  There are many places to slip up and you&#39;ll save yourself a lot of time.  Currently debugging essentially boils down to try&#x2F;catch &amp; debug.writeln.</p>

							<div><p>Ah - just remembered something that also trips people up.  Ti is pretty much async so you&#39;ll need lean the event system fairly heavily with built-in &amp; custom events.<br>It&#39;s pretty reliable but doesn&#39;t support chaining events of the same name (so you can&#39;t have 2 event handlers on the same object for &quot;open&quot;), sometimes has issues with delegates and while you can pass objects between what&#39;s firing the event and the event handler, only data properties are exchanged, methods aren&#39;t.  So you&#39;ll need to pass ID&#39;s around and then reference the source data if you attach methods to your own objects.</p>

							<p>I agree, the docs are extremely lacking. I figured most of the api&#39;s out by looking at the test apps on github. Take a look at it.</p>
