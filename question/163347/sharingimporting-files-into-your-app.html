			<h1>Sharing/Importing files into your app</h1>

			<p>Hi all, I&#39;m trying to find out if it is possible to import files from other apps to my app.</p>
<p>For example when you click the icon when viewing a photo in the photo app, it allows you to share it to places like &quot;Messages, Mail, iCloud, Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, Dropbox&quot;</p>
<p>I was wondering if there was a way I can add this functionality into the app so users can import photos&#x2F;files from other applications, such as Mail etc.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>Short answer is, on iOS, no you can&#39;t realistically make other apps &quot;share to your app.&quot;</p>
<p>Longer answer, it&#39;s possible, but unlikely and probably not going to work the way I think you&#39;re asking. </p>
<p>On iOS, you can create and publish a URL scheme, which is essentially an address for your app. Other apps can use that URL scheme to launch your app and pass data to it. But the apps have to be specifically written to share to apps through the explicit use of the URL scheme.</p>
<p>There is no central registry of these URL schemes. So, unless your app hits the big time, few will know of and use your URL scheme. Thus, it&#39;s unlikely Mail, Facebook, etc will ever enable sharing to your app.</p>
<p>On iOS, you can register document handlers. This is analogous to your desktop operating system environment where Microsoft Word registers that it is the app to handle docx files. You can&#39;t register to be the handler for common &#x2F; built-in file types, like JPG files on iOS. But, if you had some special file format your app worked with, you could register to handle that. Any app that manipulated such files (e.g. Dropbox) could in then pass such files to your app for handling. This doesn&#39;t seem to be what you&#39;re asking for.</p>
<p>On iOS (Android too), apps are sandboxed meaning you cannot access another app&#39;s files. iOS in particular is not a file oriented operating system. So, there&#39;s no real notion of file sharing, file system explorers, etc. So, there&#39;s no way to directly read the files saved by another app.</p>
<p>You do have access to the gallery picker, which would let users retrieve (aka import) photos from their photo stream into your app.</p>

							<p>I think it is worth mentioning that in iOS when you receive the requested file into your app it will be placed in a <strong>inbox</strong> folder. Your have to remember to maintain this folder your self (ie. house cleaning).</p>
<p>This information escaped me for a while. Easy to work with when you know it ;)</p>
<p>I do not belive that you can &quot;open with&quot; pictures from photos, so here you need to create access directly via Titanium.Media</p>
<p>In your APP your will have a create an eventlistner for resumed, so your APP will handle the incomming file.</p>
<p>Good luck with your project</p>
