							<p>If you are just trying to get a copy of a database on another machine, then I would suggest just sending the database file itself to the other machine.  The database should be closed when you do this.</p>
<p>The path to the database, and the actual filename extension is different on each platform.  You still didn&#39;t mention if you are doing a desktop application or mobile, and which platforms.  I have not used the desktop product or the blackberry beta, but for iOS and android I use the following logic to locate the database file itself.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-title">var</span> dbName = <span class="hljs-string">'myDatabase'</span>;
<span class="hljs-title">var</span> dbPath;
<span class="hljs-title">var</span> dbFile;
<span class="hljs-title">if</span> ( Ti.Platform.osname == <span class="hljs-string">'android'</span> ) {
    <span class="hljs-title">dbPath</span> = <span class="hljs-string">'file:///data/data/'</span> + Ti.App.getID() + <span class="hljs-string">'/databases/'</span>;
    <span class="hljs-title">dbFile</span> = Ti.Filesystem.getFile( dbPath + dbName ); 
}
<span class="hljs-title">else</span> {
    <span class="hljs-title">dbPath</span> = Ti.Filesystem.applicationSupportDirectory + <span class="hljs-string">'/database/'</span>;
    <span class="hljs-title">dbFile</span> = Ti.Filesystem.getFile( dbPath + dbName + <span class="hljs-string">'.sql'</span> );
}
</code></pre><p>You can now do whatever you want with the dbFile object reference.  For example, you may want to use it with a xhr call to upload the file to a server.  The server would need a web page where you could POST the file.</p>
<p>To restore a database, do the opposite.  Make sure you don&#39;t currently have a database with that name open, then use the above logic to determine where to place the file and what to call it.  Use xhr or whatever to download the file, and copy to the path &amp; name determined above.  You can then just issue a database open call and use the database.</p>

							<p>First, always please mention which platform(s) you are targeting.  There is nothing in the title, question, or tags to even tell us if you want to do this in a desktop or mobile application, let alone which OS(es).</p>
<p>Second, can you describe better what output you are trying to achieve?  It isn&#39;t clear if you are wanting to use something like the .dump command to produce ASCII output consisting of SQL statements that can be passed to another database engine, or if you only need a copy of the sqlite database file which can be used by sqlite elsewhere.</p>
<p>Third, it may be helpful to also know how you intend to transfer &#x2F; sync the data once &quot;exported&quot;.</p>
<p>One common reason for not getting replies to questions is because the question is too vague to attempt an answer.</p>
