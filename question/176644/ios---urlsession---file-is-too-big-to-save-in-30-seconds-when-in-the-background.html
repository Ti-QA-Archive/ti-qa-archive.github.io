			<h1>iOS - URLSession - file is too big to save in 30 seconds when in the background</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Here is the sample code from Titanium:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Ti.<span class="hljs-keyword">App</span>.iOS.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">"downloadcompleted"</span>, function(<span class="hljs-keyword">e</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Save downloaded asset</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">file</span> = Titanium.Filesystem.getFile(<span class="hljs-string">"/default.png"</span>);
    <span class="hljs-keyword">file</span>.write(<span class="hljs-keyword">e</span>.data);
});
</code></pre><p>The problem is, when the downloaded file is too large (over 1GB), the file.write() process would take more than 30 seconds. If the download is finished in the background, the app will be killed during this saving process, thus the file isn&#39;t saved correctly. iOS only allows 30 seconds in the background.</p>
<p>What should I do to solve this?</p>
<p>See <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;iOS_Background_Services">docs</a></p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I agree very strongly with Stephen.</p>
<p>If you must do this then simply use &quot;chunk management&quot;.</p>

										<p><p>chunk management like saving downloaded files in small chunks, using buffer and stream like this?</p>

</code></pre><p>This would still take too long, and both methods could cause too much memory = app crash. I don&#39;t know why. I saw it from the crash log.</p>
<p>There must be a way to download large files with iOS. Our users need to have the ability to download videos for offline use. Apple&#39;s own apps handle this very well.</p>
<p>I mean the file is downloaded without a problem. It&#39;s just with Titanium, I can&#39;t save it to the correct path. Even after this operation failed the downloaded file is still somewhere on the device. I can see that by checking the app&#39;s usage. Shouldn&#39;t there be a way to make URLSession to download the file directly to the path I want?</p>

										<p><p>You are recreating the same problem a different way, not sure why.  You have already identified the 30 seconds is restriction is too short to save the file, all you have done here is the same action but in parts.  This is not chunk management.</p>
<p>You split the source file pull it in chunks save each chunk once downloaded to the end of the previous one (you create a chain).  Given there is physically insufficient time to write one large file onto the media in 30!seconds, you reduce the chunk sizes so they are sufficiently sized to never trigger the issue, you must test the oldest slowest devices as well.  Once all parts are down then move in to whatever you want to do.</p>
<p>This is how the big boys do it.</p>

										<p><p>With URLSession module, I can&#39;t set headers, can&#39;t do range request. The only way is to literally split my source files into small chunks on the remote server? That&#39;s too much work.</p>
<p>This problem only exists using Titanium. With native sdk, the downloadcompleted delegate passes the location of the downloaded file, which you can use to save it to a different location. That takes much shorter time.</p>
<p>Titanium loaded the entire file into memory, pass this blob through an event. That&#39;s the problem.</p>
<p>However, I understand chunk management is a workaround.</p>
