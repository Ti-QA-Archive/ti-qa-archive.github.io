			<h1>Memory leak - mobile web</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have what has turned into a complex application running in a web browser (Through Titanium mobile web). We have a significant loss of memory when moving through the application and so far, have been unable to pinpoint exactly what we&#39;re doing wrong. </p>
<p>After taking a couple of heap snapshots in Chrome, I can see that a BUNCH of objects are being leaked, all possessing the _layout property. I assume this is something internal. Is there any way around this leak? Any help would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Note: not allowed to attach the snapshots that I took.</p>

							<p>Titanium Mobile Web has an undocumented feature that will save your app. It&#39;s called destroy(). All UI elements in Mobile Web have a destroy() method that disconnects all events, cleans up all DOM nodes, and removes all the instance&#39;s properties. Here&#39;s an example on how to use it:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var mybutton = Ti.UI.createButton()<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
...
mybutton.destroy &amp;&amp; mybutton.destroy()<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>iOS and Android do not support the destroy() method because both iOS and Android platforms have the ability to hook into the garbage collection system and can perform the necessary cleanup when a UI element is &quot;removed&quot;. Mobile Web cannot do this, hence the need for an explicit destroy() method.</p>

										<p><p>So we&#39;re actually calling destroy, but only on parent views. Should we be recursively calling destroy on every child of the parent view or is that taken care of for us?</p>

										<p><p>destroy() is recursive, no need to call it on the child elements. If you&#39;re still getting memory leaks, then we have a bigger problem. Without seeing your code, it will be difficult to assess the problem. Unless you can get us some sort of sample that demonstrates the leak, you&#39;re going to have to use Chrome&#39;s profile tools to find the leaks.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks a lot. I&#39;ll try to see if I can get a sample out. Currently restricted by an NDA. </p>
<p>This does help though.</p>
