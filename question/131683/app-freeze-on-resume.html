			<h1>app freeze on resume</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello, I have a problem with resume from background.<br>When I put the app in background and reopen it immediately it is starting normally but if I perform other operations while it is in background, such open and use other applications etc, when I resume my app it has a little freeze time of 1-2 seconds before to become active. In this period, if I try to move the scrollView or press a button all seems to be locked.</p>
<p>Anyone experienced the same problem?<br>Thank you</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;m having the exact same problem, it seems to be common among all Ti apps. One guess I have is that while the app is in the background it&#39;s leaking memory somehow. When it resumes, the garbage collector kicks in (and blocks the UI for reasons I don&#39;t know). This hugely affects how customers perceive the performance of our app, because they often quickly jump in and out and every time they do so feel like it&#39;s &quot;frozen&quot;. Has anyone done more testing or could we get an official response beyond &quot;please ask your question better&quot;? IMO this is critical.</p>

							<p>I had this problem when I had the Titanium Analytics enabled. It seemed to me on Resume it was using a network connection, causing quite a long pause. After disabling the Analtics in my tiapp.xml file everything was pretty much as expected.</p>
