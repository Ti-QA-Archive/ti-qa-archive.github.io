		<section>
			<p>I am createing a module for Android in Eclipse and after fixing other errors I have another which I haven&#39;t been able to resolve.  I am working in Windows 7 and have Titanium Studio, build: 2.1.2.201208301612.  When I go to build the module I recieve the error below:</p>
<p>BUILD FAILED<br>C:\Users\james\AppData\Roaming\Titanium\mobilesdk\win32\2.1.1.GA\module\android\build.xml:265: srcdir &quot;C:\Users\jbr\Development\Titanium\TestModule\build\generated\java&quot; does not exist!</p>
<p>I went to the folder and the Java folder is missing.  I assume that this folder is genertaed but I don&#39;t know what step I missed or may have failed to create this folder since it is missing and Eclipse is looking for it.  Any help would be greated appreciated.  As an aside this is my first module and I am just learning Titanium as well.<br>Thanks</p>

							<div><p>Just to get a better understanding, are you actually using Eclipse as opposed to Ti Studio? And can you give a quick step by step on how you created the module in the first place.</p>

							<div><p>Sorry, put the comment as a new comment not as a reply to yours…..Thanks for the assistance.  I created the Module in Titanium using the File &gt; New &gt; Titanim Mobile Module Project.  Then I imported what was created into Eclipse where I added my Java code.  Then I RClicked on the build.xml and did Run As.  I got some other errors at first (could not find JavaC and then Android-NDK) which I resolved.  Now I am gettingt his new error and I haven&#39;t been able find anything that says how to fix it.</p>

							<div><p>Ok, so I have tried adding the folder myself and it must be generated by Eclipse because when I rebuild the build.xml file all of the folders are recreated and the folder that I creatd is now missing.  Eclipse fails againg saying that the folder is missing as well.  I am totally stuck at this point and it appears that I am the only who has had this problem or I am not using the correct search criteria to find similar posts.  Have you heard of this error before or have any idea of what the problem is?</p>

							<div><p>I was missing the Titanium.jar file from an Eclipse folder.  I found the Titanium.jar file and put a copy in the folder and that resolved the Java folder error.  However, now I am getting the following error &quot;[exec] Error: No python executable could found in your system<br>     [exec] Result: 1&quot; and &quot;BUILD FAILED<br>C:\Users\james\AppData\Roaming\Titanium\mobilesdk\win32\2.1.1.GA\module\android\build.xml:455: C:\Users\jbr\Development\Titanium\TestModule\build\docs not found.<br>&quot; is the error after that.  Do I need to install something for Python?  I thought Titanium installed everything needed for Python or atleast that&#39;s what I thought I read in the installation document.  Or is there a plugin that I need to install to Eclipse?</p>
