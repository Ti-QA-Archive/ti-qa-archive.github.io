			<h1>Approach to Developing the Same Alloy App on an iPhone and iPad</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a question to pose to the community.  I have an application, which will have identical functionality within the iPhone and iPad versions.  I have read through the documentation, and know that within code I can specify formFactors to make the device specific views or controller specific calls (though, controller code should be fairly the same throughout each device).</p>
<p>Here is where I need guidance.  The views, much like most iPad&#x2F;iPhone views will be severely different in workflow.  I am looking to design the iPhone workflow using the scrollableView control, allowing a user to scroll mini apps, login, and use &quot;mini&quot;-fied versions of grids to view data, where-as the iPad view will have a toolbar on the top and bottom of the app at all times, with all available apps to launch on the bottom toolbar, and large grids or data within the center of the screen…major variances in the workflow&#x2F;views.</p>
<p>I know that I cannot separate formFactors into folders as I could with platforms (android&#x2F;ios), so I am afraid the formFactor conditionals could get very confusing, and since the workflows are very variant, they may not line up one to one as far as views.</p>
<p>Does any one else have similar experiences trying to do Alloy apps for both devices with major view differences?  Do you end up coding 2 separate apps?  Am I looking at this in a completely wrong approach?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for any guidance.</p>
<p>Chris</p>

							<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>It&#39;s up to you - I know that a lot of developers do release two separate versions of their apps - a HD version for iPad for example - because the user experience, like you say, on a tablet can differ a lot.</p>
<p>You&#39;re right that Alloy doesn&#39;t support separating formFactors into separate folders.</p>
<p>However, if you organise your code neatly enough it shouldn&#39;t be too much of a problem, especially if the main difference is only in the views.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a collection of links about conditional support in Alloy:</p>

										<p><p>Thank you so much for the advice and links.  I thought as much, but wanted to see how the rest of the community were tackling the issue.  I am typically very organized in code management, but since my controller functionality will be fairly reusable, I may just see if I can keep everything within one project as much as possible (and maintain organization and conditionals).</p>
<p>thank you again.</p>
