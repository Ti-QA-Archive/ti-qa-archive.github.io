			<h1>Is it possible to write files into a folder inside Resources directory?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, I&#39;m a little bit counfused reading how to use Ti.Filesystem and Ti.Filesystem.File. I have an app with some foders inside Resources directory (Resources&#x2F;img - Resources&#x2F;sound and so on). Can I write into these folders or not for example downloading new materials from Internet? Reading the official guide I saw that Ti.Filesystem.resourcesDirectory is a read-only directory corrensponding to Resources directory and Ti.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory is a read&#x2F;write dir. But how can I specify where Ti.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory points? From the book examples I can&#39;t understand. Thanks for the attention.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Short answer - no.</p>
<p>Longer answer answer;</p>
<p>As you have noted the resources folder is read-only - this is the expected behaviour.  Which means you can create or update any files in the root folder or below it.  So your examples;</p>
<ul>
<li>{appname}&#x2F;resources&#x2F; - no</li>
<li>{appname}&#x2F;resources&#x2F;img&#x2F; - no</li>
<li>{appname}&#x2F;resources&#x2F;sound&#x2F; - no</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever your app does; download content from the internet, create files on the device - they cannot be placed inside the resource folder.</p>
<p>You should be using the other folders you have access to;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Filesystem-property-applicationDataDirectory">applicationDataDirectory</a> if on IOS then ONLY user documents should be stored here</li>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Filesystem-property-applicationSupportDirectory">applicationSupportDirectory</a> iOS only - anything other than user documents should be stored here</li>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Filesystem-property-externalStorageDirectory">externalStorageDirectory</a> Android only and you should not assume it exists, it may never have existed and many devices that include external storage also allow the user to remove it</li>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Filesystem-property-tempDirectory">tempDirectory</a> use this only for files that are temporary - cached information is an example</li>
</ul>
<p>You cannot change where the applicationDataDirectory points to, there is no need it is handled by the device OS.  If your wish is to point it towards the resources folder - then despite the fact you cannot - it would still end up with a read-only folder.</p>
<p>The applicationDataDirectory is likely the location for your main files.  If the app is for IOS then your additional images and sounds sounds should be stored in the applicationSupportDirectory.  If your application is for Android only then consider using the externalStorageDirectory if available - but again it depends on what you need it for,</p>

										<p><p>Oh God… this is terrible. But this applicationDataDirectory is available only at runtime or can I use it also in Studio? In other words can I move all my stuff (img, audio) into this directiry so that I can update it from Internet when needed? Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>Terrible - interesting phrase - this is application development.</p>
<p>No ONLY the resources folder is available during development.  This is a security restriction of the platforms.  </p>
<p>If you have content inside your resources folder plus content you download from the internet you have two choices;</p>
<ul>
<li>on app first launch - copy the contents of the content into the Application Directory - considered lazy and wasteful of resources</li>
<li>know the information is in two places and retrieve from each as required - this is preferred as there is no duplication and easy enough as this is app development where you control what you show and from where.</li>
</ul>
<p>You have asked sufficient questions (I have been reviewing them) for me to believe this is something you are capable of.  Your existing questions show that you are capable of coding - you have a knowledge outside of a basic hello world app and you are clearly not a newbie.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks a lot. It was all clear. I said &#39;terrible&#39; because I&#39;m almost ready to deploy a little and funny game for Android but I have to rewrite the source portion about file management because how it is write right now forces me to do that. The fact is when I started to write I didn&#39;t know a lot about Titanium so I read a bit of thing here and there. It was better if I started to follow a course :-) Thanks again.</p>
