			<h1>Titanium Mobile 1.7 not dying on errors correctly</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Using either the Titanium Developer or Titanium Studio causes this issue. The issue is when you have a variable that doesn&#39;t exist in a call back function as part of an ajax call.  In 1.6.2 you&#39;d get the exception correctly thrown back to the console&#x2F;logs.  In 1.7.1 you see nothing and changing the logging level does nothing to change this.  It would be as if the async thread running the xhr calls isn&#39;t able to send it&#39;s error messages out.  Since my apps do a fair amount of xhr calls this is a pain.  I now I have to first build my code with 1.6.2 to ensure all the variable names and functions actually exist then recompile with 1.7.1 to make sure nothing broke between 1.6.2 and 1.7.1.</p>
<p>Please fix this Appcelerator.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one who think&#39;s he&#39;s going crazy from error messages magically not showing up in the logs when using 1.7.  Perhaps this issue is related to the requirement to pay for debugging in 1.7 with Titanium Studio?  If so then you&#39;d be best served to give out debugging for free.</p>

							<div><p>I tried to make some sample code but wasn&#39;t able to repeat it short of using my actual project&#39;s full source code.  I will continue to see if I can make the sample code necessary to show case this issue.</p>

							<div><p>John, I am guessing that there is something in your code that is causing a bug, not that there is an issue out of the box… I would try making a duplicate project and start slicing out sections of your app till the errors work correctly, then go from there… just an idea</p>
