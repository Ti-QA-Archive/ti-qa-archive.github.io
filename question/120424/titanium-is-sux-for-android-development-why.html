		<section>
			<p>Guys,</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if you all noticed this?<br>Lots of the API did not work under Android platform and lots of useful API only work under iPhone.</p>
<p>Why is this happening?</p>
<p>I thought Titanium should keep us easy while developing the app for Android and iPhone?! No?</p>
<p>Now I need to keep 2 set of codes for 2 different platforms.</p>
<p>Can you Titanium team just solve these?</p>

							<p>I think its important to applaude Appcelerator team for what they have achieved. You create a window and a window appears on two (soon three!) platforms. You can create alerts, tableviews, buttons, textviews, checkbox, bullets, text fields, tabs, progress bars, and so much more! Also, most logic is 100% cross platform! Both platforms each have specific ui advantages to them, so no, not everything is going to be cross platform. While I do agree that Android has in the past been a little neglected, they are almost up to speed with the ios development. Sure you have to put if and else statements to differ from the two platforms, but have you looked at some sample code that have been provided in apps like the KitchenSink and tweetanium.</p>
<p>Consider the following function taken from the tweetanium app:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    tt.os = function(<span class="hljs-comment">/*Object*/</span> map) {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> =</span> map.<span class="hljs-keyword">def</span>||<span class="hljs-literal">null</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">//default function or value</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (typeof map[osname] != <span class="hljs-symbol">'undefine</span>d') {
            <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (typeof map[osname] == <span class="hljs-symbol">'functio</span>n') { <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> map[osname](); }
            <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> { <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> map[osname]; }
        }
        <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
            <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (typeof <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title">==</span> '<span class="hljs-title">function</span>') {</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span>(</span>); }
            <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> { <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span>;</span> }
        }
    };
</code></pre><p>and a sample usage of it:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    <span class="hljs-filename">tt.ui.theme = {
        textColor</span>:<span class="hljs-string">'#000000'</span>,
        grayTextColor:<span class="hljs-string">'#888888'</span>,
        headerColor:<span class="hljs-string">'#333333'</span>,
        lightBlue:<span class="hljs-string">'#006cb1'</span>,
        darkBlue:<span class="hljs-string">'#93caed'</span>,
        fontFamily: <span class="hljs-filename">tt.os({
            iphone</span>:<span class="hljs-string">'Helvetica Neue'</span>,
            android:<span class="hljs-string">'Droid Sans'</span>
        })
    };
</code></pre><p>Also note that they only have 1 set of code for both iphone and android for the tweetanium apps and kitchensink. </p>
<p>So, I&#39;m not sure what your specific issue as you don&#39;t say, but I&#39;ve found titanium to be quiet easy to maintain 1  set of code.</p>

							<p>Well lets see… bonjour is a protocol built into iOS and not in android, its pretty much that simple. Is that good enough? Probably not for you. Well as I mentioned before, titanium is open source. If you want to write a bonjour module for android, I&#39;m sure the titanium community would be thankful.</p>
<p>Tell me, would you prefer titanium be a framework that did not take advantage of the uniqueness of each platform? So, no bonjour at all because it doesn&#39;t exist in android, right? Terrible logic!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve had no problems with layout attributes differing between the platforms. Are you sure you are correctly and understand how iOS handles thing with the new retina displays?</p>

							<p>ya? how sure are you ?</p>
<p>Let try on this…Ti.UI.createView + Titanium.UI.createScrollableView</p>
<p>try to set the TOP,BOTTOM,LEFT,RIGHT for the createView  and add that view into the createScrollableView(with TOP,BOTTOM,LEFT,RIGHT apply as well)… then try them on android and iphone… you will notice with the same codes it give 2 results for 2 platforms.</p>

							<p>The following code produced the image below:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var win = Titanium.UI.createWindow({<span class="hljs-string">backgroundColor:</span><span class="hljs-string">'#FFFFFF'</span>});

var view = Ti.UI.createView({<span class="hljs-string">top:</span><span class="hljs-number">20</span>,<span class="hljs-string">right:</span><span class="hljs-number">20</span>,<span class="hljs-string">bottom:</span><span class="hljs-number">20</span>,<span class="hljs-string">left:</span><span class="hljs-number">20</span>,<span class="hljs-string">backgroundColor:</span><span class="hljs-string">'#0000ff'</span>});
var scroll = Ti.UI.createScrollableView({<span class="hljs-string">top:</span><span class="hljs-number">10</span>,<span class="hljs-string">right:</span><span class="hljs-number">10</span>,<span class="hljs-string">bottom:</span><span class="hljs-number">10</span>,<span class="hljs-string">left:</span><span class="hljs-number">10</span>,<span class="hljs-string">backgroundColor:</span><span class="hljs-string">'#ff0000'</span>});

scroll.add(view);

win.add(scroll);
win.open();

<p>So, yea seems pretty awesome to me. 1 code base, two platforms, picture perfect. I&#39;m done here! Obviously you have don&#39;t want help, you just want to rant. Please, if you have any specific issues, ask in the Q&amp;A. If you feel like you found a bug, or you find some layout parameters that are NOT consistant between platforms, please follow <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Contributing+to+Titanium#ContributingtoTitanium-SubmittingBugReports">this guide and file a bug</a></p>

										<p><p>@Andrew, good job answering patiently.  I have also experienced a lot of difficulty running my application code on Android.  One major issue I had was anytime I added childviews, ie. adding a label to a button they never show up.  Also It seemed when I layered views that the eventlisteners for the bottom most view would not fire.  Do you suspect these are coding issues or does Android not support this kind of implementation the same way ios does? I have been able to circumvent most of these issues but I was curious to know if these may be known issues with Android.</p>

										<p><p>It would be great to see some code that you are having trouble with, specially the adding a label to a button, I&#39;m not sure I would do it that way. As for bottom views not firing their event listeners, are they eventlisteners on that app level or attached to that view? How many views deep are you having this problem? Also what version of titanium sdk?</p>

										<p><p>Oh and to answer your question if they are known issues with android, specifically with the bottom view new firing an event, it sounds like it could be a memory problem between android and titanium. Are you opening lots of heavyweight views&#x2F;windows on top of one another?</p>
