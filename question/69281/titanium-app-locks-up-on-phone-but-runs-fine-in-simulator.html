			<h1>Titanium App Locks up on Phone but runs fine in simulator</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a Titanium app that is feature complete and runs perfect on the simulator but locks up nearly every time I try to run it on my iPhone. </p>
<p>My only thought is that it has to be a memory issue on the phone but how am I supposed to debug that behavior if it all works great in the simulator?</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas on how to troubleshoot this problem?</p>

							<p>Since Titanium outputs an xcode project, the best way would be to open up your project in xcode and use the comprehensive in-built methods of debugging and performance measuring it provides. You won&#39;t necessarily need to understand all the code Titanium has generated, although a little understanding would help. At the very least you should be able to find out when&#x2F;why your program is crashing.</p>
<p>You should be able to find a decent tutorial on debugging somewhere. There is too much involved to go into it here.</p>
<p>Hope that helps you out.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>Angus</p>

							<p>without knowing what your app is doing or features it is using, i would say take out features, the reason it works on simulator is uses the horsepower of the computer it runs on, so when the phone runs it it doesn&#39;t have the same horsepower hence the memory problems.</p>
<p>i would concentrate on features of titanium you are using and try and optimise them eg tables, there are quite a few posts about using them and info on the blog about using classnames etc.</p>
<p>try and describe what it is actually doing, if it is loading an image or populating tables with data etc this will give the smart people on here an idea of where your problem might be.</p>
<p>hope this is of help and good luck</p>
<p>Rob</p>
