							<p>If you have everything working and no install errors maybe you should wait before installing Xcode 4? Cause right now I have Xcode 3.2.4 and there are no available updates…</p>
<p>Isn&#39;t Xcode 4 for iOS 4.2 and currently in beta?</p>

							<p>Sorry I don&#39;t understand the difference. I have iPhone SDK Version 3.2.4 (1708). This shows as I load xcode on it&#39;s first window. But, when I look at the xcode program window, it says it is using iphone simulator 4.1. And to make this more confusing, Titanium says it is using 4.1 iPhone sdk.</p>
<p>What version am I using? 3.2.4 or 4.1???</p>
<p>Maybe Titanium is using the wrong iPhone SDK, on my computer. I only show after the xcode update to have 4.1 iPhone SDK, and 3.2 iPad SDK(These are the only SDK&#39;s visible in Titanium).</p>
<p>If iPhone SDK 4.1 is the wrong version, how do I downgrade to use the other versions?</p>

							<p>Okay, I can tell you don&#39;t really know what the hell is going on, so I&#39;m going to explain what all these SDKs and version numbers are:</p>
<p><strong>3.4.2</strong> - That is the version of <em>Xcode</em> you have. Right now Xcode is on version <strong>3.4.2</strong>, which is what you are seeing when you open Xcode. That is the LATEST VERSION OF XCODE.</p>
<p><strong>4.1</strong> - This is the iOS, otherwise known as the Operating System that runs all iPhones, iPod Touches, and iPads. That is the LATEST VERSION OF iOS.</p>
<p><strong>SDK</strong> - <em>Source Development Kit</em>. iOS is a SDK and is on 4.1.</p>

							<p>Ok, but what are the various iOS SDK&#39;s that I can use to submit to apple. 4.1 does not work for me, yet! Can I use an older iOS version?</p>
<p>First off I have been asking some simple questions, and no one could at least answer the one about the SDK. I have been asking it for about 2 weeks. What am I suppose to do, buy support to ask what versions of iOS SDK that I can use. It is not like I just take input from others, without given back. If someone else has a problem that I ran across, I will gladly tell them what I did! </p>

										<p><p>It depends on whatever device you are running or APIs you are using (Since some are 4.0+ or 3.2+).</p>
<p>If your device is on iOS 3.2, then you should be using the iOS SDK 3.2.</p>

							<p>First, Thanks for your help. I really appreciate it. </p>
<p>What version(of Titanium &amp; iOS SDK) are you using to submit apps?</p>
<p>My device is currently running 4.0.2 iPhone 3G, not 3GS. iTunes is telling me that I do have an option to upgrade my device to version 4.1.</p>
<p>The only API&#39;s that I am using are (label, imageView, button, window, textbox, 2d animation matrix, 3d animation matrix, oh and sound. All of which are from Titanium.UI.</p>
<p>Right now in Titanium, all I see for available iOS SDK&#39;s are 3.2 for iPad and 4.1 for iPhone. All my other 3.x iOS SDK&#39;s have vanished from being an option in Titanium. This happened after I upgraded my xcode to the latest version.</p>
<p>Should I downgrade everything (including my device), or should I wait until my imageView issue is working and stick with iOS 4.1? Everything was working fine in Titanium 1.3, and iOS SDK 3.1</p>
<p>Thanks Again…</p>
