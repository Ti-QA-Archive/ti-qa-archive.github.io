			<h1>Background Audio (Advanced Issue)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I have an app that requires background audio. I got it to work. I play some music in the app… i make the app lose focus (i.e. i just launch another app), and the music continues.</p>
<p>That&#39;s great. </p>
<p>So, there I am with my iPhone and the music playing in the background. </p>
<p>If I double click on the iPhone Home button, what&#39;s marvelous is that I see my app in the place where the iPod player icon is.</p>
<p>Do you all know what one I&#39;m talking about? </p>
<p>You know where you double click the home button, it gives you a list of all icons &#x2F; apps that are open? If you do this and then scroll leftwards, you get the iPod player. My app icon is now there (when music is in the background).</p>
<p>As you know, there&#39;s the fix orientation button, the left button, the pause&#x2F;play button, the right button, and the app icon. </p>
<p>My question is this: </p>
<p>Whilst the app is playing background audio, these buttons do not work. I.e. I cannot stop&#x2F;play&#x2F;pause the music from this menu. </p>
<p>How does that work? </p>
<p>If I submit the app the way it is, I have a strange feeling that Apple may reject it. They&#39;ll say &quot; Oi oi oi… you&#39;ve got background music, but you need to stop the music from within the app - that needs to be corrected, unfortunately we have to reject your miserable app until this is resolved&quot;.</p>
<p>Given that I cannot bear another rejection, can someone kindly tell me how I can interface with these &quot;iPod&quot; controls??? </p>
<p>I don&#39;t care if the back button or forward button work or not.. i do not have a playlist NOR do i care for a playlist even to have them work. I just care that the stop button works. </p>

							<p>There were some SDK changes submitted a good while back that would have allowed some of what you are requesting. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_mobile&#x2F;pull&#x2F;86">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_mobile&#x2F;pull&#x2F;86</a></p>
<p>The submitter didn&#39;t submit them properly so they were never added in.  I&#39;m simply pointing them out.  Some work, some don&#39;t.  You will need to know xCode to hack it in as a lot has changed since that time.</p>

										<p><p>thanks Stephen. Oh - by the way - is there any chance of Ti SDK making function calls to work with the remote music functionality on the iPhone?</p>

							<p>Stephen,</p>
<p>Thanks. That&#39;s no issue, I already coded on Xcode before, but my root concern is this: will apple reject my app if I do not implement these controls???</p>
<p>It&#39;s awfully nice of them to provide us with these controls, but I don&#39;t even want them. No hard feelings to them, it&#39;s just me.</p>
