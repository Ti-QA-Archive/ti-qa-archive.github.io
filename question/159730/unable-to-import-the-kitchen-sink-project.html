							<p>You don&#39;t say which operating system you&#39;re developing on, but I&#39;m going to take a guess it&#39;s WIndows. git is not installed by default on Windows. You&#39;ll need to install it. Or, you can skip that and simply download the project directly from GitHub and import into Studio.</p>
<ol>
<li>Visit <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator-developer-relations&#x2F;KitchenSink">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator-developer-relations&#x2F;KitchenSink</a></li>
<li>Click the Download Zip button</li>
<li>Unzip the resulting file into your Titanium_Mobile_Workspace folder</li>
<li>In Titanium Studio, choose File, Import. Expand Titanium and select Titanium Mobile Project, then click Next.</li>
<li>Browse to your KitchenSink folder and click Finish. Accept the defaults.</li>
</ol>

										<p><p>Dear Tim,<br>Thank you for your response. I am using Windows 7 OS. I followed your instructions and managed to import Kitchen Sink. I also installed git.<br>However the Android emulator does not launch. I already made specifications in the in the AVD Manager and also updated under the &quot;Windows-Preferences tab&quot;, but am getting the error below:</p>
<p>[ERROR] :  Emulator process exited with code 1<br>[ERROR] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 1<br>[INFO] :   Project built successfully in 590ms<br>[INFO] :   Emulator not running, exiting…</p>
<p>Is there something am missing?</p>

										<p><p>Please search the Q&amp;A forums for a solution to the exit code 1 problem. I&#39;ve seen many questions on that issue, which I believe indicate a setup problem. If those solutions don&#39;t work for you, please post a new question. We encourage folks to not ask follow-up&#x2F;second questions in a thread. That makes it easier for future readers to determine if a solution was achieved or helpers like me to know whether further assistance is needed in a thread. On that note, if your original question was resolved, please mark my answer as &quot;best&quot; to close this thread.</p>

										<p><p>Verify your Python version. I&#39;ve experienced the same issue before where Python was 3.0v. After downgrading everything started working fine. To review compatibility see <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Installing_Python">here</a>.</p>
<p>Also, you may want to double check your <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Installing_the_Android_SDK">Android SDK and tools</a> are up-to-date.</p>
