			<h1>Trying to run Kitchen Sink but error says Google emulator doesn&#39;t support Google APIs????</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am just getting started with Titanium.  I am tryng to run Kitchen Sink but I see these warnings: </p>
<p>[WARN] :   Detected Titanium.Map.createView() call which requires Google APIs, but the selected emulator &quot;AVD_for_Nexus_10_by_Google&quot; does not support Google APIs<br>[WARN] :   Expect the Titanium.Map.createView() call to fail<br>[WARN] :   You should use, or create, an Android emulator that does support Google APIs</p>
<p>The emulator starts but the app doesn&#39;t run.  This is on Win 7,  Titanium 3.2.3.201404290739.  How can a Google emulator not support Google APIs?  Is there something else I have to install?  Titanium installed several additional things when I first started it and I thought I had everything, but Kitchen Sink requires the Android SDK 11 so I installed that.  I may have set the properties of the emulator wrong but I got the same error with the default emulator titanium_1_WVGA800.  I couldn&#39;t find anything about this in the docs.</p>

							<p>That helps, but I don&#39;t have any Google APIs listed on the target dropdown.  Just Android.  In trying to find out where to get them, I discovered there are several Google APIs in the c:\android-sdk-win\add-ons directory.  I have installed the Android APIs that I have by using the &quot;Install SDKs&quot; button rather than going to developer.android.com.  I tried copying them to the platforms folder but they still don&#39;t show up in the target list.  I feel I am close – what do I need to do?  Thank you!</p>

										<p><p>Great – I now have the Google APIs and I&#39;m no longer getting the original error.  But the app still won&#39;t start.  I get</p>
<p>[INFO] :   Making sure the adb server is running<br>[INFO] :   Waiting for emulator to become ready<br>[ERROR] :  Emulator failed to start in a timely manner<br>The current timeout is set to 120000 ms<br>[ERROR] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 1</p>
<p>I have tried with a couple of versions of the Google APIs, an old one and a new one, and tried running it in debug mode, but no further information about why it times out is provided.  </p>
<p>I wonder if I&#39;m still missing an essential component?</p>

										<p><p>Seems that no one wants to acknowledge the errors (or they want to remain a secret society). I for one will be using an alternative if some reasonable assistance doesn&#39;t appear soon.</p>
