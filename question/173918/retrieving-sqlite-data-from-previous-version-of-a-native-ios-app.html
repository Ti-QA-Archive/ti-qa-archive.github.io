			<h1>Retrieving SQLite Data from previous version of a native iOS App</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am writing an new version of an existing application in Titanium.<br>The current App was written in xcode and used a sqlite database.</p>
<p>How can the new Titanium version of the app, retrieve the SQLite data from the previous iOS app when the user updates?</p>
<p>And what is the best way to test this? Can I install a test app with the same app id or perhaps bundle id to simulate an update?</p>
<p>Thanks, Tom</p>

							<p>iexplorer will let you connect to an ios device and take a look at the files on the device.</p>
<p>This would let you determine the location of the older database file. </p>
<p>In your code, use the Ti.Filesystem api  back it up as a precaution first.</p>
<p>You can try to open it by its name, if that works, great. If not, you may have to &#39;install&#39; it and access it that way.</p>

										<p><p>Hi, so if I know the name of the file used by the old app, I can access it from within the new app by using Ti.Filesystem api?<br>That seems simple enough!<br>Are there not any restrictions in place from one app accessing files used by other apps?</p>
</p>

										<p><p>well, apps are sandboxed,s o they cant gab another apps files. But if this app has the same app id and is installed over top, then the files that existed before will still be there.</p>
<p>You can move the raw file around using Ti.Filesystem, you will need to access it using the database calls.</p>
<p>The other option, depending on the size, would be to send the file to a back end service, that reads the sqlite data and returns it to the app over an api to repopulate the new table.  Couple of ways you can work this.</p>
