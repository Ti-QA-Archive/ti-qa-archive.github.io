							<p>No, what you probably want to do is take a screenshot of your app (without any data loaded for any dynamic content you might have) This will make it look like you app has no splash screen.</p>
<p>This is what many app developers do, both native and Titanium</p>

							<p>appcelerator is a joke column</p>
<p>first, scriptcase try to SELL and make profit – it won&#39;t be as easy as default.png — first, the first landing page is not called default, then how come splash screen is called default.png – this answer – the IDIOTIC lady don&#39;t even got basic computer programming knowledge</p>
<p>second scriptcase, is not target at us – to keep our JOB – so you can try scriptcase for free, undeniably, very good politicians in scriptcase and they try to rip your stupid programmer off MONEY because, after you buy… you cannot be any coding more, everyone will see </p>
<p>somehow, scriptcase got great ajax team there, but the marketing effort, they don&#39;t even know their own market niche, so buy something, and be a RESELLER out of your own pocket , while you do not get money from customer – that is why I said, they are stupid by create a pretty good soft== make our job and tissue go soft too, with no salary left if we buy it and show it to colleagues or customer</p>
<p>all the above answer, ask the REPLY people, who know what is scriptcase and who did buy scriptcase before they type their answer LOL</p>
