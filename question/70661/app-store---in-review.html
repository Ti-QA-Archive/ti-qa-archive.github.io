			<h1>App Store - In Review</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>My app status is &quot;In-Review&quot; since yesterday morning (7:51 AM PST).  There is no update after that.  Is it normal for an app to be in that state for more than a day? </p>
<p>I expected some update by the end of yesterday and there is no update as yet. </p>
<p>Is there anyone who&#39;s app got approved yesterday(i.e on October 14th).  If so,  how long did the application state remain in &quot;In-Review&quot;?</p>
<p>I am starting to get worried about this. So any information on this would be really helpful.</p>
<p>UPDATE:  Its a free app.</p>

							<p>Mine was waiting review for 8 days and has been &quot;in Review&quot; for 2.  Mine is a free app, not sure why it is taking so long.  Of course if they reject your app, and you resubmit it the process starts over.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Colton,</p>
<p>3 weeks is way too long to be in &quot;In-Review&quot;. I don&#39;t understand why there is so much variation.  For some people, it just takes few hours and for some weeks.  I wish the pattern was more consistent.  </p>
<p>Usually, to go to &quot;In-Review&quot; state, it takes about a week. And then, if it takes 3 weeks for them to review, it comes up to 4 weeks in total.  Is the apple review board dormant?</p>
<p>Are you still waiting for approval?</p>

							<p>All my apps have been in-review anywhere between three hours and one full day… except this last one. This is the third day… waiting…. getting pissed off. It already got rejected once for a stupid mistake. I hope it gets approved this time.</p>
