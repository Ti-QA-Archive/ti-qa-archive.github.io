			<p>Hello<br>I have developed an application for android and iPhone both.<br>Application is working perfectly on iPhone and android both. But The problem is it&#39;s working too slow on android.</p>
<p>Mainly when i open a window to add data it&#39;s taking more time. In my application two windows having only 2-3 text fields still it&#39;s taking 2-4 seconds to open.</p>
<p>Is this problem every one having or only i am facing that problem.</p>
<p>Any can suggest any solution.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>Are you using Android emulator? Emulator is <strong>very</strong> slow, you should test on real device to see real performance.</p>

							<p>yah .. i have also tested on samsung device but still facing same issue.<br>It was a little faster on device but not as expected.</p>
<p>still windows with 2-3 fields in my app opened in around 1 sec if i removed Ti.include(); As i come to know from a post that including external js file takes more time.</p>
<p>But one of my app window having around 13 fields and it&#39;s taking 5 seconds to open.</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s strange. What Titanium SDK version do you use? Can you post some code that demonstrates the issue?</p>
<p>I have much more complex app, and it&#39;s working fast on Android.</p>

										<p><p>in your app … if you open any new modal window with few text fields and a date time picker than how much time it&#39;s taking to be opened ?</p>
<p>Actually if i want to open only window just a black window with a background view than also it&#39;s taking 1 sec. it not opening instantly.</p>

										<p><p>It opens instantly (20 and more components also, the slowdown occours when there are really large number of elements). Maybe you should try to upgrade Titanium SDK, but be aware that you may find some issues (which can be solved). But it&#39;s hard to tell without any code what&#39;s the real problem.</p>
