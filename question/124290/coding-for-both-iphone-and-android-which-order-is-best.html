			<h1>Coding for both iPhone and Android. Which order is best?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;m writing an app for both iPhone and Android and was wondering in which order to code for each platform specific feature.</p>
<p>I.e Do you do the set all the properties on UI controls to Android as default first and then branch your code down to other platforms such as iPhone in my case? Or which approach do you prefer to take? Also, is there any specific reason why a particular order is important to you? Perhaps advantages &#x2F; disadvantages between different approaches?</p>
<p>Thanks, I&#39;m looking forward to your comments and suggestions.</p>

							<p>It is muh faster to iteratively develop using the iOS simulator than it is the Android emulator, or even an Android device. This is usually a consideration when considering which to develop first.  </p>
<p>That said, it is likely most wise to develop for both platforms simultaneously. The iOS simulator paired with a connected Android device will give you the fastest development speed. This also allows you to see the subtle ways in which your logic or UI may differ between the platforms as you develop. Its a lot easier to account for the discrepancies between the platforms during development than it is to handle it all at the end.</p>
<p>While completing a version for one platform then porting it to the next might seem simpler, you lose one of Appcelerator&#39;s biggest advantages in its cross platform nature. Also, you further diverge your app, making future features and maintenance more difficult.</p>

							<p>Yeah, if you&#39;re trying to prove concept, iOS is the way to go.  I&#39;d say at least one of every 10 simulator runs should prompt a cursory check on Android to make sure you haven&#39;t broken anything.</p>

							<p>I&#39;d do it on the ios simply because of the compiling speed. If I make any changes on the interface, I&#39;d at least compile it once on android.</p>

							<p>I also run into less problems when developing for iOS. The development speed is simply much faster for iOS apps. Having finished the iOS app, I can focus on Android problems exclusively.</p>
