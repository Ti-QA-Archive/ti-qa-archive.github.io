							<p>Armindo, I can see how you find the new Studio UI confusing at first glance.</p>
<p>My nest advice to you would probably be to read the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Studio_3.2.0_Changes">Studio 3.2.0 Changes</a> from the Titanium Guides. This should at least help you get your bearings with the new interface.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Christian,</p>
<p>In &quot;Studio 3.2.0 Changes&quot; Document, it said that: </p>
<p>&quot;many of the icons from the global tool bar have been removed…&quot;</p>
<p>Is there anyway I can have some of my favorite tool icons back in the tool bar for<br>Studio Extended perspective?  I would like to have &quot;Save&quot;, &quot;Toggle Block Selection<br>Mode&quot; and &quot;Show White space Characters&quot; and other icon back in the tool bar.</p>
<p>I have tried Window &gt; Customize Perspective to no avail..</p>
<p>Later in the section under &quot;Debug Perspective and View&quot; the document did said:</p>
<p>&quot;The global toolbar can be customized with the Window &gt; Customize Perspective…<br>action to add &gt;  or remove debugging commands…. &quot;</p>
<p>and,</p>
<p>&quot;The old toolbar behavior can<br>be restored by first toggling the Show Debug Toolbar option in the<br>Debug view&#39;s menu (icon of the white arrow point down), then by<br>disabling the Debug toolbar from the Customize Perspective dialog.&quot;</p>
<p>But that is for Debug Perspective not Studio Perspective… I did have some of<br>the  old tool bar behavior back for Debug Perspective, but can not do the same for<br>Studio Perspective. And I can not save the old behavior that I manage to restore.</p>
<p>Also, I would checked the check box in customize perspective dialog box. but the<br>next time when I open the dialog box, all my check box configuration is gone…</p>
<p>Please help if you could…<br>Thanks.<br>Apollo</p>

							<p>The toolbar is messed up for me as well. I opened a ticket in the Appcelerator Jira, it&#39;s here:</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;APSTUD-8092</p>

							<p>I couldn&#39;t find how to publish to the app store as well…</p>
<p>Were these changes necessary? It is already complex enough with Alloy and regular coding, with multiple platforms and modules.</p>
<p>Changing the UI did not help me at all. Looking at the modules, it seems like the new module publishing is slowing down, as well as the updates to the modules as well.</p>
<p>On top of this some modules require Alloy but you can&#39;t know about that until you buy them…</p>
<p>Anyways maybe its me, but it seems like the popularity of the platform is not going up…</p>
