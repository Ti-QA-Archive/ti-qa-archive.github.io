							<p>I don&#39;t believe Titanium apps are web apps any more.  JavaScript is merely the language used to call native APIs.  No browser technology is used, unless you use a web view, in which case you aren&#39;t really running Titanium&#39;s javascript, you are running Safari&#39;s javascript.</p>
<p>Did I get this right? :)</p>

							<p>I think the main reason they use javascript is that apple has a built in webkit that allows you to compile the javascript so you can take full advantage of the language. </p>
<p>As far as I know there is no GUI Designer yet but I believe it&#39;s coming as part of the official IDE.</p>

							<p>Javascript is a language known to a great many people, so supporting javascript allows web developers to leverage the expertise they have obtained working on web apps with mobile apps.</p>
<p>Further, if you&#39;re going to build a system like this you need a language that runs on all of the platforms; Javascript is already present on both the iphone and android as well as many other mobile platforms, which makes it likely that Titanium could be extended to support pretty much any platform with a web browser.</p>
<p>To be honest, I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m totally sold on using Titanium for mobile development for my projects, but the theory behind it is rock solid =]</p>

							<p>Hi guys, is there any change to your answers here? I&#39;m in need of a tool that will help me write an app across as many platforms as possible, but just how does this work? Does it run in the browser or as a stand alone app on the phone&#x2F;tablet? I&#39;m not keen on the browser thing. I want it to be on the phone itself. What is the best tool? How does this compare with somthing like Corona or RhoStudio?</p>

							<p>Well it uses javascript because basically these are web-apps wrapped in native functionality.</p>
<p>You CAN use html and jquery for your app, I was going to go that direction, but its going to look clunky.</p>
<p>No ide.</p>
