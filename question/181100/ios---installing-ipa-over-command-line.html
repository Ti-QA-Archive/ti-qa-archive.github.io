			<h1>iOS - Installing IPA over command-line</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This is not related to Appcelerator, but I wanted to check with the community. I have an AdHoc IPA which I need to install in some of the iOS devices. The UDID are already added, but whenever I try to install it using iTunes, it wants to perform a sync and as a result wants to clear the contents of the device.</p>
<p>Any idea as to how can we install the IPA without iTunes, or use XCode command line tool to install them. This is possible cause from Appcelerator Studio, we can directly install the IPA on the device for developer builds. Just want to know how to do it for AdHoc builds.</p>

							<p>TestFlight allows you to upload your build to their servers and then your testers can download directly over the air by clicking on a link in an email. You could equally host your .ipa on a web server and provide a link to clic kto download&#x2F;install too.  Obviously the testers must be in the adhoc provisioning profile already…</p>

										<p><p>I tried the OTA, but somehow it is not working. I tried the Dropbox approach and it is not working. I will try to follow the link which you have mentioned and give it a try again. If it works, I will update this thread in here.</p>
