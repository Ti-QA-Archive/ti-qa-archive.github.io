			<p>Hi guys, I know this is the official forum, but I do find my questions disappear 3 hours after I&#39;ve asked them shame :(</p>
<p>I&#39;ve now setup <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.titaniumuser.com">Titanium User</a> as a community fan developer site.</p>
<p>Drop on by.</p>
<p>Cheers<br>James</p>

							<p>Yup, we&#39;re going to call our legal team and your site taken down right away for using our logo!  ;)</p>
<p>Thanks for your desire to help other users, but to the extent possible we&#39;re trying to keep all the Titanium knowledge we can here on this site so we don&#39;t have too much fragmentation of knowledge.  We know the Q&amp;A leaves some things to be desired - that&#39;s why <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.theresumator.com&#x2F;apply&#x2F;u5cupF&#x2F;Web-Developer-Community.html">we&#39;re hiring</a>.  Thanks for your continued help&#x2F;support.</p>

							<p>I like the idea.  A wiki would be nice too with sections with corrected documentation and notes.  And possibly a place to store <strong>working</strong> examples,  no Q&#x2F;A, just real code you can drop in and use.</p>

							<p>Not to rain on anyone&#39;s parade, but I for one have found this Q&amp;A useful, and the developers have more than helped my problems in the past.</p>
<p>One thing you might want to consider is this:  Don&#39;t use their company logo.  You can be free to develop a user-based forum all you want, but refrain from using the official appcelerator logo.  You even state at the disclaimer in the footer that you&#39;re in no way affiliated nor represented by Appcelerator nor Titanium.  That in itself is a copyright violation.  Now, seeing that the Terms and Conditions page is a fail-whale at the moment, it&#39;s only common sense and common courtesy to not use a company&#39;s logo without their express consent.</p>
<p>This comes from long years as an entreprenuer&#x2F;site owner.  Just thought I&#39;d give you a heads up before you land in a dilemma.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Also, if you&#39;re giving up only after 3 hours of waiting, then shame on you.  I&#39;d wait a week for the proper answer.  One thing you have to remember is that some developers, this is their job… for others, they are outsourced to the project, and do maintain normal day jobs, as you and I do.  I for one am on and off the forums and ticket tracker all day, every day to scope the latest bugfixes and developments.  You need to have careful consideration for two things here:</p>
<p>1) These guys are working their butts off trying to get this as stable as possible, without the chance of an epic fail.</p>
<p>2) If you require dedicated support, check out their pricing.  It&#39;s pricey, i know… but well worth it.</p>

							<p>@Andrew Heebner - thanks for the constructive criticism, noted and duly changed – In appreciation for Appcelerator Inc. we all know they work their butt off and I am glad they do as it&#39;s a great product that I also want to support.</p>
<p>@John - Thanks that&#39;s what I needed too hence the Coders Cookbook section.</p>
<p>Cheers<br>James</p>
