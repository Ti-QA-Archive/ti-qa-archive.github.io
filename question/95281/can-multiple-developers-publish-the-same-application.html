			<h1>Can multiple developers publish the same application?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>We work as at team and we have the code for our app in svn.  when one of us makes an update we have to get the original creator of the app in titanium to publish the new version. this is cumbersome when that developer is not around.  Are we able to have multiple developers publish the same application or must we make an account that we can all use and have a separate machine for the publishing of our apps?   &#x2F;thanks&#x2F; </p>

							<p>For iOS, publishing to the ITS matches the app id to the provisioning profile signed by the right certificate uploaded to ITS via the proper account credentials.  If you have all 3 of those components on your system, then yes, your system can produce and publish the app.  </p>
<p>This requires you have the signing certificate in your local keystone.<br>That you have the proper provisioning profile on the system.<br>That you know the apple dev login the app is published under.</p>
<p>For android, you just need the keystore used to sign the app and the password associated with it.</p>

										<p><p>If your Apple developer account is a company and not an individual, then the creator of the account can invite other devs to join.</p>
<p>Those devs can then create signing certificates as well.  This muddies the waters a bit.</p>
