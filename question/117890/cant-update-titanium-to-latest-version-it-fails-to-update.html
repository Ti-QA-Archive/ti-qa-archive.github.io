			<h1>can&#39;t update titanium to latest version, it fails to update</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi I wanted to give titainum a chance, downloaded 1.2 When it installed it tried to download some stuff which failed to unpack after downloading, it complained that the download was corrupt. I went ahead and started the app and noticed in right top corner that it was suggesting that I update to 1.6</p>
<p>I tried that and after it downloaded 100% it complained about file extration failing. I started again and noticed that is said now that there is new desktop SDK available and so I did accept that. After download it failed to unpack.</p>
<p>I work for a big consulting company and wanted personally to evaluate this software and see if its something that we could use in our company.</p>
<p>Seeing as I can&#39;t even get it installed correctly I&#39;d like some help to get started.</p>
<p>Any ideas whats failing with install? Is there a link to 1.6?</p>
<p>here is a screenshot:</p>

<p>Judging from your screenshot, I presume you are installing to OSX. Is that correct?</p>
<p>The Titanium SDKs are installed to either <code>&amp;#x2F;Library&amp;#x2F;Application Support&amp;#x2F;Titanium</code> or <code>~&amp;#x2F;Library&amp;#x2F;Application Support&amp;#x2F;Titanium</code>. Would you check to see that these directories exist, and that you have the appropriate permissions to write to them?</p>
<p>It may be best to run Titanium Developer as administrator in order to install the updates. Is this possible?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
