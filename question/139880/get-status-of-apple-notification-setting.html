			<p>I have been able to get iOS push notifications working, except for getting the current status of the Notification setting.  If the user disables the app&#39;s notification via the Notification Center, how do get this status in the app in order to unsubscribe?</p>

							<p>You cannot get that status, what you can do is, add your logic in the push receiving code that will tell you that the device is not receiving push(like a WS call that will check the push is send from the server).</p>
<p>once you found out this you can pop up a alert dialog and in the ok button you can <code>Ti.Platform.openURL(&amp;#39;prefs:root=NOTIFICATIONS_ID&amp;#39;);</code>, this will open up your device notification center.</p>

										<p><p>When the app is installed, the user is prompted to accept or decline notifications.  If the user accepts, the app subscribes them to the channel.  However, if later the user uses Apple Notification Center to disable notifications, the app needs to detect the status change and unsubscribe.  The same is true if at first they decline and then later turn on notifications.  There must be a way to get the Notification Center&#39;s app status in order for notifications to work properly.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p> You might be aware that how APNS works. Its your server that will send the message to the Apple Server and then the Apple server will send that message to your device.<br>So while sending the message to the Apple server you can add custom code that will keep a track that when the Apple push code is executed on the server etc.<br>This tracking info can be saved to a place and can be accessed by a WS to know that whether a push is send from a server or not, you can make that tracking service to run in background also at some interval so you dont have to call the WS continuously.</p>
<p>hope I made a sense there…:)</p>
