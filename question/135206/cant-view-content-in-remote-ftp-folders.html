			<h1>Can&#39;t View Content in Remote FTP Folders</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Pulling my hair out trying to figure out why it is I cannot open folders on the remote FTP server and see their contents. Such a simple task has turned into serious lost hours. Also cannot transfer files to them. Error reads &quot;<strong>Parent path does not exist</strong>&quot;. Everything is linked up fine, same setting i had in Dreamweaver… test works and I can see the matching folder structure in both local and remote windows. But i get little red crossed out circle icons (sometimes) on the remote folders. I can upload and download top level files (not in a folder) just fine, but nothing within a folder. Tried both active and passive FTP. No joy either way. I&#39;m <strong>using a Promoted Project</strong> folder structure if that makes any difference known-bug-wise. Trying to make the switch to open platform, but just about ready to go back to my Dreamweaver. Any ideas? I am on Windows 7 Pro (like probably 90% of the planet). Have firewall turned off completely. Read a million blogs… no answers found thus far. Shouldn&#39;t be this mind-blowing just to set up my FTP imho. Thanks for any help guys!</p>

							<p>If this is in version 1.0.9, it looks like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;APSTUD-3302">this issue</a> was solved in the newest 2.0.0 release. Can you update to the RC from <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;preview.appcelerator.com">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;preview.appcelerator.com</a> to see if it fixes it for you?</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the assistance Ingo! I followed the links and instructions and updated to the version 2 RC. Too cool. Had no idea there was this whole way to hook up additional sites to the program updater. I was hopeful, but unfortunately, no matter how I config the FTP, I still can&#39;t view sub-folder contents. I am actually having a harder time seeing any sub-folders now. They were there at first, then dissappeared never to return. Sigh. Maybe I&#39;m just too clueless on the setup aspects of eclipse, but pretty certain it would have worked at some point, especially since I had top-level files transferring back and forth just fine already. Hmm.. Bummer. Should I ditch the program until they get this working (on Windows 7 Pro - 64 bit), or is there another fix perhaps? Would really like to expand into this open-platform world. But, yeah… have some deadlines to get back to and Dreamweaver &quot;just works.&quot; Type in the ftp info and bam.. no problems.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help on this! :) I appreciate it!</p>
