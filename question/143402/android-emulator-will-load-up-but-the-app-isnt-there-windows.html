			<h1>Android Emulator will load up but the app isn&#39;t there (Windows)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>First I&#39;ll mention what I have done…</p>
<p>I downloaded Appcelerator&#39;s Titanium and installed it, once opened I kept the Workspace directory as it&#39;s default. It installed JDK, which I also installed to the default path of</p>
<p><code>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_25</code></p>
<p>I then installed the Android SDK making sure it had the necessary installations that it listed, from memory it was Android 2.2 and API 8 (I&#39;m pretty sure you know which bit I mean). Basically the question mark over the Android logo in the dashboard&#x2F;configure page was no longer there.</p>
<p>I made sure both updates were also checked under the help tab, just in case.</p>
<p>I then created a new Titanium Mobile Project with a default layout, gave it a project name of &#39;HelloWorld&#39;, gave it an App ID of &#39;com.titanium.helloworld&#39; and unchecked the cloud settings tickbox.</p>
<p>I then tried to run it with the Android Emulator, first of all I was getting errors of:</p>
<p><code>JDK version &amp;#39;javac&amp;#39; is not recognized</code></p>
<p>I did a bit of searching and found that I needed to alter Environment Variables by right clicking My Computer &gt; Advanced &gt; Environment Variables.</p>
<p>I read to make sure JAVA_HOME was set to</p>
<p><code>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_25</code></p>
<p>Which for starters JAVA_HOME wasn&#39;t even there so I had to add it, then at the end of PATH I needed to add</p>
<p><code>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_25\bin</code></p>
<p>After a restart, I tried again, this time the emulator ran but the app didn&#39;t show. I did a bit more searching and somewhere said to add &#39;classpath&#39; variable under the &#39;user variables&#39; in the Environment Variables with a value of &#39;.&#39; (just a full stop).</p>
<p>Again, restarted, tried again, and still the emulator runs, but no app. I ran it in a browser and it works fine, but in the emulator, nothing at all.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been sat here now for over 6 hours now, installing, uninstalling, searching, altering settings and nothing I try is working.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any advice on how to fix this and get this working? I can&#39;t be the only one who can&#39;t get this thing work?</p>

<p>I understand how deeply you worked and enthusiastic about working on Titanium, but we need something to understand your issue and that something is the error logs. If you can share the logs, i am very sure that i get make you up and running developing with Titanium.</p>
<p>Also, provide the following information:</p>
<p>.1. Platform - iOS&#x2F;Android</p>
<p>.2. Developing Module&#x2F;App through titanium</p>

										<p><p>Sorry, I&#39;ve updated the log in the Pastebin link above, I&#39;m hoping that&#39;s the right log, I ran it under debug and it was a different log than before, so I assumed this is what you meant.</p>
