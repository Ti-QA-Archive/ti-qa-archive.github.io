			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been reading a lot about performance, memory, best-practices and memory leaks when working with Titanium. I&#39;ve watched the code strong lectures about Memory Leaks, and how to code right.</p>
<p>Seems that everyone has a method of their own that is &quot;the best for&quot;…<br>but what really is the best method if you want to build an application that will run fast and you won&#39;t be spending the first 20 sec or so looking at the splash screen, won&#39;t crash and won&#39;t eat a lot of memory?</p>
<p>So far what I&#39;ve got is:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Opening a new context in a new window (window with js url) - on one hand, people say to avoid a new context - so my first question is - why? what&#39;s so wrong about a new context? as far as I see it you don&#39;t need all your app screens loaded at once with Ti.include - so you load a window do what you need with it, lazy load the js files it needs, close it and free memory. That way you (1) lazy load your js&#39;s, and (2) use it only when you need it and once you close it - free up some memory.</p>
</li>
<li><p>commonJS - in theory I think it&#39;s the best approach but it&#39;s not supported yet for Android and it currently re-includes the JS with every call (which shouldn&#39;t happen with commonJS and hopefully will be fixed).</p>
</li>
<li><p>using a namespace (like in the TweetTanium example) - in that way as I see it your app needs to build the name space into one global object that contains all your functions and on app load include all my js files - what if I don&#39;t need them all at that time?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, there are all kind of libraries and work around classes that mimic commonJS, or that make sure you Ti.include only once by keeping track of what you&#39;ve already included. And classes that help you free up memory…</p>
<p>So please share… what do you do (and for what sort of application). Do you have any answers to the questions above? would like to hear how others are dealing with it.</p>

							<p>I bid for the &quot;tweetanium style&quot;. It&#39;s easy to maintain, well structured, does not pollute the global scope and does not use new contexts. And forces you to work under some good practices that, at the end, avoid errors.</p>
<p>The problem with new contexts is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to comunicate two contexts, you have to use Ti.App events, wich can&#39;t send objects by reference. </li>
<li>If you use some kind of library for, for example, database management, you should include it again, which is a waste of (duplicated) memory.</li>
<li>The other option is pass the global object as an argument (or only the required objects), anyway, seems that is not a very good idea, is limited to the objects that exists in the global scope (if you want to access from one window in a new context to another window in an another context, it comes really tricky). </li>
</ul>
<p>Comparing both ways, I finally found the tweetanium style more clear, easier for maintain and understand. </p>
<p>In the tweetanium style you do not need to have opened all windows consuming memory. You can declare a method, i.e.,  App.ui.createMyOcasionalWindow(). The function is declared, but it barely does not consume memory until is executed. When the returned window is destroyed, memory is liberated. If you call this method inside a function (like a eventListener) when window is closed it is automatically destroyed, since the scope of this window is the function where is contained. Clean, clear and light. :)</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>Lets say I don&#39;t need to communicate between contexts - then is it a better choice?</p>
<p>As for the global scope - I know I&#39;m not supposed to pollute the global scope - but that object that lives in the scope is one big object that instead of putting var and functions in the global scope you put it in one big object that is contained by the global scope.</p>
<p>Also, you didn&#39;t address the problem of having all you includes load at once at app start - which makes initial loading slower. and what about lazy loading?</p>
<p>Another way I found is to make an object in the global scope with common functions (like DAL) and pass it as a parameter (I think it&#39;s passed as reference. and it works both on iPhone and Android - I checked).</p>

										<p><p>You can combine tweetanium style (TS) with the other mentioned styles, commonJS and new context windows, if this helps you decide. In fact, you can use commonJS modules loaded in your namespace. My decision to use TS and avoid new contexts arrived after a pair of big projects where debug tasks were a nightmare.</p>
<p>Even if you don&#39;t need to communicate different contexts, consider load these contexts under a TS structure.</p>
<p>Global scope: yes, there is a big object living out there, wich is easier to manage and debug than a lot of small objects that I wouldn&#39;t know where they were created.</p>
<p>App launch time problem: I have to say that has not been a problem for me, and I have some really complex screens (never more than 4 or 5 seconds). Use the includes to load the functions, not to execute them. For example, a connectDB function is executed after the window is open, not when declaring function. If launch time is the only problem you see with tweetanium style, there are workarounds to manage.</p>
<p>All of this is &quot;generally speaking&quot;, sure there are concrete situations, but TS is like a basic framework from where to face any situation.</p>

							<p>Hi Shlomi, I have a Ruby script on github you should check out.  It restructures a newly created Ti app just like how Tweetanium does it.  I use this script every time I create a new Ti project, it helps making the coding that much easier!<br>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;iampnelson&#x2F;TweakTi</p>
