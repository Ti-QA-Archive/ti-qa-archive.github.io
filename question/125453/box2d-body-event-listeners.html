			<h1>Box2D body event listeners</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve started playing around with ti.box2D and was wondering if there are event listeners for bodies added to the world?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve noticed on the pinball app that events are being handled by a transparent overlay on top of the whole gamescreen.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance (plus this module is very fun to use, hoping for an android release in the near future)</p>

							<p>There is currently no event listener for adding a body, and as of now, none is planed. The reason for this is that Box2D it self does not have such an event listener. The only events that the module will handel are those generated by the world.</p>
<p>As for the overlay, the reason it deals with the events of clicking is that if we did not do that if you tapped on a bumper (or any other body) rather then the bg, and the event were registered on the bg then nothing would happen. Using an overlay provides a more consistant experience.</p>

										<p><p>hmmm.  alright.</p>
<p>i suppose the closest i can get is to capture clicks with a view (like the pinball app) and iterate through the &quot;clickable&quot; objects and see if they are under the click cooordinates.</p>
<p>thanks for the info!</p>

										<p><p>If you <em>want</em> to click on elements, you can do that (as I stated, I did not in the pinball game), but its not the body you want to add the listener to, you want to do that on the view that the body &quot;contains&quot;.</p>
