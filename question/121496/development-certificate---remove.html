			<h1>Development Certificate - Remove</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m having a problem building apps to any of my devices, I&#39;m pretty sure I found out that my issue happened because my Dev. Cert. expired. I replaced it and it made no difference, I keep getting the same install error. So I cleared everything out, all provisioning profiles and dev. cert. But for some reason titanium is still seeing a dev. certificate. I&#39;ve looked through the keychain and there are none in there. </p>
<p>I think titanium is still using my old certificate thats expired and thats why I get provisioning problems when building apps to my devices. </p>
<p>How can I clear out the Development Certificate in titanium?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>Have you definitely deleted the old expired ones from your XCode Organizer window, as well as the KeyChain Utility. And also deleting Ti Studio&#x2F;Developer&#39;s knowledge of them? </p>
<p>Then it&#39;s also worth a full reboot.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also worth making sure you&#39;ve deleted any old&#x2F;expired ones on the device itself (under Settings&#x2F;General at the bottom)</p>

							<p>I figured this one out after about 4 hours of messing around. There was an expired cert. in the system keychain but I couldn&#39;t see it, it was hidden. I had to go View &gt; Show Expired Certificates. Why it wouldn&#39;t show that expired one, but would show the one in the login keychain is beyond me.</p>
