			<h1>ACS Push Notification Not Sending</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I asked a question about this early, but no one from Appcelerator seems to want to address it.  So reposting to get it to the top.</p>
<p>As of January 1, all push notification for my App has stopped sending in Development and production.  The subscriptions are happening successfully, and not even Test&#39;s from the web console can be sent.  The only logs that appear in detail are.  &quot;No sending logs found for this push notification. Push notification logs of requests will be visible here when push notifications are sent to subscribers of this app.&quot;  I have even updated one of the certs even though it wasn&#39;t expired.  Please address this and be advised if your app is using push notifications.</p>

							<div><p>Push notifications have been unstable for us over the past week too. We&#39;ve seen old notifications being delivered long after they were triggered including floods of lots (10s, possibly near 100) all being delivered at once. ACS&#39;s push notification system has definitely been having a bad time lately.</p>
