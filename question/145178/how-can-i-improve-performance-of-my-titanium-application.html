			<h1>How can i improve Performance of my titanium application</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,<br>    I am using titanium for developing mobile applications. But after developing some application which uses networks, I could understand that the performance of app is average compared to native apps. Can anyone suggest me <strong>methods to improve the performance of my applications</strong></p>

							<div><p>Titanium apps are native, so you can expect the same performance as OTHER apps.</p>
<p>Your question is very open ended and would take days to detail all of the technique that can be employed by a programmer to improve every little section.</p>
<p>You have not supplied enough information about what network interaction you perform to provide even a basic set of tips.  You will need to expand on what you provided and supply an example of code that you have created with a description of how this is slow.</p>
<p>However there is something all developers can do to make a big I prove meant; find the one thing your app does most often or that takes the most time and target that first.  This way the app will appear to have improved most.</p>
<p>If you provide a scenario and some code you will get specific answers, just remember we are not here to write your app for you - so you have to show you have done something.</p>

							<p>It depends what you are doing with &#39;networks&#39; …  if you are using Titanium.Network.HTTPClient , check the &#39;cache&#39; property which can avoid  new request  ( do it  only if  it request always produces the same result) . By default, value is set to  false.<br>This helps a lot in this scenario.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you Vince for your quick response.<br>How can I improve performance if I&#39;m using Ti.Cloud, just like message, chat etc? because I&#39;m using all these(Titanium.Network.HTTPClient  and Cloud.message) in my app.</p>

							<p>You say <strong>compared to native apps</strong>. To me that is a non issue since you don&#39;t give any details.</p>
<p>Any application (native or Titanium based) will be slow if the code doesn&#39;t adhere to some basic principles. I strongly recommend you post some code that isolates your problem. From there, people can have a look at it and help you.</p>
<p>But simply asking for <strong>&quot;methods to improve the performance of your applications&quot;</strong> is way too brad to answer. (Hell, I could write a book just on this subject)</p>
