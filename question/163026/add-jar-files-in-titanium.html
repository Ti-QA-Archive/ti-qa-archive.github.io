							<div><p>Asking &quot;… please provide me the whole solution.&quot; will not help you gain any friends here.  This is a place where people come for assistance not ask others to do your work.  This is how your question ends.</p>
<p>If you require assistance on a subject - feel free to ask - the community here will help out.  But it is very rare that someone will provide and entire &quot;solution&quot; as you have asked - especially as something that is more complicated than normal.</p>
<p>It makes you look lazy and incapable of trying things yourself.  This is not a language barrier issue as your whole question is riddled with the intent of not trying to help yourself.  This would have been a better way to ask the question;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Hello Everyone, I am trying to add a jar to my project but I do not know where to start.  Can anyone point me in the right direction or share any personal experiences you have had doing this yourself to your own app.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Sorry if this sounds harsh - but it is annoying when some many people appear to want someone else to do their work for them - without wanting to do anything themselves.</p>

							<p>Actually I can&#39;t believe anybody has bothered to answer this question.</p>
<p>You have completely ignored the guidelines, if you have even read them.</p>
<p>You have totally misunderstood the titanium framework, if you have bothered to even try to understand it,</p>
<p>And you come here and ask for a total solution to something you A)can&#39;t be bothered to look into for yourself. B) If you had you would know that you couldn&#39;t do it.</p>
<p>People here give up their spare time freely and openly to help people. We do like to see that they have at least attempted to resolve it, and are in genuine need of the knowledge and help available here.</p>
<p>It is not acceptable to come onto a Q &amp; A forum and just ask for a complete solution because you can&#39;t be bothered.</p>

							<p>You can add any file you like to your project.  If what you mean is can I then execute the .jar file, then no you cant</p>

<p>Please have a look at this document, I think &quot;Module project layout&quot; chapter will help you.</p>

										<p><p>Shuo, great link.  However, he couldn&#39;t read and follow the instructions to post a question, what makes you think he will read how to create a module?</p>
