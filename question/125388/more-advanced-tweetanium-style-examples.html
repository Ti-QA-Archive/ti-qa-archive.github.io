			<h1>More Advanced Tweetanium-Style Examples?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m currently trying to refactor an existing application from the Kitchen Sink (multi-context, tabGroup-based) style to the Tweetanium style. However, Tweetanium is extremely basic, having only one screen for each tab. I&#39;m currently trying to figure out what the best way is to handle having subscreens (as each screen accessed by the tabs is the main screen for a section).</p>
<p>Are there any apps that are more complex that use the Tweetanium style that have their code available for download? Specifically, are there any that open subscreens from within the main screens, and&#x2F;or that use maps?</p>

							<div><p>so you&#39;re looking for Kitchen Sink-style hierarchical navigation in a single context?</p>

							<div><p>My ultimate goal is maintainability of a growing app that uses hierarchical navigation (and unfortunately, I don&#39;t have the option to change this behavior). So far in my endeavors, the Tweetanium style is what keeps coming up as essentially the pinnacle of portable, stable, maintainable Titanium mobile development, particularly since JSS is discouraged for the time being. If you have suggestions for alternative methods of doing hierarchal navigation in a maintainable way (particularly with things like layout templating&#x2F;styling that allows for styles to be changed in one location and affect the whole app, and overall object reuse), I&#39;m all ears.</p>

							<div><p>I also keep running into memory issues, that other searches and questions have suggested relate to the multi-context pattern plus the use of tabGroup, that all the suggestions keep going back to Tweetanium (from what I&#39;ve been able to gather, it&#39;s in part due to known memory management issues).</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve been doing some screencasts on application templates of late, and this sound like a good excuse to do a single-context, tab based example application to replace the Kitchen Sink style.  I will address this need in episode 6 of the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator-developer-relations&#x2F;Forging-Titanium">Forging Titanium</a> series next week.  Any requests for this example to include specifically?  You have about three days to get them to me (tweet <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;kevinwhinnery">@kevinwhinnery</a> ).</p>

										<p><p>Hi Kevin, it would be really helpful if you could expand on this example a bit more, as I&#39;m still having a hard time (after doing some development based off the Kitchen Sink example) figuring out how to implement a tab based hierarchical app in a single context. Your example shows how to generate two identical app windows, but what is the best way to specify unique functionality for each window? Sorry, I&#39;m a bit lost.</p>
