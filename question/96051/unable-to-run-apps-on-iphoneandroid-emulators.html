<p>EDIT: I&#39;m also sure I&#39;m not the only one having this problem, this would be great for many new Titanium developers. If you can help with any information, please do, as it could be an answer for many people. </p>

							<div><p>I&#39;ve done 3 reinstalls and 1 clean install on another Mac - didn&#39;t work. I also updated my OS to 10.6.6 needless to say - didn&#39;t work. Tried 4 different Titanium SDKs so far (1.2.0, 1.5.1, 1.6.0 and 1.5.2) none worked. Just in case you were thinking about trying those as well. Titanium actually seems pretty cool if you manage to get it working, which is actually what seems impossible.</p>

							<div><p>Yeah, I&#39;ve been trying to run KitchenSink or anything else for that matter. Haven&#39;t even had the taste of Titanium yet. Hope it works for you. I&#39;ve been trying with 4.2, 4.1 and 4.0 without any luck. Would be great if at least we had a little support from someone. I seriously do NOT want to have to use some stuff like Rhomobile or whatever, but Titanium is slowly forcing me to. I don&#39;t have all the time in the world to spend trying to get it working… Really hope someone comes to help us here.</p>

							<p>So, I had the same issue but it was caused from upgrading to Titanium SDK 1.5.1 (at least I believe so, thats all that I believe had changed)</p>
<p>anyway, I had to follow the steps that was linked to above - which I&#39;ve since copied here for clarity &amp; ease.</p>
<p><strong>The Following Steps Worked</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Backup the Resources folder.</li>
<li>Delete project in Titanium</li>
<li>Close Titanium</li>
<li>(Finder) Go to [Project Directory]&#x2F;build&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;build</li>
<li>Delete all contents inside (don&#39;t delete build folder but every sub-folder)</li>
<li>Go to &#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx&#x2F;</li>
<li>Remove latest folder (1.5.1 currently)</li>
<li>Re-open Titanium and it will say there&#39;s an update, so do that</li>
<li>Create a new project with same details as original</li>
<li>(Finder) Go to that projects Resources folder and delete contents</li>
<li>Extract your backup you made in step 1 to this folder</li>
<li>In titanium, compile in emulator</li>
<li>If above successful, try compiling for device</li>
<li>If all this fails. I&#39;d go as far as re-installing Titanium itself</li>
</ol>

							<p>Actually, I had a similar issue, I don&#39;t remember what I did to fix it though. My gut tells me you should follow the steps I listed here.</p>

<p>You might just be that limited few percentage of people that has something get fubard on extraction or something.</p>

										<p><p>I want to use this product so bad!! But there are SO MANY issues just trying to get a simple project (or Kitchen Sink) installed. I&#39;m getting the exact same error as you, Bernardo. Also, when I tried on another computer I get a completely different error (SDK says &quot;Loading&quot; forever…) Jeez, come on Appcelerator!!!</p>

							<p>Bernardo - you might want to set the &#39;filter&#39; to &#39;trace&#39; instead of &#39;info&#39; on the emulator launch page… it will give you more info as to what is going on.</p>

										<p><p>Yeah but what about iPhone? For Android I managed to get it ALMOST working. I downloaded SDK 1.5.2 and it ran the KitchenSink app for the first time, gave me an error at runtime though (said it didn&#39;t find &#x2F;Resources&#x2F;app.js and the file was there). But anyway, for iPhone I&#39;m still having the very same error message.</p>

							<p>OK, so I updated to 10.6.6 for OSX, didn&#39;t work.  I then uninstalled and reinstalled XCode&#x2F;iOS, latest.  Finally, I delete my test app and recreated it.  It worked fine using iOS 4.2 in the simulator.  </p>
<p>In my case at least, the problem was an older XCode install.  Would be REALLY nice to have that show up on build failures if it is a known dependency!</p>
