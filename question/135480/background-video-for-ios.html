			<h1>Background Video for IOS</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>First of all, thank you whoever you are for taking the time helping someone you dont know, time that could be spent doing anything else. I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>My goal is to play large audio(some last 20 minutes, some even 1 hour) without the audio sounding distorted on the headphones.</p>
<p>I wonder if it&#39;s possible for a video to play being on the background or in sleep mode on an IOS device.</p>
<p>I had some large(as in 100mb each large) .mp3 files, which I could play in the background modifying the Info.plist doing this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">key</span>&gt;</span>UIBackgroundModes<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">key</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">array</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">string</span>&gt;</span>audio<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">string</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">array</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>And also doing this on the ti_app:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">iphone</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">backgroundModes</span>&gt;</span>
        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">mode</span>&gt;</span>audio<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">mode</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">backgroundModes</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">iphone</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>And also adding this on the player.js</p>
<p><code>Ti.Media.audioSessionMode = Ti.Media.AUDIO_SESSION_MODE_PLAYBACK;</code></p>
<p>And it worked for the .mp3 files.</p>
<p>But whenever I plugged in the headphones it sounded distorted.<br>I used the SoundPlayer to play those local files.</p>
<p>This is what I have tried so far:</p>
<p>I tried using AudioPlayer to play them locally(trying things I found on forums), but it seems that AudioPlayer ONLY accepts streaming, not local. I thought there must be a workaround that, but I couldnt find one. So I decided to transform the mp3 files, into video files, with a white background. And I am currently plaing the video files with a VideoPlayer, with transparent backgroundColor and 1x1 dimensions. So far, it works good, it doesn&#39;t sound distorted even with the headphones.</p>
<p>But the problem is, that the audio doesn&#39;t play in the background anymore. I have searched in forums, and on the internet, but I haven&#39;t found an answer, so I thought I&#39;d ask. </p>
<p>I think it has to do with the mp3 files playing with AVAudioPlayer and the VideoPlayer plays with something else that doesn&#39;t accept playing on the background.</p>
<p>I would appreciate any help.</p>
<p>Thank you again and have a nice day :)</p>

							<div><p>To give you an idea, we play streamed audio (hls&#x2F;.m38u) via the VideoPlayer in the background. 60-90 minutes at a time. Not an answer, just some information.</p>

							<p>On android, we use AudioPlayer to play both streamed .mp3s and local .mp3s that have been downloaded for use when there is no service.</p>
<p>On iOS, we use the MoviePlayer to play the .m3u8 (as I mentioned above) but also to play mp3s that have been downloaded to the local file system. (we only use MoviePlayer as AudioPlayer doesn&#39;t like playlists)</p>
<p>Give either of them a go.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you for the quick response :)</p>
<p>The app will be for IOS. I already tried with AudioPlayer with local files that have been downloaded, but it throws me an error saying &quot;Unable to configure network for read stream&quot;.</p>
<p>That&#39;s why I tried the VideoPlayer, which is working, except it isn&#39;t running in the background(It isn&#39;t streaming, as supposedly Apple has restriction on streaming more than 5mb on mobiles, or so I thought-Am i wrong?-).</p>
<p>Again, thank you very much for your response and time</p>
