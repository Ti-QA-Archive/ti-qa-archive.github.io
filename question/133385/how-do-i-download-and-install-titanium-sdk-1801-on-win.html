			<h1>How do I download and install Titanium sdk 1.8.0.1 on Win?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve installed Titanium Studio fresh on Win to develop android version of an existing (titanium based) ios app since I couldn&#39;t get the android emulator up and running on Osx Lion.<br>The fresh install on PC upgraded to 1.8.2. But my app was built for iOS with Titanium SDK 1.8.0.1. So I&#39;d like to install 1.8.0.1 on the pc and get rid of a bunch of errors due to the different sdk versions. How can I achieve this?<br>Thanks</p>

<p>Ok, i found the answer to my own earlier question… so, here it is for all WindowsHeads like me:</p>
<p>You can download earlier versions of the Ti SDK from: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;index.html</p>
<p>And to install it… you need to copy the SDK to: C:\ProgramData\Titanium\mobilesdk\win32</p>
<p>This last step was the strange bit since I installed Ti in C:\Ti the SDK is not installed in the same folder… somehow, no matter where you install Ti, the SDK is installed in C:\ProgramData\Titanium…</p>
<p>So, now we can enjoy older versions of Ti SDK :-)</p>

										<p><p>Ah, sorry I didn&#39;t check for that specific version, I had assumed it would be there. It appears there are some close versions in the &quot;branch-5062&quot; dropdown that may be useful to you. If you can&#39;t get exactly what your looking for, you might be able to work with something close, without too much modification.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
