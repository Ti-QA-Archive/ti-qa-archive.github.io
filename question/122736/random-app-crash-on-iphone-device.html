			<h1>random app crash on iPhone device</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve been struggling with an issue in titanium mobile for ages. My app crashes for what seems to be no apparent reason on random sections of the app. I&#39;m using the tabgroup but I&#39;m not sure if thats the cause. </p>
<p>The app is very image intensive as it&#39;s for a retailer. When monitoring the memory I can see that it&#39;s leaking some, but I&#39;ve limited this. The problem seems to occur mostly when navigating around quickly (i.e. jumping from product to product and page to page fast). </p>
<p>There are xhr calls that fetch the information for each page and having checked the crash log from the phone I&#39;ve fond the EXC_CRASH (SIGABRT) error. I&#39;m not sure if the error comes from the xhr calls not completing, if this is the case does anyone know of a workaround or further error check to cancel an uncompleted call on window close?</p>
<p>I&#39;m really not sure of the issue here, any thoughts you may have regarding possible fixes etc would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Excuse me for the irate ranting style of this post, but this really has been bugging me!</p>
<p>I&#39;m using the titanium studio SDK 1.7 on an iPhone 3GS ver 4.3.4</p>

										<p><p>The console provides no output as it&#39;s running on the iPhone device itself. There&#39;s nothing said by Titanium after &quot;[INFO] iTunes sync initiated&quot;. This is half of the problem really as I can&#39;t reliably debug the issue!</p>

										<p><p>Is the error always on the same page? or does that differ too?</p>
<p>If it&#39;s always in the same page you can surround it with a try catch(e) an give an alert of the error ( alert(e) ).</p>

										<p><p>the try-catch provided no answers, however I segmented off some code using comments. It looks like the problem is coming from a picker which is being populated with online data from an xhr call. I&#39;m going to look a little further into this. If I come up with an answer I&#39;ll post it</p>

							<p>You can see device logs in Xcode organiser.</p>
<p>Careful with XHR population of things, if the XHR has not returned properly or completely and you are using the XHR data to populate things, there can be a race condition. </p>
<p>For instance if you download an XML file and store it, then try and read it to populate the picker you need to make sure you do not call the population from anywhere else other than the onload of the XHR.</p>

							<p>The code populating the picker and the xhr call got into a race condition which caused the picker to look at the data before it had returned properly. </p>
<p>To solve the issue I made the xhr call run asynchronously, using the async:true argument, so that no other operations were attempted until the data was returned. This seems to have solved the issue. </p>
<p>I&#39;m pretty sure the memory leaks  and general buggyness of Titanium etc aren&#39;t helping the issue, but this seems to have reduced its negative affect on user experience.</p>
