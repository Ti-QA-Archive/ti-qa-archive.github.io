			<h1>Push Notifications not working</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have setup the example app from within the ACS module folder.</p>
<p>It runs fine. I created a user fine and made sure I was logged in. </p>
<p>I then enabled push notifications in the settings under the push notifications menu. </p>
<p>I subscribed to a channel. All went fine. </p>
<p>Went into the ACS control panel under developer, I saw my device as being subscribed to that channel. I sent that channel a message…nothing…sent a message to all channels…nothing…and so it went on for a long time and I have so far got nowhere. </p>
<p>Anyone have a clue as to why it might be failing? </p>
<p>It fails when the app is open, background or closed. </p>
<p>I can even send notifications from the app and they are recorded in the log but nothing ever turns up on the device.</p>
