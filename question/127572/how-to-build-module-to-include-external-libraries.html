			<h1>How to build module to include external libraries?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello. I am able to successfully write a simple module, call the method from javascript, and fire call back when the module method is done; however, when i try to compile the module with an external library, Xcode tells me build successful in both Debug and Release modes, build.py also reports Build Susccesfully, but &quot;titanium run&quot; refuses to run it because of Undefined Symbol for architecture i386 blah blah blah towards the end of the build.log. </p>
<p>Anyone know why this is happening? It&#39;s getting a bit frustrating.</p>

							<div><p>Have you tried including other libraries, other than the one that is failing? Maybe it&#39;s a bad library? Not sure, but I would test all possibilities an let us know your findings. :)</p>

							<div><p>paul, I use the same library and code in an xcode project, it runs fine in both simulator and device. Does titanium doesn&#39;t like certain things in a library?</p>

							<div><p>Hi Hao,</p>
<p>I might be able to help you. Can you please tell me what library you&#39;re trying to include. The steps you took to include it in your module xcode project. And where the library is located relative to your module directory.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<div><p>Also can you use pastie.org to send the build.log file for the project? You can find the build.log file by looking at the last line that titanium prints when you call <code>titanium run</code>. It will say something like <code>build.log file is located here (directory)&amp;#x2F;....&amp;#x2F;build.log</code>. Can you find that file?</p>

							<div><p>guys, thank you for all the enthusiasm, but I figured it out. I used Other Compiler Flags to load the libraries for each architecture type and that was not a smart idea. I ended up dragging the universal libs into the Project and clearing the flags and Library Search path, and that did the job. Thank you again.</p>

							<div><p>Not sure if this thread is active but I&#39;m still having problems getting Security.Framework to work on my module as it keeps crashing with an [script Error = parse error (unknown file). I have the module.xcconfig set to OTHER_LDFLAGS=$(inherited) -framework Security. Not sure about the location its looking at. Any ideas??</p>

							<p>During building of a module, any dependencies that the module has (for example, a framework i.e CoreText etc.) must be defined somewhere so that the build tools know to add those frameworks to the commands that it sends to XCode. This needs to be defined in module.xconfig file by setting the OTHER_LD property</p>
<p>For example: </p>
<p><code>OTHER_LDFLAGS=$(inherited) -framework QuartzCore -framework UIKit</code></p>
<p>This file is pulled in during application build time to add any additional options to the link command for XCode.</p>
