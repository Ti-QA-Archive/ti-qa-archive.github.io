			<h1>I stopped receiving Appcelerator&#39;s Q&amp;A notifications?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>On my profile it says that notifications are enabled but I don&#39;t receive any more mails about answers or comments.</p>
<p>It is not in junk folder or anywhere, it just stopped coming and I have to refresh all my questions now to see if I got an answer or comment.</p>
<p>Could it be that I mesed up something with my mail account or is it Appcelerator&#39;s fault?</p>

<p>Post up if you get it fixed, it is kind of annoying to check back and refresh all day.</p>

<p>Check your spam folder.</p>

										<p><p>I think it has to be on Appcelerator&#39;s side. Here is the image of my gmail inbox. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;imageshack.us&#x2F;photo&#x2F;my-images&#x2F;23&#x2F;screenshot20120216at112.png&#x2F;">image link</a></p>
<p>I&#39;ve been receiving notifications until it just stopped. Yesterday I created a filter for appcelerator and put all that mail in that folder. And It recovered me only that one at the top (blue one). But I had a lots of more notification in the mean time. So it can&#39;t be my email client&#39;s fault because then I wouldn&#39;t have that one mail in spam.</p>

							<p>OK, so this is the &quot;solution&quot;. </p>
<p>I have 2 google accounts and I modified first one to forward all messages to second one. I registered on Appcelerator with that first account and Appcelerator notifications were stuck in that&#39;s spam folder so they have never been sent to my main account. Stupid google.</p>
