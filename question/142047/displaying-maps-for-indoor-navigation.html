			<h1>Displaying maps for indoor navigation</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>We are in the process of creating an app which will feature indoor navigation. Logically this would require some kind of map to show the planned path on. However we are unsure what is the best way to show a custom map. A map of a single floor has the following requirements in our project:</p>
<ol>
<li>-It should have sufficient detail (not pixelated) to allow the user to understand where he&#x2F;she is.</li>
<li>-It should be fast (as little delay between touch gestures and map movements as possible)</li>
<li>-We should be able to zoom and move the map.</li>
</ol>
<p>With that said my first idea was to use an image in a scrollview. I believe this would work however there are several problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>-Large buildings will result in very large images. I&#39;m not sure how an average mobile will deal with images with more than 10k*10k pixels. It may be slow and it will certainly use a lot of memory.</li>
<li>-How will I draw a route on an image in an easy way?</li>
<li>-Zooming is not directly supported, so we have to program something for that.</li>
</ol>
<p>So an image in a scrollview may not exactly be ideal in our situation.</p>
<p>Our second idea is based on my previous experience with the ArcGIS sdk for Android. I could simply create a map on a desktop computer, store it on a server and allow the app to download parts of this map (at various resolutions) when needed. It also allowed for easy addition of features like a series of lines to represent a path.</p>
<p>Sadly appcelerator has no module for ArcGIS so at the time this is also not a solution. It is possible though to use a webview and the ArcGIS javascript library but this has proven to run quite slow.</p>
<p>The next thing we saw was the openstreetmap module, the features look a lot like those of ArcGIS. Sadly this will also not work since it does not support Android, only iPhone.</p>
<p>So to summarize: what would be the best (or atleast working) way to show a detailed map to the user which allows zooming and scrolling while also allowing us to draw other elements (lines or polygons) on it?</p>
<p>I know this may be a hard question to answer, but if you have any ideas please share. It may just help us<br> solve this problem.</p>

							<p>Because people still find this topic when looking for indoor navigation I decided to change the &#39;Accepted Answer&#39; to this answer. About two years ago we created an app using Micello&#39;s indoor navigation system. Afterwards we decided to create our own indoor navigation system for our company Movin Software. The most important reason being we felt limited with the systems of other indoor navigation companies. </p>
<p>We offer an advanced API for showing indoor maps and navigating within buildings. We also offer mapping tools which allow users to update the maps themselves (which is ofter faster than sending an update request to another company). Lastly we have developed our own indoor positioning technology which integrates with our mapping software.</p>
<p>We are planning to release our tools for other developers soon. You can however always contact me if you have any questions.</p>

										<p><p>Dear Mathyn Buiteveld, your previous 2-year question is totally match what I want to do. After 2 years research on this field, did you and your team find out the solution? Could you please share some information or have a tutorial for other developers to get knowledge how to handle it?</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your dedication.</p>

										<p><p>Hello Long Le, we did find a solution by developing our own system. Currently our system is available as a web based Javascript API. The indoor positioning APIs are available in Java and an Objective-C version is in development. We are also developing a web service for accessing and showing maps using WMS, WMTS and WFS.</p>
<p>Our systems are already used in our customers products and we are planning on releasing it to other developers as a beta. If you are interested you can contact us at info@movinsoftware.nl. An official tutorial is not yet available, but I&#39;m sure we can send something your way.</p>
<p>Just out of curiosity: is there a specific indoor navigation case you are currently working on?</p>

										<p><p>Dear  Mathyn Buiteveld, thank you so much for your reply. To be honest, I am researching about implementing a pedestrian dead reckoning indoor navigation system in Android smartphone. Basically, I got the technique how to implement such system as that. However, the first obstacle is creating and displaying offline and&#x2F;or online indoor map for 1 single floor in Android smartphone for further works.  I tried to search from Internet but have not got solution till now. Some guys suggested using OpenStreetMap. But there is no tutorial how to create .osm from AutoCAD blueprint and  display .osm file on Android. I am really appreciated if you can guide me the way to overcome mentioned problem.</p>

							<p>If you&#39;re not open to the idea of creating a native module to add support for something like <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.micello.com&#x2F;">Micello</a> then you&#39;re very limited. However, the only other way that I can think of besides the solutions you&#39;ve already mentioned is a &lt;canvas&gt; element wrapped in a webview. The canvas element will give you zoom and pan functionality while also allowing you to create polylines. This may not be the most elegant solution, and the more elements you add to the canvas the slower it may become, but it will give you the functionality that you need.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the reply and the link to Micello. I had not discovered that possibility. I see that Micello also has a javascript api. I&#39;ll check how it performs on a mobile phone.</p>
<p>I am open to the idea of writing a module (if I plan on creating appcelerator apps it might be worth learning it), but I have no experience writing iPhone apps using objective-c. Is an understanding of how to write iPhone apps natively needed to write a module which exposes new functionality for appcelerator and the iPhone platform?</p>

										<p><p>To add functionality from a service that, lets say, offers a iOS SDK or an Android SDK, yes, you would need to have decent knowledge of Obj-C and&#x2F;or Java to implement them as a native module. However, if a service or lib comes as a javascript SDK, then you could create a module based on that library without digging into the native code for each platform.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>

										<p><p>Yes it makes sense, thank you. However what is the main advantage in placing the javascript code in a module vs placing the javascript code in a webview (the website of Micello shows an indoor map using the javascript api, so it should work in the webview)? Is it faster to use a module or would it just be &#39;cleaner&#39;? </p>
<p>Also if a certain piece of javascript code works in a web browser is it certain it will also work when wrapped in a module, or is that impossible to say?</p>

										<p><p>The advantages of javascript modules or mostly portability. You can easily require() a module on any page in any app and the module stays the same, rather than moving a bunch of code around. However in your case, a module isn&#39;t completely necessary, I only brought it up to completely cover your question about module creation.</p>

										<p><p>Hello André, I implemented Micello in an app for a customer. It did what it was advertised to do and the customer was satisfied. However I will not continue to use Micello for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The API is limited and rather verbose (variable names shortened to just 1 letter are common)</li>
<li>Updating of map content is slow because you cannot update the maps yourself.</li>
</ol>
<p>After using Micello we decided to create our own software for indoor maps for our company Movin Software. We offer a more advanced API and allow users to update the maps themselves using our Maps content management system. We are planning to release our tools for other developers soon.</p>
