							<div><p>Rather than having to drill down four levels to see the built in templates in the list view I would prefer to see built in template code in a window or view code off a tab. Likewise, rather than having to tap down four levels to see tableviews under the vertical layout I would like to see them off a tab. I mean two tabs in a tabbed application like KitchenSink, one tab is the built in template and the other is the tableview from underneath the vertical layout.</p>
<p>I see the commonjs, I do not see any of the windows being closed. But that is a side observation.  For me, I need to understand the logic, rather than just copy and pasting. This will help me to understand the layouts and the listviews, but also the rest of the Kitchen sink and commonJS.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>I am in Buffalo. It is 1215 am. I have trying to figure this out for awhile. Your help will be appreciated.</p>
