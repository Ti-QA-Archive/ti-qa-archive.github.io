			<h1>Double-tap to zoom Scrollview at point of doubletap</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a ScrollView that contains an ImageView.</p>
<p>I&#39;m attempting to mimick the feature in the Photos app on iOS devices whereby a photo zooms to the point on the photo where the user double-tapped. E.g. if you double tap in the top right hand corner, it will zoom in on that corner.</p>
<p>I have a solution working using ScrollView.zoomScale to zoom in and ScrollView.scrollTo() to pan to the right position on screen, but it&#39;s very clumsy, first zooming to the center of the image and then panning… it&#39;s not ideal.</p>
<p>Is there a way of zooming in on a particular part of a ScrollView in 1 motion? Maybe by specifying co-ordinates so that it zooms in on that area in a more natural way. </p>

<p>I do appreciate your frustration with not getting an answer to this question. However, please consider the situation from another perspective; this question is very project-specific and, as such, there is no stock solution. As with all of these types of questions, trial, error and persistence is needed in order to solve it</p>
<p>Bear in mind that it could take us an hour or two, experimenting with different approaches, to establish whether it is currently possible or to get a working solution.</p>
<p>Certainly, you can increase your chances of getting a response by improving your question. If your question does indeed presently include the complete list of approaches that you have already tried, then I would suggest that you have not made enough attempts yourself before posting. If it doesn&#39;t include everything you have tried, then I would suggest that you have not spent sufficient effort defining your question for it to warrant an answer.</p>
<p>Before publishing any more <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;122110&#x2F;is-appcelerator-using-poor-support-to-push-people-toward-subscriptions">accusations</a>, I urge you to try to balance the moments it apparently took for you to post this question with the time it takes us to answer it conscientiously, along with the thousands of others in the Q&amp;A. Also, please understand that help is offered in this <em>community</em> forum on a best-effort basis, by community members and staff alike, which is in contrast to the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;plans-pricing&#x2F;">official support plans</a>, which offer guaranteed responses within pre-defined timeframes.</p>
<p>The Titanium SDK provides the building blocks necessary to build applications. In my opinion, the main priority for staff participating in this forum is to insure that those components are working in a way that our users expect, and to escallate any bugs, exposed by users&#39; questions, via the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org">bug ticketing system</a>. While we do regularly help out with project-specific&#x2F;product-specific solutions, there is no avoiding the fact that these must take second priority, bearing in mind our finite resources. That said, there are lots of highly-competent developers frequenting these pages who often share their experiences, when their previous projects happen to overlap the topic of the questions being asked.</p>
<p>Back to your question; I would suggest you experiment with changing the imageView dimensions as the user clicks on specific points in the image, and using an animation transition to create a pleasing effect between each &quot;zoom&quot;.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>Paul, thanks for the response. I&#39;d like to make a points or two.</p>
<p>Firstly, I&#39;d like you to consider this question from this perspective. The API was not at the time (not sure about now) fully complete… it was not uncommon to stumble across undocumented API calls. Alas, my question really was: a) is there an API call that I don&#39;t know of? b) is there a way of combining the zooming and panning into 1 action?</p>
<p>It was a generic question regarding the ScrollView API. You have assumed that I wanted someone to write the code for me, but I was looking for pointers. And your response…</p>
<p>&gt; Back to your question; I would suggest you experiment with changing the imageView dimensions as the user clicks on specific points in the image, and using an animation transition to create a pleasing effect between each &quot;zoom&quot;.</p>
<p>… would have been a perfectly acceptable response to me.</p>
<p>Secondly, yes the other post is slightly accusatory, but not really as it was a question not a statement! :) </p>
<p>My aim was not to upset anyone on staff, but to bring to your attention the difficulty in getting support using this Q&amp;A system. For example, the question about my app not showing up in my.appcelerator was initially responded to and then everything went silent…… very frustrating. Was that a poorly asked question? Maybe.</p>
<p>The fact is, for me, I love working with Ti Mobile and when my company gets to a level whereby a subscription makes economic sense then I&#39;ll consider it, but not before. And I&#39;ll consider it based on the cost and my experiences leading up until that point, as I imagine many people would. Until then, I think Appcelerator can do a better job of supporting it&#39;s community developers who have invested a lot of time in the platform.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
