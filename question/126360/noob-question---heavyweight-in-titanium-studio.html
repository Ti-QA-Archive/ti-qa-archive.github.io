			<h1>Noob Question - Heavyweight in Titanium studio</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I just downloaded Titanium studio (was using titanium developer before) but the first thing I noticed is that all of my apps are running in heavyweight. Is there an option somewhere that I&#39;m missing?</p>
<p>(running on a droid)</p>
<p>Thank you for your response.</p>

							<p>By &#39;running in heavyweight&#39;, are you referring to the windows in your app?  If so, there is no setting in Studio for this, as it is dependent on how you define your windows.  See Don Thorp&#39;s answer <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;2731&#x2F;adding-a-window-to-the-stack#5381">here</a> on how to make a window &#39;heavyweight&#39;.  </p>
<p>If you are talking about something else, my apologies, please give a little more info on what you are talking about.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you for your response. You are correct in you interpretation of my question. I guess I may or may not be confused here. The way I was able to tell that a window was heavyweight was that there would be a bar on the top with my app name, whereas when it was not in heavyweight it would be full-screen. That bar is now always there, even as my app is loading.</p>

										<p><p>If you have any of these properties in your window definition, then the window will be heavyweight:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">url
fullscreen (<span class="hljs-constant">true</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> <span class="hljs-constant">false</span>)
navBarHidden (<span class="hljs-constant">true</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> <span class="hljs-constant">false</span>)
</code></pre><p>Since fullscreen or navBarHidden could be either true or false and still make the window heavyweight, seeing the bar at the top may not be an accurate indicator of heavyweight..ness.</p>
<p>Now that you are using Studio, you will be able to run debugger and check to see threads being created for the heavyweight windows.  This will tell you for sure.  Check out the Debug view and expand Emulator &gt; Android JS Debugger and see the threads listed for the running app.</p>

										<p><p>I do not have Android JS Debugger under my debug view, however I do not use any of those heavyweight properties. My apps were not like this before, only after I upgraded. Another problem I have now that I didn&#39;t before is that animations inside of even listeners make changes, but do not animate the changes they made.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> thisWin = Titanium.UI.currentWindow;
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> bar = Titanium.UI.createView({
    backgroundColor: <span class="hljs-string">'#000000'</span>,
    bottom: <span class="hljs-number">0</span>,    
    height: <span class="hljs-number">100</span>,
    right: <span class="hljs-number">50</span>,
    left: <span class="hljs-number">50</span>
});

thisWin.add(bar);
bar.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>,<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
    bar.animate({duration: <span class="hljs-number">500</span>, height: bar.height+=<span class="hljs-number">100</span>});
});
</code></pre><p>That code makes changes to height, but it does not animate it.</p>
