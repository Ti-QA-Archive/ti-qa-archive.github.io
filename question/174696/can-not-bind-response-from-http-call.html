		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have done service call like</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> request = Titanium.Network.createHTTPClient ();
    request.onload = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> responseObj = <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.responseText;
        alert(responseObj);

    request.onerror = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
        alert(<span class="hljs-string">"error"</span>);
    };

    request.open (POST, <span class="hljs-string">"My url and method"</span>);
    request.setRequestHeader (<span class="hljs-string">"enctype"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"multipart/form-data"</span>);
    request.setRequestHeader (<span class="hljs-string">"Content-Type"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"application/json; charset=utf-8"</span>);
    request.send ();
</code></pre><p>From above Http Call I am getting response back which is having list of data, That list of data contains userDetail(User information) in which there is username,address,UserProfileImage, etc…(almost &gt; 10 users data always)</p>
<p>Here is my problem, In my some of devices I am getting response back and able to bind that data into tableview, but In most of devices I am getting error log like this</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[<span class="hljs-keyword">ERROR</span>] :  <span class="hljs-keyword">E</span>/dalvikvm-heap: <span class="hljs-keyword">Out</span> of <span class="hljs-keyword">memory</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">on</span> a 18449080-byte allocation.

</code></pre><p>Here I am not able to get response in some of devices so I can not move ahead.</p>
<p>After basic troubleshooting I came to know problem, once i remove <strong>UserProfileImage</strong> from my response data list from WEB API Function, then It works fine in all devices.</p>
<p>So from that troubleshooting I came to know that there is some problem when I get response including  <strong>UserProfileImage</strong></p>
<p> <strong>UserProfileImage</strong> returns data from database in which previously I have stored value from <code>Ti.Utils.base64encode ($.myImageView.image).text</code>(captured from camera&#x2F;selected from gallery)</p>
<p>So Is there any way to compress image or minimize that images when I store them into database so that when I get back all that images at same time there should not having problem of memory.</p>
<p>I am using alloy framework and my titanium sdk version is 3.2.0 GA.</p>
<p>Please help me out of this, I am stuck with this problem since few days.</p>
<p>Any help will be appreciated.</p>

							<p>First off, dont store your images in a database. Store them in the file system and put a row in a table that references the path.  By base64encoding your image you are making it even larger than the original.  All this is contributing to your out-of-memory issues. Also, checkout <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitt.io&#x2F;component&#x2F;fh.imagefactory">this module</a> for resizing &#x2F; optimising the size of your stored images.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>Thanks for your response, But I must have to store that images in database because my app is not having only device specific users.</p>
<p> I mean your user suppose Nick.</p>
<p>You create your account from device1 and store userInfo like yourname,address,your display Pic(UserProfileImage) now If I do not store your image in database then how will I get that image in device2 when you logged in from device2?</p>
<p>So for above purpose I have stored image in database, so I can show that image in any device.</p>

										<p><p>+1 Dan. Krupa, you still dont need to store them locally. Store the images in a cloud service of some sorts and store a reference to their cloud location instead and download just what you need to process locally</p>

										<p><p>DONT store them in the database. If you need to separate them by user, put them in the filesystem in their own directory &#x2F;user1&#x2F;image1.png  &#x2F;user2&#x2F;image2.png etc and store a reference in the DB.  </p>
<p>Your problem is that you are using too much memory for the devices to handle, you must try and reduce the footprint of both your images and how they are stored in the db because both will consume memory.  That is why I also suggest you try and optimise their size to the smallest acceptable</p>

										<p><p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>I think there is some confusion</p>
<p>I will store images in filesystem of <strong>device1</strong> like &#x2F;user1&#x2F;image1.png  &#x2F;user2&#x2F;image2.png. but now how would I get that user1&#x2F;image1.png in <strong>device2</strong>? </p>
<p>Because that Image will not be there in filesystem of device2. </p>

										<p><p>Sorry, I see now but still dont like your solution very much… The issue is</p>

</code></pre><p>you are further increasing the storage and therefore memory requirement of holding the base64 value.</p>
<p>So you are using too much memory for the devices. The images are a definite issue. Have to tried to reduce their footprint using the module I suggested ?</p>

<ul>
<li>Are you trying to store the image in the local device database?</li>
<li>Are you sending the image to a server and then saving the image in that database?</li>
<li>Are you hoping that by saving an image on your iphone it will somehow turn up on some others users iphone?</li>
<li>If so HOW is the second user meant to get that image if it is stored on the device of the first user?</li>
