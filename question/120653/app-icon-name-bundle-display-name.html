			<h1>App Icon Name Bundle Display Name</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,<br>I can&#39;t set the App Icon Name or Bundle Display Name.<br>I have tried changing various variables in an Info.plist file in my root copied from the build folder, and I can see that the new one generated in the build folder has those settings.</p>
<p>Everytime I delete the app and rebuild the icon is called &quot;titanium&quot;.</p>
<p>This is with 1.7 RC SDK and Titanium Studio.<br>I would have thought either a param in the tiapp.xml file or even in the xml file editor in Studio would be a good idea for setting this as its a common task.</p>
<p>Can anyone advise me on how to change it.<br>The only thing I can see its getting the name &quot;titanium&quot; from is the folder that the project is in which is what the Eclipse project is called in Titanium Studio as well.</p>
<p>Seems like a bug?</p>

							<p>Okay so this is what iv discovered with Titanium Studio.<br>The Spring Board CF Bundle Display Name comes from the Info.plist file.</p>
<p>You must copy it from the build folder and then edit it so the CFBundleDisplayName xml pair is like this:</p>
<p>Info.plist (copied from build into your &#x2F;project_folder)</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">key</span>&gt;</span>CFBundleDisplayName<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">key</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">string</span>&gt;</span>Shrt Nmn<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">string</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>However…<br>The &lt;name&gt; in the tiapp.xml file actually makes it way into the main.c file in your project as the const TI_APPLICATION_NAME</p>
<p>It appears changes to the manifest file do nothing, but its probably an old legacy file from Titanium Developer.</p>
<p>If, like me your having trouble getting the right number of characters for your CFBundleDisplayName so it doesnt show an ellipsis then heres a sweet tip.</p>
<p>Every time you delete the build folder it takes a while to recreate all the source files before actually compiling the app pkg.</p>
<p>To short cut this, since the only thing thats changing is the CFBundleDisplayName in your Info.plist (remember this is your copy in the root folder of your Titanium Project),<br>then you just need to delete the app file in your build folder each time and delete it from your simulator, and when you run test again it will be generated super fast and you can test your new CFBundleDisplayName fits.</p>
<p>The files to delete each time are in, &#x2F;build&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;build&#x2F;Debug-iphonesimulator&#x2F;</p>
<p>Hey Appcelerator guys, you can fix this by detecting the Info.plist change and rebuilding the pkg, OR… even better make it part of the tiapp.xml and rebuild when that changes.</p>
<p>One last tip, using just numbers with no spaces, the longest CFBundleDisplayName I could fit was 12 characters. So that seems like the magic number to aim for.</p>
<p>Good luck. :)</p>
<p>Code Strong…. alll niighht lawwwng</p>

							<p>i think that the name of the application is the name of directory where your source is</p>
