							<p>Hello Bojaraj,</p>
<p>There is no way to do this from your windows environment. You have to have a apple desktop or laptop and you should have installed Xcode on that. Than after you just have to configure and install your titanium and just import your project over there. You will need a little changes in code (That depends on your code what controls and what properties you have used If you have used some thing specific to android than that you have to change over here to run it on iPhone). Other things will be same. Launch your project after importing and it will generated Xcode project for you.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

							<p>Without buying a Mac, you could try renting a cloud based one for the tine you need. http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macincloud.com&#x2F;</p>
<p>Apart from that, The Zero is quite right that you will need to use a Mac in some way in order to build for IOS.</p>

							<p>Hello,</p>
<p>even if you have an Android App done with Appcelerator, it&#39;s likely you will need to do some modifications in order to get it working with iOS. I agree with Boydlee, Mac in Cloud sounds like a good option, since you can pay by the hour or use, so in the best case with two or three hours you will be able to compile your iphone app. Just remember that you will need an Apple Developer account, configure certificates, etc. </p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro</p>
