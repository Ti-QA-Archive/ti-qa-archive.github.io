			<h1>Desktop UI Controls or lack thereof.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>From what I can see from the Desktop API documentation none of the controls that are available for Mobile are available for Desktop. ex. Titanium.UI for Mobile has Button, Label, Picker, TextArea etc.etc., however none of these are available for the Desktop API. </p>
<p>Am I missing something here or is that case? If so how does one create all of these controls for Desktop apps?</p>

							<p>the UI for Desktop is managed via HTML, basically the Desktop SDK is a wrapper for a webkit view.</p>
<p>See an example <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2010&#x2F;06&#x2F;how-to-full-page-css-3-layout-desktop.html">here</a></p>
<p>You can take a look at tweetanium <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;tweetanium&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;desktop&#x2F;Tweetanium&#x2F;Resources">source</a> for more</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Federico, however these examples don&#39;t show or use any controls like buttons, toolbars, tabs etc. just CSS for layouts and some nice visual effects.</p>
<p>I had assumed the full range of Titanium.UI controls would be available for all target platforms, so that a common core of application code could be used across all targets. IMO without that, the ability to target Desktop apps is seriously diminished.</p>

										<p><p>You can do so much more with Desktop version just by using HTML, and porting is a day of work tops, because all you need is to remake UI.</p>

										<p><p>actually you can use user library widgets in your desktop view..Check out mootools ui, jquery ui, yahoo ui, and others…Implementing these widgets will make you app truly look like a desktop</p>

							<p>Thanks for the replies. I already use Mootools, Mochaui, jQuery etc. If I am going to use these for Desktop Apps then I have a very different set of &#39;presentation code&#39; to what I&#39;d use for native mobile apps. </p>
<p>Further they don&#39;t give me a native look and feel, which the Titanium Desktop appears to suggest they do.</p>
<p>Quote from http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;titanium-desktop-application-development&#x2F; :<br>&quot;Titanium makes Vista apps look like Vista apps, XP apps like XP apps and Mac OS X apps fully native as well. Check out Titanium Developer to see native UI on each platform in action.&quot;</p>
<p>If I am going to use Web UI on the Desktop then maybe I am better of using it for Mobile as well and have that common code base and look and feel. If that&#39;s the case then maybe I am better of using PhoneGap (except it doesn&#39;t do Desktop).</p>
<p>Another related issue is that I&#39;m also interested in Portable Desktop Apps and ones that don&#39;t leave any footprints behind. Titanium desktop apps carry a lot of baggage (dlls etc) with them. I realize this is off topic, just a general comment.</p>

							<p>I completely agree with Neville. I understand that mobile is really hot right now, but I think there&#39;s a lot of potential for making native UI components available for desktop apps that&#39;s being missed.</p>
