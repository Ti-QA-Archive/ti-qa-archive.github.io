			<h1>Default Titanium Alloy Hello World Android App is 16.45MB</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey all,</p>
<p>I&#39;m new to Titanium.  I figured I would start with the latest approach using Alloy to create a simple App.  After I created the Default Alloy Project (no tabs), I installed it to my Android phone and noticed that the size is rather massive for a Hello World application.</p>
<p>I saw other posts where people were wondering about what else the developer had added to their project to get the crazy sizes the were worried about, but this is as clean a project as one should be able to create. Others mentioned that their Apps are coming around 4 MB.</p>
<p>If I just look at the total size of the files under all resources, including iOS which shouldn&#39;t be loaded, there is 5.69 MB of files.  Android is only a little over 1 MB.  Even assuming that non-Android files are getting loaded, which hopefully they aren&#39;t, that leaves me with a 10.9 MB &quot;Hello World&quot; app.  Ouch.</p>
<p>Is there some additional code being loaded that I&#39;m just not using that can be filtered out somehow?<br>Is this a defect that is being addressed?<br>Other?</p>
<p>Here is my current setup:</p>
<p>Windows 7 64 bit<br>Titanium SDK: 3.0.2.GA<br>Java JDK: 1.6<br>Installing to a Samsung Galaxy Note II running Android 4.1.1</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Todd</p>

							<p>Android installs the V8 JS engine with each build, so that accounts for the size.</p>

										<p><p>Tony, I thought the concept was supposed to be that the APK gets generated prior to deploying to the device.  I don&#39;t have much of an app at this point and it is already 21.59MB.  If I deploy this to the Google Play Store, I will completely understand why users will bash it for being huge.  Is there some way to have the APK generated prior to deployment and not require the V8 engine to be installed with the app?  It looks like the iOS generated apps don&#39;t have this issue (at least according to what I have read).</p>
<p>Thanks, Todd</p>

										<p><p>The APK is generated prior to deployment. That&#39;s how Android apps work in any form. The V8 engine is required so that Titanium&#39;s javascript bindings to native code can be executed. iOS does not have this problem because V8 is not used, the default jscore engine is used.</p>

										<p><p>And there&#39;s my core misunderstanding.  I thought the JS code was converted to, not binded to, native code.  In that case there wouldn&#39;t be a need for the V8 engine deployed along with the app, it would just be another Android app.  I&#39;m sure there&#39;s good reasoning for the approach taken, just a bummer that the app will be large.</p>
<p>Thanks for the clarification, Todd</p>
