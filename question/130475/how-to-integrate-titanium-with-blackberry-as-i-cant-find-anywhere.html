							<p>Firstly the blackberry SDK is in beta an announcement is due next week on the road map for this. Well according to appcelerator it is anyway.</p>
<p>Secondly to get eh blackberry SDK you have to be at least an indie member.</p>
<p>Thirdly the Blackberry SDK is only available on Windows and Blackberry only support windows with their SDK.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

										<p><p>RIM only provides an sdk that works with windows. I would suggest that you look at something like vmware so you could install a windows OS on your Mac. I haven&#39;t seen any information from Appcelerator indicating support for Symbian or windows phone.</p>
