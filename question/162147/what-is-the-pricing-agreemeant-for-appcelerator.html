							<p>Hi</p>
<p>This question comes up time after time - there are many questions here all with the same answer - but for your convenience - here it is again.</p>
<ul>
<li>You do not have to pay Appcelerator anything to;<ul>
<li>You can create free apps</li>
<li>You can create paid apps</li>
<li>You can create free apps with in app purchases</li>
<li>You can create any mixture of payment in your apps</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can put your apps in these stores with no charges to Appcelerator<ul>
<li>Apple App Store</li>
<li>Google Play Store</li>
<li>Amazon App Store</li>
<li>Blackberry World (or whatever it is called)</li>
<li>Tizen app store (or whatever it is called)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You WILL have to pay Apple, Google, Tizen, Blackberry or whatever company a small annual fee to be in their store - this is paid directly to them not Appcelerator and is true of ALL development languages - this is their own fee. These are small usually $100 or less each.</p>
<p>ONLY if you CHOOSE to use something that Appcelerator does charge for then you pay for that. But they have even made that easy;</p>
<ul>
<li>The free version is called Titanium Studio</li>
<li>Paid version is called Appcelerator Studio</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have the free one then you only pay for things like custom modules - and then only from other third-parties - Appcelerator do not charge for their Titanium Modules.</p>
<p>If you have the paid one - you will know about it - your support will be hands on, your app icon will be a bright red colour, your wallet will be dented - professional level hands on support with enterprise level additions to the framework cost real money - so you will be charged real money.</p>
<p>But again - if you are using Titanium Studio, create your app put it a store of your choice choose how or if to charge for the app and be happy.</p>

										<p><p>Well, Me and my friend are planing on making some free, apps with ads in them, or paid apps. We plan on using Titanium and making an app. putting it on google play, and updating it from time to time, We don&#39;t plan on making a company, we don&#39;t have any licences. Before we begin, can you tell us if there is anything here we have to pay for other than the 25$ to google?</p>

										<p><p>I had hoped that was very clear, but OK</p>
<p>You can make as many apps as you want include your own adverts or use a third-party service to provide them.  You can then upload these apps to the Google Play store.</p>
<p>Appcelerator does NOT charge for this at all.  So the development costs related to Appcelerator are free.  </p>
<p>You and friend do not need to form a company in order to put an app in the Google Play Store - you can be an &quot;individual&quot; rather than a business.</p>
<p>You can make as much money from the apps as you are capable of using the adverts and any other method you choose.  Still not money is paid to Appcelerator.</p>
<p>You do have to pay the fee to Google but that is it - nothing else.</p>
<p>When you start earning millions - you may want to have support contracts and extra services - you can then choose to use the Appcelerator Studio version instead - this is aimed at enterprises - this is not you right now.  But even if you do become an enterprise you still do not have to use the paid versions.</p>
<p>I hope that explains it.</p>
<p>BTW - creating apps can be very rewarding, they can also be very frustrating - be positive and focus on what you are trying to achieve and hopefully we will be reading about you two in the next years press when you sell out to facebook or other large company - here&#39;s hoping.</p>
