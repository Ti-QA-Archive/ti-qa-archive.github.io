			<p>Hi</p>
<p>My app got rejected and it got rejected because it gets crashed when a button is hit to open Email Dialog. I am using two buttons, both for opening Email Dialogs. I am mentioning the URLs of both my code and Crash files as I am not being able to figure out the root cause since I am not well versed in Obj-C. Kindly help. What I assume, is this because I am using two email Dialogs, both with same var name? URls given below:</p>
<p>Code: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;1542163</p>
<p>Crash files: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;1542144</p>
<p>It;s crashing on iPhone 4 running iOS 4.2.1.(as reported by Apple)</p>
<p>Please Help!!</p>

							<p>I don&#39;t see why you should define the dEmailMessage with the same vars.</p>
<p>give the email dialog for the feedback button its own var names and it should work.</p>
<p>Other then that i don&#39;t see anything out of the ordinary.</p>

										<p><p>I think so that as well but why didn&#39;t it get crashed on my same device? I am also using iPhone 4 and have iOS 4.2.1. I am using 1.5.1 Titanium SDK. Following is the URL of my complete App Source. Does Adding Event Listener on early lines causing the issue? In app it has to be the last action rather first. Please have a look.</p>

										<p><p>Thoughh you are right that there&#39;s no var before creating the instance, thing is same line of code worked well in my other app and it did not get crashed and got approved. Could it be because I use dEmailMessage only once in that app and here its not declared as well as referred twice?</p>
<p>Does the sequence of creating Object also make difference? For instance i created email Object in earlier listened and added event listener too but called it quite later?</p>

										<p><p>No, timing does not matter, just like structure does not matter, like:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">blah</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span>{ alert(<span class="hljs-string">"Cool."</span>); }
</code></pre><p>Is the same as:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">blah</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span>
</span>{
   alert(<span class="hljs-string">"Cool."</span>);
}
</code></pre></p>

							<p>I&#39;m sure it is the use of the same object in two listeners without a &quot;var&quot; declaration.  This would cause them to refer to the same global object.  The name can be the same, but both must be declared with &quot;var&quot; to make them local to the enclosing function.</p>
<p>Your order of declaration is fine - you add the event listener before opening the object, which should ensure the listener is ready to respond immediately.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the answer. What do you mean by &quot;Opening&quot; of Object? I am creating the objects first then adding Listeners in them. Can you please refer what are you talking about?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
