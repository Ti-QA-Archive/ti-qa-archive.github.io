			<h1>Copy data between tables in database</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m trying to copy data from one table to another in a mobile app (iOS and Android).  Both tables are in one sqlite file and have the same structure.  I can can do it by looping through and copying each row individually, but that makes it far too slow.  I can&#39;t seem to get a single INSERT command though.  The code below is what I&#39;m trying to work with - any help would be appreciated.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Titanium.Database.install(<span class="hljs-string">'../../db_NLA2012.sqlite'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'tbl_permDataEntry'</span>);
Titanium.Database.install(<span class="hljs-string">'../../db_NLA2012.sqlite'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'tbl_tempDataEntry'</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> dbPerm = Titanium.Database.open(<span class="hljs-string">'tbl_permDataEntry'</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> dbTemp = Titanium.Database.open(<span class="hljs-string">'tbl_tempDataEntry'</span>);

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> rows = dbPerm.execute(<span class="hljs-string">'SELECT * FROM tbl_permDataEntry WHERE UID = "'</span> + dbID + <span class="hljs-string">'"'</span>);

<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (rows.isValidRow()) {
    dbTemp.execute(<span class="hljs-string">'INSERT INTO tbl_tempDataEntry (UID,PARAMETER,RESULT) SELECT UID,PARAMETER,RESULT FROM tbl_permDataEntry'</span>);
}
rows.<span class="hljs-built_in">close</span>();
dbPerm.<span class="hljs-built_in">close</span>();
dbTemp.<span class="hljs-built_in">close</span>();

							<p>Firstly, if both tables are in the same database file, do you really need to create two db connections?</p>
<p>For the INSERT, cant you do something like :</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">
dbTemp.execute('<span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">INSERT</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">INTO</span> tbl_tempDataEntry <span class="hljs-keyword">values</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'field1a'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'field2a'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'etc'</span>), (<span class="hljs-string">'field1b'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'field2b'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'etc'</span>), (<span class="hljs-string">'field1c'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'field2c'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'etc'</span>), (<span class="hljs-string">'field1d'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'field2d'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'etc'</span>);</span>');
</code></pre><p>This is how a MySQL dump file import&#x2F;export would do it, rather than a separate INSERT for each new row.<br>But I don&#39;t know if &#39;values&#39; is supported in SQLITE.</p>

							<p>Why are you creating two databases from the same resource file, then copying from one to the other?</p>
<p>According to the SQLite <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sqlite.org&#x2F;lang_insert.html">INSERT syntax diagram</a>, you should probably be able to do this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">dbPerm.execute('<span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">INSERT</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">INTO</span> tbl_tempDataEntry <span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> * <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> tbl_permDataEntry<span class="hljs-string">');</span></span>
</code></pre><p>Since you state both tables have the same format and you want to include all fields, you can drop the field list from the INSERT then use SELECT * to get all fields from the other table.  I don&#39;t know if the SQLite query optimizer is smart enough to recognize what this is trying to do, but I&#39;d give it a high probability of being significantly more efficient than your current method.</p>
<p>I have not tested this; I merely looked at the SQLite syntax diagrams.</p>

										<p><p>The &#39;why&#39; is a longer story, but the quick summary is that I needed temporary storage for editing which can then be &quot;saved&quot; permanently.</p>
<p>The actual query string works in the SQLite Manager Firefox add-in - so I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s not the query string per se.  I think the problem is that it is not recognizing the &#39;tbl_permDataEntry&#39; in the query string.  So I think I need something like:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">dbTemp.execute('<span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">INSERT</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">INTO</span> tbl_tempDataEntry (UID,PARAMETER,<span class="hljs-keyword">RESULT</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> UID,PARAMETER,<span class="hljs-keyword">RESULT</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> <span class="hljs-string">' + dbPerm);</span></span>

										<p><p>Which query string worked in the FF add-in?  Mine?</p>
<p>I can pretty much guarantee it won&#39;t work as coded in your comment above.  The execute() needs a string with the SQL command, and you are trying to concatenate a database object (dbPerm) to a string.</p>
<p>Check the debug console window for the messages that SQLite is throwing.</p>
<p>Note that in my example, you never need dbTemp at all.  Do not create the dbTemp variable, or open or close it or perform any dbTemp.execute() call.</p>
<p>Am I correct that your resource file db_NLA2012.sqlite is (at least) two tables:</p>
<ul>
<li>tbl_permDataEntry (with some records in it)</li>
<li>tbl_tempDataEntry (with the same field layout but no records as shipped in db_NLA2012)</li>
</ul>
<p>Or do I misunderstand your original database table structure?</p>

										<p><p>My original query string was the one that worked, but yours did as well. And yes, you have the structure correct.</p>
<p>The point I was trying to make was that it doesn&#39;t seem to recognize both tables in the query string…even though they are both there…</p>

										<p><p>If mine worked in the FF add-in, then the syntax should be right.  Could you tell a performance difference in FF between your syntax and mine?  Your desktop may be fast enough or the record count small enough to not be noticeable in FF even if it would be on the device.  History has taught me there is no substitute for performance testing on the target mobile device.  At times the performance of things is completely counter-intuitive.</p>
<p>I&#39;d suggest running under debug and examining the console output when you execute the SQL.  Set a breakpoint on that line and single step it.</p>
<p>Perhaps the mobile version of SQLite used by Titanium does not support that syntax, though I wouldn&#39;t know why.  I was simply going off the syntax diagram I linked earlier.</p>
