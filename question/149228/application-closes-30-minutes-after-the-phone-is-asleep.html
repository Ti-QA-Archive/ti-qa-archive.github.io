										<p><p>YES.  Android closes your apps when backgrounded to save resources for the USER.</p>
<p>If you are going to be writing apps for Android, might want to go read up on android a little bit.</p>
<p>btw, if this answer has helped you, please mark it as correct (&#x2F;me pokes @christian)</p>

							<p>Really.. Im sorry but how do you expect anybody to be able to help you.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t know what phone, we don&#39;t know what version of the OS, we don&#39;t know what version of titanium your running. We don&#39;t actually now anything except the app stops.</p>
<p>Please read the guidelines for posting questions and provide as much info as is relevant.</p>
<p>This Q &amp; A forum is full of people who would really like to help out. But give us a fighting chance of being able to.</p>

							<p>Android does not close all background applications. The services and alarms are recurrent and are never closed unless its programming is incorrect. When applications are not part of a recurring service if they are closed for Android. That happens on any version of Android on any phone.</p>
