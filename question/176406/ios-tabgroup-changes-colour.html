		<section>
			<p>Hi all,<br>I&#39;ve found an issue I&#39;ve not come across before, and I&#39;m at a loss as to how to deal with it.</p>
<p>I have a simple app that includes tabs and a map.  Everything works fine until you go to the map, at which point the tabs change colour.  Once the tabs have changed colour, selecting a different tab produces yet a different colour.  </p>
<p>I&#39;ve included some before and after screenshots</p>
<p>Before: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;xE7fnUi</p>
<p>After: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;PCfxa1m</p>
<p>Selecting a different tab after: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;NZM94ef</p>
<p>I believe the issue stems from the map somehow, as it doesn&#39;t just happen when you go to the map tab.  In the detail pages I have a button that shows the item on a map, which also causes the colour change.</p>
<p>Another interesting factor is that this only happens on a device.  I have not been able to replicate the issue in the simulator.</p>
<p>I have looked through my code and there is nothing in there that even comes close to changing the colour of the tabs.  I&#39;ve performed project wide searches for background colour, tints, tabs and tabgroup and come up empty.  I&#39;ve attached focus events to the tabs and windows and logged out the properties, comparing them before and after.  </p>
<p>The project is using SDK 3.2.3 and Alloy 1.0</p>
<p>If anyone has any ideas I would be grateful to hear them</p>

							<p>It&#39;ll be a good idea if you can show your code for us to be able of be of more help.<br>If you are using graphic assets as tab backgrounds, it wouldn&#39;t surprise me that you have an issue with case sensitive paths. On the simulator paths are  not case sensitive, on device they are.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Richard, thanks for your answer.  I would usually post a snippet, but I don&#39;t think this issue is related to my code.  At no point am I attempting to change these colours, the changes are completely unintentional.  </p>
<p>I&#39;m not using graphics for the background, only the icons.  I&#39;m setting the background using tintColor, tabsTintColor, barColor and barTintColor.  I attached a handler to the tabs for the focus event and logged the properties of the tabs as I switched through them.  At no point, even after visually seeing the colour change, did the actual values of the properties change.</p>

										<p><p>No code… Very difficult to help.  the standard debugging practise is to start with the most simple test case, extend it until you find the behaviour change.</p>

										<p><p>Daniel. I haven&#39;t had of heard of your issue, and as Nick states, withouth code, it&#39;s impossible to help.</p>

							<p>It turns out it was a bug, it was just hard to pin down the existing tickets.  For reference:</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-15493</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC-3032</p>
<p>I set translucent:false on the window and tabGroup and the issue has gone away.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time Nick and Richard</p>
