			<h1>Get macaddress only for android devices - Apple rejection?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>First of all, sorry if my question is a bit dumb, I am a bit new to this…</p>
<p>I am developing a paid application (which will be available for Android and iOS). I want to restrict the installation on a per-device basis (I want to control what devices the app is installed in). I have read through a lot of documentation, and I know that although there is a method for obtaining the mac address, Apple actually does not allow it.</p>
<p>So I was thinking about programmatically checking whether the device is android or iOS, and only for the Android case, get the macadress. </p>
<p>However, I am not too sure how he apple review process works, and I don´t know whether they are likely to reject my application if I get the MAC Address, even if I get it for Android devices only. I know that they don´t actually check the source code but the binaries, but I don´t know whether those binaries might show any trace of me using Ti.Ui.Macaddress</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance!</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I am not sure the other answer is true and without resubmitting the app or pulling apart the compiled source it may be hard to confirm.  I agree the logic says this code will not process on iOS, but is it carefully removed from other code with other complex rules - that is another question.</p>
<p>Whilst I agree that this code will not be executed on iOS, I am not convinced it is not included in the code itself within the compiled app.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (Ti.Platform.osname == <span class="hljs-string">"android"</span>) { 
    <span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> mac</span> = Ti.Platform.macaddress; 
}
</code></pre><p>I suggest the following solution that would mean it does not matter either way, it will certainly not be included;</p>
<p>Create two new files called <strong>support.js</strong> (call them what you need but here they will be referred to as <strong>support.js</strong>).</p>
<ul>
<li>Android CommonJS Helper<ul>
<li><strong>{appname}&#x2F;resources&#x2F;android&#x2F;support.js</strong>  (non-Alloy apps file location)</li>
<li><strong>{appname}&#x2F;app&#x2F;lib&#x2F;android&#x2F;support.js</strong> (Alloy apps file location)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="hljs">exports.address = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">address</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> Ti.Platform.macaddress;
};
</code></pre><ul>
<li>iOS CommonJS Helper<ul>
<li><strong>{appname}&#x2F;resources&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;support.js</strong>  (non-Alloy apps file location)</li>
<li><strong>{appname}&#x2F;app&#x2F;lib&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;support.js</strong> (Alloy apps file location)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="hljs">exports.address = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">address</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-string">""</span>;
};
</code></pre><p>Inside the app you access the value by calling the function of the CommonJS file using require;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// usage example;</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> mac = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'support.js'</span>).address();
<span class="hljs-comment">// on android it will return something</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// on ios it will return an empty string</span>
</code></pre><p>This technique uses a feature not used enough in my opinion - platform dependant code folders.</p>
<p>If you place code inside a platform specific folder, then during compile the platform specific version of the file will be chosen and the other version is not event considered.  As you may know from how images are handled any image inside a platform folder will overwrite one in the target parent folder.</p>
<p>In the example above;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// this platform file</span>
{appname}<span class="hljs-regexp">/resources/</span>iphone/support.js
<span class="hljs-comment">// will get collapsed to </span>
{appname}<span class="hljs-regexp">/resources/</span>support.js
<span class="hljs-comment">// during compile</span>

<span class="hljs-comment">// the same is true of the android version</span>

<span class="hljs-comment">// this platform file</span>
{appname}<span class="hljs-regexp">/resources/</span>android/support.js
<span class="hljs-comment">// will get collapsed to </span>
{appname}<span class="hljs-regexp">/resources/</span>support.js
<span class="hljs-comment">// during compile</span>
</code></pre><p>So when compiling for Android the iPhone file is never used and the same but the other way around for compiling to Android.</p>
<p>My technique exploits this by adding the function you want into a platform specific CommonJS folder.  The Android version returns back the value, the iOS one returns an empty string.</p>
<p>As the compile to iOS will ONLY take the iphone folder file and NOT the android folder file - the offending code is NEVER included in the app either way.  You have basically moved the conditional check to a fixed code version.</p>
<p>This way there is no chance of the android code being perceived as accessible in the iOS app.</p>
<p>I hope this makes sense.</p>

										<p><p>If you&#39;re using Alloy, the following would be stripped from an iOS build:</p>

										<p><p>hey Malcolm, </p>
<p>one brief question: Ti.Platform.macadress is basically just a call to the appIdentifier method from TiUtils.h, which reads a special key from nsuserdefaults. It does not use any private api, but maybe apple observes the read processes of nsuserdefaults. Isn&#39;t TiUtils always included and compiled into every ios titanium app?</p>

										<p><p>Good question keep in mind the author of the question has not been rejected only asking if there was a chance - so we do not have to determine if certain libraries do one thing or another.</p>
<p>My main point was to say if there was a problem with the use of that keyword then the expectation of Titanium not including that code as well of not executing it was incorrect.  The way I suggested simply aimed to guarantee that code IF potentially problematic could never be seen.  Basically belt and braces.</p>
<p>All of this is assuming that the app would get rejected on the use of this keyword - I hope that Appcelerator would have accounted for that if there was a possibility.</p>

										<p><p>Very complete answer, thank you. Although it seems that there would be no problem using macaddress for iOS as it generates random code, and that using the following code the macaddress line won&#39;t be compiled for iOS</p>
<p>if (Ti.Platform.osname == &quot;android&quot;) { var mac = Ti.Platform.macaddress; &#x2F;&#x2F; this will never be executed on iOS },</p>
<p>for the sake of good programming practice I will create two separate helpers for Android and iOS.</p>
<p>Thank you all for your prompt responses!</p>

							<p>don&#39;t worry, apple looks for the execution of a private api method, if you do not excute it, everything is fine.</p>
<p>if (Ti.Platform.osname == &quot;android&quot;) {<br>    var mac = Ti.Platform.macaddress; &#x2F;&#x2F; this will never be executed on iOS<br>}</p>

										<p><p>ok i checked the ti sdk sourcecode. Ti.Platform.macadress ( same as Ti.Platform.id) is basically just random string, which change after every uninstall&#x2F;install of the app. There is no reference to the real udid. They are safe to use on iOS.</p>
