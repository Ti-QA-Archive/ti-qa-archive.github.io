			<p>I know it&#39;s bad practice to criticize and ask a question but I have to vent and say if I knew then what I  know now about appcelerator and Android I would have never , ever started this project with Appcelerator and I doubt I start another project with this … just learn android &amp; iOS seems like its less hassle … that being said My App will not display in android my pix , works fine in IOS … I&#39;ve tried everything but nothing works… I&#39;ve been in the forums and nothing works I am using  Titanium Studio, build: 3.3.0.201407100905 … is there a solution ? what am I doing wrong ?</p>

							<div><p>This will be short as Stephen Feather has provided an answer that covers the point well.</p>
<p>However as an ambassador of the Q&amp;A I felt it necessary to add a small comment of my own.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Addressed to all other users of this Q&amp;A forum;</p>
<p>There has been a drop in quality of both questions and answers recently.  Some of those who ask questions cannot be bothered to write more than two lines of a description and then provide no environment details (sdk version, platform etc) but still expecting others do complete their work for them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Addressed specifically to Dolamite Jenkins specifically</p>
<p>Your question is in a whole different league, you not only insult, you suggest that <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oxforddictionaries.com&#x2F;definition&#x2F;english&#x2F;workman">the tools are at fault - rather than the workman</a>.  That shows real ignorance - not a simple misunderstanding from someone who genuinely wants to solve their problem.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your suggestion that you have been in the forums and nothing works - is simply ludicrous, I posted three links below - two of which are the gold standard for this sort of thing.  I have answered more than 2,700 questions many of which would contain code examples that include a simple image reference.  But I am not alone - so have many of the other people here, even the authors of the questions have provided code snippets here that show images references.  So we will add laziness to ignorance.  By the way the documentation also points out how to reference images many times over.</p>
<p>Had you have begin your question in the middle and not included the rude and ignorant first half, you would have gained your answer quickly, learnt something and moved on.</p>
<p>However you chose to be very rude about a product suggesting it as not worthwhile due to your own incompetence.</p>
<p>Politeness costs you nothing, but rudeness costs you everything.</p>

							<div><p>Ok Malcom I&#39;m not suggesting I am flat saying it ! Let me take you through my MONTH !!!  with this product … first I updated my mac  as asked by the constant pop ups and once I did… I couldn&#39;t install Appcelerator because it kept asking for my os system password to install… I entered it and it would not recognize it and no  installed (discovered it was a bug that appcelerator   claimed to be fixed NOT!)  so after a week I ended up having to reformat my entire hard drive and reinstall everything … with the fresh install it took about 3 days to get IOS working but android never worked would download successfully but kept saying current version: unknown ( another bug that was claimed to be fixed but is still there) so I went to my windows machine and installed appcelerator on windows 7 … first it  would not run kept getting exit on process 1 so I updated everything several times before it took and then the emulator would not launch and exited on process 8 … then after 3 days and searching the forum I got it to run BUT I could not update my code … NO changes to my code where accepted (ANOTHER reported bug that was suppose to be fixed NOT) found a solution on your forum and (Drum roll please) nothing works now … So I tried on a brand new out of the box machine with nothing for a fresh install and NO luck kept getting a server time out error(yet another bug Appcelerator claimed to have fixed) … so one month later I finally got it to work on my IOS and every single suggestion listed below I tried and it doesn&#39;t work … I tried everything … everything and the more I searched the forum the more I see this is a big problem … with a lot of different solutions but no one certain why this behavior is happening  ….  Yes I said what I said … Lastly some friends of mine who launched an app based service about a year ago on my suggestion used appcelerator  and where very happy with iOS but abandoned the platform because of the performance of  android … I feel bad suggesting this to friends … so don&#39;t attack me fix the product …. read through the forum and see the number of experienced developers having problems with this platform and fix it … we are stuck with appcelerator for now because we are so deep into the project …</p>

							<div><p>At the risk of a receiving a reply designed to insult myself, other people or Appcelerator I will keep this comment short;</p>
<ul>
<li>For the purposes of this response I will ignore the two previous tirades</li>
<li>The original question you asked was this;</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> win3 = Titanium.UI.createWindow({  
    backgroundImage:<span class="hljs-string">'/Resources/MainScreen.png'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-comment">//width:1280,</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">//height: 800,</span>
 });
</code></pre><p> Why does the image not show up?</p>
<ul>
<li>You received a very good a suitably simple answer from <strong>Md.Harish-Uz-Jaman Mridh</strong> he had this misfortune of adding any sort of answer to this thread.  This was not his fault, nor should he ever of been marked down by anyone.</li>
<li>His answer was clearly not suitable to your needs - despite the obvious fact his answer was correct.</li>
<li>This brings us to the main point; you asked a question that showed your level of knowledge to be that of a novice.  I checked your account and noted it was setup two years ago.  I believed you must have decided to come back to Titanium after an initial play.</li>
<li>The reason I came to that conclusion is that your source code showed 3 indicators of a first time user</li>
<li>It turns out though you must have been trying to develop for longer - you only mentioned this afterwards in your long rebuttal - which I have only skimmed due to the lack of paragraphs, my poor eyesight and number of uses of uppercase that are added to any negative sounding workding</li>
</ul>
<p>So the actual problem you have is not what you asked for;</p>
<ul>
<li>The installation has failed to work so many times on so many machines in so many ways that your frustration is inevitable </li>
<li>But not my fault, not the fault of the community, not the fault of the people here who give up their time to help you and others for free out of their own time.</li>
<li>Probably not your fault either</li>
<li>My concern is that so many issues over so many machines over so many setups - does not sound likely.  Even you have to admit that.  At that rate no apps would ever have been built or been providing a job and business for so many.</li>
<li>So the problem is likely coming from a different place - where - no idea, we were given no information about any of this</li>
</ul>
<p>I promised this would be short and it is not, at least not as short as I hoped.</p>
<p>You almost certainly feel as if you have been let down and no one wants to offer you the assistance you felt you should get in order to move forwards.</p>
<p>This is what you should have done and still can do if you give it a week or so;</p>
<ul>
<li>Start at the beginning and ask a single question that requires a single answer.</li>
<li>Do not include any commentary that aims to annoy or provide an unrelated impolite narrative </li>
<li>Be polite when answered, if the answer does not solve the problem straight away - report back those findings and await further thoughts</li>
<li>Understand that whilst those giving help will have experienced frustration at things related to development in their time and they will sympathise - they are unlikely to accept being attacked or insulted for using a system they earn a living from.</li>
<li>Finally; please learn the formatting tags here - click the toolbar on the poorly contrasted link captions to see examples.  You only managed script tags in the original question but no paragraphs, bullets or more to help break your question up.  This comment for example uses blocks of related paragraphs and bullets to help keep the narrative on track and to make it easier to review your content.</li>
</ul>
<p>So finally;</p>
<ul>
<li>We are not your enemy</li>
<li>We did not cause your problem</li>
<li>We do not deserve to be insulted</li>
<li>We are willing to help polite people</li>
<li>We do understand frustration</li>
<li>We have been frustrated</li>
<li>We do enjoy doing this - do not be the one that stops us enjoying it</li>
</ul>

							<p>Wow.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">I know <span class="hljs-keyword">it</span>'s bad practice <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> criticize <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> ask a question
</code></pre><p>Good, then I consider that permission to escalate the vitriol in my response to match the inconsideration you have already shown, an inconsideration shown with complete knowledge and lack of remorse. See, your &#39;venting&#39; is like walking into a police station and screaming &#39;you filthy lazy donut eating pigs, I demand you find out who scratched my car in the parking lot!&#39; . Ineffective and childish.</p>
<p>Its akin to my coming to your house and leaving a giant bag of poo on your doorstep and then expecting you to help me jump start my car. Such insanity.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"> just learn <span class="hljs-keyword">android </span>&amp; iOS seems like <span class="hljs-keyword">its </span>less hassle
</code></pre><p>I figure you will have trouble learning two languages when you can&#39;t seem to be able to read and following a simple form submission.</p>
<p>So…you also don&#39;t need an answer from this forum then as this is not an iOS or Android native forum. Don&#39;t let the door smack you on your uncouth backside on your way out of the forum.</p>
<p>You must not be able to actually <strong>READ</strong>, because had you read, I&#39;d see a lot more details in your question (simply based upon the text on the submission form page). See, no mention of the environment, no mention of the SDK version, no mention of the tooling, no mention if this is an alloy or classic project.</p>
<h2 id="but-just-in-case-someone-with-better-social-skills-than-you-comes-along-let-me-see-if-we-can-break-this-down-and-give-some-technical-support-type-answers-">But, just in case someone with better social skills than you comes along, let me see if we can break this down and give some technical, support type answers.</h2>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-string">backgroundImage:</span><span class="hljs-string">'/Resources/MainScreen.png</span>
</code></pre><p>Now, this is interesting.  Does this mean you have an image located at <code>{project_folder}&amp;#x2F;Resources&amp;#x2F;Resources</code>? </p>
<p>Because that seems kind of foolish.</p>
<p>If this is an alloy project, thats just stupid to put an image in the Resources folder where it might get overwrittern (you know, since your stuff is supposed to be in the app&#x2F;assets folder).</p>
<p>If this is a classic project, and all your stuff is IN the Resources folder, why on this beautiful green planet would anyone go and put ANOTHER Resources folder inside of the FIRST Resources folder? Geez.</p>
<p>See? Foolish.</p>
<p>Oh, MAYBE, you thought you should reference things including the <code>Resources</code> at the beginning, instead of understanding that things should be referenced from the root (which is Resources in a classic project).</p>
<p>But then, you are wondering, wait, this WORKED on iOS it should magically work on Android! I did something WRONG and it actually worked, so it should work in a broken state across the board!  This is pixie dust kind of thinking.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No, if you have a <strong>VALID</strong> (we will come back to this one in a bit) PNG located in <code>{project_folder}&amp;#x2F;Resources</code> of a classic project, then it would be referenced as <code>&amp;#x2F;my.png</code> and not as &#39;&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;my.png`</p>
</li>
<li><p>Surprise! Android and iOS use 2 different javascript engines, so, they are NOT the same and do not always behave the same.</p>
</li>
<li><p>iOS being all unicornish will sometimes tolerate malformed pngs and jpgs named as pngs, while Android will not.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, lets sum up.</p>
<ul>
<li>You walked into our house and behaved like an asshat.</li>
<li>You don&#39;t know how to follow simple directions.</li>
<li>Instead of being an asshat, you could have asked a simple technical type question and received a technical type answer.</li>
<li>Any question you ask in the future will be down voted so low that I can <em>almost</em> guarantee it will never get a response (there are some desperate point wh*res around here who troll for those, thus the <em>almost</em> in my statement)</li>
</ul>
<p>Good luck behaving like this in an Android forum. I let you off easy.</p>

							<p>Hi Jenkins,</p>
<p>Thanks for your concern.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not working because you are doing it in a wrong way.</p>
<p>The correct way is <code>backgroundImage:&amp;#39;&amp;#x2F;MainScreen.png&amp;#39;</code></p>
<p>My test code is given below:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">
var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
<span class="hljs-label">    backgroundImage:</span><span class="hljs-string">'/image.png'</span>    
});

var label = Ti.UI.createLabel({
    <span class="hljs-string">text :</span> <span class="hljs-string">'AppceleratorTitanium Rockz !!!'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-string">color :</span> <span class="hljs-string">'#000'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-string">font :</span> {<span class="hljs-string">fontSize:</span><span class="hljs-number">22</span>},
    <span class="hljs-string">top :</span> <span class="hljs-number">50</span>,
    <span class="hljs-string">textAlign :</span> <span class="hljs-string">'center'</span>
});

win.add(label);
win.open();
</code></pre><p><img src="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;oi60.tinypic.com&#x2F;6rsvlt.jpg" alt="Screen_Shot"></p>
<p>If you have any concern about my answer then feel free to ask.</p>
