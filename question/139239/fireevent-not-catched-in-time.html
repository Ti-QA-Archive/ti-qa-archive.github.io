			<h1>fireEvent not catched in time</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hi,<br>I have a problem with fireEvent.<br>I have to display a progress bar that is animated by events that are called in a loop.<br>Note that the loop that call fireEvent is in a different JS file, not on a same windows.<br>The problem is that the first 2 or 3 events are catched (and the progress bar move), then the event are catched only when the loop is done, not usefull.<br>How to avoid this ?</p>
<p>Regards</p>

							<p>I think the Animation is blocked by the Loop, try <code>Ti.API.info(progress);</code> within your Animation Event to see if the Event is called properly.</p>

										<p><p>in fact I have tested it like this but showing a counter instead.<br>and as I said, only a few events are received during the loop, all others are received adter the loop.<br>It&#39;s like async events…</p>
