			<h1>Validation Error</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Tried to compile an update to an existing app, however the validation step within the XCode Organizer keeps throwing me the following error:</p>
<p>This bundle is invalid. The key CFBundle in the Info.plist file must contain a higher version than that of the previously uploaded version.</p>
<p>The version number is correct in the tiapp.xml file (1.0.3). When I open the Info.plist file, the bundle version is listed out as 1.0.3.1286740549.</p>
<p>I have already logged into iTunes Connect and prepared the entry for the update (1.0.3).</p>
<p>I am not sure what is causing the conflict. I am building with 1.4.1.1 sdk.</p>

							<p>I had this same issue and resolved it by changing the version from 1.0.1 to 1.1 in the tiapp.xml file. Apparently Titanium doesn&#39;t support x.0.x version types.</p>

							<p>My solution to this was that I had previously uploaded a build that was 2.2 but iTunes Connect had it marked as 2.1. Changing my new upload in iTunes Connect to 2.3 and my app in Titanium to 2.3, resolved the issue.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, What I discovered that you can only have .x in a version number and not .0.x  I am sure it is mentioned somewhere in the docs.</p>
