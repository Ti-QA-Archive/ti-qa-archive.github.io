			<h1>Make the APK smaller - remove Rhino Script?  Manually delete APK files?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>So from what I have gathered through the grapevine (please correct me if I&#39;m wrong!), the reason APKs built for Android 2.2+ on Titanium 3.0.2 are so big (at least 15 MB in my smallest builds), is because they have two Javascript engines: the old Rhino Script engine, and the new V8 engine.  Each of these take up about 6.5MB.  My questions are basically related to methods I could use to make the APK as small as possible, assuming I&#39;ve cleaned up my code and minified all my JS files…</p>
<ol>
<li>Can I simply &quot;delete&quot; Rhino Script?  In the app settings, I have V8 set as the JScript engine - is it possible to package the app without the Rhino Script engine?</li>
<li>I&#39;ve tried to manually delete some files from the APK after it has been compiled.  I&#39;ve managed to remove several files (about 1MB worth…) with no apparent affect on usability or performance.  Does anyone know what files I could &quot;kill?&quot;</li>
<li>I&#39;ve read that a significant portion of the Titanium App size I am seeing in my APKs is taken up by the Titanium debugger, and that the live app will be smaller because of this.  Does anyone know how much smaller the final, non-debugging build will be?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for all your help.  Any other suggestions you have to make final APK and install sizes smaller are greatly appreciated!</p>
