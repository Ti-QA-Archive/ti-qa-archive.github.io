			<p>Hi everybody,<br>I&#39;m having a very BIG issue with the urbanairship module for iOS. For making it short unless the app was in development mode and i tested it on the device all the notifications worked fine. After publishing it in the appstore i discovered that the production app is not getting push notifications anymore. </p>
<p>To tell all I think the level of support and documentation of this module is very poor, looking at the example you find in the latest beta there are some properties to configure:</p>
<p>PRODUCTION_APP_SECRET:&#39;you production app secret&#39;,<br>APP_STORE_OR_AD_HOC_BUILD:false,<br>DEVELOPMENT_APP_KEY:&#39;your development app key&#39;,<br>DEVELOPMENT_APP_SECRET:&#39;your development app secret&#39;,<br>LOGGING_ENABLED:false</p>
<p>I immediately noticed that in the docs there&#39;s no &quot;PRODUCTION_APP_KEY&quot; property mentioned but when you switch your urbanairship configuration to production also your app key may change (best practices at Urbanairship tells that you should make an app for development and an app for production, thus having 2 different app keys…</p>
<p>So i built my app for appstore adding the property PRODUCTION_APP_KEY and setting APP_STORE_OR_AD_HOC_BUILD:true.</p>
<p>The bad surprise is that now the app is available on the appstore but notifications do not work…</p>
<p>Was somebody able to make urbanairship work in production?</p>
<p>Please let me know, I&#39;m going crazy…</p>
<p>Thanks to everybody</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Alessandro</p>

										<p><p>I was making a mistake:I was pretending that the device token released to the app was the same. It&#39;s not like that! when you use the development APN you get a device tokem, when you use the production one you get another. So for testing the production build you need to send notifications using the right deivice token and the production configuration. Pay attention that for using the different APNs you need to configure the app on the Urban Airship console with different app keys &#x2F; secrets and you must use the right ones according to the APN of interest (dev or production).</p>
