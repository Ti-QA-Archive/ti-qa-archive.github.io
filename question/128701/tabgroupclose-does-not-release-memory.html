			<h1>TabGroup.close does not release memory</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi !</p>
<p>The app I&#39;m working on needs the open and close tabGroups.<br>It works fine, except for one thing.<br>When I close a tabGroup (using tabGroup.close()), the memory is not released.</p>
<p>I profiled my app using Xcode and Allocations, and it seems every objects composing the tagGroup don&#39;t go to transitory.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a way to properly close a tabGroup ?</strong></p>
<p>I tried :</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Closing the tabGroup using <code>close</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>Affecting <code>null</code> to the var containing the tabGroup</p>
</li>
<li><p>Closing every window contained by the tabGroup (after the tabGroup close event got triggered)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these works…</p>

							<div><p>I have an app for a university (with several tabs dynamically filled).<br>It&#39;s already on the AppStore.</p>
<p>This university has convinced several other universities to join the app.<br>But they want to have a menu where they can choose which university informations to display.</p>
<p>What I want is basically to have two windows :</p>
<ul>
<li>One with the list of universities</li>
<li>One with the informations</li>
</ul>
<p>The use case is :</p>
<ul>
<li>When the user click the button to choose another university, I show the list window.</li>
<li>When the user choose a university from the list, I close the window displaying the list and open the tabGroup to load the informations from the right university.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I did works pretty good, but memory is not released from the tabGroup (and that&#39;s a real problem).</p>

							<div><p>By the way, if someone from Appcelerator comes here, I think it&#39;s a bug.</p>
<p>TabGroup works like a super Window but memory is not released when you close it. And there is a lack of persistence with the Android platform as the close event is never triggered.</p>
<p>This thing made me think really hard about the choice I&#39;ve made for my company to use Titanium. Even though we already have 3 apps on iOS and 1 on Android using Titanium. And we still have a lot of apps coming up this year.</p>
<p>The platform is obviously still very young. It&#39;s very complicated to add bugs to bug trackers. Appcelerator staff doesn&#39;t seem to be very present on the Q&amp;A, and that&#39;s a real mistake for me. A</p>
<p>pp developers need to feel that there is someone keeping note of what&#39;s going wrong and taking it to the platform developers.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think I will keep using Titanium. But I will probably no longer use TabGroups. I made my own TabGroup manager using Views, but it&#39;s probably not as effective as it could be using native coding. So, I will probably use it for the next app I&#39;ll have to make. Which is sad because I only ask to be able to rely on Titanium components.</p>

							<p>Heya. I&#39;m not sure if this will help, but I&#39;ve spent the past couple of days coming up with a basic app, testing and exploring how common UI patterns work and ensuring stuff isn&#39;t leaking. Believe me it&#39;s been a lengthy process. There might be some code ideas in here to help you out, I&#39;m by no means an Appcelerator developer, I just wanted to start off on the right foot with apps. </p>
<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;RowanH&#x2F;AppceleratorBaseUITest">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;RowanH&#x2F;AppceleratorBaseUITest</a></p>
<p>I actually worked on the Tabs stuff this afternoon, and got the magic TabProxy elements to be collected. </p>
<p>I think a couple of key things I found - within the module that constructed and added the tabs, I had to remove and null out the tabs (&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;lib&#x2F;pages&#x2F;tabGroupConstructor.js) , then go back out and in the control that added the tabGroup (&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;lib&#x2F;pages&#x2F;tabWindow.js), then call tabGroup.close(); </p>
<p>This generally seems to be the pattern, add a close event handler to the child object, on close, remove everything that you can from that child, then in the parent object call close and remove from the parent.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Rowan,</p>
<p>Your work is very instructive.<br>I still haven&#39;t used the <code>require</code> layout to include files to a project, but it seems great.</p>
<p>I had tried that technique too (catch tabGroup close event, remove tabs and change references to null), but it wasn&#39;t very effective (but maybe I still had references somewhere).</p>
<p>But I still think your work is interesting, I have a few question :</p>
<ul>
<li>When you remove all the tabs of a tabGroup, doesn&#39;t it crash your app ?</li>
<li>When you profile your app with Xcode, do the the Window elements get released from memory too ?</li>
<li>Did you test it in Android ? Because after a few searches I found that tabGroups don&#39;t have a working <code>close</code> method in Android, and therefore no <code>close</code> event triggered.</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>Originally I tried copying the CodeStrong app which used the include method and I got into a whole lot of trouble. So I went require with this sample, not sure whether it&#39;s helping the memory management or not.. but seems to work. </p>
<ul>
<li>App doesn&#39;t crash when closing the tab groups</li>
<li>In profiling -&gt; Xcode, phone plugged in, looking at the Proxies, yes the windows, tagbroups and tabs get released. </li>
<li>No testing in Android. </li>
</ul>
<p>Would love for someone else to verify my work. Going to keep adding to the app so please check it out, run it on your own device and see what happens. I&#39;m aiming to pull together a good &#39;working best practise&#39; so I&#39;m confident rolling forward with recommending Appcelerator internally at my company.</p>

										<p><p>Rowan, in &quot;app.js&quot; you have a variable declared without &quot;var&quot; keyword:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">DashWindow = require<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-quoted">'lib/pages/dash</span>')</span><span class="hljs-list">()</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>That would create global variable, which is not so good.</p>
<p>Also, I noticed that you use &quot;global&quot; global variable. That can also be dangerous regarding memory leaks. I haven&#39;t looked at your app deeply, but be careful about those things.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ve made a little test on your app, using Xcode and Instruments.<br>I&#39;ve filtered the memory allocation by using the search &quot;proxy&quot; to only see Titanium objects.</p>
<p>To make my report a little clearer, I removed redundant part of the objects name.</p>
<p>For example :</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">TiUIWindowProxy --<span class="hljs-subst">-&gt; </span>Window
TiUILabelProxy  --<span class="hljs-subst">-&gt; </span>Label
<span class="hljs-attribute">...</span>
</code></pre><p>On App opening :</p>
<ul>
<li>3 DashboardItem</li>
<li>2 Window</li>
<li>1 iPhone</li>
<li>1 DashboardView</li>
<li>1 iPhoneAnimation</li>
</ul>
<p>After clicking the button &quot;2 TABGROUP&quot;, clicking on the second tab, then clicking the Back button (5 times)</p>
<ul>
<li>16 Label</li>
<li>10 Window</li>
<li>6 Tab</li>
<li>2 TabGroup</li>
<li>1 Dashboard</li>
<li>1 iPhone</li>
<li>1 iPhoneNavigation</li>
<li>1 DashboardView</li>
<li>1 iPhoneAnimation</li>
</ul>
<p>After continuing the same action 5 more times :</p>
<ul>
<li>20 Label</li>
<li>12 Window</li>
<li>11 Tab</li>
<li>1 TabGRoup</li>
<li>3 DashboardItem</li>
<li>1 iPhone</li>
<li>1 iPhoneNavigation</li>
<li>1 DashboardView</li>
<li>1 iPhoneAnimation</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, some items have been collected by the garbage collector, but not all of them :</p>
<ul>
<li>20 Label</li>
<li>20 Window</li>
<li>9 Tab</li>
<li>9 TabGroup</li>
</ul>
<p>When the app starts, it uses 3.79MB of memory.<br>At the end of the test, it uses 4.13MB of memory.</p>
<p>In the end, we can see some memory got cleaned up, but not all of it.<br>And as you said Rowan, you&#39;ve made a lot to clean everything up.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Adrien for testing that&#39;s exactly how I tested - so what I&#39;ve noticed is variable memory collection. There&#39;s no real explanation that I can see for how&#x2F;when items get collected, even if I forceably close something, remove it etc, sometimes it just hangs around, other times it will get collected. When items are never going to get released (ie my code was wrong), for example in my original tests with tab groups, I would never get a single tab released, then I&#39;d tweak the code such that finally it would start releasing items - then you see the variable releasing, sometimes just one tab, othertimes the two tabs. The items in the non released side just start creeping up, until for whatever reason there&#39;s a big bump, and bunch get released.  </p>
<p>Something I&#39;ve noticed, when I add a memory heavy component, eg a list of Images with remote urls, then garbage collection gets a lot more aggressive. The windows that weren&#39;t getting fully released (eg the 20 you mention above) suddenly start dropping in bigger numbers. </p>
<p>I think I should document this &#x2F; show some worked examples. I want to know I&#39;m on the right track here.</p>

										<p><p>I had noticed that heavy weight windows, created like this :</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
    <span class="hljs-string">'url'</span> : <span class="hljs-string">'winStuff.js'</span>
});
</code></pre><p>are well handled by garbage collector. When you close one, it will surely be released from memory with all its components. I had no problem with modal windows neither.</p>
<p>At least, you can work with that.</p>
<p>It seems to me that TabGroups are made to stay opened and not to be closed. The kind of use you can see in the KitchenSink app for example.</p>

										<p><p>Hi guys. The thing here is that garbage collection in general does not occur immediately when window closes. GC will happen when there is no intensive operation going on because it could compromise overall performance and user experience otherwise.</p>
<p>That said, try to run application for some time, open and close windows and play around. While doing that, check if memory consumption is constant over time. That doesn&#39;t mean that memory available when window opens has to be identical to available memory when window is closes. The key is &quot;constant over time&quot;.</p>
<p>Check this output from my app that can run for hours:</p>

        _APPNAME.memoryPool.add(_ARGS)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
        _APPNAME.memoryPool.close()<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

    }<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
})()<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
$$ = _APPNAME.Properties<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>Then within your app you can call when your app first loads.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    <span class="hljs-variable">$$</span>.createMemoryPool();
</code></pre><p>And then call this when ever you want to clear the memory.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    <span class="hljs-variable">$$</span>.clearMemoryPool(win);

										<p><p>I already tried that kind of solution.</p>
<p>It usually works well, but it doesn&#39;t seem to work with a tabGroup.</p>
<p>Maybe because tabGroup works like a kind of window itself.</p>

										<p><p>Just hide the tabgroup.hide(). Once the tabgroup is created it cannot be released. Just hide it when user navigate to other menu&#x2F;window.</p>
<p>but for the windows inside the tabgroup, you can close() it manually one by one. For my case, i close the windows when the user navigate to other menu or when click the back button.</p>
