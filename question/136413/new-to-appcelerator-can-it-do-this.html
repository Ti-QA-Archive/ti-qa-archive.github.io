		<section>
			<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I am considering Corona, PhoneGap and Appcelerator. I like corona, just they are not able to integrate to 3rd party API&#x2F;web services.</p>
<p>Wonder Appcelerator can do this?</p>
<p>a) Bar code&#x2F;QR Code scanning - is this built-in or can I call 3rd party SDK&#x2F;APIs like below?</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.google.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;zxing&#x2F;<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bardecode.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;products&#x2F;200-barcode-reader-sdk-for-the-iphone.html</p>
<p>b) Integrate to Open Source Systems like below</p>
<p>example, asterisks unified communication</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.google.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;asterisk-php-api&#x2F;<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.voip-info.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;view&#x2F;Asterisk+manager+Examples</p>
<p>example, openerp<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.openerp.com&#x2F;v6.0&#x2F;developer&#x2F;6_22_XML-RPC_web_services&#x2F;index.html</p>
<p>Any help? Thanks.</p>
<p>c) If both above is possible, can the Standard version sufficient to do that? </p>
<p>d) How much is standard edition? Per user basis? I heard $195&#x2F;month? Is that true?</p>
<p>e) I read quite number of complains on appcelerator memory issues and they are slow. I think corona is the fastest, what do you think?</p>
<p>f) Just wonder, can appcelerator use to do business apps and also games?</p>
<p>g) lastly, can appcelerator integrates to social media like facebook and twitter?</p>
<p>Any help? Thanks.</p>

							<p>I didn&#39;t like to say, but yes Titanium has a far greater support for the devices sensors and functions than corona, but corona is better for gaming. </p>
<p>If you wanted to do brochures then to be honest I would use an ebook tool. but if you wanted it in the app, then I don&#39;t know of a quick way to build this apart from write the code.</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;listing?1288529520&amp;q=barcode is the barcode scanner….</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

							<p>Appcelerator is a native solution for iOS and Android app (BB coming soon). Like any programming language, there are pitfalls especially when poorly designed and implemented. The greatest advantage the platform has on the competition is that it produces Native Applications using Javascript, and not HTML5 apps wrapped in a webview. </p>
<p>It is highly extensible, and there are solutions for most problems that are not part of the core Titanium using modules. </p>
<ol>
<li>There are modules for doing barcode&#x2F;qr - check the marketplace or online (google)</li>
<li>It supports most REST APIs, and even SOAP implementations. If it is XML&#x2F;JSON, you should be able to implement it.</li>
<li>This is a difficult version to answer - the core system addresses most use cases</li>
<li>I am not well versed in pricing, but there isn&#39;t a standard edition for 195&#x2F;month. Before the new prices and plans were announced a few weeks ago, the Indie level package was 600&#x2F;year.</li>
<li>Using best practices can mitigate this. It is native code, and has the best performance in its space, when code is well implemented</li>
<li>Appcelerator may not be your choice for games, i&#39;d advice Corona for that. But for all other types of apps, it should be your #1 choice</li>
<li>It integrate natively with Facebook, and there are numerous Twitter implementations out in the wild.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope i helped answer your questions.</p>

							<p>Hi Eric</p>
<p>Ill give a go answering your questions.</p>
<p>Prior to version 2, the latest yes it was possible to have memory leaks easily, but it is down to coding. Version 2 now has the commonJS specification implemented into the framework and it is much harder to code serious memory leaks, but still very possible.</p>
<p>a) There is no inbuilt Bar code scanner, but it is JavaScript so you can plug in one of the open source ones or use one of the available modules.</p>
<p>b) You can link to any website and incorporate most JavaScript open source items.</p>
<p>c) Yes standard issue is sufficient, unless you have a lot of developers.</p>
<p>d) Not sure on the cost but I think what you have been told is high, you can sign up and start coding for free, you don&#39;t need to buy a specific service. You would then just pay for the modules you may need on top. I haven&#39;t as yet had to use any modules, and I have also produced bar cde and qr code scanning apps.</p>
<p>e) Actually I think Appcelerator is now slightly faster than corona although I don&#39;t think there is much in it. It is a lot faster than phoneGap. The memory issues are down to coding.</p>
<p>f) Yes is the answer. Although I think titanium is much more suited to business apps, there is a growing number of games coming out using it.</p>
<p>g) Yes integrates to social apps, and even open source examples are provided.,</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>T…</p>

							<p>Thanks Ayorinde and Trevor.</p>
<p>Few more questions:-</p>
<p>a) Is there a way to know the exact pricing of standard? Where can I find indie pricing too?</p>
<p>Yeah, I am aware of the free version. But I need to do some budgeting.</p>
<p>b) so if i use the free version, and upgrade to standard version.. the same code can be used?</p>
<p>c) Is there a version 2? The one with free download is version 2?</p>
<p>d) Trevor, do you have tips to get titanium working with qr&#x2F;bar code scanning? Which open source scanners do you use for this integration? I am really curious.</p>
<p>e) Just one thing. I do notice the corona coding is way more easier than Titanium. However, I am just comparing between tutorials so I can&#39;t say much for now.</p>
<p>f) lastly, if i publish an app to appstore either free or 0.99 cents. do my customer needs to pay any license fee from appcelerator? just to confirm.</p>

							<p>So to go further. </p>
<p>a) I don&#39;t work for Appcelerator so I cannot comment on pricing.. but if you contact sales@appceleraotr.com they should get straight back to you.</p>
<p>b) Yes, the code doesn&#39;t change at all.</p>
<p>c) Studio and SDK version 2 have recently been released they are the ones that are currently downloadable.</p>
<p>d) Tips for working with Bar code, literally pick one of the Javascript open source solutions. Don&#39;t need anything other than that. Would have to dig out code from last year to give a more accurate answer, or you can get the one from the Appcelerator market place.</p>
<p>e) Actually initially corona coding is easier, but not for complex well structured business applications. Using commonJS is a thing recently introduced by Appcelerator into Titanium and yes it takes a little getting used to but is far more stable and conforms to the standard way JavaScript frameworks should be developed.</p>
<p>f) There are no licensing costs involved in releasing your applications, to your customers. It depends on the app your writing so if your using something like google places then after a certain amount of hits, you will be charged but not by Appcelerator, by google.</p>
<p>If you want to know more I am running a commonJS titanium workshop in a couple of weeks. http:&#x2F;&#x2F;softlywired02.eventbrite.co.uk&#x2F; not sure where your based.</p>

							<p>Hi Trevor, I am based in Malaysia. Can&#39;t attend it :( </p>
<p>Except you record the session for online download, will be good :)</p>
<p>I am interested to do an app like redflash (iphone) but more to internal usage to track our inventory at our warehouse. Do you mind to share links to the barcode&#x2F;qrcode in the marketplace?</p>
<p>Let me explore further on this. It seems Titanium can do more extensive stuff than Corona. Corona seems to come short of this.</p>
<p>In Corona, they can build interactive ebooks easily. Wonder can this be done easily with Titanium?</p>
<p>I am thinking to create few marketing brochures which you can flip pages for our company&#39;s purpose. So people can download the app to understand better if they want to.</p>
<p>At the end, the pricing has to make sense for standard edition at least. Probably have to check with the sales team for more information.</p>
<p>What do you think? Thanks again :)</p>
