			<h1>Optimizing multiple image upload from app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a Titanium Alloy app (currently only iOS) that allows the user to insert multiple images, either from the photo gallery or directly from the camera which are then cropped, resized and sent to the server to be processed.</p>
<p>It all works fine, but even after resizing the images to 1024x1024 they are still over 2 MB each, making the upload take a very long time. Is there anything I can do to minimize the time needed to upload multiple images?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Sounds like you need to be able to reduce the quality setting of the images as they are saved - the same as designers do when creating web suitable versions of images.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_modules&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;imagefactory">Image Factory</a></li>
<li><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_modules&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;imagefactory&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;ios&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;index.md">Documentation</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You are looking for the <strong>compress</strong> method.</p>

										<p><p>I know what compression is, I&#39;m a web developer, but thanks for confirming my suspicion that I would have to use Image Factory. I suppose that also means there is no way to perform image compression natively on the device?</p>

										<p><p>Sorry I am confused as you said I have confirmed your suspicions about using Image Factory when you did not mention it, also no mention of compression.  Strange.</p>
<p>ImageFactory is a module that you include in your app that accesses the native functions of the OS to provide these features directly in your app using Titanium.</p>
<p>So yes this is natively supported in the app using Image Factory.</p>

										<p><p>Well I mentioned it in that comment. I thought it was obvious that compression is what was necessary to reduce file size and thus minimize upload time.</p>
<p>I probably shouldn&#39;t have used the term &quot;natively&quot;. What I meant was it&#39;s not possible purely through the Titanium SDK and without modules.</p>
<p>Anyway, it looks like I&#39;ll have to wait for the GitHub servers to stop acting up before I can take a proper look at it.</p>
