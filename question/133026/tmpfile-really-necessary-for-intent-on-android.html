		<section>
			<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I hope someone can give me a hand, I was following this tutorial:<br><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;09&#x2F;sharing-project-assets-with-android-intents.html">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;09&#x2F;sharing-project-assets-with-android-intents.html</a> which has worked out very well. I did create it for  movie instead of a PDF file, but with some slight changes it does work. The movie file is downloaded and here it comes: direct playback via an intent doesn´t work, I get a message from the movie player: this movie type is no supported. I played around a bit and figured out, that I also have to implement the tmpfile code:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">tmpFile = Ti.Filesystem.createTempFile()<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
newPath = tmpFile.nativePath + '.pdf'<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
tmpFile.move(newPath)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
tmpFile = Ti.Filesystem.getFile(newPath)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
tmpFile.write(file.read())<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>Now my code works perfectly, but the movie files are between 10 and 200MB, so well, it does work, but starting copying to a tempfile can take a few seconds to minutes, as the file is already stored locally, I wonder if there is some way around this tmpfile copying? I saw some guys native code, that also does the same, but this truely kills performance on larger files.</p>
<p>I used file.nativePath and the path to my file goes like this: file:&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;data&#x2F;data&#x2F;APPIDENTIFIER&#x2F;app_appdata&#x2F;movie1.mp4</p>
<p>As said, directly opening that file in an intent does not work, but copying to an tmpfile and afterwards opening that tmpfile works like a charm.</p>
<p>I suppose I could fix that by downloading the movie to a tmpfile directly, but this files get killed after the application closes, right?</p>
<p>Thanks guys!</p>

							<pre><code class="hljs">APPIDENTIFIER/app_appdata
</code></pre><p>This folder is part of your application and it contains your application data. So Your movie player will not be able to read the video file from your application data folder. That&#39;s why article is showing to create a tmp file to read it through third party application. If you want your movie file permanent storage than as you said you have to use Ti.Filesystem.externalStorageDirectory. You can create a directory for your application on SDCARD and than save video&#39;s to that directory so that user can easily clean up that directory or you can provide delete cached file option to your own application too.</p>

										<p><p>I wonder: will that folder be delete if the user uninstalls the application? This is the most important concern I have about storing the videos on the SD card. Also do you know what happens if the SD card is absent? Seems like the Galaxy S2 and a few others handle this transparently?</p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t know about specific devices but you can check always for whether SDCARD is available or not. And no folder will not be deleted if user will uninstall application. If you have stored your data in app-data folder (applications&#39;s data folder) than it will remove it other wise uninstalling app will not remove data from SDCARD.</p>
