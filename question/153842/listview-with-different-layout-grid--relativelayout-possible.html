			<h1>ListView with different layout (grid / RelativeLayout) possible?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi There,</p>
<p>I&#39;m using the latest version of Titanium &amp; Alloy (Git master). In the documentation it refers to an item in a ListView creating a row however is there a way to have more than one item per row? For example in a grid layout. Having previously come from a native Android environment I know this can be achieved with a ListView using a RelativeLayout so is there any way to achieve this with Titanium?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Sam</p>

							<p>I don&#39;t believe there is. It is meant to be a fast-as-possible standard set of rows. You could, however, submit a feature request to the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC">Titanium Community Jira Project</a>. That way it will be seen by the platforms engineers and you can get direct feedback that way.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Tony, will open a ticket a bit later on today. At the moment I&#39;m probably going to have to go for a WebView to get the layout I want which is a shame. Having said that, am using Alloy on this project and its made development noticeably quicker, great work.</p>

										<p><p>You can do something similar with a ScrollView and a <code>layout: &amp;#39;horizontal&amp;#39;</code>. By default, horizontal layouts will operate like a grid and start to stack vertically when they run out of horizontal space.</p>

										<p><p>Yeah I went for that option originally in the first iteration of my app but found horrendous memory leaks when using imageviews which seemed be common knowledge at the time. Since then I&#39;m hesitant to use a ScrollView with a bunch of images again.</p>
