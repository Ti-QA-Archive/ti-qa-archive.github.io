			<h1>Appcelerator and Android UI</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey Guys,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been researching a whole lot about Appcelerator to figure out whether it could be a good fit for my next cross-platform mobile app project and have come across discussions on how Appcelerator doesn&#39;t deliver the &quot;native&quot; look, feel, and interactivity on Android. I have also seen articles talking about how GetGlue and Wunderlist switched from Appcelerator for Android to native Android SDK.</p>
<p>Do you guys mind sharing your experience? Also, if there are apps out there (other than NBC) built on Appcelerator that are x-platform could anyone please point them them out?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help in advance.</p>
<p>Uday</p>

							<p>You should have a look at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.builtwithtitanium.com&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.builtwithtitanium.com&#x2F;</a>. It&#39;s a pretty complete catalog of app made with Titanium.</p>

										<p><p>Thx Christian. I&#39;ve actually looked at it and I can&#39;t seem to find anything that pushes the envelope in terms of UI&#x2F;UX. What do you think?</p>

										<p><p>Maybe you should look at this the other way around. You should focus on one or two Androis applications you want to emulate and ask if such a design is achievable on Android.</p>
<p>Because, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll agree, your question could mean many things.</p>

										<p><p>I agree with you but the reason I&#39;ve been chasing existing apps is to see the platform capabilities in action as opposed to hypothesize what&#39;s achievable.</p>

										<p><p>Well, again, from my experience, I&#39;ve never been faced with a feature I couldn&#39;t implement using Titanium on Android since we have the possibility of developing native modules. (had to do this on occasions and worked like a charm)</p>
<p>You make it sound as if you were trying to develop PlayStation 3 games on a phone. What are you trying to develop that is &quot;pushing the envelope&quot; so much?</p>

										<p><p>Something similar to Roambi - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunes.apple.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;app&#x2F;roambi-analytics&#x2F;id315020789?mt=8. Also, what&#39;s your take on simple app like Wunderlist switching from Appcelerator Android to native Android - http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tryexcept.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2011&#x2F;09&#x2F;12&#x2F;wunderlist-for-android-is-going-native-drops-appcelerator-titanium-mobile.html.</p>

										<p><p>Well, something like Roambi will be pretty hard to pull on Android, even in native Code. But if you really need to push the envelope like that, I can only assume that you are pretty well rounded with Android development and its intricate zBuffering. So my advice to you would be: Stay with native if you already have deep knowledge. </p>
<p>As for Wunderlist, as simple as it may look, it&#39;s quite a complex app. While it is true they had to move away from Android (the app was aweful to use back then). It was largely due to the fact that the first version of Titanium was using the Rhino Javascript engine. Which was very slow, it has since been replace with the V8 engine which is much faster. But since it was not ready back then, it made perfect sense for them rewrite the thing natively instead of having to wait for a better Titanium (with V8).</p>
