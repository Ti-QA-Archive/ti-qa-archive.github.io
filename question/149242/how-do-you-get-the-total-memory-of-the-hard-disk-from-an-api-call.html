							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Please explain what you mean by <strong>hard disk</strong> because mobile devices rarely have an actual hard disc and then you go on to ask about <strong>system memory</strong> is this the same question or two different things you are after?</p>
<p>Do you mean;</p>
<ul>
<li>The device has 1gb of RAM, how much is left available for apps?</li>
<li>The device could have 256MB, 512MB or 1gb of RAM, you need to know which of these?</li>
<li>The device has a 16GB memory card - you want to know that?</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>I got to output some system specs like so: </p>
<p>OS: iOS 6.1<br>RAM: 4 GB<br>File System: 64GB<br>Available: 36.4 GB</p>
<p>The File System corresponds to the size of the hard disks on a computer.  Ram corresponds to the total available memory on a computer.</p>

										<p><p>Are you expecting your mobile phone based app to somehow work out the these values from a computer which is unrelated physically to the mobile device?</p>
<p>You need to provide much more specifics for this as this is clearly not a normal mobile app situation.</p>

										<p><p>The iPhone has a certain amount of space on it&#39;s hard drive (just like a computer).  The iPhone also has a certain amount of RAM (just like a computer).  That is all I was saying.</p>
