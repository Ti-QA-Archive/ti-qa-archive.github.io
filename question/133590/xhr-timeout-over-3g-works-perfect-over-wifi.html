			<h1>xhr timeout over 3G, works perfect over wifi</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello there, I have an issue which could be related to the last iOS update. My xhr works perfectly over wifi but it fails over 3G. I searched this Q&amp;A section and tried everything relevant:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in">enable</span>KeepAlive:<span class="hljs-literal">false</span>,
</code></pre><pre><code class="hljs">xhr.setTimeout(<span class="hljs-number">0</span>);
</code></pre><pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">xhr</span><span class="hljs-class">.setTimeout</span>(<span class="hljs-tag">random</span><span class="hljs-class">.high</span><span class="hljs-class">.value</span>);
</code></pre><p>but nothing seems to work. What is even more perplexing is that my xhr works from time to time on different carriers.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. I would also advise anyone whose iOS apps are accessing data remotely through xhr to test that remote connection over 3G is still working as intended following the last iOS update.</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Dimitris</p>

							<p>Following your comment Darren, I checked with all three major carriers in Greece. All devices under the same roof. All working perfectly both over wifi and 3G with the exception of Vodafone 3G. Does this even make sense? Any thoughts?</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m aware of another developer that had issues with 3g on Vodafone. Apparently, Vodafone does something with the headers before sending to the server. They somehow alter or append what the app uses as a header. The developer&#39;s name is Jon Odel. You should be able to look him up on devlink. I may have his email address too, but try contacting him through devlink first. I think he found some sort of workaround. If you have any other questions, don&#39;t hesitate to ask me here or contact me on devlink.</p>

							<p>After trying every workaround to any problem remotely close to mine, the most simple thing seems to have done the job: switching from http to https. Of course the URL you are trying to call needs to support that but luckily google (which I am calling) does.</p>
<p>Did not manage to get a hold of Jon, thanks Darren for pointing me to the right direction though.</p>
