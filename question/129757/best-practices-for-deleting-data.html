			<p>Hi, I have a fairly simple application but implemented using the wrong approach, that is creating windows using the js url like the kitchensink.<br>I am aware of the tweetanium approach and I&#39;m planning to change the app that way as soon as I can.</p>
<p>There&#39;s about 10 windows in my app. The good thing is that all the windows are independent and there is no need to move data or communicate between them at all. </p>
<p>So in the meanwhile I&#39;d like to make sure I clean up as much as I can while navigating the app. What I&#39;m doing is going backwards when I close a window. </p>
<p>So I use window.remove any views I might have added to the window + set the variables of any objects to null. I know we can&#39;t trust that everything is deleted but is there anything else I should take care of?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the comment Rainer. Now in each window there is a &quot;Back&quot; button and in the click event of the button I do mywin.remove(myview) and myview = null for all the views I might have created.</p>
<p>I will do as you suggest. Do you think the code I have in the click event of the back buttons is then needed or will setting the window to null take care of that already? I guess it will.</p>

										<p><p>Ok, after adding the close listener I can see this in the logs:</p>
<p>[WARN] called remove for [object TiUIView] on [object TiUIWindow], but [object TiUIView] isn&#39;t a child or has already been removed</p>
<p>So I guess this means that the close listener on the window was also trying to delete the views I already deleted before so I imagine this answers my previous question and I don&#39;t need the stuff in the back buttons.</p>
