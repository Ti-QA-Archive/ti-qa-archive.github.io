			<h1>Android Image Sizes - What&#39;s necessary?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Currently, I have been preparing all of our assets for iOS and android based on best practices and using @2x, mdpi, xhdpi folders, etc. Everything works fine, however, I do have some lingering, beginner questions.</p>
<p>Take android, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Why not just use xhdpi images across all resolutions and specify &quot;dp&quot; sizes to scale everything down for the lower resolutions? Are there any disadvantages to this approach?</p>
</li>
<li><p>When packaging for production, does the apk contain all resolution images? Does this result in a large apk size? Or does a mdpi user only receive an apk with mdpi assets somehow after the apk is sent to the play store somehow?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks everyone!</p>

							<p><em>Why not just use xhdpi images across all resolutions and specify &quot;dp&quot; sizes to scale everything down for the lower resolutions? Are there any disadvantages to this approach?</em></p>
<p>Because you&#39;re forcing the handset to downsample all the images, resulting in slower performance and possibly blurred or mis-rendered graphics. It would be like designing a web page in which you want to show an image in a 240x320 px block but point the img tag to a 1536x2048 graphic. Inefficient, slow, wasteful. (Flip side, on newer devices supporting xxhdpi and xxxhdpi graphics, your images would be up-sampled, pixellated, and ugly.)</p>
<p><em>When packaging for production, does the apk contain all resolution images? Does this result in a large apk size? Or does a mdpi user only receive an apk with mdpi assets somehow after the apk is sent to the play store somehow?</em></p>
<p>All of the images are included in the apk. Yes, it makes for a larger apk. You have a few options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use R (built-in to Android) assets wherever possible (for buttons, icons, etc)</li>
<li>Use custom fonts instead of images for buttons, icons, etc.</li>
<li>Limit or avoid graphics</li>
<li>Include only low-res, small graphics in the published apk, but have the app download resolution-specific graphics on the first launch, using them thereafter.</li>
<li>Upload separate apks for each display class and work through Google Play&#39;s cumbersome process for associating each apk with the appropriate device class.</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>BTW, the same applies to iOS apps as well. Your iPad assets are included in the IPA an iPhone user downloads when you submit a Universal app. You could create separate iPhone &amp; iPad releases instead, or use the other techniques I described for Android.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Tim. I thought this might be the case. I think for some parts of the app we will probably go with the download on first launch approach.</p>
