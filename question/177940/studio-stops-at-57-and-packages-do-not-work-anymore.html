			<h1>Studio stops at 57% and packages do not work anymore</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi<br>I am building for Android using Titanium sdk 3.3.0</p>
<p>I was in the process of building&#x2F;testning over and over when all of a sudden build stopped at 57%<br>without showing any error message. It just hangs or freezes at that point.</p>
<p>I noticed that packaging for Google store worked, so I packaged and installed the app manually on my android to at least be able to continue testing. It the turned out that the app just freezes at first window (when showing app.js).<br>I am then not able to click on the screen, nothing happens, the screen is dead.</p>
<p>So I imagine that there is a problem in the build process, that is not solved when packaging after all.</p>
<p>I have been using backup files, created new projects, rebooted and all, but the problem persists. I can not build newly created apps either (even though using new package or build configurations).</p>
<p>Building for ios works like before.<br>This problem turned up yesterday in the middle of working with it.</p>
<p>Would much appreciate help since I need to update an ugly app asap.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance &#x2F;Best regards &#x2F;Tove</p>

							<div><p>What operating system are you on? What SDK version did you use to create the App? Also can you copy some parts of the log output from console during build and paste here? Would like to see what the console is out putting.</p>
