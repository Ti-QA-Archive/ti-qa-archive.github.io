			<h1>Can&#39;t update CLI to 3.2</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>mobile<br>Titanium 3.2<br>Mac OS X<br> I have recently updated titanium to 3.2, but I can&#39;t run the simulator, it just keeps telling me the CLI version does not match the titanium version.  When I run titanium -v in the terminal I get 3.1.2, and my titanium sdk is 3.2.  I have updated my node.js and npm just to make sure they are the current versions (node is v0.10.24 and npm is 1.3.21), and ran sudo npm -g install titanium and sudo npm -g install alloy titanium both at separate times, I have restarted titanium and my system several times, but I still get 3.1.2 for my version of CLI.  what am I missing?</p>

							<p>I think I have found the possible root cause. Comment first; I know many of Titanium developers are from the Web world, and are not very familiar with full-blown software development environment outside WebKit. That&#39;s why I find many questions and answers in this forum to be a little of low quality. This is not to offend anyone, I understand because I were like you before, a Web developer, until I got a proper degree in Computer Engineer almost 7 years ago. </p>
<p>It&#39;s also something staff at Appcelerator will have to tolerate with. But actually having a helpful and intelligible user community is one of the success factors of a framework. After using Titanium Mobile for a while, I find that the documentation can be much much better in help educating the community (Though currently it is already considered good). Look at Symfony Web framework, it has successfully bring monkey PHP coders like me to learn best coding practices and leverage the development skill to the next level. I wish to see that in Titanium Mobile as well. By having more organized and comprehensive documentation rather than a few simple tutorials just to get amateur developer in, the community will grow to become strong and knowledgable and finally benefits the ecosystem in return. </p>
<p>To give an idea, the documents could possibly targeting at Web developer who knows very little about software development tools&#x2F;workflow&#x2F;practices, to have a smooth transition from the Web world and at the same time learn about how to properly develop software ( explanation of npm&#39;s basic is a good example).</p>
<p>One more thing before I explain how to update CLI to titanium 3.2.0 (I was getting stuck at 3.1.2 too), I tried searching for iOS QR Code reader module in Google and found many links to this forum where almost all replies are pointing to outdated module from someone, and nothing about Ti&#39;s official QR Code module until I try searching in modules&#39; market at last resort. The module is even underrated even though it&#39;s working ( I know there are some mis-resolving but with some workaround this is ok). I think Ti need someone to oversee these matters, you guys built great platform but have no awesome way to represent it! </p>
<p>Ok, enough for comment for my beloved Titanium. Here is the solution I found:</p>
<p>For those of you who don&#39;t want the details do this: ( Mac OS X or Linux, I don&#39;t know Windows command)</p>
<ol>
<li>In command line, run &#39;npm bin -g&#39; (of course without &#39; )</li>
<li>You should see current configuration setting for bin directory; make note of the return value, it is the path where npm program is being installed to.</li>
</ol>
<p>In my system this is &#x2F;Applications&#x2F;Titanium Studio&#x2F;TitaniumStudio.app&#x2F;Contents&#x2F;MacOS&#x2F;Password:&#x2F;usr&#x2F;local&#x2F;bin</p>
<p>Obviously, Titanium installation has changed my default npm installation prefix! And it is not in my PATH environment variable so the newly installed titanium package will never get called, but the old module which is still installed some where in the system is still intact!</p>
<p>In your case this may be different, just follow on.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Type &#39;which titanium&#39; and note the path returned; that is the path of current titanium version you are using.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the path&#39;s value from 2) and  3) doesn&#39;t seem to match ( e.g. 2) = &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local&#x2F;bin 3) = &#x2F;some&#x2F;other&#x2F;dir ) I means you have two install location, which must be the case if after installing new version of titanium CLI but you still calling the old one.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Run &#39;sudo npm config set prefix &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local&#39; which will revert back the npm prefix for bin and lib&#x2F;node_module (global package install location) to the default.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now install titanium again using &#39;sudo npm install titanium -g&#39;</p>
</li>
<li><p>This is optionally but you may want to delete whatever in and over path from 2) and related stuffs. It&#39;s old npm&#39;s installation after we have changed prefix in step 5)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope this help.</p>

										<p><p>yes Wirawit,</p>
<p>This seems to work.   Much thx!   Weird tho that my &#39;which titanium&#39; reported &#39;&#x2F;usr&#x2F;local&#x2F;bin&#x2F;titanium&#39; both before and after running &#39;sudo npm config set prefix &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local&#39;.   However after doing this, and then also re-running &#39;sudo npm install titanium -g&#39;, running &#39;ti –version&#39; then reported 3.2.0.</p>
<p>However after all this, now when doing an iOS build(emulators, adhoc and distribution), I get the following:<br>[ERROR] :  Invalid &quot;–ios-version&quot; value &quot;7.0.3&quot;<br>   7.0<br>   6.1<br>For help, run: titanium help build</p>
<p>When trying to reset to 7.0 .. I dont get that selection in any of the run configurations dialog boxes.<br>Any thought on this one?</p>
<p>Anyway .. I&#39;m not a web developer .. maybe this is part of my problem?    ;-)</p>
<p>many thx again</p>

							<p>In Studio, choose Help, Check for Updates (checks for Studio updates). Then, choose  Help, Check for Titanium Updates (which checks for CLI, Alloy, and other updates).</p>

										<p><p>Jenna, so apparently you do not have titanium installed locally (in your user directory), which is good. However, I&#39;m not sure why you cannot uninstall&#x2F;reinstall&#x2F;update titanium to 3.2.</p>
<p>Try entering these commands (the part after &#x2F;&#x2F; is what shows on my system):</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">which node        /<span class="hljs-regexp">/ --&gt; /usr</span><span class="hljs-regexp">/local/bin</span><span class="hljs-regexp">/node
which npm         /</span><span class="hljs-regexp">/ --&gt; /usr</span><span class="hljs-regexp">/local/bin</span><span class="hljs-regexp">/npm
which titanium   /</span><span class="hljs-regexp">/ --&gt; /usr</span><span class="hljs-regexp">/local/bin</span><span class="hljs-regexp">/titanium
which alloy       /</span><span class="hljs-regexp">/ --&gt; /usr</span><span class="hljs-regexp">/local/bin</span><span class="hljs-regexp">/alloy</span>
</code></pre><p>From your comment above, it looks like NPM is installed in your local directory not globally. Perhaps that&#39;s part of the issue. You might have multiple or incomplete node&#x2F;npm installs? </p>
<p>Perhaps you need to remove node &amp; npm and reinstall them. That&#39;s a bit of a sledgehammer approach. So, if someone else has other ideas hopefully they will chime in.</p>
<p>These articles will help with the uninstall process:</p>

<p>Then, visit <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nodejs.org&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nodejs.org&#x2F;</a> to reinstall node (which includes npm). Then do </p>

							<p>According to Apple (Make sure your apps work seamlessly with the innovative technologies in iOS 7. Starting February 1, new apps and app updates submitted to the App Store must be built with Xcode 5 and iOS 7 SDK.), this will have to be working by Feb 1 2014 .. since v3.2.0 of the SDK doesn&#39;t work with v3.1.2 of the CLI.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on how to get this done ultimately?   None of the above suggestions given by Tim are working for me.</p>
<p>Anyone?</p>
<p>much thx in advance</p>
