			<h1>ANDROID Navigation controller with back and return to start buttons.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>This is an Appcelerator Titanium Question just for ANDROID.  I already wrote the app in iOS, so I am only interested in making this work in ANDROID.</p>
<p>I want to write an app with Buttons that will display a new screen. Each screen will have a question, and each button will be an optional Choice.  The logic would look something like a tree, with some paths running much longer than other paths.  In iOS this is a UINavigationController.  in Android, I suppose I could be opening up new activities.</p>
<p>I would like this app to have a back button the returns to the previous question as well as a home button that returns to the very first question in the tree.</p>
<p>This is the part of the project that I really want to resolve:  The second part of the question. The logic of the questions will probably get complicated. So I was looking for a RAILS way of doing this.  Each view would have its own .js file…  perhaps some kind of scaffolding.  ideally, I would have one include file with the questions that I could edit.</p>
<p>any thoughts?  thanks</p>

							<div><p>I don&#39;t have a specific answer for your navigation question.  But I will suggest strongly that you use require() rather than include(), and you use CommonJS modules for your views.</p>

							<div><p>I have been doing that. But the issue is that I want to get back to the first View with a button click.  And I want to add to the view stack.  this alloy framework looks interesting for its framework looks like rails.<br>What I am thinking that I need to do is get rid of the navigation stack completely.</p>
