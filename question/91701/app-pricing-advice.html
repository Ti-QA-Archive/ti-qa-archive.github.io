			<h1>app pricing advice</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;d like to ask the community for advice on what is a reasonable price for my app.  The app is called appTrends and it it basically gives app developers mobile access to their sales, ranking, and reviews from appFigures.com.</p>
<p>I originally had it priced at $5.99. I lowered it to $4.99 because I thought since my app uses appFigures data and they already charge their customers, people may not be willing to pay more money to extend that functionality. I could be wrong.</p>
<p>I&#39;d like to get more opinions of what some other developers would be willing to pay for this app. I should also mention that I am working on another big update that will add more detail to current reports and will be adding a report for iAds.</p>
<p>I have 20 promo codes that I will give to the first 20 people that can suggest a reasonable price.</p>
<p>You can check out appTrends here:</p>
<p>website - <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pudgyfish.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;apptrends">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pudgyfish.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;apptrends</a></p>
<p>iTunes - <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunes.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;apptrends&#x2F;id402597480?mt=8">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunes.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;apptrends&#x2F;id402597480?mt=8</a></p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>sorry to burst your bubble but i agree with Kasper, i think your pricing may be a tad steep since we already pay appfigures. i second the $1.99 recommendation.</p>

							<p>Here are my thoughts.</p>
<p>.99 is the lowest you can price an app, as such if you ever decide to cut the price in 1&#x2F;2 say for a limited time promotion then you&#39;re not going to be able to do so. I&#39;d price the app at at least 1.99 as you can then cut that price in 1&#x2F;2 if you need to.</p>

							<p>Thanks to everyone who provided their feedback!!!  I am going with the suggestions to lower the price to $1.99.  I agree that this is a fair and reasonable price.</p>
<p>The price has been changed on the app effective this morning.</p>
<p>If you did not get a promo code, please email me at info { AT } pudgyfish { dot } com and I&#39;d be happy to send one over.</p>
<p>Thanks again everyone for your opinions!!!</p>
