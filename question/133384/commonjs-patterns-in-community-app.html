			<h1>CommonJS Patterns in Community App</h1>

		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m trying to better understand the &#39;right&#39; way to use common JS.  I see in the community app that the Component.js uses the prototype pattern while ActionBarView uses a different pattern where a single method return an object which has been extended (what is the name of this pattern?).  What are the pros and cons of these patterns?  Any easy rules of thumbs when to choose which?</p>

							<p>I use the prototype for Component because I am not directly extending another type, and instantiating objects is slightly faster when functions and properties are added to the prototype rather than the constructor.</p>
<p>I use &quot;parasitic inheritance&quot; for the other component constructors because I need to essentially subclass the built in Ti.UI.XXX components, like views and windows.  In those cases, in the constructor, I create an instance of the object I would like to extend, create its children, sometimes add new &quot;instance&quot; properties&#x2F;functions to it, and pass it off as an instance of a new type of object.</p>

										<p><p>THanks a bunch, the idea of extending vs. creating is what I was sort of concluding.  I still find the parasitic inheritance odd in that that the constructer has a &quot;return&quot;.</p>
