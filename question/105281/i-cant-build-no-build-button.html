		<section>
			<p>OK so this is quite strange.<br>I have a new install of Titanium Developer (reinstalled Windows).<br>I know how this used to work - but with this latest install, I don&#39;t even get any of the &quot;Launch&#x2F;Install&#x2F;Package&quot; buttons, when I click on &quot;Test &amp; Package&quot;.  I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling Titanium, but the area below is just solid grey with nothing, under all 3 tabs (Run Emulator, Run on Device, Distribute).<br>I know normally there is a button down there to build and launch in the Emulator on the first tab, but it&#39;s completely grey with no options&#x2F;text under those 3 tabs.<br>What could be going on?  Any ideas?  This is strange!</p>

<p>OK, thanks for the gist. I can see a couple of issues.</p>
<p>Python is not recognized. Hence, you need to add the path to the python executable to <strong>the end of</strong> your system PATH.</p>
<p>adb is not recognised. Hence, you need to follow the instructions in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;installing_on_windows.html#workaround_for_a_missing_%3Ctt%3Eadb%3C&#x2F;tt%3E">Workaround for a missing adb</a></p>
<p>When you have rectified these, if you create another gist of your diagnostics output and post the link here, I will double-check it for you.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>Hrm… now it&#39;s telling me - for the New Project I created - &quot;This project is not configured to run for Android&quot; under &quot;Run on Device&quot; and &quot;Distribute&quot;.</p>
<p>Also - my imported project still says &quot;loading…&quot; for the SDK and Screen under &quot;Run Emulator&quot;…</p>

										<p><p>Hrm - well, the first project above never had a build directory since I never got the ability to build… so I deleted it, and now when I do a Create Project, it says:<br>&quot;Project creation error: No &quot;android-4&quot; or &quot;android-1.6&quot; in the Android SDK&quot;</p>
<p>For the existing project I was working on - I deleted the files under each of the immediate subdirectories under &#39;build\android&#39;, then I re-imported it, but am still getting stuck on &quot;loading…&quot; for both the SDK and Screen.</p>

										<p><p>OK, Takahito, I think you are getting there.</p>
<p>Make sure that you have set the path of the Android SDK, as per the first screenshot under <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;troubleshooting_your_installation.html#the_project_creation_process">The Project Creation Process</a>.</p>

<p>Then try to launch your app again.</p>

										<p><p>Reset the location&#x2F;path of your Android SDK home again on the Edit Profile screen, in case it contains any illegal characters, such as trailing spaces, as TiDev is unlikely to be able to boot an android emulator if there are.</p>
<p>Install the latest <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;continuous_builds.html">Continuous Build</a> 1.5.X. Use this when launching apps, as per <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32238-titanium-mobile&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;2852">#2852</a>.</p>
<p>Consider replicating exactly the packages installed on the system desribed in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32238-titanium-mobile&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;2813">#2813</a>. Note the workaround to the problem (ie you must also install 1.5, even though it&#39;s not officially supported).</p>
<p>Then, are you able to log into the machine as administrator, and create and launch a new default project?</p>

<p>Have you made any progress with this?  Would you go through my previous comment, which could solve the issue?</p>
<p>Also, would you tell me the path to your Titanium SDK directory (where you place the continuous builds)?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>I have done:<br>Reset location&#x2F;path of Android SDK in Edit Profile screen.<br>Install latest Continuous Build 1.6.x (not 1.5.x; I&#39;ve tried 1.5.1)<br>Installed Android SDK 1.5.</p>
<p>None of these have made differences; I have not logged in as administrator (especially since I don&#39;t want to do that just to be able to build)…</p>
<p>I&#39;m so lost - I have no idea where to go with this… I&#39;ve done 4-5 successful Titanium installs (all on Win7 - both x86 and x64) in the past year alone.  This is the only one so far not working…</p>

										<p><p>Takahito, it&#39;s important that you at least try my suggestions if we are to be able to eliminate possible causes and make progress. It&#39;s not so fun from this side of the conversation either, you know! ;)</p>
<p>As stated in the &quot;Installing on Win 7&quot; guide, confirming that things work correctly when logged in as an administrator is important, as it confirms that Titanium <strong>can</strong> work on your machine and that the issue is user-specific rather than system-wide. I wouldn&#39;t for one moment suggest that you should use an administrator account for developing. Hence, would you please, at least, give it a try?</p>
<p>Also, as I have explained, there is a bug in 1.6.X relating to the build process. This is why you should use <strong>the latest</strong> 1.5.X build while we troubleshoot this issue.</p>
<p>Again, would you please state the path where your Titanium SDKs are stored on your system?</p>
<p>Would you also post here (or at imageshack or similar) a screenshot of your android packages (in the android tool). I will check it against mine to be extra certain.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Hal - thanks for the quick replies.  I&#39;m going to try all of that later tonight when I get off work (I&#39;m actually visiting San Jose for work - I see you guys are in Mountain View!  Maybe I should just bring my laptop by there.. ha!).  I appreciate your help - got any exciting events happening there in the next 2 weeks while I am in town? :-)  I&#39;d love to check you guys out!</p>

										<p><p>I tried Titanium under the administrator account.  When I tried to create a new project, I got the same error of &quot;Project creation error: No &quot;android-4&quot; or &quot;android-1.6&quot; in the Android SDK&quot; even though it said it found the Android SDK.  When I imported my existing project, it also did the same thing with getting stuck on &quot;loading…&quot; for both SDK and Screen.</p>
<p>My Titanium SDK (Mobile) is located here:<br>C:\ProgramData\Titanium\mobilesdk\win32</p>
<p>Here is my Installed Android Packages:<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;img510.imageshack.us&#x2F;img510&#x2F;2064&#x2F;20110128100542.png</p>
<p>I tried the Continuous Build mobilesdk-1.5.2-20110127090351 and got the same &quot;loading…&quot; issue on both the SDK and Screen with my existing project.</p>
<p>Let me know what else I can try!</p>

										<p><p>Hi Takahito</p>
<p>Don&#39;t worry, I haven&#39;t abandoned you, although I am struggling to imagine what could be causing this.</p>
<p>I actually completely removed my TiDev and Android installation today to try to replicate your issue, but mine still works, um, unfortunately!</p>
<p>I note from your screenshot that there are duplicate entries (five in total) of the Samsung package. I wonder if your Android SDK installation is corrupted. You could try removing the Samsung packages, reboot (just to be sure) and trying again.</p>
<p>If that doesn&#39;t work, although it&#39;s a pain, you could completely remove Android SDK Tools and reinstall it and the packages.</p>
<p>Sorry the advice is not more conclusive.  :&#x2F;</p>
