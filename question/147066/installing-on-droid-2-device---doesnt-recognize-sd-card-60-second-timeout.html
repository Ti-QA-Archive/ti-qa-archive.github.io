			<h1>Installing on Droid 2 device - doesn&#39;t recognize SD card (60 second timeout)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I recently got a used Droid 2 w&#x2F;SD card (8G) for development - the first Android I&#39;ve used.  Whenever I do an installation to the phone, it spends 60 seconds trying to find the SD card before actually installing.  This is the repeated &quot;adb.exe -d shell mount&quot; call one sees other posts about.</p>
<p>Since I actually do have an SD card installed (I can see it under Setup), why is ADB failing to see the SD card?  I did notice that if I plug in the phone to the computer via USB, and view the Storage settings, it states the card is unavailable.  But if I unplug the USB, then it shows as available.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

							<div><p>I should add that I had been using the phone for development without an SD card for a while. I just bought one to make the 60 second timeout go away.  Doesn&#39;t seem to make a difference.  I also tried reformatting the card on the phone to no effect.</p>

<p>This is expected behavior if the USB access is &#39;mass storage&#39; in Froyo or GingerBread.</p>
<p>Trying changing it to &#39;charge only&#39; or similar.</p>
<p>Some of the newer devices allow a MTP mode which often allows access from device and from attached system at the same time.</p>

										<p><p>Ah this makes sense, thanks.  A quick search shows me this page, which I&#39;m guessing will work since the X and 2 are pretty much identical minus keyboard &amp; display.</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.companionlink.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2010&#x2F;07&#x2F;tech-tip-ensure-charge-only-mode-is-set-when-syncing-with-droid-x&#x2F;  </p>
<p>I&#39;ll give it a shot tonight when back in the office.  It will be nice to get this fixed and have my build&#x2F;deploy&#x2F;test cycle sped up.</p>

										<p><p>Bingo!  This solved the problem.  The steps outlined in the link in my comment above tell exactly how to set my phone (at least) to &#39;charge only&#39;</p>
