							<p>Hi</p>
<p>IF you mean you want to present ALL users with a username and password window when the app first loads and ONLY those who have the correct permissions can then access the rest of the app - then <strong>YES</strong>.</p>
<p>For example; twitter, facebook, dropbox - all use this method to make sure the features returned are those of the correct person.  In your case it simply allows access to the app.</p>
<p>I would make sure you do NOT only provide one common username&#x2F;password as it will get out and render your app security useless.</p>

										<p><p>ok</p>
<p>But in the android market it is possible to restrict an app before downloading it, or give access to a single user with as much of gmail? something.</p>
<p>I have a colleague who tells me that if you download even a portion of the app and ask for username and password, you can desconpilar this app and find the path to the server, my other question is whether it can provide security for the app to not be decompiled</p>

										<p><p>I understand the question better now - as your app stands right now - it would be fairly easy to pull it apart yes.</p>
<p>So yes you could simply email apps to people directly - many companies sell them on their own website and do not user the several market place points of distribution.</p>
<p>Not really a good plan if you are looking for some sort of saturation.</p>
<p>There is a solution Google already provides called <strong>Google Play Licensing</strong> and you can include it in your app and it will interact with the licence server and should make it much harder.  Keep in mind nothing is ever 100% safe no matter what you do.  You simply balance everything you could do with the effort factor.</p>
<p>If you want to include the <strong>Google Play Licensing</strong> in your app then there is a module in the Appcelerator market place that will do it for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;4359?1071605670">Google Play Licensing Module</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It is not free - but not expensive either and if you are looking for piece of mind then it is worth everyone of the very few pennies being asked for it.</p>
