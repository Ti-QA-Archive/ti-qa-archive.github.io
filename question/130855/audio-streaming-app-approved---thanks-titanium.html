			<h1>Audio streaming app approved - thanks Titanium!</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>So after many months of dev, I finally submitted my iOS app and it got approved on the first try. It took 1 week for Apple to review it and within a couple hours of being In Review, it was Ready for Sale. I&#39;m pretty happy. I was a bit worried about how much streaming the app does (and allows for over cell connection).<br>The app is free and is in support of <strong>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dubplate.fm</strong>. It allows users to listen to the 4 radio stations and also listen to the complete archive of dj uploaded mixes. It also allows for chatting (via a webview).<br>The app uses google analytics and I was glad to see that Apple had no problems with this. I had read that some forms of user tracking were not allowed and there seemed to be some confusion about whether google analytics is ok to use.<br>Despite the problems and frustrations I had while developing it, I&#39;m happy to see that Titanium is a viable solution for iOS apps.</p>
<p>Check it out - Dubplate.fm - <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunes.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;dubplate.fm&#x2F;id494184333">on iTunes</a></p>

										<p><p>I ended up using VideoPlayer class. I did this because I needed seek ability as some mixes are 1 - 2 hours long. I had to hack titanium source to get seek working but it was pretty easy. http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;66911&#x2F;please-add-currentplaybacktime-to-titaniummediavideoplayer</p>
