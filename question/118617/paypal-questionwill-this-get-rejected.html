			<h1>Paypal Question..will this get rejected?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a free app, and I&#39;m looking at this as a solution for users to upgrade, since the in-app module price is ridiculous.</p>
<ul>
<li>A user clicks a &quot;register button&quot;</li>
<li>it takes them paypal (in app) site</li>
<li>they pay, get a code emailed to them</li>
<li>enter the code, app is registered, ads are removed and all features are released</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise, they would have to register on the free to sync their data to the website, then delete the free app and download the paid one, re-login and download their changes.</p>
<p>Question is, does anyone know if this is something Apple will reject, because of the purchasing?  </p>

							<div><p>Josh, I am not guessing this will get you in lotsa trouble with Apple if not banned as a developer. The latest apple developer agreement was rewritten to prevent ANY app from selling ANYTHING without apple getting their 30% fee. Do a search on how Amazon (kindle) and others that ebooks reacted to this. It is not a joke, if it slips through the approval process…when they catch it you will lose your apple developer rights. Find a different way to monetize or build in apples 30%.</p>

							<p>Even if Apple doesn&#39;t reject this initially as Ronald stated you will end up losing your developer rights. Apple wants it&#39;s 30%. If you cannot live with that then price your app 30% higher.</p>
