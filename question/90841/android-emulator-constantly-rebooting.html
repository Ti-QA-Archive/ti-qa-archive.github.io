		<section>
			<p>Hi there, and thanks for reading!</p>
<p>After switching to Titanium 1.2.2 and Mobile SDK 1.5.0, I&#39;ve noticed some erratic behaviour on the Android emulator:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>emulator restarts with no reason, sometimes after a runtime error, sometimes right after launching my app, and sometimes just right after booting completely after being launched</p>
</li>
<li><p>emulator informs that &quot;process $1 is not responding&quot;, where $1 is generally the system process, but sometimes may be acore, or the calendar. This may happen while installing my app on the emulator, right after loading it, or right after unlocking the screen.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I was quite sure the problem came from the emulator, but now I&#39;m more inclined to think the problem comes from Titanium, especially after I ran the Titanium virtual device from outside of Titanium and observed it behaved in the same erratic way, as opposed to a brand-new virtual device I made from the Android SDK; as they suggested me on <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;4462927&#x2F;android-emulator-constantly-rebooting-on-ubuntu-maverick">the Android forums</a>.</p>
<p>If anybody has any idea how to fix this or where else I could point to, I&#39;ll be very thankful. BTW, I&#39;m running everything on Ubuntu 10.10.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>Leo</p>

							<p>I think I found a solution, but I don&#39;t claim it is universally valid. Here&#39;s what I did</p>
<ul>
<li>erased the virtual device created under Titanium</li>
<li>changed the project file for it to use SDK 1.4.2</li>
<li>launched project build under 1.4.2. It didn&#39;t build the app, but at least it created a new virtual device</li>
<li>launched project build under 1.5.0 using the virtual device above</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, I cannot assure this would always work, but for me it work very well.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>I&#39;m having this same problem. It seems that the virtual device Titanium 1.5+ creates (w&#x2F; latest Android tools) has some major issues. I&#39;ve also tried the continuous 1.6 with the same results. </p>
<p>I tried your advice with a 1.4.3 build since I don&#39;t have the 1.4.2 sdk, but I couldn&#39;t get Titanium to create the Android device.</p>
<p>We need this fixed! Android SDK and Titanium installed fresh doesn&#39;t work properly together.</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve had this problem, and for me, it seemed specific to running the Emulator under 2.1 API; Once I switched to 1.6 or 2.2, it seemed stable.</p>
