			<h1>How to Delete table row with confirmation</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am trying to do delete a row from a table only on confirmation. But row is getting deleted from the table view on screen before the delete event is called. I have first line as alert statement in delete event. The rows gets deleted even before alerts gets popup. Since now row is already deleted, i can&#39;t add it back. It gives error.</p>
<p>table.addEventListener(&quot;delete&quot;, function(e) {<br>   alert(&#39;delete called);<br>    var alertBox = Ti.UI.createAlertDialog({<br>        title: &quot;Delete&quot;,<br>        message: &quot;Are you sure you want to delete ?&quot;,<br>        buttonNames: [&#39;Cancel&#39;,&#39;Yes&#39;]<br>    });</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">alertBox.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">"click"</span>, function(<span class="hljs-keyword">e</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">e</span>.index == 1) {
        <span class="hljs-comment">// Delete row</span>
    } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
        <span class="hljs-comment">// Add row again</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">table</span>.insertRowBefore(<span class="hljs-keyword">e</span>.index, <span class="hljs-keyword">e</span>.row);
    }
});
</code></pre><p>});</p>

							<p>This is because you&#39;re calling the alert inside the &#39;delete&#39; listener. This means the row has already been deleted. You can&#39;t stop an event that has already happened. You need to confirm the delete before the row is deleted and the delete event is fired.</p>

										<p><p>Can you please suggest in which event, I can put the confirmation logic? I can&#39;t do it on swipe event. On swipe even the delete button is just displayed. I need to do it on click even of the delete button click which appeared after swipe event..</p>

										<p><p>According to the process you&#39;ve just described, it seems like you&#39;re adding an extra step here. The swipe is the action, and pressing the delete button is the confirmation. This is the way that the experience was intended. Adding a 3rd step or a &#39;second confirmation&#39; breaks that flow.</p>
<p>However, if you wish to insert that confirmation anyway, I think you&#39;re going to have to take over the entire process. You&#39;ll have to turn off the swipe to delete, then listen for the swipe event yourself, then display a delete button on that row, and when that button is clicked you can display your confirmation dialog.</p>

										<p><p>I have already thought about that approach but that&#39;s the last option, I want to go with. I believe, it&#39;s always good to have some handler in place before any delete action is performed. Delete is an action people are adapted and expects that confirmation will be asked before actual delete.</p>

										<p><p>It is always good to have something in place before the delete action is performed, you are correct, people are used to seeing this in most web scenarios. However, iPhone users are now used to performing a swipe and delete as the action to remove something. I&#39;d be surprised if you can find a widely used application that breaks the flow of swipe and delete. </p>
<p>However, you can add a step, but you&#39;d have to do it without the alert dialog. You can add a button to the top of your table that will put the table into edit mode. Once in edit mode, small red icons appear as the left image of each table row. When you click the icon for a table row, then the delete button appears. When you click on the delete button, only then the row is delete. You can see an example of this in action here:<br><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_mobile&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;demos&#x2F;KitchenSink&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;examples&#x2F;table_view_delete.js">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_mobile&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;demos&#x2F;KitchenSink&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;examples&#x2F;table_view_delete.js</a></p>
<p>This adds a secondary &#39;confirmation&#39; step without the obtrusive alert dialog for each row that you want to delete.</p>
<p>As I said before though, if you want the alert dialog, you&#39;re going to have to take over the entire process yourself.</p>

										<p><p>There&#39;s another use case for canceling the delete.  In the &#39;delete&#39; event listener, delete the row in the DB and, if the DB delete fails, display a message and cancel the delete operation so the row stays in the table view.</p>
