			<p>What appears to be the best practice for connecting screens between each other?  Some of mine are represented as views and others are windows with views.</p>
<p>My main screen is a window with 3 buttons.  Clicking on button 1 opens a list of items(another window).  Then when you click on the item in the table, it opens a 3rd window that has a tab collection of views.  I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;m using too many windows instead of appropriately using views.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Window 1: main application has the title of the application and 3 buttons for navigation</li>
<li>Window 2: table with a list of items</li>
<li>Window 3: allows the user to open and see more in-depth view of the content for the user, which has tabs to allow navigation between sections of it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Am I going window crazy?  Should I be using views between all this stuff instead?  Is anyone aware of an article on this?  Anyone know of examples that show this in action?  I&#39;m using the 2.0 SDK.  </p>
<p>Martin</p>

							<p>Hello Martin,</p>
<p>You are not going window crazy :-). This is an issue that I am sure everybody worries about! It&#39;s not easy to decide for the &#39;correct&#39; application structure as there is no one! Depending on your application, a structure may be considered as the ideal one!</p>
<p>I would suggest to check out the MVC model (Model, View, Controller) which is very famous - however again, it&#39;s not easy to get it &quot;right&quot; because there are many variations, depending on your case.</p>
<p>What is important though is to keep your code tidy, simple and easy to extend. This is something that requires special attention in Titanium as it&#39;s very easy to find yourself in front of <em>nasty</em> code. </p>
<p>Make sure to utilize the CommonJS and try to keep your code in separate files. Make them as reusable as possible! Check out this tutorial which is very helpful! <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;video&#x2F;27447911">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;video&#x2F;27447911</a></p>
<p>Also, Ketan Majmudar had a great video at CODESTRONG 2011, called <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;video&#x2F;30085639">From Kitchen Sink to App: Real World Case Studies</a> where he talks about the App Structure.</p>
<p>I have already contacted Appcelerator Support about the MVC models which are listed into the Marketplace. I was said that they are working towards an official MVC release in the near future, as the models listed there are not officially theirs.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
