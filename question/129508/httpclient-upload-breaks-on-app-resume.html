			<h1>HTTPClient upload breaks on app resume</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all.</p>
<p>My app has an upload facility which ideally I want to abort once the app is paused, as there seems no way to freeze the upload or better still keep it going in the background.</p>
<p>The problem is, Titanium appears to be trying to complete the upload on resume, but not sending the correct data, so my web API keeps getting broken data and throwing errors.</p>
<p>So a quick sequence of events:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I record a lengthy piece of audio in the iOS Simulator</p>
</li>
<li><p>I post it, and as soon as I hit the Post button, I hit the hardware home button</p>
</li>
<li><p>I wait a second or two for the download to pause, as it takes a wee while. And while this is going on, I&#39;m logging the sending process</p>
</li>
<li><p>I go back into the app and find that the upload progress (as reported by <code>onsendstream</code>) has gone from 0.01 or 0.08 etc, to 1, and I have a fresh new error at the web API end, because the data from 8% to 99% is missing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#39;ve tried various things, hooking into the pause&#x2F;resume App events to abort the download then restart it. That works, but when it restarts, it still seems to register that there was a previous <code>HTTPClient</code> with that data, and almost tries to carry on from where it left off [which would be great, if it worked :)].</p>
<p>That&#39;s what <em>appears</em> to be happening, anyway. Even though it starts a completely fresh <code>HTTPClient</code>, it seems that, because it&#39;s sending the same data, it&#39;s trying to resume.</p>
<p>Also a quick note, I&#39;ve even tried appending a timestamp to the end of every request URL, to make each post unique, but still no luck. And yes, if I record the audio without pausing and resuming the app, the upload goes through fine.</p>
<p>I know this is probably slightly rambling, but if you can understand the basics of what I&#39;m saying, I&#39;d appreciate any advice or questions you have.</p>

							<p>I might try and put some thought where.</p>
<p>I am thinking that a HTTP request will remain open until it is closed by the application, there is no override. So I wonder if the original request is still open, and when you create a new request it is in effect using the original one.</p>
<p>Try nulling out the http request variable on a pause of the app during an upload.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>T.</p>

										<p><p>Yes thank you. What I hadn&#39;t mentioned is my HTTPClients are in a dict, and I&#39;m deleting them after the abort(). Is it worth nulling it beforhand?</p>

										<p><p>yes null them… and make sure each request is in a new variable… I.e. if your using a statement like var xhr = request put it into a unique array like xhr[nextnum] = request. or you will just be using the already open request. T…</p>

										<p><p>thanks for this Trevor.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried nulling the <code>HTTPClient</code>, but with no luck. It&#39;s not practical for me to have a different key as it&#39;s tied to the record that the upload relates to.</p>
<p>The dict I referred to actually contains a number of objects which wrap the <code>HTTPClient</code> to make it better fit my needs, so each time a new upload it started, it&#39;s creating a new <code>UploadController</code> object which has an <code>HTTPClient</code> object within it.</p>
<p>Do you think there&#39;s anything else worth trying?</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>

										<p><p>ok the issue I think is that you are using the same connection. Although you may believe that it is creating a new instance, it actually isn&#39;t. This is exactly the issue I had and resolved it by the array method.</p>
<p>It does actually mean that you are creating a single instance of the request which is being used each time until the connection is actually closed.</p>
<p>I hope I have explained this ok. if you would like to post the code to gitpaste maybe I can help you work out a solution.</p>

										<p><p>Actually, I think a combination of things you&#39;ve suggested might be helping already, thank you.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried rebuilding the &quot;stack&quot; of uploads, by popping each item from the bottom, then re-adding it (via a secondary list). I don&#39;t really know how, but it seems to work more often than not, which is a great improvement on before, where it didn&#39;t work at all!</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.<br>-Mark</p>
