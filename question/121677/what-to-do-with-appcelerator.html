			<h1>What to do with Appcelerator...</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have been developing an app for the last few months, using my android handset to test and overall it has been going pretty well, except the constant &#39;run on device&#39; was frustrating for seeing the results of code changes. It was with <strong>GREAT ENTHUSIASM</strong> that I signed up as an Indie developer to start using an actual debugger to move development ahead more quickly… sadly the experience has been more than disappointing.</p>
<p>Initially, I had issues with getting the new TStudio up and running, but that was to be expected, I was learning and things were new… Now after three weeks of trial and error, I have decided that debugging my current project in TStudio is a waste of time and I&#39;m back to code change&#x2F;run on device&#x2F;make a change&#x2F;repeat. Not the ideal scenario, but the only one that seems to work. </p>
<p>The various issues I have had are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Initially couldn&#39;t figure out why ALL of my screens had changed layout. Turns out this was an artifact of some things Appcelerator had changed in 1.7 (see this posting for details <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;06&#x2F;new-defaults-for-android-layouts-in-1-7.html">New Defaults for android layouts in 1.7</a> So, it was frustrating, but at least there was a fix.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Database not installing on emulator. Again a weird problem that I never did figure out why it was happening. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;121197&#x2F;android-database-install-on-emulator-fails-works-fine-on-device-cant-figure-it-out">See my Q&amp;A posting</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Last Straw, I am trying to debug on the emulator, but when I set a breakpoint and switch to the &#39;Variable&#39; view tab so I can try and see what is going on, TStudio fires an error <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;121505&#x2F;titanium-error-when-debugging">Debug Error</a> that causes the debugger to become USELESS because you can&#39;t see the values of ANYTHING you&#39;re trying to debug!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, I may be slow or daft, but the indie subscription does nothing for me as I can&#39;t get the help I need to either get this setup properly or figure out if this is a true product error or not. So it would be helpful if there was some way to submit issues around setup or errors or bugs that the system is raising (not my APP, again it works fine&#x2F;GREAT as a matter of fact, on my handset).</p>
<p>Not sure where to go from here, what to do… If anyone from Appcelerator has any suggestions, I&#39;m open to them. In the meantime I really feel like you have my money and I don&#39;t really have any way of getting the answers I need to move forward with the product.</p>

							<p>Feel your pain. I signed for an Indie membership because I really wanted the debug and some modules (Tvout to be precise). That module is unusable, slow and buggy. Studio simple does not cut it for me. </p>
<p>Helpdesk read access is nice. Its kinda frustrating sometimes, but that feature only is not a good reason to pay the admission fee…</p>
<p>But I have faith that Appcelerator will fix Studio quick, specially the debugger… I think if you stick around you will no regret it (thats how i feel)</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>I feel the same way. I expect they&#39;ll fix it, just frustrating to be back in the code(insert many alert statements here)&#x2F;run&#x2F;fix&#x2F;remove alert boxes&#x2F;repeat mode… </p>
<p>Read access to the helpdesk has been great too. I&#39;m hanging in… just hoping it moves quickly…</p>

							<p>Hi Ray</p>
<p>I can entirely understand your frustration with this, and will endeavor to help.</p>
<p>Have you seen the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Contributing+to+Titanium">Contributing to Titanium</a> guide? Users don&#39;t need to subscribe to an Appcelerator plan in order to submit tickets for genuine, well-described, well-tested, reproducible bugs.</p>
<p>After you have read the guidelines, raise a ticket in the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC">Titanium Community</a> project, and I will help you through the process of getting it into the appropriate project.</p>
<p>Speak to you over there! ;)</p>

<p>Would you please state fully the environment you are having the debugger problems with, including Titanium version, build and date, the platform and platform SDK version.</p>

										<p><p>Paul,</p>
<p>Thanks for the nudge in the right direction. I will <strong>DEFINITELY</strong> take the time to document&#x2F;submit this. Didn&#39;t know you could do this. Thanks so much for replying.</p>

<p>Once you have raised a ticket, would you post a link to it here, so that other users may find it?  I will investigate it as soon as you have done so.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
