			<h1>ScrollableView in heavyweight windows eventually causes crash on android</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>I&#39;m noticing that in the latest version of Titanium (2.0.2+) that creating a scrollableView within a heavyweight window thats being opened&#x2F;closed&#x2F;re-opened will eventually cause a force close on android. This problem doesn&#39;t occur on iOS. </p>
<p>The app is being built with CommonJS principles and essentially its a heavyweight window that has a scrollableview inside of it. At first I thought it was happening when tableview&#39;s were inside it but it also happens with webviews (News reader part of app– dashboard &gt; news (news table) &gt; scrollableview when selecting an article that allows you to swipe to view other articles in the list.</p>
<p>I can post code but I don&#39;t think that&#39;ll help it&#39;s basically if you have a scrollableview within a heavyweight window that the problem occurs. It doesn&#39;t always happen straight away either, it only occurs if you keep going back to the window with the scrollableview in it; eventually resulting in a force close. Which is quite disappointing as it seems to point to it eventually becoming unstable the more it is used.</p>
<p>My next step is just to remove the original scrollableView and create a new one every time the window opens as an attempt to resolve– if that doesn&#39;t do it I&#39;m not sure what else to be doing other than to just not use scrollableView&#39;s on android.</p>
<p>This is just one of many hurdles on my way through building apps in Titanium, it&#39;s proving to be a somewhat unreliable framework in places I&#39;m surprised things like this aren&#39;t more obvious to have been fixed. Whether it be inconsistencies betwen iOS and android (daft things like table rows with views inside won&#39;t highlight on android unless you make all the views inside it have touchEnabled:false to major things like if you specify on android anyDensity:true it results in way way way poorer performance across the board than using dp&#39;s to manage density—every example application I&#39;ve ever seen never specifies in dp&#39;s nor does the documentation seem to reflect how big of a deal that is to performance on android). Anyway back on subject, if anyone has any pointers as to why scrollableView&#39;s would cause crashing in this way I&#39;d be keen to hear it.</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;ve been absolutely wracking my brain the last month and a half having this exact issue with my application. I&#39;ve spend so much time trying to track down the issue, but essentially my app is having this exact same behavior. </p>
<p>A scrollable view that is opened, closed, and then re-opened crashes almost everytime on Android. iOS, works perfectly!</p>
<p>DDMS shows some very vague nullpointer exceptions which are next to impossible to trace back to native titanium code. Hopefully others will look into this issue as well.</p>

							<p>Ok. So after doing some tests I&#39;ve managed to workaround this for the moment.</p>
<p>Essentially I have to:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(Perhaps not necessary) Add an event to the window for when it is closed. In this function I remove the scroll view in question from the display.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the function I call that opens the window, on the line before it I am currently populating the news in the scrollableView first (this removes the previous data from the scrollableView and adds the new set). In here I was re-populating the same scrollableView (Note: that this bug still happens even if you aren&#39;t repopulating). Instead of doing that I overwrite the scrollableView with a NEW one rather than use the old instance and populate+add that instead</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In my tests, even if I removed the scrollableView from the display as the window close event fired but never re-added it to the display when the window is re-opened, it would still cause the application to crash in the same way. It seems the only way to work around on android is to create a new scrollableView every time which is far from ideal. (and in my tests I do that before the window is called to be re-opened, I&#39;m not sure if it would occur or not if you attempted to create a new scrollableView on the window &#39;open&#39; event..</p>
