			<h1>Writing apps that are running on iOS and Android with the same code</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve had some trouble getting my app to run both on iOS and Android with the same code. I&#39;ve experienced performance impacts when calling openWindow under Android and different behaviours of the orientationchange event. But I find a solution how I can avoid these traps. But this solution has some influences on the way I structure my code and where I place my variables.</p>
<p>To share my conclusions I&#39;ve written an article in my blog. Maybe you will find it helpful:</p>

<p>Feel free to leave a comment if you like the article or if you&#39;ve found a better solution.</p>

<p>The article you have written is good, and much closer to best practice than many other examples I&#39;ve seen. However, please be cautious about using phrases such as, &quot;According to Appcelerator it is recommended, that each window gets its own context&quot;, as this is certainly not the case.</p>
<p>That said, thanks for sharing your experiences, as I am certain other community members will find it useful.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m sorry if I missunderstood something. I thought I&#39;ve read this in some guide. Maybe an older one?! Can&#39;t find it anymore. Maybe some memory error. ;) I&#39;ve deleted this phrase. :)</p>

							<p>While developing I detected that performance on Android has been slowed down extremely, when using fonts that have a fontFamily set. So I took out the fontFamily for Android (using the default) to get a much better performance.</p>
