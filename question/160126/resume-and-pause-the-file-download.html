		<section>
			<p>Hello Friends,</p>
<p>I have created a app and in this app can download the video and stored in the local storage. This part is done easily but problem is How to pause and resume the downlod file.<br>Mean User can also pause the download file and also resume that download file. if you have any idea about this logic the let me inform.</p>
<p>i.e : </p>
<p>User A can download the remote vidoe1 and he want to download another video at that time and he just pause the first video and start the second video for donload. So, Problem is how can we pause the download and also resume that download file from the end point.?</p>
<p>I am not sure but i think i need to go for module(iOS native).<br>Let me know if guys have any suggestion for me.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>Jigar M</p>

							<p>Kevin Willford used to have two great little modules in the marketplace, one for ios and one for android.  They allowed queued downloading and pausing.  They don&#39;t seem to listed there any more though. Kevin hasn&#39;t been around here for a while though. You might be able to contact him through his website, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kcwdev.com">www.kcwdev.com</a></p>
