							<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just read your post and tried installing a new Ti app on my iPhone and it all worked fine. </p>
<p>?</p>
<p>On a side note, out of interest, what&#39;s your app called in iTunes? ;)</p>

							<p>My issue is that my development environment crashes - not the app in the phone. Ti Developer (on Mac) dies.<br>When I select &#39;Run on Device&#39; then click on &#39;Install&#39; - Developer dies.<br>This is a totally new (today) development. I figure something in my development environment has gotten corrupted and I am hoping someone can tell me how to fix it.</p>

							<p>I haven&#39;t seen that happen personally but have heard of it happening to others.  iTunes likes to freeze when I install a new app.  Not sure which is better.  LOL</p>
<p>Try this process and see if it works any better for you, in my experience so far this way seems to work the best:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you&#39;re iPhone is not connected to your computer.</li>
<li>Double-click your provisioning file and it should open the Xcode Organizer.</li>
<li>Drag and drop your provisioning profile from Finder to the Provisioning Profiles area in Xcode Organizer.</li>
<li>Add your provisioning profile in Titanium Developer and click Install Now (if the button is disabled, click the edit tab, then back to Test &amp; Package and Run on Device).</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully that&#39;ll all work and your app will be installed into iTunes. Then connect your iPhone, make sure your new app is selected to be synced on the app tab, and try syncing it.</p>
<p>EDIT: Hehehe I just saw that rebooting worked for you, glad you&#39;re okay now.  :)</p>
