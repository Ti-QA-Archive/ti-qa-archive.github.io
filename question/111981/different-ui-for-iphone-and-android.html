			<h1>Different UI for iPhone and Android</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m developing an app for both platforms and my original plan was to use one UI design for both and branch in-code, as needed, to achieve this.</p>
<p>I&#39;m having difficulty achieving this due to differences in the ways controls render on each platform. I&#39;m also running into bugs&#x2F;restrictions on one and not the other (gradients primarily) and it appears that using a different (although similar) UI design on each will work best.</p>
<p>I hate to deviate from my original design but this seems like the best way to get the work done quickly and still have pleasing designs on each.  I&#39;m going to organize my code to still maximize code reuse.</p>
<p>I&#39;d be interested to hear how others are dealing with this. Common UI design or different?</p>

							<p>I dont know what your UI looks like, but I would focus more on making sure the UI is consistent with conventions for the specific platform and not so much that they are the same.</p>
<p>Android and IOS are different and users expectations on how the applications should behave are also different; so I am not saying they should not match, I am just saying the priority should be a consistent look and feel for the specific platform</p>

							<p>I got the two to look the same by using lots images for button and backgrounds. I started by getting my iphone app in the simulator and importing screen captures into gimp for the images.  Also, my app is small enough that I created a &quot;table&quot; by hand that looks like an iphone table on both the android and iphone.</p>
