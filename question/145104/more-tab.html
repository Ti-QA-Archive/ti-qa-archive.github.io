			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have searched around and couldn&#39;t find how to hide the &quot;more&quot; tab on the titlebar when you have 6 tabs or more?</p>
<p>When I switch from tab 1 to tab 4 there&#39;s no &quot;more&quot; tab, on the 5th and 6th tab the &quot;more&quot; tab appears on the top left of title bar.</p>
<p>I&#39;m using customtabbar for the 6 tabs.</p>
<p>Can the tab be hidden or removed?</p>

							<p>Titanium does not give you such functionality. It cannot be accessed through the API so you cant do anything to change it.</p>

										<p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>The app I&#39;m developing requires 6 tabs. The app do not require the &quot;More&quot; tab.</p>
<p>How about hiding the whole title bar?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve created a custom titlebar with 2 image.</p>
<p>What&#39;s happening now is that I&#39;m able to hide tab1 to tab4 system title bar and only show the custom titlebar, when I click on tab5 and tab6 the system title bar still shows with the &quot;More&quot; button and custom titlebar appears below it.</p>
<p>Any ways to totally hide the system title bar so I can replace with a custom titlebar instead. Or any workaround suggestion?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

										<p><p>are you talking about the TITLEBAR or TABBAR? the one on the top? or on the bottom (in iOS)?</p>

										<p><p>That can not work. Titanium does not give you a way to handle this.</p>
<p>If it is ok with you you could accept this answer as BEST answer so that people know there is no API access to do such thing.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>You are using third-party code that aims to solve a problem, namely the ability to override the standard way tabs work - there is nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>That said as it is third-party code and as it does come from the Market Place there is very little that can be done without the original author making the changes or someone else trying to add that functionality to that persons code.</p>
<p>This if often the case when using third-party code to solve one problem - you end up with another, no matter how great the original code was.</p>
<p>I would suggest you either look for a different way to achieve your custom tabs requirement or determine a way for the app to not require 6 tabs and to use five instead as there are many code examples that achieve that well.</p>
<p>Keep in mind when you have tabs each tab should have the same &#39;feature weight&#39;.  By this I mean that each tab should be a separate distinct function within the app.  If the tabs have similar functions then join them together and use a tabBar to swap between the similar functionality.  If one of the tabs is no more than supplementary information or a limited set of functionality ass this as a button or other link from within a &#39;home&#39; or other generally focussed tab.</p>
