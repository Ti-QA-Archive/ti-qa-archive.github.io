			<h1>Marketing iPhone Apps</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve released one app the App Store and although I didn&#39;t expect my first app to be extremely popular, I also didn&#39;t expect it to get lost in the App Store as quickly as it did.</p>
<p>I&#39;m working on another app now that I&#39;m hoping will be much more popular, but want to establish a marketing plan beforehand to avoid this one being lost also.</p>
<p>Anyone using Facebook ads or Google Ads to market apps?  What types of marketing efforts have worked for you?</p>

							<p>Facebook ads arent the greatest…the best is to have a website, a blog, a twitter, a &#39;share with friends&#39; button in your app that people can email links to, etc.</p>
<p>Also, having an appropriate name for your app works.  My initial build of my iPad app was called PlotMe, but unless people were searching for that, they rarely got it.  I renamed it to Travel Map for iPad, and now when you&#39;re searching, you get so far as &quot;travel m&quot; and it shows up as the #1 search result, the #1 iPad app for that criteria, and its almost all of Google&#39;s page 1 search  results.</p>

							<p>Appropriate names, and setting all the keywords properly helps. If add a ratings feature in it to have the current users give it a rating that could help also.</p>

							<p>Check out Tap for Tap. My company, in full disclosure. It&#39;s a good cross-promotion service for indie developers. We have a free plugin on the marketplace here. Check it out!</p>
