			<h1>Better way to use push notifications on ACS</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>I have my app designed and push notifications seems to work well for a reduced group of mobile devices. My worries are about grow.</p>
<p>Initially I will have a few users on my app, maybe dozens or hundreds, so I suppose all will go well, but eventually I can grow to thousands or even a million, and I don&#39;t know how push notifications will handle it.</p>
<p>My simple need is to allow users to subscribe to 4 main channels: ch1, ch2, ch3 and ch4, which represents features in my app. Sometimes I will send to all my subscribed users a message, for example, notifying them to a new future update of my app for feature 4.<br>Then, I send to ch4 the message, and all will receive the message.</p>
<p>Same for the other channels. The idea is so simple.</p>
<p>The users don&#39;t need registration (users&#x2F;pass), they only subscribe their mobile devices (by token), so I cannot differentiate which user I send, I send to all the subscribed devices to the channel.</p>
<p>Will this work for 1 user or 1 million in the same way? Obviously, in the case I have more subscriptions than the free limit, I will upgrade to Appcelerator Platform, but my worries here are the support for the push notifications, no matter if there are 1, 100 or 100.000 users subscribed.</p>
<p>Also, is this a right way to use push notifications or there is a better way to solve the problem? I don&#39;t want users to be obliged to register, only be able to receive the push notifications (with a simple button Subscribe-Unsubscribe).</p>

							<p>Hi You can probably try using the UAS module from the marketplace. Please find the link below:<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;urbanairship.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;mobile-app-engagement<br>It does almost everything you need.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the link, Rupesh, but it seems that Titanium also does the same things for free (and I have it done). My doubts are about the &quot;power&quot; of the free edition of Titanium, I only want to know if my suppositions are right or not.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Luis, but I have my app working months ago. My question was related to &quot;grow&quot;, not to &quot;how to do notifications&quot;.</p>
