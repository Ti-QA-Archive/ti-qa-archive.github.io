			<h1>Push on android doesn&#39;t work anymore and device is unsubscribed from ACS</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Since some days, my app cannot receive push with android device. It doesn&#39;t work anymore with the develpment ACS server.</p>
<p>Note I had problem in my app. Sometimes push were sent continousely every 5 seconds and it could possibly sature the ACS server. But now this problem is solved. Device is subscribed but when I send a push to this device token, the device is unsubscribed from ACS serveur and push are never received.</p>
<p>Could I&#39;ve been black-listed from ACS server?</p>
<p>I checked appcelerator ACS logs but I found no error message. I get only subscribe and notify messages and they all have 200 state.</p>
<p>I noticed another problem during my app compilation on android, this error is displayed:<br>CloudpushModuleImplementation: (KrollRuntimeThread) [293,293] Problem parsing <code>acs-push-api-url</code>: java.net.MalformedURLException<br>Perhaps this is the problem, perhaps not. I can&#39;t find any info for this error.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know how to resove this. I tried previous Titanium SDK but problem persist.<br>Thanks for any help</p>
<p>Titanium SDK: 3.4.1.GA<br>Android SDK: 4.4.2</p>
