			<p>Looking at the Studio license dated April 16,2012,<br>What does &quot;Appcelerator may include ads within the  Applications developed with the Product(s).&quot; (section2.3) mean - am I going to get random Appcelerator ads appearing in my app?</p>

							<p>As Ivan points out, this provision relates to our development tooling.  Appcelerator has no plans to include advertising within your applications, unless of course you put those ads there yourself in the form of AdMob or iAds.</p>

<p>I think that means adverts in TiStudio&#39;s dashboard.</p>

							<p>I hope not too, as it would be a show stopper for me. :-(</p>
<p>..in Section 14 Definitions it says</p>
<p>14.2 &quot;Application(s)&quot;    shall    mean the software application products that<br>Customer will develop     using the Product(s).</p>
<p>that&#39;s not TIStudio</p>

							<p>hm.. you are right, although the terms &amp; conditions page right now returns a &quot;Page not found&quot; message.</p>
<p>it&#39;s important to know this, although I don&#39;t believe that Appcelerator will ever decide to drop the whole community that is trying to build during these tough days…</p>

<p>As you say, it is very important that this is clarified as this could leave any app wide open for any Appceleretor adverts of any kind.</p>

							<p>Highly doubtful, as this would turn off a lot of developers. </p>
<p>Some official clarification from Appcelerator would be a good thing.</p>

										<p><p>True! Although I have been in direct communication with the sales team to confirm about any charges that may incur in the future, I haven&#39;t paid attention to this issue either. And yes, it&#39;s very important for the developers to know if such a possibility exists.</p>

							<p>I have just read a document sent to me by Appcelerator  called &#39;New License Pricing&#39; and it does seem that adverts can be included in your App. </p>
<p>To quote the document for the &#39;Core Product Packaging for App Explore&#39;  it says &quot;Can be subject to advertisement inserts&quot;</p>
<p>Their &#39;Core product Packaging for Commercial App Packages&#39; stipulate &quot;No Advertisements&quot; - this package interestingly enough also says &quot;Full ownership of the Application&quot; which would suggest the previous package would not give you full ownership of you own package.</p>
<p>Is this the direction Appcelerator is taking us?</p>
