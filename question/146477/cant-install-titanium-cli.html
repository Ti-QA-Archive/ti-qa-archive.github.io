			<h1>Can&#39;t Install Titanium CLI???</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi Folks.</p>
<p>Today I decided to upgrade to the latest version of Titanium (3.0.1) and the latest version of XCode (4.5.2)<br>On my mac running OSX 10.8.2</p>
<p>My only problem is that in Titanium there is a pop-up that prompts me to download &#39;Titanium CLI 3.0.22&#39;.<br>When I click &#39;Install&#39; it goes through the motions and then I get an error message: &#39;Installing Titanium Updates…&#39; has encountered a problem. When I click on the details box it tells me: Failed to install titanium.</p>
<p>So I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling Titanium a couple of times now but the exact same stuff keeps happening to me. Because of this error I am unable to run the iPad Simulator (I am primarily working on an iPad app).</p>
<p>Does anyone know what is going on here or how to fix it?</p>

							<p>Hi Jay, As Chris suggested to remove&#x2F;change the titanium from you bash profile to something other than titanium… one more thing to do is… check the node JS version which is installed and if it is not latest one.. then download the latest one from nodejs.org… and upgrade it.</p>
<p>i faced issue related to this when updated to titanium 3.0.</p>

							<p>Can you verify that the CLI is installed by running <code>titanium -v</code> at the command line? It should output &quot;3.0.22&quot;. If that works, then run <code>titanium sdk</code> and verify that the correct SDK version is marked as &quot;active&quot;. Lastly, makes sure the &lt;sdk-version&gt; in the tiapp.xml is set to the correct version.</p>

										<p><p>OK, you have &quot;titanium&quot; aliased to the old Python-based scripts. You need to edit your .bash_profile in your home folder and remove the &quot;titanium&quot; alias, then restart your terminal and try <code>titanium -v</code> again.</p>
