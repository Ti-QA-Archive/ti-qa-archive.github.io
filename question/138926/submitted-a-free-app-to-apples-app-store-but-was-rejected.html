			<h1>Submitted a free app to apple&#39;s app store but was rejected</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>We submitted one app to Apple Store but was rejected due to the reason that Apple said the application against their review guideline &quot;11.13 Apps that link to external mechanisms for purchases or subscriptions to be used in the app, such as a “buy&quot; button that goes to a web site to purchase a digital book…..&quot;</p>
<p>We are a POS service provider and want to provide users with free Apple app for download to their iPad and iPhone. And users have to sign up for accounts at our website before they can user the Cloud POS service, and we will charge users for cloud service fees.<br>I saw some company already used this business model that their users can free download app from Apple store free and they charge users for other services. How can we actually accomplish this?</p>

							<p>As far as I understand from the Apple&#39;s policy is that you <strong>can</strong> offer subscriptions outside Appstore as long as you don&#39;t provide any link, or button in your app that does this.<br>In other words instruct the users to go to your site for the &quot;pro&quot; options without giving them any link or &quot;buy&quot; button.</p>

							<p>11.13 is a stupid, overused rule.  Apple rejected one of my paid apps with the same rule #, only because I provided a popup window that showed my website address for obtaining free richer content…I wasn&#39;t selling anything, and it wasn&#39;t even a link…just text.</p>
