							<div><p>I face this problem too with SDK 3.1.3. I did a manual xcodebuild again using the terminal and was able to run the app on the iOS simulator. However there is still a problem with imageview. Downgrading to SDK 3.1.1 has totally resolved the above problem. I guess maybe SDK 3.1.3 is meant for only Xcode5 and iOS7.</p>

							<div><p>Yes for SDK 3.1.3 you need to have Xcode 5 that include iOS 7 and OSX &gt;= 10.8.5 ,but you can develop in iOS 6 as well. I am doing it right now without any problem.</p>
