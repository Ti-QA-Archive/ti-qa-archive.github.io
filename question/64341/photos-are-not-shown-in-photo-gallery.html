			<h1>Photos are not shown in photo gallery</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>  I recently upgraded my SDK to vsn 4.0, and now there are no photos in the simulator to work with while developing my apps.<br>I got this message on the simulator screen when trying to access the Photo gallery;<br>&quot;You can synch photos and videos onto your iPhone simulator using iTunes&quot;<br>Of course I don&#39;t see any way to go about this in iTunes.<br>Anyone have any ideas on how to accomplish this?</p>
<p>I drag the picture over to the simulator, then it opens in Safari, and choose save but nothing was happened.</p>

							<p>The way I always get images in the simulator is to open safari from within the simulator and go to some webpage then hold down on the image and select save.</p>
<p>If you upload particular images to your own website you can get specific images if you desire, otherwise just browse to any image on the web.</p>

										<p><p>You mentioned dragging the photo into safari, did you try going to a web page and using an image from the web?<br>You mentioned that Kitchen Sink isn&#39;t displaying the photos, but the real question is are they on the simulator at all?<br>Check the photos application from within the simulator, if there is nothing there likely an iPhone SDK&#x2F;Simulator issue…..if the photos exist there it&#39;s a Titanium issue.</p>
