			<h1>Unable to get JSS to work consistently</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello everyone - I&#39;ve looked around and haven&#39;t found an item on JSS that&#39;s helped so starting a new thread.</p>
<p>I am trying to test out JSS to see if its feasible to use within my application - for the life of me i can not get any type of consistent results that would make it useable.</p>
<p>Now my first caveat here is that admittedly, I haven&#39;t used JSS in the past, but I am extremely familiar with CSS and the paradigm.</p>
<p><strong>Background Info</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>iPhone SDK 4.2</li>
<li>Titanium 1.5.1</li>
<li>New Project created through Titanium Developer</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Scope</strong></p>
<p>Below is just a very basic example of what I am trying to and I can&#39;t get it working.</p>
<p>I have created a global.jss file which i am placing in the Resources Directory alongside app.jss. It is only creating one window style as shown:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// global.jss</span>

<span class="hljs-id">#win</span> {
  <span class="hljs-attribute">background-color</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"red"</span>;
}
</code></pre><p>Within the app.jss file, I have the following code to create a simple window with a button:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">//app.js</span>

var win1 = Titanium.UI.createWindow({  
    id:<span class="hljs-string">'win'</span>,
    title:<span class="hljs-string">'Window1'</span>
});

var button1 = Titanium.UI.createButton({
    title:<span class="hljs-string">'I am a Button'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-variable">width</span>:<span class="hljs-number">150</span>,
    <span class="hljs-variable">height</span>: <span class="hljs-number">25</span>
});

win1.<span class="hljs-built_in">add</span>(button1);
win1.<span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>();
</code></pre><p><strong>Observations</strong></p>
<p>First - i was able to get this to work one time, when I actually had the background color set to #000. Since then, the background has remained #000 no matter what the current assigned value.</p>
<p>Second - I have noticed that even when navigating to the simulator application directory and deleting the stylesheet.plist file from my .app package, it is getting replaced, but the data doesn&#39;t seem to ever change (even if I change it and recompile from scratch)</p>
<p>Third - Manually updating the stylesheet.plist file of course doesn&#39;t work, because it is getting recopied.</p>
<p>Fourth - I haven&#39;t tried pushing this to the device yet.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Has anyone else seen this behavior? Am I doing something completely wrong? Is there a fix I am unaware of?</p>
<p>Right now JSS just doesn&#39;t seem to be a valid use case for the iPhone unless the mistake is on my side.</p>
<p>I welcome any and all feedback, even if its to tell me I am way wrong. Thanks in advance!</p>

							<p>First of all global.jss doesnt work on the iPhone, so dont try using it on the iPhone. To use JSS on the iPhone you will have to have the exact same of the JSS file as the JS file you are working on.<br>For example: if you want to handle design for window.js you will have to have window.jss in the same place as the JS file.</p>
<p>Second. The id proprierty is not working so you have to use classes.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>&#x2F;&#x2F;window.js</p>
<p>var win1 = Titanium.UI.createWindow({<br>    className: &#39;win1&#39;,<br>    title:&#39;Window1&#39;<br>});</p>
<p>var button1 = Titanium.UI.createButton({<br>    title:&#39;I am a Button&#39;,<br>    width:150,<br>    height: 25<br>});</p>
<p>win1.add(button1);<br>win1.open();</p>
<hr>
<p>&#x2F;&#x2F;window.jss</p>
<p>.win1{<br>background-color:#000000; &#x2F;<em>or use background instead of background-color</em>&#x2F;<br>}</p>
<hr>
<p>This should do the trick.</p>

							<p>I haven&#39;t used the JSS stuff yet. One thing to note is that the style rules use appcelerator object properties not CSS type properties. So, the background color is backgroundColor not background-color. During their recent webinar, they said that JSS is basically a way to expose the properties of the UI elements rather than an implementation of the CSS spec.</p>
<p>You might also want to check out the tweetanium app they just released. It uses an included styles.js file as an alternative to JSS. For various reasons, I might use that app model instead.</p>

							<p>In my experience, JSS will sometimes work and sometimes not, and it is very hard to figure out what the cause is or how to fix it when jss is not applied.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Not all files are imported<br>My app uses @import statements to import different jss files. Some of these files seem not to be used at all by Titanium, although I can see them being imported when I debug with iOS simulator.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Location within a jss file matters<br>Some classes were not applied when I had them near the top of the jss file, but they worked fine once I moved them near the bottom, or vice versa.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The order of defining and adding elements matters<br>Sometimes it helps to create a view and add it immediately to its parent before creating and adding other children of that parent, sometimes it helps to create all children first, then add them all to the parent.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sometimes it&#39;s about the jss properties<br>In specific cases, setting a top, left, right, or bottom property seems to be necessary for the other class properties to be applied.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>My suspicion is that many problems are caused during parsing of the classes and are caused things like commented lines, unquoted or quoted values, and other stuff that <em>should</em> work fine.</p>
