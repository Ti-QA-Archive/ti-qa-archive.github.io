		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a proposal&#x2F;question for you.</p>
<p>I am a first year college student computer science major, and i have no java script experience. i have taken a C++ course but by no means am a master coder.<br>I am taking a digital media course and i proposed to the instructor that i make an android app for his class that simply has a UI with buttons that links to class videos hosted on youtube.</p>
<p>MY question is if I buy a java script book and read is it possible to make this simple app withen the two months of class we have?<br>i cannot pay for any pro user support but i am very willing to try this experiment. But before i bite off more than i can chew and promise something to this instructor only to fail and thus fail the class. I wanted to ask people in the know.</p>
<p>I worked on a summer internship that used Titanium to create an app for their chemistry department. I helped with the mock wire-frame and some other non code elements and this is how I got interested in titanium. </p>
<p>Am i right in my thinking that simply linking to videos would be a relatively simple app or am I sounding like a complete idiot student with no background in coding even using a keyboard?</p>
<p>any feedback is welcome<br>Thanks<br>-Luke </p>

							<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve learned JS on the fly.</p>
<p>My first language was the PHP, but as a amateur webdeveloper, I&#39;ve seen that I need JS, so I started with jQuery.</p>
<p>Javascript, jQuery and PHP are very close each other, and C++ is the same.</p>
<p>I never buyed any book , never read any tutorial. I&#39;ve learned from reading code and trying to do changes.</p>
<p>With Titanium, it&#39;s a new challenge, but, with Kitchen Sink, you can have every part of code you need. Copy &amp; Paste every time, try until you succes!</p>
<p>That&#39;s the hard way, but the best for learning and personnal satisfaction!</p>

							<p>I know PHP, HTML, CSS, Ruby, C++, a bit of C#, Lua, and Java. I am 17, in my senior year, and I have <em>never</em> taken or attended a computer&#x2F;programming class in the last 4 years. I have never bought any books, any resources, and have never spent over $10 on my programming, but have cashed in hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars.</p>
<p>You don&#39;t need books. I learnt Java (And every other language I said above) the same way Ivan did below. I looked at code (For Java, jQuery and Titanium KitchenSink) and made changes&#x2F;added things.</p>

							<p>Luke, don&#39;t buy a JAVA book, but a JAVASCRIPT one. But don&#39;t buy a book at all.<br>The internet it&#39;s the best book you could have, like Ivan said.</p>
