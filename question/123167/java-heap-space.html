							<p>First, update your heap space limits:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;tis&#x2F;Setting+Memory+Levels</p>
<p>To isolate if it&#39;s a particular project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Close all projects (right-click &gt; close) </li>
<li>Open them one by one, watching the memory level setting to see if one in particular makes the memory jump.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want a very expedient way of doing that, or you still can&#39;t open Studio after upping the memory levels:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find your workspace folder and move all projects out. That will close them all.</li>
<li>Now move them back in and &quot;reopen&quot; them in Studio.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have a large tiapp.xml file in one project (&gt; 1MB), then open it up in a text editor and see if there is gibberish content inside. If so, delete that, but please file a ticket to let us know that happened, especially if you can figure out when it happened.</p>

							<p>Can you please try the following?</p>
<p>1) Show the Studio memory manager (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;tis&#x2F;Setting+Memory+Levels). You can also try upping your memory limits for now to allow you to at least open Studio appropriately.</p>
<p>2) Close all your projects (right-click on a particular project) and restart. Now, try opening them one-by-one to see if there is a particular project that causes the memory to jump a lot.</p>
<p>3) Is there anything interesting in your log file? (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;tis&#x2F;Accessing+the+Log+File)</p>

										<p><p>Okay. Is there a way you can attach the tiapp.xml (compressed) to a support ticket? In the meantime, if you can open it and edit it, you should be able to strip out the offending content (you&#39;lll probably need to use notepad or text edit or something that can read huge files)</p>

										<p><p>Okay, so there is definitely gibberish in there. You can strip out the description, and that should fix the issue. I&#39;m more curious how it happened. Is there a way you can track back to when it might have occurred?</p>

										<p><p>I did a couple of things that may have been the cause.  One, I installed eclipse&#39;s svn plugin and two, I changed the default workspace path.<br>None of those sound like probable cause to such an error, do they? Other than those, it was coding and testing as usual. And of course, migrating from snow leopard to lion.</p>

										<p><p>No–that sounds fine. We&#39;re adding some checks into our code to make sure that we somehow don&#39;t cause the issue. But if you notice it happen again with a different file, please let us know ASAP.</p>

										<p><p>I ended up doing something similar.  I created a fresh new mobile project and then I copied my original resources folder (everything but the tiapp.xml file) to the newly created. Although since I didn&#39;t locate the problem&#39;s root, it may happen again. Let&#39;s see how long it holds.</p>
