			<h1>Titanium Mobile feature requests for iOS 5</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am putting together a top 10 wish list of the iOS 5 functionality that I would like to see shine through in an upcoming release of Titanium Mobile.</p>
<p>While there are a lot of cool new features in iOS 5, this list is more about some of the features that I feel would be most beneficial to a larger majority of developers (and their users). </p>
<p>The following items are taken from <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;prerelease&#x2F;ios&#x2F;#releasenotes&#x2F;General&#x2F;WhatsNewIniPhoneOS&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;iOS5.html">this page</a> on Apple&#39;s Developer site</p>
<p>1) Twitter Framework<br>The Twitter framework (Twitter.framework) provides support for sending Twitter requests on behalf of the user and for composing and sending tweets. </p>
<p>2) Accounts Framework<br>The Accounts framework (Accounts.framework) provides a single sign-on model for certain user accounts. Single sign-on improves the user experience, because applications no longer need to prompt a user separately for login information related to an account.</p>
<p>3) Custom Appearance for UIKit Controls<br>You can now customize the appearance of many UIKit views and controls to give your application a unique look and feel. For example, you might use these customizations to make the standard system controls match the branding for the rest of your application. You can set the tint color, background image, and title position properties (among other) on a wide variety of objects, including toolbars, navigation bars, search bars, buttons, sliders, and some other controls.</p>
<p>4) Core Image Framework<br>The Core Image framework (CoreImage.framework) provides a powerful set of built-in filters for manipulating video and still images. You can use the built-in filters for everything from simple operations (like touching up and correcting photos) to more advanced operations (like face and feature detection).</p>
<p>5) Map Kit<br>The Map Kit framework supports the ability to use heading data to rotate a map based on the user’s current orientation. As you can with the Maps application, you can configure your map view to scroll the map according to the user’s current location. For example, a walking tour application might use this to show the user their current location on the tour.</p>
<p>6) Core Location<br>The Core Location framework (CoreLocation.framework) now includes support for both forward and reverse geocoding location data. This support allows you to convert back and forth between a set of map coordinates and information about the street, city, country (and so on) at that coordinate.</p>
<p>7) The UITableView class adds support for automatic row animations, moving rows and sections, multiselection, and copy and paste behaviors for cells.</p>
<p>8) The UIScrollView class now exposes its gesture recognizers so that you can configure them more precisely for your application.</p>
<p>9) Core Graphics<br>The Core Graphics framework (CoreGraphics.framework) includes some new interfaces to support the creation of paths. Specifically, there are new interfaces for creating paths with an ellipse or rectangle and for adding arcs to existing paths.</p>
<p>10) The UIImage class includes support for Core Image, support for stretching an image by tiling part of its content, and support for looping animations.</p>

							<p>Anyone with access to Apple beta software, including iOS5 and the pre-release version of Xcode, has agreed via Apple&#39;s NDA not to discuss it in a public space. As this includes us, we will be obliged to close and lock any threads on the subject. Thus, kindly raise any issues, comments or feedback about Apple beta software in the Official Forum instead. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
