			<h1>I can&#39;t run my project in the simulator anymore</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve been successfully running my iPad app in the Titanium simulator for some time now. Last night I shut down my Mac. This morning when I started everything up again, there is no &quot;Run&#x2F;Debug&quot; icon, and I can&#39;t find ANY way at all to simply launch my project in the iOS simulator. My project is there, code is all there, everything is good.</p>
<p>Side note: I configured a keyboard shortcut for Run (a week ago), and that shortcut no longer works. It&#39;s as though running my app has become disabled for some reason. Please help.</p>

							<div><p>I just found that if I right-click my project, I can do Run As, and run it in the simulator. Whew. But I STILL can&#39;t get the Run icon to display in my Titanium toolbar. How do I get that back? And why would it go away in the 1st place?</p>

							<p>Try this shortcut: <strong>Shift + Command + F11</strong>.<br>If it&#39;s still not working, I&#39;d suggest you to re-install the Studio.</p>

							<p>Fixed it! The Run button disappeared because somehow the &quot;Launch&quot; Command Group got deselected and was thus unavailable. I certainly didn&#39;t do this, but somehow it happened on its own, maybe as a side effect of something else I did. I fixed it by right-clicking on the toolbar and choosing &quot;Customize Perspective&quot;. There was a &quot;Launch&quot; section that was deselected.</p>
