		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;m using live streaming and need some advice. </p>
<p>At times, I&#39;m not responsible, nor can I control the bit rate of a video stream. It may well be over 64kbps. </p>
<p>In order that my app doesn&#39;t get rejected, I will make sure that before the videoPlayer is called, there is a network check to ensure that the Network is WIFI and not CELLULAR. </p>
<p>My question is this: </p>
<p>Do i have to also modify my info.plist to state that it will only use WIFI? (i.e. is this change to the info.plist an obligation) </p>
<p>What do you all suggest?<br>How do I add that? What is the exact parameter I need to include? </p>
<p>Does this additional parameter (WIFI usage) in the info.plist result in the app only using WiFi? Maybe that&#39;s a dumb question, but what I&#39;m trying to ask is what are the consequences of this info.plist parameter change? i.e. what else exactly am I signing up to by including this in the info.plist? What if I don&#39;t want to use WiFi?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>EB, let me first say that you have come a long way as a developer in the short time you have been here.  This is a very good question and comes about because section 9 has been a moving target for developers the last few years.  Throw in that the developer in charge of HLS comes across as anti-social and defensive hasn&#39;t helped. </p>
<p><strong>9. Media content</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.1</strong> Apps that do not use the MediaPlayer framework to access media in the Music Library will be rejected</p>
<p><strong>9.2</strong> App user interfaces that mimic any iPod interface will be rejected</p>
<p><strong>9.3</strong> Audio streaming content over a cellular network may not use more than 5MB over 5 minutes</p>
<p><strong>9.4</strong> Video streaming content over a cellular network longer than 10 minutes must use HTTP Live Streaming and include a baseline 64 kbps audio-only HTTP Live stream</p>
<p><em>(From the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;appstore&#x2F;resources&#x2F;approval&#x2F;guidelines.html">App Store Review Guidelines</a>)</em></p>
<p>A decent HLS video feed should have multiple bit rates available.  If it isn&#39;t your feed, you can grab the initial feed url and open it with a text editor <em>(<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;resources&#x2F;http-streaming&#x2F;examples&#x2F;">sample feeds</a>)</em>.  </p>
<p>To meet the guidelines, if the feed has a 64bit audio only stream associated with it, then you don&#39;t have to worry about the bit rate of the video stream. Now, that meets the &#39;letter of the law&#39; so to speak.  But the user&#39;s experience may end up being subpar if they are out in the back country and only getting the audio stream from your video feed and that goes to the &#39;spirit of the law&#39;.  Apple&#39;s intent in 9.4 is to offer a great user experience.  If the audio stream remains good, our brains allow for some video issues (think Blair Witch Project).  </p>
<p>As the developer, you need to weigh technical ability against user experience.</p>
<p>That being said, you shouldn&#39;t have to change anything in your info.plist.  You don&#39;t want your app to be wifi only.  You just want to limit certain functionality based upon network type.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.0&#x2F;index.html#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Network-method-getNetworkType">Titanium.Network.getNetworkType()</a> will let you check the network before starting the stream.  Because the network connectivity can change, this needs to be checked very close to the player launch, not at app bootstrap.</p>
<p>Regarding submissions, </p>
<ul>
<li>app rejection isn&#39;t the end of the world</li>
<li>rejection often doesn&#39;t reflect on you but on the particular reviewer</li>
<li>rejections because of technical problems can be beneficial to you in that you can have a problem resolved before the end users experience it</li>
<li>the instructions for reviewers isn&#39;t used often enough (in your case, politely explain that you have taken 9.4 into consideration and that you have taken whatever you action you have decided to meet the requirements. this shows you are a thoughtful developer with the end user&#39;s best interest in mind, etc)</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>Indeed Stephen.<br>Yes, my app was rejected because of clause 9. </p>
<p>I quickly added some condition in the app to ensure that if its a CELLULAR network, to alert the user and to only work on WiFI. </p>
<p>Thanks a million for the answer - its exactly what I needed. I do not need to update my plist. </p>
<p>Whenever my app is being reviewed, it gives me 5 days to prepare for a new release, so that waiting time is never wasted, the new version will have Apple&#39;s correction (if its rejected) and a lot of new value added features.</p>
<p>You tell me that I&#39;ve come a long way in a short time, but really Stephen, its thanks to your help. </p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>
