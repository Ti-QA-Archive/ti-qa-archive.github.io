			<h1>Android Push Notification - Unsubscribe error after sleep mode</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>This is the first time I have ever had to post to a forum but this issue has me stumped. I will provide code if needed but I thought I would post the issue first to see if anyone else has encountered this issue.</p>
<p>Application: Mobile<br>SDK: 2.1.1.GA<br>Platform: Android 2.2</p>
<p>ISSUE:<br>I have implemented Push Notification for the Appcelerator Cloud.  I have followed the Appcelerator documents to get it working.  I am using the ti.cloud and ti.cloudpush libraries.<br>I can send and receive push notifications in my moble app without any issues.<br>I get an error every time I try to unsubscribe after the phone has gone to sleep and wakes back up.<br>I can still receive push notification after the phone wakes back up but I cannot unsubscribe to the same channel.  My app does not close it is still there waiting for notifications after the phone wakes up.</p>
<p>Example that works:<br>I start my app, it connects and subscribes to a channel.  It receives push notifications.<br>I unsubscribe before the phone goes to sleep and it is successful every time.</p>
<p>Example that fails:<br>I start my app, it connects and subscribes to a channel.  It receives push notifications.<br>I wait a few minutes for the phone to sleep, wake it up, and I still receive push notifications.  I unsubscribe and get the following error every time:<br>Error:\nSSL shutdown failed: I&#x2F;O error during system call, Broken pipe</p>
<p>I have been all over Google searching for something that might point me in the right direction but I have not found anything that explains this situation.  Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
