							<p>Hi Kusuma. </p>
<p>these are nice meaningless general questions that you ask here, expecting clear answers. </p>
<p>Imagine you were asked these questions and you should answer them!</p>
<p>Could you give those answers? </p>
<p>It&#39;s as if you were writing a letter and sending it to your car repair shop. </p>
<p><em>My car is too slow and rattles, please fix it without seeing the car or knowing the manufacturer or type.</em> </p>
<p>Even in the previous questions you were posting, you were asked to give more information so that someone can help you effectively. </p>
<p>So think again about how you ask your questions to get satisfied and the informations needed to achieve this. </p>
<p>For your current problem, for example, the following information would be helpful: </p>
<ul>
<li>Which mobile OS Versions and Devices you are testing with?</li>
<li>Is it a classic or Alloy App?</li>
<li>What does your app and how is it designed?</li>
<li>What exactly is the problem? The performance, the native look, or both? </li>
<li>What features are too slow, or what&#39;s the problem with the look? </li>
<li>What have you done to identify or fix the problems?</li>
<li>Show us the code or layout of these problematic points!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have questions about several topics, consider to ask several questions. </p>
<p>Have a nice day. </p>
<p>Greetings, </p>
<p>Matthias</p>
