			<h1>Has anyone got a stable workflow building on android?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve been using Titanium for quite a while now, intermittently. I recently started using it again on 1.8 hoping that it had evolved and matured since last time. Building for iPhone is working ok, but for Android it&#39;s like a russian roulette. I never know if it&#39;s going to work.<br>You click on play, and you&#39;ll get an unrelated error message, and while you wait for your app to appear on the android emulator… nothing happens.<br>So you click on play again, and then it works. </p>
<p>Here&#39;s a bunch of error messages that I still get occasionally:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>java.net.SocketException: Address family not supported by protocol</p>
</li>
<li><p>Timed out waiting for emulator to be ready, you may need to close the emulator and try again</p>
</li>
<li><p>adb devices returned 0 devices&#x2F;emulators</p>
</li>
<li><p>Error generating R.java from manifest</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to know if anyone has this working in a stable manner.<br>Is there anything I can do to have it stable, or is it just buggy and do I have to accept it?<br>I am getting really frustrated with developing for android with Titanium.</p>
<p>My platform: Mac OSX Lion.<br>Everything up to date.</p>

							<div><p>I think some of these issues are with Android emulator, and not necessarily Titanium.  Adb and emulator timeout gives me problems in native android dev, as well.  Like Trevor, I try to use a device when possible.</p>

							<div><p>I spent several weeks trying to upgrade to 1.8 and am now back on 1.7.5. The issues you&#39;re describing were introduced sometime after the release of 1.7.5 GA, because I don&#39;t have them now that I&#39;ve reverted. I find anything after that release to be completely unusable (i.e. too unpredictable&#x2F;buggy) for Android development.</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;ll second with Trevor, the emulator is a pile of, well, can&#39;t say it in polite conversation.  With russian roulette, I only have 1 in 6 chance of something going badly.  With the emulator, its a 5&#x2F;6!</p>
<p>I will say, that I have more trouble with 2.2 launching than with 2.1 ever did.  The forced change from 2.1 to 2.2 brought this to the surface.  So, I target 2.3.3 and that seems to go ok.</p>
<p>The droidX spends most of its day tethered to the system (osx lion) for testing.  Much faster, much more reliable.</p>

							<p>From what I gather after crawling through this forum and google.<br>Developing with Titanium and the Android emulator is way too buggy. (feels like a hack)<br>The only &quot;productive&quot; workflow is to use a physical android device to test. </p>
<p>I thought after the funding, that this would have improved a lot but I still find it quite frustrating. I don&#39;t want this to be a rant. So I&#39;ll leave the question open for a few more days to see if anyone has a better idea (I doubt it)</p>
<p>cheers,</p>

							<p>Im new to Titanium, but i successfully developed applications for both sides, iOS and Android. Now im working 4 weeks with Titanium. My experience on the iOS side is very good. But on the Android side its very painful Im using the Android Emulator to test my code. Its really bugy!</p>
<p>At the moment Im thinking of quitting with Titanium and start native Development…</p>
<p>Now i read this post and i will give it a new try by testing on a Android Device.<br>I hope this will work!</p>
<p>My Setup:</p>
<p>MacOSX Lion 10.7.3<br>Android API 2.2<br>Titanium 2.0.1</p>
