			<h1>ListView Template or TableView for XHR results - Alloy</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey all. I was wondering if someone could help me clarify a best plan of action for a rebuild of my app. I am building v2 of my app with Alloy. Really love how organized it forces me to be. </p>
<p>My app searches for items (images, videos, audio etc) from a services API which returns a json result. that I am displaying with thumbnails if available or just mainly text. I at first I was playing around with ListView and their templates but was having issues with the app crashing in the iOS simulator. From what I can tell it had to do with an imageView being nested in a view and the images height set to fill the view. But it may be something. I was sure not to use anything more than labels, views and imageViews in my template. Still running into crashes. </p>
<p>I haven&#39;t pinpointed the issue but i&#39;m wondering if TableViews are the better way to do. ListViews are still pretty new (I&#39;m playing around with the Ti 3.2 beta). If I went with a tableView, is there a similar technique of using templates? I can&#39;t seem to find any docs or examples of that. I only see binding data to a tableview using Backbone. </p>
<p>Would it be counterproductive or inefficient to use a collection and models for search results. Writing the results as a model to the collection (and clearing the collection after each search?). Or should I simply build my table data and add it to the tableview after looping through the results. Thats what I did with v1 of my app but I thought maybe there was a better method now. </p>
<p>Thanks again. Any help is greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Dave</p>
