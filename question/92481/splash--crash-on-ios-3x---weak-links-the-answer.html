			<h1>Splash &amp; Crash on iOS 3x - weak links the answer?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve had my second app accepted for the App Store (thanks Appcelerator) and was happy for about five minutes before my customer - who has a first generation iPod running iOS 3.1.3 - told me it crashes at the splash screen!</p>
<p>It&#39;s been very stable on any iOS4 device I&#39;ve tested on and having read in various places about &#39;weak linking&#39; I am wondering if this is the answer for the crash under iOS 3x.</p>
<p>The crash logs point towards the problem occurring in libSystem.B.dylib, which I cannot actually see being used in my project&#39;s Xcode frameworks though. Maybe it&#39;s included by default.</p>
<p>So the question is - how do I weak link when I can&#39;t see this library?</p>

							<div><p>If you&#39;re comfortable posting the crash logs, we can take a look at them.  If you&#39;d rather they not be public, you can send them to community@appcelerator.com and we can get some of the iOS guys&#39; eyes on them to see if we have ideas.</p>

							<div><p>I got the same error using the nightly 1.6.0 continuous build on a iOS 1.3.2 device. Crash logs complained about libSystem.B.dylib. Has this bug been addressed yet? Do all Titanium apps crash on iOS 1.3.x?</p>
