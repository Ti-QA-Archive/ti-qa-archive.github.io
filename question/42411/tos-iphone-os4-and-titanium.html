			<h1>ToS Iphone os4 and Titanium</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I know this is a recurrent question but I could not wait anymore to ask it, do you have some news on how Titanium is considered by Apple iphone TOS ? Phonegap seems to be accepted for some times now, I know you do not have the right to talk about your discussions with Apple, but the status could be considered as &quot;under review&quot;, &quot;waiting for answer&quot;, &quot;in active discussion&quot;, &quot;confirmation needed&quot;?</p>
<p>Sorry to be pressuring on that precise point, but it&#39;s so important for the whole community…</p>
<p>Keep up guys, we are all behind you</p>
<p>Clem</p>

							<p>We have had many hundreds of applications updated and accepted since the new terms of service went into effect, so if Apple doesn&#39;t approve of Titanium, they have a funny way of showing it!  We use the Xcode tool chain to generate the native binary, use the WebKit JavaScript interpreter, and don&#39;t link to any private APIs, so we are in compliance with the ToS as we read it.  Like those 1000 or so developers who have recently submitted apps to the store, you should be good ;).</p>
<p>Also, re: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.nitobi.com&#x2F;jesse&#x2F;2009&#x2F;11&#x2F;20&#x2F;phonegapp-store-approval&#x2F;">the PhoneGap post</a>, you&#39;ll notice one comment that went unanswered - &quot;But can you tell us more about you hearing word from Apple? Was this in an email? Phone call? Press release? Until then, this post is part of the rumor mill as well.&quot;</p>
<p>My personal belief is that Apple&#39;s &quot;approval&quot; was informal and acquired through a Nitobi contact&#x2F;acquiantance, and that Apple has made no official statement about PhoneGap (as they have not with any other tool, to my knowledge).  Which is all good - PhoneGap apps are technologically (if not functionally) similar to Titanium apps, so it stands to reason that they would be accepted as well.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I thought this had already been answered or rather I understood the answer to be yes it is within the tos.</p>
<p>Certainly appears that way as I have read posts&#x2F;tweets of people saying they had apps approved.</p>
<p>Could be wrong though…</p>

							<p>i have submitted an app at the beginning of july that was approved for iOS4 (even it doesn&#39;t use the iOS4 specific suspend and multitasking events), and also released an update for it this week, that got approved too. also there are many other users, who already have their apps approved for iOS4, so i guess the ToS are no problem for us titanium mobile developers at all</p>

							<p>I also had an app approved, but still …<br>For exemple Phonegap had a proper answer as stated here [http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.informationweek.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;personal_tech&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;showArticle.jhtml?articleID=221901204]. </p>
<p>&gt;In a blog post on Friday, PhoneGap contributor Jesse MacFadyen, a software developer at a Web development firm called Nitobi, said that Apple has completed a technical analysis of PhoneGap and concluded that PhoneGap does not violate the Terms &amp; Conditions of its App Store. </p>
<p>This is the kind of confirmation I would love to hear, even if Titanium apps are being accepted in the appstore.</p>
