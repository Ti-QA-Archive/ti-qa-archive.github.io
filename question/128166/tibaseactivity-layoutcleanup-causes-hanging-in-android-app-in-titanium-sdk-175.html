			<h1>&#34;TiBaseActivity layoutCleanup&#34; causes hanging in Android App in Titanium SDK 1.7.5</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>This is not a question, but since I can&#39;t submit a bug report or support ticket, I thought it might be useful to post it somewhere so others can find it. &quot;A problem shared…&quot; and all that! :-)</p>
<p>I have observed that when moving between Heavyweight windows in Android app (particularly when closing the window that is being switched from), log cat reports that TiBaseActivity fires &#39;layoutCleanup&#39;. In versions of the Titanium SDK prior to 1.7.5 this does not cause any issue, but under 1.7.5 it causes the app to hang up and the UI becomes unresponsive. There is no other information output to log cat, no errors, debug or anything. The only solution is a manual Force Close and restart of the app.</p>
<p>The window switching is being handled by Kevin Whinnery&#39;s excellent Navigation Controller module code as it&#39;s the best way I have found of having a properly working hierarchical navigation system in Android apps under Titanium.</p>
<p>I have reverted to using 1.7.3 for now as it seems stable for supporting this approach.</p>
<p>I would love to submit this as a bug report or ticket for the Titanium team to look into but as an Indie subscriber I can&#39;t as far as I am aware?</p>
<p>K</p>

							<p>Sure you can submit a bug report over in the Titanium Community project over at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org</a>. </p>
<p>Just make sure you search existing tickets first so as to not create a duplicate.</p>
