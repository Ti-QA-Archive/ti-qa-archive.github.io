			<h1>Using ACS as a back end for your app... client web access to data.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I was just reading the new blog post <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2013&#x2F;05&#x2F;using-acs-as-a-back-end-for-your-app.html">here</a> and got me wondering what others are doing. I understand the approach described in the post, but I haven&#39;t had much luck going in that direction, so have switched to creating a pure web interface for my clients.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> I have a couple of apps that currently use ACS as their back end and it&#39;s working great. The issue I have is I really want a good &#39;customer&#39; portal for clients to maintain data stored in ACS.  Most of my clients expect a &#39;web based&#39; portal of some kind. </p>
<p>Though Titanium works great as a mobile platform, if you compile to Mobile Web it only works on WebKit based browsers and doesn&#39;t work well on desktop browsers (even the webkit based ones like Chrome and Safari). It&#39;s a tough sell to tell a client you cannot use anything BUT Chrome or Safari on my &#39;web interface&#39;. Some clients only allow IE (Still!) so they need to be accommodated. </p>
<p><strong>My Approach:</strong> Because of this, I have started developing a PHP&#x2F;jScript based approach that is using jQuery and jqGrid to present information from ACS to a desktop web browser, allowing users to login and update ACS data.</p>
<p>Just wondering what others are doing? What approach you&#39;re taking and why? What tools you&#39;re using?</p>
<p>If someone else has already tamed this beast, it would be nice to know what the approach was.</p>

							<div><p>You&#39;re right, this is a terrible flaw in ACS! My clients need to be able to edit the information that the app presents to the end user. And my clients don&#39;t like, or know how to deal with, scary-looking dysfunctional web forms like what you get when you open the ACS example app in your browser.</p>

							<p>Using Node.ACS, you can write a NodeJS app that runs in the ACS cloud and has full access to your ACS data. It would also have full access to the ACS APIs. Node.ACS supports the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;cloud&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;node_mvc">Express MVC framework</a>. </p>
<p>You might be able to find a CMS built using MVC and replace its model layer with one based on the ACS calls. That would get you a long way towards a finished solution in a fairly quick time.</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to guess that this would be pretty popular in the community. So, you&#39;d probably be able to get help if you open sourced this and put it on GitHub.</p>
