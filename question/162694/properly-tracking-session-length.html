			<h1>Properly tracking session length</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all</p>
<p>I&#39;m wondering how to properly track app sessions.  Here&#39;s what we have done so far:</p>
<ol>
<li>user logs in and logs out–that is pretty simple&#x2F;straightforward, unless there&#39; are thoughts otherwise</li>
</ol>
<p>2.use logs in but does not log out–so they stay logged in, but they are not obviously using the app for 24 hours (as an example).  How is best to track&#x2F;manage this?  We have but a &#39;last click&#39; in and after say 30 minutes if there is no click since the last click, then we consider that session closed.</p>
<p>We&#39;re trying to ensure we can get a sense of the time spent in the app.  Not sure if there are 3rd party solutions (free or fee based) but what we also have is the need where we are tracking the sessions by user on our site and then want to track the app, then merge together.  So I&#39;m a bit hesitant about using a 3rd party, since we may not be able to then access specific user data and&#x2F;or tie it back to the web data</p>
<p>Any thoughts&#x2F;help would be appreciated.</p>

							<p>have you tried using the google analytics or flurry modules? They will track the sessions for you.</p>

										<p><p>HI Aaron</p>
<p>Thanks for your response.  I thought there were some issues with putting GA into the iOS app and that apple can reject it?</p>
<p>I have heard of Flurry, but have not implemented.  Would it have the same issue as above (if it&#39;s true)</p>
