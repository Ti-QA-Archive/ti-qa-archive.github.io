			<p>I have this bit of code, and it works fine when I deploy to the Android emulator. However, when I deploy to the iOS simulator, it throws a parse error on line 10.</p>

            }
        }
    });
</code></pre><p>the txt variables are text fields. This was working on iOS at some point in the past, and somehow it stopped. SDK update maybe? I&#39;ve tried cleaning and re-building. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Your JSON structure is correctly formatted so the problem must be with the data or the <strong>jsonRequest</strong> function you have created.</p>
<p>I would hard code each of the variable assigned to this outer object and try again.</p>
<ul>
<li>Works = The problem is with the <strong>values</strong> you are requesting.</li>
<li>Fails = The problem is with the <strong>jsonRequest</strong> function</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>Thanks for your answer. I tried hard coding strings for the variables and no change. The jsonRequest fails because what is being passed in is a weird string - since the js engine cannot parse it as an object. Could it be the method&#39;s fault even though it is not getting proper input?</p>

										<p><p>The problem might be with the encoding of the string - for example pound signs (GBP currency) cause no end of issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Try simplifying the values, so hard-code but ONLY use a-z or 0-9, so no letters you would not find on a western keyboard; test1, test2, test3 - for example.</li>
<li>Are you able to provide an example of the data those parameters can include?</li>

										<p><p>I made sure that the test values are just alphanumeric, and they always will be (except for an @ in the email). I thought that maybe &quot;name&quot;, &quot;email&quot;, or &quot;group&quot; were reserved keywords under iOS so I changed the names of those variables, but no luck. Maybe iOS doesn&#39;t like nesting objects two levels deep? Should I roll back my SDK to an earlier version? I&#39;m out of ideas since the code is correct.</p>

										<p><p>You said <em>&quot;The jsonRequest fails because what is being passed in is a weird string&quot;</em> - so what is this weird string as you also said no strings have characters so a little confused.</p>
<p>iOS has no problem with multiple depth objects being passed - I do it all the time.</p>
<ul>
<li>I would suggest closing your emulator and simulator and then cleaning the project by menu &gt; Project &gt; Clean &gt; select your project.</li>
<li>I would also give the machine a re-boot - sometimes - it just works.</li>

</code></pre><p>The values in there are correct, despite some of them not being strings, but the parser just refuses to make it an object. I will try restarting.</p>
