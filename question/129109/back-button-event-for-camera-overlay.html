			<h1>Back Button Event for Camera Overlay</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Is there a way to listen for when the user presses the hardware back button in Android when the camera overlay is showing? I know you can listen for the &#39;android:back&#39; event on windows, but I wasn&#39;t sure how to detect such events while the camera overlay is displayed. Thanks.</p>

							<p>Hi David </p>
<p>The camera overlay is actually a view and we cannot directly listen the back event inside the view. The window which opens the view for camera able to listen the back event and from that you can perform other logic. </p>
<p>So from my perspective if the overlay is done using view then we cant handle the back event inside the view.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

										<p><p>I actually have the same issue, you have to put the back handler on the window, and code accordingly. I have this and can easily back out of the camera view.</p>

<p>Yes we can achieve this by handling the back event from the window. Hope @David get the solution.</p>

										<p><p>How exactly do I let the window calling the the camera view handle the back events? When I try to do so, it resulted in requiring an extra back button press and it didn&#39;t seem to launch any events while still in the camera view. Thanks again for the help.</p>

										<p><p>Was this ever figured out?  It looks like the back button just causes the overlay&#x2F;preview to close, with no events being triggered.  I would think at a minimum this would cause the cancel event to be called back</p>
