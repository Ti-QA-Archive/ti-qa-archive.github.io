			<h1>Facebook module 3.8.01 - the missing link</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Wanting to use the latest version of the Titanium.Facebook module - 3.8.01, I downloaded it from GitHub, installed it and attempted to build my project. However it appears to be missing a link to the FacebookSDK framework as highlighted by the error message:</p>
<p>ld: warning: directory not found for option &#39;-F&#x2F;Users&#x2F;Marek&#x2F;forks&#x2F;titanium_modules&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;ios&#39;<br>[TRACE] :  ld: framework not found FacebookSDK</p>
<p>In the main folder for the module (with the Xcode project files) there is a folder called &#39;FacebookSDK.framework&#39; containing an alias to &#39;FacebookSDK&#39;. This points to a further folder called &#39;Versions&#39; and digging into that I indeed find a Unix Executable called &#39;FacebookSDK&#39;. Is this what it can&#39;t find?</p>
<p>Now, I thought the idea of modules is they are self-contained with no outside dependencies, so this was a bit disconcerting. I have expanded &#39;facebook-iphone-3.8.01.zip&#39; and placed it where my other modules are located. The project sees it in the tiapp.xml Overview so it&#39;s correctly entered there.</p>
<p>In desperation I tried mad things like adding the &#39;FacebookSDK&#39; to the module folder, just in case it may see it - but no joy.</p>
<p>Has anybody any clues to why it&#39;s trying to find &#39;FacebookSDK&#39;, and seemingly on somebody else&#39;s computer, as I am not &#39;Marek&#39; - and never have been!</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Mac OS 10.8.5 Titanium SDK version 3.2.0.GA CLI version 3.2.0</p>

							<div><p>Well, if it isn&#39;t the way of all things. Just after posting the above I thought I&#39;d try editing the module.xcconfig file in with the Xcode stuff (not the one in the expanded zip). This has a line &#39;OTHER_LDFLAGS=$(inherited) -F&quot;&#x2F;My&#x2F;path&#x2F;to&#x2F;titanium_modules&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;ios&quot; -framework FacebookSDK&#39;</p>
<p>But the version that expends with the module points specifically to &#39;F&#x2F;Users&#x2F;Marek&#39; etc….&#39; (see above). So I changed the path to point at where I have located the full unexpanded version of the module - more out of desperation than thinking it would actually work - and it now builds without errors!</p>
<p>So I&#39;ve answered my own question, but I&#39;d love to know why it didn&#39;t work from the expanded zip as I&#39;d normally expect a module would.</p>

							<div><p>And to be fair to the module author he does actual say in the build notes back at GitHub &#39;In module.xcconfig modify the -F option to the path on your machine&#39; - but when I first skated through the notes that line didn&#39;t mean anything to me. It now does! You live and you learn - every day!</p>
