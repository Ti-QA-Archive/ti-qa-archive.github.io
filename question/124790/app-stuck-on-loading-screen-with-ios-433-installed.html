			<h1>App stuck on Loading screen with iOS 4.3.3 installed</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I can&#39;t seem to figure out what is causing this. I don&#39;t seem to have any errors:</p>
<p>My app starts up and works fine on my 3GS with 5.0b5 installed, but on my iPad1 and my wifes iPhone4 running 4.3.3 it gets stuck on the apps loading screen. </p>
<p>I tried building with 1.7.2 and the latest continuous build 1.7.3 but have the same result. The app was built with iOS SDK 4.3. </p>
<p>Does anyone know what would cause this? ANY tips are appreciated.</p>

							<p>Does it crash on 4.3.3 running in the simulator? What about the iPad simulator? If so, then try the debugger to see which line causes them to fail.</p>

										<p><p>Hey. Thanks for the reply. Iactually built and tested with the simulator running 4.3 and it worked on the iPad and iPhone versions. That&#39;s what&#39;s so strange. No errors at all. I even used JSLint to clean up some code issues. Very weird.</p>

										<p><p>That is indeed odd. A brute force approach would be to hack off sections of the code and try to triangulate the problem that way. Not very efficient, especially for testing on a device. Hopefully someone else has a better idea what would cause this though.</p>
<p>I think I&#39;ve had a similar issue where I finally pinpointed it to a very long reg ex pattern that apparently wasn&#39;t sitting well with Titanium. Had to substitute it with a much shorter version. </p>
<p>I really wish we had better tools to debug on devices.</p>

										<p><p>Actually whats even weirder is that it works on my brothers 3GS running 4.3.3. So it doesn&#39;t seem to be the iOS version. Its something else. Clearly its my code. I gotta figure out what. Thanks for the suggestion. I&#39;ll start pulling some of the new code out. Yay! :)</p>
