			<p>Hi, I started using Titanium a couple of months ago and all can I say is that working with this framework is a nightmare: everyday some new bad surprise. For example now I am not able to test my programs because alI get is<br>[ERROR] :  Emulator exited with error: 1<br>[ERROR] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 1<br>and, I don&#39;t know why, I can create AVD but I can&#39;t assign it to my configuration.<br>I have more the 15 years in developing (but new about mobile dev) but use Titanium is driving me crazy. I want to develop apps just for Android. I have a very good notebook workstation and I use Win 7 64 Pro 64bit. The person who is interested in this my offer must help me in this:<br>1) reduce drastically time for testing in emulator (e.g. configuring on my pc tishadow and stuff like this. I tried but with no result)<br>2) tell me how I can reduce apk size (it&#39;s absurd that an app with few lines of code is almost 8mb apk file)<br>This person can remotely access my pc via Teamviewer and make everything I need.<br>The price sould be reasonable.<br>My email is lorschi@email.it<br>Thanks.</p>

							<p>1) The Android-emulator is known for being painfully slow. One solution if you really need to use an emulator is using an x86-based one, like Genymotion. This <em>might</em> cause some issues with modules that aren&#39;t built for x86-processors.</p>
<p>I personally prefer to run my apps on a real device. It&#39;s easy, it&#39;s quick and you get a much better idea on how it will perform on real devices. If you don&#39;t have a device yet, get one. You should definitely test on a real device before the app is finished.</p>
<p>2) On Android you won&#39;t get any smaller APKs. The reason for this is that Titanium bundles the V8 JavaScript-runtime that&#39;s used to actually run your code. With 15 years of experience you shouldn&#39;t be surprised that runtimes takes a bit of space.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your answer. About the problem of slowness this is not about the emulator itself (it is fast enought) but about the process from source code to build (ctrl+11 in Titanium Studio). I want to speed up it not the emulator. Bye</p>

							<p>Mario,</p>
<p>A couple of things:</p>
<p>1) if you expect your APK to be smaller, it won&#39;t. If this is a deal breaker for someone to help you, them it&#39;s going to be a problem. Titanium bundles the v8 engine in with the APK. You need it, there is no way around it and it means your APK starts at over 6mb+.<br>2) have you tried this <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stephenfeather.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tishadow-getting-started-part-1&#x2F;">tutorial on setting up tishadow</a>? It might help. </p>
<p>3) did you ever get genymotion installed and configured? You MAY find that is good enough without tishadow. </p>
<p>You can find the genymotion download <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.genymotion.com&#x2F;">here</a></p>
<p>I would start with genymotion, give it a try and see if that helps you enough. If you do need more help, let me know and I&#39;ll see what I can do.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your reply. I can understand that the size of APK cannot be small beacose of the interpreter and I can cohabit with this but the worse thing is about the slowness not of the emulator itself but the phase from Run to the creation of the app into emulator. I tried to use Tishadow but without success also following the guide. Probably it is a problem of my configuration. I&#39;ll try another time with another coputer and let you know. Thanks.</p>
