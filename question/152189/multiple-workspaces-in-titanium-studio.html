			<h1>Multiple Workspaces in Titanium Studio</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Currently I have Titanium Studio configured to use &#x2F;Users&#x2F;myname&#x2F;Documents as the workspace. This means that whenever I create or import a project, it automatically copies that project into the root of the workspace directory. The essence of my question is, how do I create&#x2F;import a project that is in a location other than the root of my workspace and have it not copy it into the root of the workspace?</p>
<p>My situation is that I have a hg repository called &quot;Coach&quot;, which has directories under it named &quot;Web&quot; and &quot;Titanium&quot;. I can only clone the whole repository (Coach), not just the Titanium directory. So within my Workspace I clone Coach, which has the child directory Titanium. I then try to import the Titanium directory into Titanium Studio as an existing project, which then copies the Titanium code into the root of the Workspace. This obviously breaks my source control structure, as I then have the Titanium directory under {workspace}&#x2F;Titanium as well as {workspace}&#x2F;Coach&#x2F;Titanium.</p>
<p>This is an annoying issue, how do I get around it?</p>

										<p><p>@Mauro - Is that the only option I have? I can do that if need be, however I&#39;m working on two Titanium apps day to day, so I&#39;d need to close&#x2F;reopen Titanium Studio and change the workspace multiple times per day…</p>

										<p><p>This ended up not being too bad.. Switching workspace closes&#x2F;reopens Ti Studio, but it&#39;s pretty fast. Thanks! </p>
<p>P.S. It&#39;d be nice to be able to import projects without having to copy them into the workspace, Ti Studio used to have this ability but doesn&#39;t anymore…</p>
