			<h1>Breakpoints are ignored while debugging</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m experiencing a problem similar to to issue logged by other community members, but not yet solved: breakpoints are ignored while debugging. Some users mentioned that it&#39;s working in app.js only, but not in my case: even if I create new project, put breakpoints in several places (app.js and other files) and start debugging: none of breakpoints are fired. I also would like to mention that previously when I was selecting debug - Studio was suggesting me to switch to debug view and everything was working; now it&#39;s not even suggesting me that. Is it Studio configuration issue? I tried re-installing (attempted to install both released and RC versions), but with no positive result (probably some of my &quot;wrong&quot; settings were kept on my PC after de-installation).</p>
<p>At least suggestion how to completely un-install Studio will be helpful, probably I configured something wrong and broke that feature :)</p>
