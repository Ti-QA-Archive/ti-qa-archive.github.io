			<h1>Manually fire a Click on a WebView&#39;s html link.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>I have <em>Scroll View</em> with <em>Web Views</em> in it that link to YouTube videos. To be able to scroll the Scroll View <strong>without</strong> scrolling the Web View, I did this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">webViewVideos.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'touchmoved'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{

    e.preventDefault();
}
</code></pre><p>This issues me the following <em>WARNING</em> when I scroll the <strong>Scroll View</strong>:</p>
<p><code>Result of expression &amp;#39;e.preventDefault&amp;#39; [undefined] is not a function.;</code></p>
<p>And works. As I am no longer able to scroll the <strong>Web View</strong> anymore. The problem is that this also <strong>removes</strong> the <strong>click</strong> event from my Web View and I can&#39;t click the YouTube play button.</p>
<p>I was thinking about placing an invisible view <em>in front</em> of the WebView, to avoid using <code>e.preventDefault()</code> and adding an <code>eventListener</code> to this view to <strong>manually</strong> fire a click to play the YouTube video in the Web View.</p>
<p>I know this is <strong>not</strong> the best option, but I&#39;m short on time and it&#39;s the only thing I could think of right now.</p>
<p>Any ideas how to make this work? Or another workaround to my issue?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<div><p>Typo there, I&#39;m using the eventListener <code>touchmove</code>. I didn&#39;t copy and paste the code, typed it from memory, hence the typo. The post is still valid.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m afraid, that is not a warning, that is JS exception. In Titanum event system you can&#39;t prevent default action. &quot;preventDefault&quot; is DOM only, you can use it in web view, but not outside web view. I think that&#39;s why your &quot;click&quot; event is not working …</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s correct. I failed to realize that&#39;s a JS exception. And about the &quot;preventDefault&quot; issue, do you know of any other way that I could &quot;block&quot; the scroll function of the WebView but still allow it to be clicked in order to start my YouTube Videos?</p>

										<p><p>No. But your idea with overlay view seems OK to me.</p>

										<p><p>The problem is that I can&#39;t do this, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">myOverlayView.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{

    myBackgroundWebView.fireEvent(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, { e });
});
</code></pre><p>Apparently the event is not fired, but if I add an eventListener to &quot;myBackgroundWebView&quot; with an alert in it, the event actually is fired, however there&#39;s no response from the html, only from the Web View object.</p>

										<p><p>No, you need use app-level events to trigger something in web view. So, capture overlay view&#39;s click event and then, using app-level event, trigger something in web view. Also, note that { e } is not valid JS object, you can do this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">myBackgroundWebView.fireEvent(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, e);
</code></pre><p>since &quot;e&quot; is object in your case.</p>
<p>Anyway, you&#39;ll need to track where did overlay window got clicked (see &quot;e.x&quot; and &quot;e.y&quot; properties) and according to that, you&#39;ll need to fire particular event in web view. If you can build same layout in overlay view as it is in web view, you can map particular areas in web view to corresponding areas in overlay view (so, overlay view would consist of more views that constructs layout similar to the one in webview). I don&#39;t know will you understand what I mean. :)</p>
<p>Anyway, it&#39;s a bit of a work, but I can&#39;t think of any other solution. Maybe you should wait for some time, maybe someone will come with better solution.</p>

										<p><p>I get what you mean, but luckily enough, since all my Web View has is an embedded Youtube video, it doesn&#39;t really matter where it was clicked, as long as it&#39;s clicked, to make the video play. </p>
<p>So basically I have a square with the video and in front of it, another square (this one transparent) that will be responsible for getting the touch events and triggering the video action. </p>
<p>However, I haven&#39;t had luck with <em>fireEvent</em> yet (yes, I&#39;m using the correct syntax as you mentioned up there). Will keep trying, but any other ideas will be welcomed. Thanks!</p>
