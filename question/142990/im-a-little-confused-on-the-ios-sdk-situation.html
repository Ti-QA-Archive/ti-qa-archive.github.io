							<p>No, always work backwards. If you want to support iOS6 and iPhone 5, it will require that you have the proper Xcode and SDKs installed. Then you can work backwards compatibility up to a certain extent. Currently, if you are building for iOS 6, then the minimum required SDK is 4.3 I believe.</p>
<p>Build for the latest release, and test on earlier version of hardware&#x2F;software</p>

										<p><p>You&#39;re saying 3G and 4G, but the device has nothing to do with it. Its the version of the OS installed on those devices that you need to support. For instance, you&#39;ll be able to support a 3G device running 4.3, but not 4.1.</p>
<p>Everything has a version, so by &#39;4.2.1&#39; I assume you mean Xcode, in which case the answer is no. Again, the only way to support iOS 6 and the iPhone 5 is with Xcode 4.5 and Titanium SDK 2.1.3RC. Grab the latest Xcode and Titanium SDK and you will have a minimum supported version of iOS 4.3</p>

										<p><p>I guess that&#39;s where I&#39;m confused. I thought the last version of iOS that could be installed on the iPhone 3G was iOS v4.2.1. I thought I read somewhere that XCode 4.3 doesn&#39;t support iOS v4.2.1. So If I installed XCode 4.5 I would no longer be able to install the app on the iPhone 3G with iOS v4.2.1.</p>

										<p><p>Im pretty sure that this is Apple&#39;s way of kicking the weak link off the platform. The ARMv6 architecture is no longer supported in iOS 6. So ARMv6 is not targeted when building for the iOS 6 SDK, or if the min iOS version is set to 4.3 or above. Not allowing the 3G to update to 4.3 is akin to no longer receiving an unemployment after being on the market too long.</p>
<p>On the bright side, you can probably milk the 3GS for a bit longer before it gets the boot as well.</p>

										<p><p>(Sorry this is my first iPhone app) I haven&#39;t seen this anywhere. Can I have 2 versions of the app in the app store? One that supports the 3G and the other that supports iPhone 5?</p>

										<p><p>I suppose you could try giving your app &quot;Name&quot; and then &quot;Name 3G&quot; for the specific use case, but you really need to decide whether or not its even worth it. A quick search for iPhone 3G market share shows that they pretty much stopped reporting&#x2F;recording marketshare for the 3G in Oct of 2011. Meaning, who are you really building it for? </p>
<p>Its your first app, cover the top of the food chain, and if you do well enough, or have enough people request a 3g version, then go ahead and give it a try.</p>
