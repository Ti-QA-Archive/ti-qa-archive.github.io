			<h1>Workaround for streaming to Android that allows background play AND scrubbing?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Does anyone have a solution for streaming audio to Android that will allow background play as well as allow the user to control their current playback time?</p>
<p>On iOS the videoPlayer covers this.<br>On Android, using the videoPlayer with idleTimerDisabled set to true almost addresses background play, though it still shuts off when switching apps or if the user initiates sleep. The audioPlayer solves the allowBackground issue but has no control over currentPlaybackTime.</p>
<p>I know that this question has been asked many times before without resolution so my expectation is low, but is someone at least able to explain why this is an OS specific issue?</p>

							<p>I understand the reason behind not having video play if it is not focused upon but seeing as where it is possible to control the same audio stream with a video player, why no control over audio playback with an audio player? Does it cause problems? Is there a security issue? Patent infringement? Any insight is helpful as I should be able to speak to clients about limitations and possible solutions outside of my current framework or knowledge.</p>
<p>I welcome any feedback.</p>
