			<h1>Create Android apk without V8 engine included?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I read somewhere that Android 2.2+ uses the Javascrip V8 engine, at least for the browser. Does this mean it is possible to create packages that does not include the huge files needed in the apk that is the V8 runtime?</p>
<p>If that is true, how do I create such apk?</p>

							<p>I think you are referring to the V8 engine within the android browser. This is not sharable with Titanium - hence the need to include it within the Titanium distributed apk</p>

										<p><p>I was afraid so. </p>
<p>If I look in the APK I can see there are three versions of the v8 engine included in the lib folder. Is it possible to either a) keep only one of the two armeabi-versions and still have a compatible apk or b) to create separate packages and have Google Play (or other store) to automatically choose the proper package based on the device of the downloading user? (The last option would create 3 apk-files, on for x86m, one for armeabi and one for armeabi-v7a)</p>

										<p><p>I dont think you can specify a different distribution for different devices AND use the same App name in Google Play.  But in theory if you know your target device support (eg v7 arm only) you could remove the others from the apk before re-signing.  There is an example of doing this in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;132976&#x2F;reducing-the-size-of-titanium-based-android-app">this post</a></p>

										<p><p>I did some more investigating and actually found <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;google&#x2F;play&#x2F;publishing&#x2F;multiple-apks.html">Multiple APK Support</a> which have some text about &quot;Supporting multiple CPU architectures&quot;. I have not yet read the details, but it looks very promising.</p>
