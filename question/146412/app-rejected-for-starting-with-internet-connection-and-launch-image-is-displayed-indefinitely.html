							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Some time ago I had similar problem, the only way to find the problem was to build for ad-hoc put that on my device before I could find the actual issue.  I am not sure why that gave me more information but it did.</p>
<p>My problem (in case the one in a million chance it is similar) was an extra trailing comma in an oauth library we did not write.</p>
<p>So we found code like this;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var lbl = Ti.UI.createLabel({
  <span class="hljs-variable">height</span>: <span class="hljs-number">40</span>,
  <span class="hljs-built_in">text</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'hello'</span>,
  <span class="hljs-variable">width</span>: <span class="hljs-number">100</span>,
});
</code></pre><p>Note the trailing comma in this example - that was our problem and a lesson well learned.</p>
<p>Again this was my problem and may have no relationship to yours but - just in case.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks I am going to give it a try. You are right the problem is that I don&#39;t know where to begin to look for the problem.  When I run the code in the simulator does not give me any errors, and works perfectly on the iPhone itself.</p>

										<p><p>Malcom, </p>
<p>I did not have any problems with the app store after creating a new app with 3.0.1 and  copying the contents into it. But the customers had to delete the old app in order to use the new one.</p>

										<p><p>Excellent news. Might be worth marking this question as answered as there may still be some people out there on 3.0.0 so they can find how to solve it.</p>
