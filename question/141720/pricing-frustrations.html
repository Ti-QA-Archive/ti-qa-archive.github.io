			<h1>Pricing frustrations</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Despite my successful and happy use of Titanium development tools, I am writting this post to express my frustration regarding the pricing policy :</p>
<ul>
<li>The &#39;Contact sales&#39; price -&gt; I HATE it so much…. When I create an app, I have a lot of expectations regarding the success but in the end I just don&#39;t know what is going to happens. Discussing with somebody any pricing is useless until an app is really successful and I have an idea about the ressources involved.</li>
<li>Limits in &#39;Appcelerator cloud&#39; services -&gt; Again I have no idea how much ressources my users will be using, are they going to update their facebook once or twice or 3 times a day ? Looking and trying to understand the pricing plans drive me away from producing quickly a beta app to test the audience. Of course their is the free plan, but I won&#39;t get it because if my app is successfull, I just don&#39;t have a clue how to calculate how much it is going to cost me (ie. : Contact sales)</li>
</ul>
<p>I end up developing using my free account simple applications tied up with web services online. For cloud apps… well I am still looking to better solutions regarding the pricing plans :</p>
<ul>
<li>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tiggzi.com&#x2F;pricing -&gt; Simple and straight forward</li>
<li>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appmobi.com&#x2F;?page_id=145 -&gt; I LOVE the no-lose guarantee</li>
<li>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wakanda.org&#x2F;faq -&gt; $35 &#x2F; month, then I just have to find a cloud hosting solution, and there are plenty with great scalable servers which will evolve with the traffic use not the number of time each little feature is used.</li>
<li>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.applicationcraft.com&#x2F;pricing-main</li>
</ul>
<p>I may be wrong but my first concern in app development is to create the app and test the potential success as quick as possible. In a 2nd step I would focus on the statistics to precise my hosting needs. It just feel wrong to focus on the 2nd step first, 9 times on 10 it will just be a waste of time because it is not easy to produce successful apps.</p>
<p>Please, make the pricing schemes simple, devs want to develop. For exemple I would love to see :</p>
<ul>
<li>$50 &#x2F; month - All included (Up to xxGB of disk space use and xxGB bandwidth use)</li>
<li>$50 extra &#x2F; month to add xxGB disk and xxGB bandwidth</li>
</ul>
<p>This way I know how much I spend without any calculation, and I just have to wait for an alert that I go over the limit to evaluate how much I need to add each month. In the other side you make people life easier and let&#39;s be true not that many users will approach the limits since it&#39;s the success of the app which drive the server use. Let&#39;s face it, it&#39;s not that easy to create a really successfull app so pleaaaaase let us focus on the code.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br>Clement Chazarra</p>

							<div><p>So, no question then?</p>
<p>Lets take the reverse…</p>
<p>While in development, why would I want to pay $50 a month to access backend services? Use the free tier? If thats an answer, then devs really want it BOTH ways.</p>
<p>If your app is successful, then you should be making money with which to pay the service fees.</p>
<p>If I read your rant correctly, you would rather pay up front for what you MIGHT use.</p>
<p>I would rather pay after the fact based on what I DID use. Unknowns? Sure, Welcome to big boy business.</p>

							<div><p>Sorry you are right, with a clearer paid scheme I would still use the free account like you say.</p>
<p>But with a clean and simple pricing plan, I would also be confortable with any future scenario wether the app works or not. My problem now is that I just have no idea what the cost might be in the future and since my bank account is not that big, I do not feel confortable in that scenario.</p>
<p>&#39;Welcome to big boy business&#39; &gt; Again you are right, I am a little freelance dev behind my desk trying to get in a big money market, but I thought Appcelerator Titanium was specifically aiming to help web developers to get on mobile app market. If I had a &#39;big boy business&#39; I would not use Titanium but pay to get my native app done.</p>
<p>Still, if Titanium think it&#39;s not possible to make a simpler pricing scheme, I would be happy with a good simulation tool or even some stats of existing successful apps. In the end the free plan might be enough for most cases, and the extra pricing very affordable… I just don&#39;t know</p>

							<div><p>Titanium does not aiming to help web developers. I think you still missing the entire point of the library. Ti&#39;s main purpose is to speed up the process of building entire app in multiple platform and make it easy to maintain. About the pricing if you get more than 250,000 hits then you must be making money on that app so ethically speaking you should pay for using the service.</p>

							<div><p>Sorry but I disagree, have a look to this <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;#hl=fr&amp;output=search&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=site:http%3A%2F%2Fappcelerator.com+%22web+developers%22&amp;oq=site:http%3A%2F%2Fappcelerator.com+%22web+developers%22&amp;gs_l=hp.3...6387.6387.0.9754.1.1.0.0.0.0.259.259.2-1.1.0...0.0...1c.bF0X6K1MCwI&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;fp=ebf177bb236acb8f&amp;biw=1281&amp;bih=582">google search</a>.<br>Titanium is aiming mainly to web developers, else why using javascript and not java or c++ ? Low-level language developers also find Titanium appealing for the reason you outlined but in the end I depend more in Titanium than they do, that&#39;s why I believe to be more there targeted customer.</p>
<p>Anyway in the end Titanium is for me a great tool, but I still feel unconfortable with the blurry pricing plans.</p>
<p>Thanks for your insight, I take good note of your remark about 250,000 hits but don&#39;t think I am being greedy, it&#39;s not the case, I&#39;m just scared of the dark, and want the officials to reassure me.</p>

							<div><p>Lets review, shall we? You have:</p>
<ul>
<li>FREE framework</li>
<li>FREE IDE</li>
<li>FREE support</li>
<li>FREE Cloud Services</li>
</ul>
<p>But you want more.  What assurance do you want?  The appmobi &#39;no-loss guarantee&#39; has a limit, is full of weezle words and means nothing.  The others you mentioned aren&#39;t really in the same arena of competition as Titanium.</p>
<p>In wakeboard comps we had a saying, <strong>Go Big or Go Home</strong>.</p>
<p>If your app&#39;s business model doesn&#39;t account for how you are going to pay for the services your app uses, then you have no business model.</p>

							<div><p>All right I surrender. Sorry if I offended some of you, again I am a happy titanium developer my only concern was about understanding the ACS pricing and being able to evaluate the possible future costs.</p>
<p>Looking at the comments (it hurts a little ;)) it seems people here have experienced with the ACS product and state that it&#39;s a good one compared to other solutions… Point well taken ! I will stop to worry about that for now and focus on defining a good business model.</p>
<p>Thanks for the link down which also helped me getting more confortable with the pricing, time for me to get back to work and stop whining</p>

										<p><p>How many extra &quot;packages&quot; can I order? For example if I need more than 1.000.000 tier 1 calls will tht be possible? Will I just get billed $10 for each 1.000.000 level I reach?</p>
