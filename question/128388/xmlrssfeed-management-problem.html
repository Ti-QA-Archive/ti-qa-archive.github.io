			<h1>XML/RSS/FEED management problem</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve been coding an app that downloads a few RSS and display its contents. This is straightforward. </p>
<p>However I would like my app to download the RSS feeds and if the connection is lost the user can still browse the information previously downloaded, without having to try to connect again and get an alert about &quot;no network&quot; </p>
<p>Is there a way to store the feeds temporarily? How would this work? </p>
<p>Thanks for the help!</p>

							<p>Nahum,</p>
<p>Our app pulls in 2 different xml feeds.  One is event data with meta information that includes links to audio and sometimes video resources.  The other feed is simply blog information with the full posting information sent down (not just a summary)</p>
<p>If the xml file doesn&#39;t exist in our cache directory, we grab a new one.  If it does exist, we load the old one.  User has refresh buttons to refresh the feed on demand.</p>
<p>So the app launches with a default dataset, which decreases launch time and quickly presents the user with a full interface, even off network.</p>
<p>The publications.xml can be viewed offline.  All the content is displayed in a web view with local .css injected for formatting.</p>
<p>The events.xml is a bit different.  We have 3 different sized images attached to the list, the event details, and the actual audio player windows.  Those are cached the first time they are referenced and saved for 30 days on the device.  So a user can go through the app without being online until the moment they click to open the audio player or launch a video feed.</p>
<p>Just some thoughts to let you know what we have been able to do, and maybe get you thinking about the process.</p>

										<p><p>To add on the reason we decided to go this route:</p>
<p>Our text xml feed is a 128k.  For most of that, it doesn&#39;t sound like a lot.  But 8 refreshes is a meg of data. Lets say I grab the xml feed on every launch for a month.  4mb of data just to populate my list view.  I&#39;m fortunate to have a grandfathered in account with Verizon.  But a lot of folks are stuck with a 2gb limit.  My 4mb may seem like a drop in the 2gb bucket, but it helps to fill none-the-less. Throw in the overhead of reloading a bunch of little images to make the list view look pretty, and I&#39;m now being wasteful of the end user&#39;s bandwidth.</p>
<p>As mobile developers, running our tests on simulators or on wifi connections, we need to keep in mind our end users.  We need to be considering our responsibility in being wise stewards of their bandwidth when we can.</p>

										<p><p>Stephen, thanks for the reply. It is exactly what I want to do. In my app there will be a couple of feeds that won&#39;t change that much, however it would be nice to have the refresh button. The 30 days on the device is a nice touch!</p>
<p>The other sections will be more like a blog, with a lot of new info everyday. I just think that is nice to have some offline&#x2F;old info in case there is no connection.</p>
<p>I assume you are downloading and storing the xml with Ti.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory, and once it&#39;s refreshed you just overwrite the file. Is that right?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

										<p><p>For image caching, we used a slightly modified version of this code:</p>
<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;978559">Appcelerator Titanium ImageView &#x2F;w cache</a></p>
<p>Our file naming is a little different than his.  We strip out some chars (&#x2F; : ? .. \ = # &amp;) from the remote image&#39;s url then MD5 that resulting string and use that as our base filename.</p>

										<p><p>For the XML, yes, we are using Ti.Filesystem.<br>XHR calls grab the remote file into an object.<br>use getFile to open a file.<br>f.write(doc.responseText);</p>
<p>The read function opens the cached file if it exists, returns the text from that file which is passed to the table population function for parsing. Because the populating function just wants xml to parse, it doesn&#39;t care if its from a remote file or a local file.</p>
<p>Too many of the early Titanium code examples show the table building code inside of the xhr.onload  Better to separate it all out now, much easier to problem solve.</p>

										<p><p>Stephen, sorry to abuse of your knowledge. I have succeeded with my app, I am just trouble with one thing: how to send information to be displayed in a webview. This is my case: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;128958&#x2F;printing-variables-in-webview  Thanks in advance!</p>

							<p>There are several ways to do this. It depends on the way you want to persist the feeds.</p>
<p>If you want your data to be available even after the app has been shut down, you should consider parsing the feed and store the items in a database.</p>
<p>You could also create an array items maps. </p>
<p>A third way would be to temporary save the .xml file in the filesystem (never done this but you could look at <code>Titanium.Buffer</code> and <code>Titanium.Filesystem</code> in the API guide)</p>
