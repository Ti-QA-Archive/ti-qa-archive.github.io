			<h1>Appcelerator Titanium - Alloy vs Classic</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m about to start a new Titanium project. So far, what I&#39;ve written is what&#39;s now considered as &quot;Classic Project&quot; (I&#39;ve been writing Titanium apps since before Alloy).</p>
<p>I was wondering weather or not it&#39;s worth while to switch to Alloy for my new project. I know that basically, Alloy compiles to &quot;Classic&quot; Titanium code before compiling down to the java project or objective-c project. I also know about a big advantage in that &quot;pre-compilation&quot; process, which is to mark in alloy code that are relevant only for Android or iPhone and not including the other in the compiled &quot;Classic&quot; code.</p>
<p>My main concerns are flexibility - as with &quot;Classic&quot; I feel like I have more control over the code and what&#39;s going on.</p>
<p>Second concern, I have controls (like open sourced sliding menu) that are not written for alloy - how will I be able to have them as part of my project?</p>
<p>I started asking myself rather to use Alloy or not after finding (introduced in TiConf 2014) TI UX (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jaraen&#x2F;Ti.UX.Templates) which is written for Alloy.</p>
<p>few other questions:</p>
<p>how can I have old UI code run inside Alloy?<br>Can I have controls written for Alloy run in a &quot;Classic&quot; project?<br>Can &quot;Classic&quot; project also map out code not belonging to iOS&#x2F;Android?<br>is there a difference in performance between Alloy projects and Classic projects? what about other flexibility issues?<br>Thanks</p>

							<div><p>Tim has you sorted but I want to clear up a misunderstanding that persists;  Alloy and &quot;Classic&quot; are not two competing things;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Titanium App without the Alloy Framework (classic is the common phrase but is wrong)</p>
<p>This is Titanium</p>
</li>
<li><p>Titanium App with the Alloy Framework</p>
<p>This is also Titanium</p>
<p>However you gain all the things Tim will have said, plus control over things you never had before.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a small learning curve to get used to the extra abilities of Alloy, plus how to best manage a project that requires structure (my previous projects were in different states of organisation).  The time this take to understand is much less than the time you will save on the project.  THe second project will be even faster.</p>
<p>The only real way to see how much better you and Titanium can be by using Alloy is to actually start using it.  There is no way I would start a new project without the Alloy Framework.</p>

							<div><p>Thanks. Can you please elaborate on the extra things that are not available on the &quot;Classic&quot; project?</p>
<p>It seem a bit strange to me since Alloy is turned into &quot;Classic&quot; before compilation.</p>

							<p>I posted an answer last week, possibly the week before on this same topic. Please do a search to find the reasons I gave.</p>
<p>Maybe a few I didn&#39;t address specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>how can I have old UI code run inside Alloy?</em> You put it in a controller (JS file) </li>
<li><em>Can I have controls written for Alloy run in a &quot;Classic&quot; project?</em> Yes</li>
<li><em>Can &quot;Classic&quot; project also map out code not belonging to iOS&#x2F;Android?</em> Probably not as efficiently as Alloy. Alloy pre-compiles your app, removing all code and assets not used for the target platform. None of the if&#x2F;then branching options in the Classic SDK offer that. So, you&#39;d have to come up with your own techniques.</li>
<li><em>is there a difference in performance between Alloy projects and Classic projects?</em> Yes, Alloy apps are typically faster</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>Thanks. If Alloy compiles to &quot;Classic&quot; code - what is the element that makes them faster? Thanks</p>

										<p><p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>Why is an Alloy project running faster that classic if it compiles to a classic before? I had a look at the code and it seems like it&#39;s loading more libraries on startup (like backbone, and underscore… and it&#39;s doing it on start without lazy loading).</p>
<p>Also, each controller adds code to be executed before showing the window - how come this doesn&#39;t slow things down?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
