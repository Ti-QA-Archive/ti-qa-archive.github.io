			<h1>Violation of Apple Review Guild 11.13</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Thanks for reading my question.</p>
<p>Our company has developed an App and would like to submit to Apple Store for review.</p>
<p>Our app is a restaurant ordering system and must connect to an internal&#x2F;inhouse server.<br>So for Apple review team to review and test the app,  we must provide Apple review team with the static IP address for theirr testing. But will that be  considered as violation of Apple Review Guild 11.13 “Apps<br> that link to external mechanisms for purchases or subscriptions to be used in the<br>app, such as a “buy&quot; button that goes to a web site to purchase a digital book, will be rejected”?</p>
<p>thank you,</p>

							<p>If you offer physical goods (food in your case) you should be able to do this without restriction from Apple - regarding the &quot;buy&quot; button or the payment method (paypal for example). They don&#39;t allow you to offer electronic subscription -  like magazines - outside their system.</p>
<p>At least this is what I know :)</p>

										<p><p>Dan&#39;s answer is spot on and the correct distinction.  An exception to non-physical would be tithes, offerings, donations, gifts…Apple doesn&#39;t seem to want a part of that.</p>

							<p>We have an app that connects to different servers than apple&#39;s. Just give them a dummy server so that they can test your app and it&#39;ll be allright.<br>There are tons of apps that make you use paypal or other external payment methods.</p>
