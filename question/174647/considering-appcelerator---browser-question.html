			<h1>Considering Appcelerator - Browser Question</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I understand that app is developed using HTML5 and JS (among others). The app that would be distributed - does it open in it&#39;s own &quot;browser&quot; or does it use safari or chrome?</p>
<p>If in Safari or Chrome, is there a way to open in full screen mode on iOS 7?</p>
<p>Thanks for help with an obviously NOOB question.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Appcelerator Apps do NOT get created in HTML in anyway shape or form. Unless you are talking about web apps.</p>
<p>Whilst Javascript is used as the development language that does not mean this is related to HTML development.  An app designed for the Apple AppStore or Google Play Store are native apps that use native components to give users of these apps native experiences.</p>
<p>You can choose to include web pages in your app, but they&#39;d are used to show web content NOT building blocks for the app UI.</p>
<p>If you are talking about a web app then that is compiled down into suitable HTML, CSS and JacScript from the original code using Titanium APIs.  These apps are not provided inside a web browser either as that is not how web apps are distributed.</p>
<p>All app created using Appcelerator Titanium can display in full screen mode if you choose on one or all windows, that is an app design choice.  But there is no faking of web pages made to look like a real app - these are real apps.</p>
