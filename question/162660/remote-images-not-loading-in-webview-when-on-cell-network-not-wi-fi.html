			<h1>Remote images not loading in WebView when on cell network (not wi-fi)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m building an app that shows a list of photos in a WebView.  I load a standard HTML &quot;host&quot; document into a WebView, then build up the HTML that contains the IMG tags in Titanium and call a method in my web page to append the HTML to an element in the WebView.  When I do this in the iOS Simulator and on my iPhone connected to wi-fi everything works just fine.  However, when I run it on my iPhone on my cell network (not on wi-fi), some images fail to load in the WebView.  If I load that same image into an ImageView it works fine, so I know that the image URL is valid.  Has anyone experienced this and have a suggestion as to how to fix it?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>These are time-outs - as the device is using cell networks then it is that some image simply fail.</p>
<p>You are putting these images into a web page and then referring to them - so you have the time-outs that are defined for the web page and not that of the device.  You would have to increase the timeout on the server that is delivering the imagery.</p>
<p>When you test the image directly in your app you are allowing the OS to handling the time-out and retry.  The OS is designed to manage with very few resources so it is tuned to manage this process for you.</p>
<p>By using a webView - you are ignoring all the benefits that the OS provides.</p>
<p>As to fixing the problem, do not use a webView.  TableViews and ScrollViews are much better for this.  Keep in mind you are developing a native app and not translating a web site to an app.  If you are using a webView then it should be used to display web pages and not user interface elements.</p>

										<p><p>Unfortunately there&#39;s no native control that provides me the scrolling performance I need.  I&#39;ve tried ScrollView, TableView and ListView and they are all stutter when scrolling.  I resorted to WebView because it had the best scrolling performance.</p>
