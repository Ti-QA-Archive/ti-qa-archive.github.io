			<p>Hi,<br>What is the current version details of Titanium and its parts, and where can i find this out in future.</p>
<p>I have the same issues as this guy;-<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;69511&#x2F;extra-space-remains-after-keyboard-pops-up</p>
<p>But i am on 1.4.2, if i go here;-<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;get_started</p>
<p>And download the dmg file, then even when i have it on my computer and mounted, there is still not version details.</p>
<p>I know there are continuous builds, but I stick with stable versions as there is often more than just me coding a project or running it.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Jez</p>

							<p>I think i have solved this by looking harder and thinking more :-)</p>
<p>If you go here;-<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tag&#x2F;sdk</p>
<p>Then there is bunch of info about the upcoming SDKs and other info. I was looking for something in the package.</p>
<p>As for the issue i was having, my project was set to 1.4.2 but i have SDKs up to 1.5.1 as had got updates when prompted by Titanium. So i just needed to update the project settings to reflect the newer SDKs.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>Titanium Developer is on <strong>1.1.2</strong>. Titanium Developer is the program you write the codes in and export them and all.</p>
<p>Titanium&#39;s Mobile SDKs latest stable release was <strong>1.5.1</strong>, which should be the latest one it asked you to download as you said. This one is the latest one which should give you the least problems. 1.5.1 fully supports iOS 4, as well as Android all the way up to 2.2 I believe (With 2.3 on it&#39;s way).</p>
<p>I would suggest updating all of your SDKs to the latest, as not many people stay on the lower firmwares and developing for the lowers rather than the newer would just be… Inefficient :)</p>
