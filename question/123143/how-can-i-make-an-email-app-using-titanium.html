							<p>the iPhone SDK does not allow for emails or SMS to be sent directly via an app, only via the modal windows… that said you could prob do it if you do it all manualy… but there is no API in titanium, or the native Apple SDKs</p>

										<p><p>He seems fine with the modal window for sending mail.  The real question was how to RECEIVE mail.  That still must be done manually using sockets implementing Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).</p>

							<p>The Titanium Framework does not provide you with the functionality to read mails <em>out-of-the-box</em>. The only way I can imagine this possible is by implementing yourself the Mail protocol in JavaScript using <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;05&#x2F;titanium-mobile-intro-series-sockets.html">Sockets</a></p>
<p>You could also develop a module that reads the emails. (that would probably be easier since the code to read email in Objective-C or Java already exists.)</p>

							<p>You would need to start from scratch. By the sounds of it you are stretching. Perhaps try something less ambitious to start with and make friends with the platform, UI bits and sockets.</p>

							<p>To receive email, an app must talk directly to the SMTP server.  If you are not familiar with SMTP, then I suggest you first start by learning how SMTP works.  Do a web search on something like <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=smtp+commands">SMTP commands</a> to see how exchanges with a mail server work.</p>
<p>Once you understand that, you need to implement those same commands using sockets, as Christian already pointed out.</p>
