			<h1>Maintain selected item in ListView after opening new window?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a window containing a ListView that allows users to select an item, after which a view to the right of the list updates with details of the selected item.  However, if I open a new window to perform some other task unrelated to the list (e.g. a system configuration window), then close that window, the selected item is now deselected.  I&#39;m pretty sure this is due to the fact that Titanium assumes a ListView is used to navigate to a new window in order to display details about a selected record, and that when returning to the list the selected item should no longer be selected (I&#39;m getting this from this bug ticket: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-13499).  The assumption that the new window was opened due to selecting an item in the list is wrong in this case.  I&#39;ve tried working around this issue by listening for the new window&#39;s close event and reselecting the selected item, but it causes an animation that seems out of place.  I also tried handling setting the item&#39;s background color myself when an item is selected, but when the item is deselected as a result of closing a window it just gets set back to white (I even tried putting a View inside the ListItem and setting its background color instead but I get the same behavior).  Any suggestions?</p>

							<p>Just tested that and see what you mean… grr! </p>
<p>It looks like they addressed the iOS guidelines issue by attaching the reset of the selected item to the re-showing of the window regardless of the action that caused a new window . </p>
<p>However if the iOS guidelines really state this (i cant find anything after a casual search) then regardless your App would be rejected as they seem to mean ANY navigation away from the active window should reset it state, so your app would fail as well. </p>
<p>So I would bear this in mind unless you want to have to argue your case with the fickle App approvers</p>

										<p><p>Oh, but if you really must proceed in this way, you could always just use your own scrollview and mock the rows with views and handle the selected state that way… That&#39;s really what a TableView and ListView actually are under the hood</p>

										<p><p>My app has already been approved and is available on the App Store with this behavior.  It was while I was in the process of converting a TableView to a ListView that I uncovered this bug.</p>

										<p><p>Even more suspect that they decided to change the behaviour in that JIRA but only for ListViews, if that&#39;s the case with TableViews. I would re-open that ticket or add a new one referencing this and the original ticket. The fix seem inappropriate</p>
