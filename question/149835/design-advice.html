			<p>It seems like I have been struggling for a couple years now to create anything beyond a basic app.  I just cannot get the design concepts.  When I started learning HTML 15 years ago I just did a view source.  No such luck with phone apps.  No reverse engineering is possible.  Cool apps like NFL mobile I just assumed were HTML 5 wrapped in a web view, but web view is so slow I now believe these are all native apps.  It blows my mind how they make those designs.  I am wondering if anyone could be so kind as to offer me some pointers.</p>
<p>I want to build an app that looks exactly like the Google Play store.  It is comprised of the following features:</p>
<ol>
<li>A header that displays a back arrow on the left when inside a section</li>
<li>A horizontal sliding menu</li>
<li>A two column grid</li>
</ol>
<p>What I am hoping is that these are all default components and someone can tell me what they used for 1 - 3.</p>
<p>Any tips would be much appreciated.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The best thing you should do is download the kitchen sink app, complete with source code.  This has all the comments and lets you use each, once you have then understood what each can do you can start building your own app.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Malcolm,  I have the Kitchen Sink and have examined it in detail.  It helps create basic apps and demo API functionality, but does not help with real world application design.  I am looking for help taking those basic concepts and translating them into a functional application design.  The only way I see that happening is if someone with more experience is willing to break down a real world app (e.g. the play store) into specific components so new adopters can see how they work together.</p>

							<p>I found what I was looking for.  It is called a ViewPager in Android, but there is no equivalent in Titanium yet.</p>
<p>There is a module on the store, but I had trouble getting it to work in Android 4.  </p>
<p>For people reading this I have found the best way to create layouts is by using Views as if they were HTML Divs and then plugging in appropriate controls, such as scrollable views, when needed.</p>
<p>So without a Titanium ViewPager you need to have one Scroll View for the nav and one Scrollable View for the body.</p>

							<p>Ok.  After tons and tons of research I stumbled upon something called the action bar, which is not in the Kitchen Sink.  The action bar combined with the scroll view will recreate the play store layout.  This action bar is a huge find and I am surprised it is not in the kitchen sink examples.  It is pretty amazing what you can do with it and there are theme generators as well.  Another example of the action bar is the Four Square app.  Anyway, this is the correct answer, but I don&#39;t think I can mark my own answer as &quot;best&quot;.  If you stumble upon this I hope it helps with your designs.</p>
