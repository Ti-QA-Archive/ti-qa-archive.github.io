			<p>Hi all</p>
<p>Ok, so in Titanium you explicitly set the position of each added element - very different to the way I&#39;m used to laying content out with HTML&#x2F;CSS where everything is positioned for you in order with block elements.</p>
<p>What kind of methods do people use to stagger content without having to manually set everything? Furthermore, if one needs to switch content on&#x2F;off and have content that flows after it shift position accordingly, how is this best achieved?</p>
<p>When I say content, I am referring to various labels, buttons, etc, which will be placed one after the other in a scrollable view.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<div><p>Oh, and how does one add (without having to add redundant elements) a little padding to the bottom of a scroll view? Presently the content of the scroll view sits flush with the bottom when you scroll down, but it needs a 20px gap. Is the only way to add an element underneath that has no visual appearance but occupies 20px of space?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>Ok, so you don&#39;t have to statically position everything. You can set the <code>layout</code> property on any view to give it either a <code>vertical</code> or <code>horizontal</code> value to lay things out similar to the way that elements lay out in html. Vertical would be like stacking block level elements on top of each other and Horizontal would be like setting float:left on a bunch of images and stacking them from left to right, wrapping when they get to the end of the view.</p>
<p>With that knowledge you should be able to get your content laid out the way that you want to.</p>
<p>When you need to relayout content, the best idea is to create a function that handles nothing but the layout of whatever it is that you need specific dynamic layouts for. When something in that view changes, call that layout function again to relayout that view.</p>
<p>As for the space at the end of the scrollview, you can either set the <code>bottom</code> property on the last item to the space you need, or create a white view with the space you need. The white view will be undetectable as it will look like the background of the scrollview.</p>

										<p><p>A little follow up question on this:</p>
<p>Is it possible to have a view with vertical&#x2F;horizontal layout, and then have something within that view position itself absolutely, rather than obeying the layout rule of its parent? In the same way you can in CSS with &#39;position: absolute&#39;?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance :)</p>

										<p><p>@BenHull Yes. If you put a view inside of another view that has a layout: &#39;vertical&#39; or &#39;horizontal&#39;, the second view will still default to &#39;composite&#39; which is basically absolute positioning.</p>
