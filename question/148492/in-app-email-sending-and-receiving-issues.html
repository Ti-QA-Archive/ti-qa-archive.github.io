			<h1>In-App email sending and receiving Issues</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>RUnning on Mac OSX Mountain Lion, Titanium 3.0.0, for targets iOS and android. I have this code that pops up an email dialog in my app. I am able to compose email both in simulator and on device and send same.  However, the email that is supposedly sent is never received even when it shows in my sent folder that the email was actually sent.</p>
<p>What am I doing wrong or what additional steps are required to receive the email at the recipient email address?  Thanks as you point me in the right direction.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">

<span class="actionscript">    btnEmail.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span>

        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> emailDialog = Titanium.UI.createEmailDialog();

        emailDialog.toRecipients = [<span class="hljs-string">'obisi7@gmail.com'</span>];

							<div><p>Titans, any advice or am I the only one who has this problem? I have not stopped trying to fix this issue but I am at my wits end. Any advice on how to have email supposedly sent from the app using native email client can be received. I am using the code snippet above straight from the docs…</p>

							<div><p>Can someone please help point out what I am missing in having email sent from my app per the code above?  Email dialog displays, allows for filling, and &quot;claims&quot; form sent to the email recipient.  But I never got an email sent from this form at all. This like other posting relative forms in Titanium studio have puzzled and frustrated me.  They have delayed my app development to date so significantly that I am trying other app development platforms.  I know this is my problem but I hope the community will help me at least point out my error and I will research how ot fix it; if I can.  I ust haven&#39;t seen what I am doing wrong per the development reference guide.  Thanks as you assist.</p>
