							<p>Based on a number of postings (see http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eclipse.org&#x2F;forums&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;t&#x2F;160069&#x2F; as an example) it looks like a corrupted download during the update. The best suggestion is to uninstall and reinstall. Apologies for the inconvenience.</p>

										<p><p>Uninstall&#x2F;reinstall may be a workaround, but it is hardly the &quot;best suggestion&quot;.  The &quot;best suggestion&quot; would be for Appcelerator to issue a Ti Studio update to fix this.</p>

										<p><p>I understand that uninstall&#x2F;reinstall is not ideal, and I would avoid it if possible. Steven, are you experiencing the same issue as well?</p>
<p>The above suggestion is to fix the issue reported in the log file, which from all forum postings (see the attached link) I can see, it&#39;s a problem where the download is somehow corrupted during the update process. There isn&#39;t a &#39;fix&#39; that we can issue, since it would be the same as someone got a bad download off a web site, but it works fine for others. Since that error is definitely a problem, it makes sense to fix that because it may well also solve the mobile project creation problem.</p>
<p>I just re-confirmed mobile project creation works on Windows XP for me in 1.0.7. If someone is experiencing the crash, can you please attach the contents of the crash file?</p>

										<p><p>Ingo, in my case, Studio doesn&#39;t crashâ¦I just get the &quot;An Exception occurred in the script&quot; error (as quoted by Vijay at the top of this thread) as soon as the Dashboard tries to come up.  Once I &quot;OK&quot; the error window, I see the Dashboard with just one panel at the topâ¦nothing else.  I can close the Dashboard and then reopen it, and I get the same error.</p>

										<p><p>Ingo, Bingo!  Dashboard works now (01&#x2F;03&#x2F;2012, 2:20pm EST) with no error msg.</p>
<p>The format of the Dashboard page is all jacked up (compared to what it looks like on a Win7 machine that never had the error), but I&#39;m assuming &quot;partially solve&quot; is relevant here.  If it&#39;s supposed to look good, let me know and I&#39;ll send you a screen shot.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Vijay,<br>I tried reproducing the issue on two different windows XP boxes but with no luck. Based on the log file, I delivered a change that should fix the issue. Can you try reproducing the issue with tonight&#39;s Beta build (should be 1.0.8.20120105xxxx+).</p>

							<p>These both are different error. The JSON error is related to HTML page which is getting loaded in Dashboard whereas crashing is a problem with Titanium Studio itself. I think this application is so buggy because it works on my other machine but there it keeps on waiting for android emulator whereas Google&#39;s AVD Manager shows that emulator is running perfectly. Please release a stable version.</p>

										<p><p>Ankur, we appreciate your comments, and please know that we are doing everything we can to produce the best software possible. As to the Android emulator waiting, we have to launch our emulator differently than Google does which appears to be part of the problem for some individuals. You may also note that the Android emulator can take a significant amount of time to load, which does not ease the process. We are working with the platform team to get these issues resolved ASAP.</p>
