		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey guys… just got an email that the plus modules are available. very psyched about that. I sent an email to get some details on pricing but in the meantime…</p>
<ul>
<li>how do we use it? Instructions are pretty vague. Anyone </li>
<li>says somewhere that it can call home to be sure its been licensed properly. Weird. </li>
<li>v0.1? That makes me a bit nervous. Are we paying for an alpha?</li>
<li>any idea on costs?</li>
</ul>

							<p>I think details are sparse so far.  There is a webinar on Mar 9 that you can &#x2F; should register for <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www3.gotomeeting.com&#x2F;register&#x2F;309116222">here</a> which should answer lots of questions, plus there is time for Q&amp;A set aside from what I read.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t worry too much about the version 0.1 – as someone who has developed a few iOS modules myself, I can tell you that is just the default version number assigned to a project until you change it.  That said, I doubt any of these modules have been tested outside Appcelerator internal projects, because I don&#39;t think any of them have been publicly available in the past.  Perhaps some Pro or higher subscribers were able to get early access copies, but since I am not in that crowd I could not say.</p>
<p>Regarding costs, I imagine full disclosure options will be made in the webinar, if not before, but the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;03&#x2F;the-cloud-starts-here%e2%84%a2.html">developer blog</a> says in part:</p>
<p>  &quot;As you move into commercial development, we have created new small business and enterprise packages that feature the new Titanium+Plus modules for commercial deployment. Pricing starts at $2,500&#x2F;year.&quot;</p>
<p>It is unclear to me if there are any module license alternatives separate from a Pro&#x2F;Small Business or higher subscription.  I am sure details will be forthcoming within a week, or less.</p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t look forward to paying $2,500&#x2F;year for 1 or 2 Modules that I&#39;d use on 1 or 2 of my apps… I hope there&#39;ll be a &quot;Simple Package&quot; that will <em>ONLY</em> have access to the modules. That&#39;s all I&#39;d want.</p>

										<p><p>Well, you tried posting a question to the group, but maybe you did not get any answers because it was too vague.  I would suggest asking a new question (not a comment reply follow up here, which is not as likely to be seen).  In the question try to give as much detail as you are comfortable saying publicly – like which platform(s) it must support (modules are written separately for each), at a minimum what category it deals with (ie audio&#x2F;video, geolocation, graphics&#x2F;sprites, networking, etc), and your time frame.  The more details, the better your chance of getting somebody who feels like they can respond appropriately.</p>

							<p>Thank guys. </p>
<p>I totally agree that $2500 is way out of my small business range. I have one app that prob won&#39;t see too many sales, so offering in-app purchase for a large sum vs offering both a LITE and FULL version of my app at no cost is a no brainer. Hopefully they figure this out so that everyone is happy. </p>
<p>In the mean time. I&#39;m trying to play around with the Ti.storekit and test it. I created a in-app product in itunes connect and a test user. I am trying to test it but not getting a response. My contracts are up to date as well. I get not response back when I call</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Ti.Storekit.requestProducts([<span class="hljs-string">'id'</span>], <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{
</code></pre><p>what exactly should be in the id? is it the app&#39;s number (as a string or number??) assigned by itunes. Is it the bundle identifier for the product (like com.mycompany.myapp)? if so, should it have the random string that apple appends to it? So confused. </p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>Fish</p>

							<p>I&#39;am also interested by the response </p>
<p>&quot;what exactly should be in the id? is it the app&#39;s number (as a string or number??) assigned by itunes. Is it the bundle identifier for the product (like com.mycompany.myapp)? &quot;</p>

							<p>It occurred to me that my PAID app is already in the app store. For me to make it a FREE app with UPGRADE would be logistically difficult to do. If I replaced my paid app with a FREE (w in-app), the previously PAID users would get screwed up on upgrade. </p>
<p>I think i&#39;m gonna stick to 2 separate apps. a PAID app and a FREE app. The other benefit to this that reviews will be separate. I can imagine that FREE users downloading my app b&#x2F;c its free may likely pan it b&#x2F;c its limited features or because there are Ads in it. So keeping the apps separate may actually benefit me.. and potentially save me $2500 :)</p>

							<p>You can download the free modules listed in the blog linked below. Unzip them into &quot;&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&quot;. There is documentation in the source code for the free&#x2F;open source modules linked below.</p>
<p>For those with a Professional license, login and click on each module listed on the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium-plus">Ti+Plus</a> page and download each file separately. So far I count 16 modules including the free ones. There doesn&#39;t seem to be any documentation in the module, on the live Documentation or in the Developer page. I expect it&#39;ll all come out with the webinar on March 9.</p>
<p>For fast unzipping of all 16 modules if you download them to the Downloads folder and from &quot;&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&quot; within a terminal:<br><code>for file in ~&amp;#x2F;Downloads&amp;#x2F;ti.*.zip ; do unzip $file ; done</code></p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
