			<h1>Titanium 3.2.0 Minimum IOS Version</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have number of apps I&#39;ve recently updated to be IOS7 friendly using SDK 3.2.0, I have 23&#39;000 apps updated and no complaints, but recently I got 2 complaints from users saying the app just crashes on there old iPhones, running 5.1.1. This is making me wonder how many others may crash and as the app doesn&#39;t run they can&#39;t click the feedback button. Yes they can use the apps store link but certainly a lot of people won&#39;t think of that</p>
<p>When I updated my Apps I deleted them completely from titanium and created them from new, I recreate the TiApp.xml and then copy a template into the folder for the other files, make changes to variables and graphics, test and Im done.</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me the min IOS that 3.2.0 supports, assuming my Apps need a higher version of IOS than 5.1.1 how do I specify that in titanium, looking on the app store they say that the min version is 5.0. It looks like the app store will support previous versions for older apps but I somehow need to change the current version to specify a higher version</p>
<p>Any ideas, for info the error they see is as below, @appcelerator this is a development error showing in an actual app downloaded from the app store</p>

										<p><p>Check this real-time chart for iOS version installed base.</p>

<p>Whilst you can still submit apps targeted at iOS 5 it is no longer considered a main stream OS version with on average currently less than 2% of the share.  Whilst that does mean that percentage actually translates into a larger number of devices - it also means those devices cannot access more modern API sets.</p>
<p>So you can use an older Ti SDK for older apps and a newer one for current iOS apps (as Nick points out) you will have to branch your code into two development versions.</p>
<p>The app store will provide an earlier version of your app to those who do not have the later OS versions that would allow newer versions it does mean you need to be smart about your app if it requires external API calls.  If your app uses external API calls you provide then you should change the end point of each main app versions to another URL or path within a URL - otherwise older apps will conflict with changes to newer APIs you create - just worth noting.</p>

										<p><p>Hi, it seems the App Store will deploy older versions of the apps automatically depending on the clients iOS version. Is there a way to deploy a maintenance update which simply updates the min iOS version for the current release, applying a new version will mean users still fall back to the version I have now and won&#39;t solve my issue ?</p>
