			<h1>Reading from plist/manifest at runtime?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m working on a white label app which will load data dependant on a unique ID. </p>
<p>What I wanted to do was the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add an &quot;app_id&quot; field to both the ios plist &amp; android manifest sections in the tiapp.xml</li>
<li>Package for both iOS &amp; Android</li>
<li>Pass the project files to a third party who would then open the projects, change the app_id, icons etc and build for app stores</li>
<li>The app will read the app_id on opening and deal with it accordingly</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, I can add the properties just fine, but I&#39;m unable to access them in any way I can think of. I&#39;ve tried looking around but to no avail. </p>
<p>Is there any way of doing this that will work for both Android &amp; iOS?  Is there an alternative way to do what I&#39;m looking for?</p>
<p>Please note: I cannot just allow the third party to build directly with Titanium - that is out of my hands so I need to find another way.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Dangerous process - handing off code to third-parties and not keeping that in-house.  Your security is compromised as is that of all other parties involved in this process as they all have access to the same code.</p>
<p>Ignoring the point above.  You do NOT need to add different properties to both the android and iOS tiapp.xml properties.  You should instead simply use tiapp.xml level properties and read those back in the app using the &quot;property&quot; namespace already available in Titanium.</p>
<p>You can also read the &quot;app id&quot; already set and use that within the app - keep in mind that each app should app its own guid.  With the new versions of Appcelerator going forwards you will find your way to control the process will be limited by the new licences and how each &quot;organisation&quot; can be set.</p>
<p>If you are using Alloy then much of this could and should be done within themes, this way you can localise all settings, images, styles and more.</p>

										<p><p>It&#39;s not being handed off to complete strangers - just another part of the company who will deal with the submissions. That entire side is out of my hands though so I just need to find a way to generate packages they can make minor edits to and submit.</p>
<p>I found this recently (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;87221&#x2F;how-to-deliver-iphone-xcode-source-to-client) but I&#39;m not sure if that;s still an option and I&#39;d need to do it for Android too.</p>
