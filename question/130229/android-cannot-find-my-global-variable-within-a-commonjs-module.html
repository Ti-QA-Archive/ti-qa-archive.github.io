			<h1>Android cannot find my global variable within a commonjs module</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>To organize my project better, I made a global object that contains settings&#x2F;global functions&#x2F;etc. and I included that in my app.js file.</p>
<p>global_var.js</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> GlobalVar = {};
GlobalVar.font = <span class="hljs-string">'foo'</span>;
GlobalVar.bar = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{<span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>;}
</code></pre><p>Then in app.js I include this file.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-type">Ti</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">include</span>(<span class="hljs-symbol">'global_var</span>.js');
</code></pre><p>I then create a commonjs module for a window and in that I reference the GlobalVar variable.</p>
<p>menu.js</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">... code to create window ...

var label = Ti.UI.createLabel({
        <span class="hljs-string">text :</span> <span class="hljs-string">'Foo Label'</span>,
        <span class="hljs-string">font :</span> {
            <span class="hljs-string">fontFamily :</span> GlobalVar.font,
            <span class="hljs-string">fontSize :</span> <span class="hljs-number">24</span>
        });
</code></pre><p>Everything works great in iOS, but when I try to run on the Android emulator I get an error for &quot;Uncaught ReferenceError: GlobalVar is not defined&quot;. Why can Android not see the global variable?</p>
<p>Titanium SDK 1.8, Android 2.2.3 V8</p>

							<p>To copy-paste myself :)</p>
<p>In Titanium&#39;s CommonJS implementation, variables defined in global scope cannot be referenced from module&#39;s scope.<br>That is, CommonJS module creates new JS context (like iframe in browser environment), so even if you do something like change of native prototypes like &quot;String.prototype&quot; (String.prototype.doSomething = function() {}), that won&#39;t be reflected in module scope (typeof &quot;&quot;.doSomething === &quot;undefined&quot;).<br>Now, is that a good thing or a bad thing can be discussed. :)</p>

										<p><p>Dont get me wrong using commonjs modules is the way forward; however having the ability to define globals I miss alot; I mean alot; its bad practice but sometimes to make development 100 fold easier I want  the ios broken implementation every day of the week;</p>

							<p>On Android you cannot have variables outside the current commonJS scope. From what I understand, the behaviour you are seeing is actually an &#39;error&#39; in the iOS javascript implementation (at least that&#39;s what I read on the boards in a previous post).</p>

										<p><p>Trevor, I&#39;ve been trying to implement a similar solution, and it works fine on Android but fails in iOS.  I have a window that is opened with the &quot;url&quot; property, which tries to require(&#39;Globals&#39;), but that ends up <strong>reloading</strong> the Globals.js file (another require-d module already did a require(&#39;Globals&#39;) call), contrary to Appcelerator&#39;s documentation.</p>
<p>Does anyone know why this happens or how to prevent it?</p>

										<p><p>Hi Shawn sorry not got back to you but it&#39;s been a busy day.</p>
<p>OK sorry Ivan but Shawn please don&#39;t monkey patch this it is not required nor is it a sensible solution.</p>
<p>The solution is not to load a window with the URL property. The issue you have is that when you load using the URL it actually uses an new context of the JavaScript interpreter so it will actually load any required files into memory again.. This is not a bug but is well documented that using a URL load unless you have a very very specific reason to is not recommended. </p>
<p>I know the kitchen sink is written that way, but they do have a specific reason to. </p>
<p>Hope this resolves the confusion on this that titanium is actually performing as it should in the way you are using it. To fix it will require you to change the application architecture.</p>

										<p><p>I think it&#39;s a bug, but I&#39;m not sure on what side. :)</p>
<p>The problem here is that iOS re-requires modules in new URL-based context, while Android does not. CommonJS specification does not define this behavior (as far as I know).</p>
<p>While I agree with you that real solution is to re-write application so it does not use URL-based windows, sometimes re-writing is not simple thing to do. Monkey-patch so that module is not re-required in new context is quick and dirty solution (sometimes it&#39;s better to have any solution, than no solution).</p>

							<p>Well, good to know it&#39;s not possible then. </p>
<p>What is a good way to try to achieve global variables between multiple modules? I might just drop commonjs because it has caused me more problems than benefits.</p>

										<p><p>You know, I&#39;m not really sure about globals except to see if <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;latest&#x2F;Titanium.App.Properties-module">Titanium.App.properties</a> would meet your needs. I don&#39;t use globals in my code, but commonJS has really helped nailing down memory problems and (to date for me at least) has been MUCH better than some of the other approaches I have seen for apps.</p>
