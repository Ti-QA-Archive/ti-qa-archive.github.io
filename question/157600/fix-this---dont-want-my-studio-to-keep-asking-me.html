										<p><p>My issue is that this is one of many examples, of  clear bugs, but nothing is done. Uses are expected to do hacks to fix. Not good enough.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m sorry, but &#39;clear bugs&#39; has not been established. In your particular case, you didn&#39;t have enough respect for the forum contributors to even try and give enough information to solve your problem,  no information regarding your environment, so no one is able to even attempt to reproduce the issue.</p>
<p>In our shop, on 5 dev machines, we have never experienced this issue across multiple installs, across multiple OSX versions, across multiple node versions.</p>
<p>With that in mind, &#39;screaming&#39; with excessive punctuation like a spoilt child is entirely counter productive.</p>

										<p><p>Sorry but I wont be using this platform after this project, as my experience with titanium is way too many bugs. </p>
<p>And they don&#39;t get fixed, just ignored e.g. NSRangeException in 3.1???</p>
<p>Splash screen bug????</p>
<p>What gives, driving me crazy with so many basic issues!!</p>
<p>Better testing please!</p>

										<p><p>Just so I&#39;m clear then and I&#39;m not wasting my time, this thread is just complaining and any answer or workaround I give, like to quick fix above or the fact that this is actively being addressed in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TISTUD-5431">TISTUD-5431</a>, will be met with a snarky, unappreciative comment? Good to know. </p>
<p>Sorry you&#39;re having such a tough time. If you&#39;d like to soften your attitude we&#39;d be happy to help. Otherwise, good luck in your search for bug-free software.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Tony</p>
<p>Sorry I seem a bit pissed off, just that we had our app working fine in 2.1.4.</p>
<p>Then we upgrade to sdk 3, and suddenly everything crashes. Wow.</p>
<p>Now that is a problem, and we have found everytime an update is released similar issues are experienced.</p>
<p>So this drives me nuts.</p>
<p>Happy to report, that I have resolved the issues, but I find that I have to do work arounds all the time to avoid bugs which exist in this software.</p>
<p>But I think the real issue here is not so much the bugs, but that the support for android is lacking, and speed on the android platform is very slow.</p>
<p>If only tittanium can be less buggy, when updates are released that would be great, as I am pushing this product to the limits of its capabilities.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t think I am alone in being fustrated with this product, as a few people in the land of oz have tried it, but given up due to bugs.</p>
<p>I know it is not possible to find all bugs possible, I am realistic.</p>
<p>You need to not give the impression that your product is buggy, as it is from the user prospective that I see the problem.</p>
<p>When something is released it really needs to work, when installed, not have a bunch of issues which people see. Can&#39;t just say it worked on my machine.<br>As clients won&#39;t be happy with that response.</p>
<p>The point of this post was to grab your attention, that not everyone is happy with bugs, and people will get pissed off that is a reality. Happy to be called a baby, But need to express concern about issues coming up.</p>
<p>Still plugging away with our app, and will report bugs when I have time.</p>
<p>Thanks for responding.</p>
