			<h1>iOS - Upgrading from SDK 1.6.2 / Xcode 4.2 .. To alloy</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>We have a 1.6.2 iOS app (Xcode 4.2). We have been releasing updates without a problem on this platform for over 2 years. However, I am expecting our next upgrade to be rejected. Mainly because our platform versions don&#39;t support the iPhone 5 resolutions, that I believe became mandatory in May.</p>
<p>Is this rejection assumption correct. And if so, what sort of pain do we have to got through to upgrade to the latest Xcode &amp; titanium platforms?</p>
<p>I seem to remember some of the v1.x controls are no longer supported in v3.x, so there will be some rewriting.</p>
<p>Anybody been through this and have any advice?</p>

							<p>Hi Mel</p>
<p>Without looking at the code base, I am going to have some guesses here.</p>
<p>Version 1.6.2 is pre commonJS.</p>
<p>So an assumption is that you have used a global namespace method.</p>
<p>Although you don&#39;t have to use alloy, but its advantages maybe useful, you will need to implement commonJS.</p>
<p>quite a lot of items have been deprecated between 1.6.2 and 3.1.3.</p>
<p>The decision here is not if you have to upgrade but if you use alloy or just commonJS, either way you have a massive learning curve, and a potential application rewrite, depending on what you app does.</p>
<p>Not a great deal of help, but you have reached the point of no option unfortunately.</p>
<p>T.</p>
