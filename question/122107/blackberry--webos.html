			<h1>BlackBerry / WebOS</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hi, is there any way titanium will incorporate support for these two platforms ? (RIM - BlackBerry, webOS - palm )<br>When it probably would be ? I woul like to see it, for now I&#39;m using phonegap :&#x2F; to create apps for these two platform and it&#39;s really anoying to copy and rewrite whole code just to fit it into their enviroment when I could just &quot;simply&quot; hit the build button in Appcelerator Titanium Studio.</p>
<p>Thanks for response</p>

							<p>Blackberry is available in Beta and supposedly coming in the next several weeks or so as a release.  I haven&#39;t heard any talk at all about WebOS, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s on the radar.</p>

							<p>Why&#39;s that ? Because I&#39;ve checked the WebOS 3.0 (as it was released recently) and it is only a web technology packed into a pseudo native app. So the intuition gives that if there will be a Titanium Mobile Web SDK why not include a WebOS branch ?</p>

										<p><p>I can&#39;t answer for Appcelerator, in terms of why or whether they have something in the works we&#39;re not aware of, only as to what I have heard or what they&#39;ve released publicly.  I haven&#39;t heard WebOS coming up much in the marketplace either… in terms of people or organizations demanding apps on that platform, but everybody&#39;s experience is different.</p>

										<p><p>I can&#39;t speak for Appcelerator either, but I suspect all decisions come down to where to allocate limited resources.  The last [mobile OS market share analysis<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ubergizmo.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;07&#x2F;apple-rim-us-smartphone-share&#x2F;">1</a> I saw showed webOS at only 2.4% of the market.  That is 1&#x2F;10 of the share of RIM, though RIM is falling faster than Palm.</p>
<p>Also consider that even if webOS 3.x &quot;is only a web technology packed into a pseudo native app&quot;, that most existing devices won&#39;t be on webOS 3.x anytime soon.  Last I knew, here in the USA the original Pre and Pixi from Sprint and Verizon could not even be upgraded to webOS 2.x let alone 3.x</p>
<p>So if a webOS branch of Mobile Web SDK needed 3.x as a minimum requirement (and I confess I do not know if it would), then the 2.4% market share of webOS would be greatly overstated as its potential user base.  All of which brings us back to where to allocate limited resources.</p>
<p>I think we can all agree we have our own pet peeve list of things we wished were already fixed in either the iOS or Android SDKs, so it isn&#39;t like they are dealing with unlimited resources here.</p>
<p>Also, one beauty of open source is that you can fork your own branches.  If you feel webOS 3.x support will be trivial to implement, why not do it yourself?</p>
