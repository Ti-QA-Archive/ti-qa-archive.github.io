			<h1>Autocomplete with AJAX?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I googled a bit around and I saw that jquery was supported in Titanium Mobile in the past and of course still is inside a Webview, which would also work for my problem, but maybe there is another solution for this task:</p>
<p>I have a database which has postal codes inside of it, what I would like to create is a search field which starts to show up suggestions after two numbers haven been typed. The database is sqlite, but I could also just make it available via JSON.</p>
<p>So what would be the best way to achieve this? The platform I want to run the app on is specifically the iPhone.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Kind regards,<br>Daniel</p>

							<div><p>Just a little confused, you mention AJAX and sqlite. Is the data you are attempting to access local to your app or remote?</p>

							<p>Ideally if the data isn&#39;t going to change anymore often than you would update your app, then storing locally will give you better performance. The complexity and size of your stored data should determine whether you should store it as sqlite or with simple JSON. </p>
<p>If the dataset is modest enough that you could load the whole thing in memory, storing it in JSON and loading it all up would be sure to give you your best performance. You&#39;d simply be accessing an array of Javascript objects at that point, instead of having to query sqlite. If the dataset is large and requires some more complex logic to query, perhaps sqlite would be your best path.</p>

										<p><p>awesome! So I can either use it and make the database available as a webservice or just change the data retrieval from the example to sqlite, thanks!</p>

							<p>If your data is big or updates frequently, then you can use external services to autocomplete the data.<br>Look at Autocomplete as a Service (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;aaas.io) .  It would make your app fast, consume less memory.<br>Also you can update the data anytime, without any need to update the app. It has got a very easy API, designed for easy integration into mobile apps.</p>
<p>Disclaimer - I work for &#39;Autocomplere as a Service&#39;</p>
