			<h1>Problem using Pusher along with Titanium</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello everybody,<br>I&#39;m working on a project with Real-time messaging behavior in it (kinda multi-player card playing game, a simple one) and i&#39;m gonna make use of the Pusher real-time services but im not able to build and use its official module for Titanium SDK and i have to embed its javascript library into webview and communicate back and forth between app logic and the webview via app-level events which doesn&#39;t really make sense.</p>
<p>my question is if anybody here have used Pusher with the official module working or any other non-official modules?<br>if not, what about other services? have anybody used real-time features in his&#x2F;her Ti-based app?with which method or service?</p>
<p>i have worked with realtime.co but its stability didn&#39;t satisfied me with several disconnects and reconnects and even lost messages.<br>i didn&#39;t test PubNub because its free plan is very limited for even beta testing.<br>i have the same problem with FireBase&#39;s ti module as with Pusher&#39;s module, i cant build and use it.<br>all comments are welcome and<br>Thanks.</p>
