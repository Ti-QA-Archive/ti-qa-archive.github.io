							<p>Hi Filipe. I&#39;m talking from my experience and from what I know from Appcelerator people (starting with employees and ending with Jeff, the CEO )</p>
<p>1 . No fees, nada, zit, zero - you can develop apps for any purpose without paying a single cent to Appcelerator. I did it myself A LOT and I know A LOT of devs doing the same.</p>
<p>2 . The explorer pack allows you to do whatever you want for free. If you don&#39;t need analytics or don&#39;t want to go with Appcelerator just set it to false in tiapp.xml - no logs will be done in this case so no danger to go over the limit.<br>ACS -  in your case you won&#39;t use it as you want to do your own backend. - so again no issues here</p>
<p>Anyway, if you use ACS there are some additional packs you can find here<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;plans-pricing -  scroll down a little :)</p>
<p>3 . Support - I don&#39;t know how it goes now, I&#39;m a pro&#x2F;enterprise user for too long and things changed a little but you always have QA and a lot of blogs around. The QA has a community that is pretty helpful as long as you don&#39;t ask for code or don&#39;t put &quot;stupid&quot; questions ( by stupid I mean things like : &quot;my app doesn&#39;t work, help.&quot;).<br>I can tell you that I rarely have to reach to the pro support, usually when it happens is for a bug, a feature request or if the things are way to advanced for me or other QA users.</p>

							<p>As you mentioned, this question has been asked a lot by the community over time. So maybe a good approach would have been to do some searching in the Q&amp;A. But I digress.</p>
<p>###Let&#39;s put plain and simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>The is absolutely <strong>no fee</strong> to develop your application using Titanium SDK and Titanium Studio.</li>
<li>App explorer would be enough to build any application. </li>
<li>As for support, there is always the Q&amp;A for community help. <ul>
<li>If you require more immediate support and the community can&#39;t help you, you will have to subscribe to <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;plans-pricing">one of the paid plans</a> provided by Appcelerator. I am not aware of any <em>per incident</em> support plans.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
