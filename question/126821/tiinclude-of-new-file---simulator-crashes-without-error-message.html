			<h1>Ti.include of new file -&gt; Simulator crashes without error message</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,<br>after I finally got Titanium Studio to work again, I am now encountering a very strange phenomenon:<br>When I try including a new file with Ti.include, the iPhone simulator just crashes without an error message. I first thought I had written some bad code, but the simulator even crashes, when the included file is empty.</p>
<p>I have no problem adding files with Ti.include, that previously existed in the project.<br>And spelling seems not be the problem, because if I spell the name of the file wrong, I get an explicit error message.</p>
<p>Does someone know what might be the reason of this error and how I could fix it?</p>
<p>I am using the latest version of Titanium Studio on Mac OS X and Titanium SDK 1.7.2</p>

							<div><p>Sure, I just uploaded my app.js file here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;1285417">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;1285417</a><br>The problem is the <code>Ti.include(&amp;#39;location&amp;#x2F;updateCategories.js&amp;#39;);</code> line. It includes a new file I created. But with that line the app crashes when it comes to launchApplication(). It even does so, when the file is empty and there is no code at all that could possibly destroy anything.</p>

							<p>What happens if you copy the code from the include and paste it directly in your project ?</p>
<p>Sometimes this can helo find an error because incudes Ive found are really bad when it comes to the debug stuff.</p>
<p>The other thing is what happens if you change the name of the file ?</p>

										<p><p>Same problem if I change the name of the file. Also, including a new file from the same folder as app.js crashes the app.</p>
<p>And the file is currently empty, I deleted all code, because I thought my code caused the crash, but it just keeps crashing (I also cleaned the project and build everything new, but still the same problem).<br>It&#39;s probably sth with my setup, but I have no clue, what that might be.</p>
