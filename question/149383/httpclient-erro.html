							<div><p>I think someone has a problem with the fact you have asked questions (this and another) with obvious code issues and yet not provided any code whatsoever.</p>
<p>Your question is vague and without code there is no way to determine what problem you have actually code or offer any assistance until you do.</p>
<p>This information is detailed in the page you filled out to create this question.</p>

							<div><p>I do not understand what the position to define you, &quot;that&#39;s a good question,&quot; the questions of many users are very simple and we show you insist code. For my part, I have found what is the answer to my question, and if I see another question like this, I will not hesitate to answer a simple as the question.</p>
<p>It is a bad practice they are doing.</p>

							<div><p>Well done for finding your own answer, but in future do provide code, you may not think it is worth it and that is your choice.  But if you want a quick answer then providing code is likely to give you a much better answer to your problem.  In this questions case the answer could have been a dozen things.</p>
<p>You have not shared with the community what the problem was that you have now solved - so the community cannot learn from this question.</p>

							<div><p>You will also find that giving feedback to those who provide you answers is also recommend.  If the answer provided helped solve the problem - mark it as answered and choose the answer that gave you the most help.  If no answer gives you a full answer but enough to get you moving in the right direction - then mark that one and comment on the question what additional details you later found out - so the community will be helped as you were.</p>
