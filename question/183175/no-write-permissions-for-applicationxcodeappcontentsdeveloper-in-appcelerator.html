			<p>I have mac version 10.10.5 with Titanium SDK version 5.0.1and Xcode 7 installed. However, when I open Appcelerator Studio (latest version), the dashboard shows that &quot;iOS &amp; Xcode&quot; are not installed. When I click the download button, the &quot;Platform Configuration&quot; window opens. If I check the checkbox for iOS, an error message appears in the window saying &quot;No write permissions for &#x2F;Application&#x2F;Xcode.app&#x2F;Contents&#x2F;Developer&#x2F;&quot;. Any ideas?</p>

							<p>I finally got everything installed correctly. I had to uninstall Node.js, Java JDK, Appcelerator CLI, and Appcelerator Studio. I then reinstalled Appcelerator Studio, AND LET STUDIO INSTALL EACH OF THOSE COMPONENTS. That was the important part. I&#39;m sure not every single one of those components needed to be uninstalled, but for someone like me who had just installed everything, uninstalling wasn&#39;t a huge deal. When installing studio, it asked me for permission to install Node, the JDK, and the CLI. I said yes and it installed everything. When I opened studio for the first time, the dashboard came up saying iOS and Xcode were installed. I think that it was possibly a path that the studio couldn&#39;t see previously, not really sure. The only thing I can say is this: DON&#39;T FOLLOW THE APPCELERATOR DOCS for getting up and running with Appcelerator Studio. I followed those docs perfectly for mac and everything was a mess. Windows was perfect, but Mac was a mess. Just install the studio and let it do it&#39;s thing. Hope this helps someone.</p>
