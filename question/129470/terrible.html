			<p>Is there a specific reason this is the worst RIA app I have ever used? <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jsfiddle.net&#x2F;XTREME104&#x2F;zgxKu&#x2F;">jsFiddle - Bouncing Particles</a> looks fine in Safari, with a million tabs open in both windows, but the exact same code creates the worst mostrosity ever in Titanium (Worst RIA app ever)? I was hoping this would look better, but obviously not, plus it uses an outdated version of webkit, I have to specify -webkit-box-shadow, rather than just box-shadow.</p>

							<div><p>It&#39;s also amazing that appcelerator claims &quot;Unlike Adobe AIR, Titanium gives you access to the entire system’s resources. And Titanium apps take up to 1&#x2F;10th the memory that AIR apps do.&quot;, when Titanium gives you access to no system resource&#39;s, while AIR does. AIR also has way better performance. Plus, your &quot;Native Advantage&quot; is running Javascript in an an outdated webkit browser window without menus</p>

							<div><p>&quot;Looks can be appealing&quot;, displaying iTunes, which has extended top chrome&#x2F;titlebar, which Titanium doesn&#39;t allow you to do. Titanium is soooo cool because the window looks like a mac window on a mac, and a windows window on windows</p>

							<div><p>&quot;Titanium bundles in the latest version of webkit, so you have access to all the latest capabilities in HTML5 and CSS3. Add custom animations, 3D effects, or build a killer UI without cross-browser issues.&quot;, just… lol.</p>
<p>&quot;Apps for more than just the desktop<br>Titanium powers digital signage, point-of-sale, Kiosks, ATMs, and set top apps and will support Google Chrome OS and Apple’s Tablet.&quot;, They seriously use this crap in any of those? the people who decided that shoould be fired.</p>
<p>The one thing that makes me inclined to use Titanium is the idea of ACTUAL native code (modules)</p>

							<div><p>Oh, cool. Modules are only for mobile web pages (I guess appcelerator calls them apps), nice to know, now I have no reason to use Titanium. So ill stick with AIR :)</p>

							<div><p>Your gripe may be genuine, but the level of hate towards Titanium seems a little over the top.</p>
<p>Too bad Titanium wasn&#39;t a fit for what you needed though.</p>
