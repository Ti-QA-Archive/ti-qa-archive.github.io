							<p>Dropdown lists are not part of the iOS UI component set, nor are they part of the Android component set. Both the Apple Human Interface Guidelines and Android Design Guides point out that dropdown lists are troublesome on mobile because of the small click areas and limited screen real estate. That&#39;s why both platforms offer the spinner controls.</p>
<p>On Android, the spinner can appear somewhat like a dropdown list. However, iOS does not offer that sort of native control. There&#39;s a small chance that rigging up one of your own would keep Apple from approving your app for the App Store.</p>

										<p><p>hey tim, it&#39;s an honour to get an answer from you (after watching lots of videos). What I have mentioned with dropdown was the picker. I&#39;m looking for the functionality of doing search and select from a list. Like the &#39;tags&#39; field in Q&amp;A here. What&#39;s the best approach for mobile environment?</p>

										<p><p>Ah, I guess I misunderstood what you were looking for. I don&#39;t know of a specific solution that you could just drop into a project.</p>
<p>On a broad level, you could listen for the &#39;change&#39; event on a text field, do a lookup for matching terms based on what the user entered so far, use the results to populate a table which you would display hovering over and just beneath the text box. A click event on the table could then set the text field&#39;s value to the contents of that row. </p>
<p>Sorry, that&#39;s not much help. If you find a component, make sure to update this thread in case others are looking for a similar solution.</p>

										<p><p>Yeah that would be the workaround, but I hoped that there is somewone who knows (or already built) a component. Anyway, I&#39;ll go for an own solution. thanks. and yes, If I would find a solution I would paste it here.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>There is a right way to do this, in fact there are two right ways; one for iOS and one for Android.</p>
<p>We now use these methods in all our apps as do many of the big names apps.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>iOS</strong></p>
<p>Modal window that pops up showing a table that an entry can be selected - shows a tick and allows the user to cancel or confirm the choice.  The window is then closed updating the user interface to show the new choice.</p>
<p>There is a great example of this in the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunes.apple.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;app&#x2F;apple-store&#x2F;id375380948">Apple Store</a> app (not App Store app that is different).  Download the app if you do not already have it and then select any product that offers a choice - iPad case for example, press the initial colour and the modal window displays with the other choices for you to select from.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Android</strong></p>
<p>OptionDialog; this is the accepted way to display a mobile UI list of choices.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>How</strong></p>
<p>In our apps we create a single CommonJS module (classic Titanium style) or Widget (Alloy style) that accepts the list of choices as an array and the currently selected item.  It then uses the correct UI for the platform and then returns back the selected option value which is usually a title and id in our apps.</p>
<p>By making this modular you can then use it anywhere you like in your apps because it becomes a CommonDialog you re-use.</p>
</li>
</ul>
