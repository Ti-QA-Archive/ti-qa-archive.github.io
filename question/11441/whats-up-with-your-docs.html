			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to get up and running with Appcelerator, but the docs are a mess.  I guess the API is fine, but Google keeps sending me to codestrong.com, which contains old samples that don&#39;t seem to work with the new SDK.  There is a disclaimer on that site stating it is deprecated (fine), but the message also states that the information has been integrated within the new dev center.  As far as I can tell it hasn&#39;t, so what&#39;s up?</p>
<p>I know you are trying to push the paid training, but based on your 100 series (which is really just a sales pitch for Appcelerator), I&#39;m a bit pessimistic about your video training.</p>
<p>I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that the new user experience is awful - poor&#x2F;confusing docs, outdated code samples with poor commenting, lack of community resources, etc.  So, again, what&#39;s up?</p>

							<p>The docs are a work in progress… this site is a new look&#x2F;content and is a big improvement from the pre 1.0 web presence of just over a month ago. So, as a fairly new user that is getting his feet under him here&#39;s a strategy to get you started.</p>
<p>Check out the intro&#x2F;training videos on vimeo.com, should be plenty to get you started there.  After that, be sure to download the Kitchensink app. It is basically dozens of pages of app demo functions categorized into tabs for convenience.  After you play with that, the next step is to open up your favorite IDE and start exploring the well documented javascript files.  You can grab code, cut=n=paste and be building apps in no time.</p>
<p>Of course more App in any category that have been around for years will have oodles of training and tech material.  Around here, folks know it is coming.  There will be a TI book published this Summer.  In the meantime, experiment, ask questions, and the community does what it can to help you out.</p>
<p>B.</p>

							<p>my 2ct: the docs are far from complete. but with what&#39;s there and the Q&amp;A (which i don&#39;t like much, i&#39;d prefer a forum) it took me 2 weeks from zero to a smoothly working android app. that&#39;s not bad. Ti staff has been very supporting too. a mess is different…</p>
