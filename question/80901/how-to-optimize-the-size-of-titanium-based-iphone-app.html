			<h1>How to optimize the size of Titanium based iPhone App?</h1>

		<section>
			<p>I have created a iPhone App using the Titanium Framework. The app has totally 4 screens. I do not use any database at all. But my application size seems to be around 5.7 MB. Is there any way to reduce the size of the application?</p>

							<p>As mentioned in other answers, code has already been committed to 1.5.X that makes the Titanium pre-compiler much more effective. The pre-compiler takes the JavaScript code you have developed and optimises it by removing whitespace, reducing symbols&#39; size etc and then creates a dependency hierarchy of only the Titanium APIs used by your application.</p>
<p>The enhancement was tracked in ticket <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32238&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;685-android-minimize-apk">#685</a>. In fact, Marshall only moved it to fixed-in-qa status two days ago, so it&#39;s quite a coincidence that you brought the subject up! :)</p>

							<p>Thats because every titanium module is compiled with it. In the nex release (1.5.0) the size should be reduced (if i&#39;m correct)</p>

										<p><p>Hi, But the KitchenSink app is roughly 6.7 MB. What could be the reason?</p>

										<p><p>As Jacob said, most of the big size is because every Titanium module gets loaded with every app. The code, a few or alot of windows for example doesnt affect the size that much.</p>
<p>So thats why the size of your &quot;small&quot; app and Kitchen Sink &quot;the big app&quot; is almost the same.</p>

							<p>Check your resources folder and get rid of everything you&#39;re not using.  I had some Photoshop PSD&#39;s that I had in a project for design purposes and my app was huge.  Moved these to another folder and it shrunk.</p>

							<p>Just before publishing an app, I copy all of the resources to a new place, delete the project, and re-create it from new.  My thought is that perhaps Titanium doesn&#39;t do a full &quot;distclean&quot; type of rebuild and there might be stuff hanging around from previous builds.  Try this, it might help, and can&#39;t hurt (as long as you&#39;re careful not to delete all your code…) </p>
