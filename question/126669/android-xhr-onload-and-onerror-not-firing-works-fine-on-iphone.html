			<h1>Android XHR: onload and onerror not firing (works fine on iPhone)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>This one&#39;s driving me a bit crazy. I have some simple xhr code that fails to throw either onload or onerror events on Android.</p>
<p>The code does make the HTTP call, but doesn&#39;t execute the onload and onerror functions: neither SUCCESS nor ERROR are printed to the log.</p>
<p>The same code works perfectly well on iPhone.</p>
<p>I suspect this has something to do with the context the code is running in; I&#39;ve had similar issues with other events not firing on Android that were resolved by moving the events to other windows or contexts.</p>
<p>This code was previously working. I cleaned various things up to encapsulate things, put them into separate windows, and at some point this quietly broke.</p>
<p>Ideas are appreciated.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var httpRequest = Ti.Network.createHTTPClient();
httpRequest.open(<span class="hljs-string">"<span class="hljs-keyword">GET</span>"</span>,  <span class="hljs-string">"http://parand.com/"</span>);
httpRequest.onload =function(xhr) { Titanium.API.info('=== SUCCESS'); }
httpRequest.onerror =function(xhr) { Titanium.API.info('=== ERRORR'); }
httpRequest.send();
Titanium.API.info('--- HTTP REQUEST SENT');

							<p>Figured out the issue: I was closing the window that was doing the XHR call before the call was completed. This, apparently, is fine under iPhone, but causes problems under Android.</p>
<p>I ended up moving the XHR call to an async thread (via code below), separating the window lifetime from the XHR lifetime.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> asyncThread</span> = Ti.UI.createWindow ({ url: <span class="hljs-string">"async.js"</span> });
asyncThread.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>();

										<p><p>although this worked, probably not a very good pattern to use for your applications. I would recommend either a single context application or using an event to close the window based on the success or failure of the http request</p>

										<p><p>Aaron, much thanks for that. I thought this was the recommended way of doing background tasks?</p>
<p>It turns out I can do most of what I need via events instead of having a separate async window - I guess you&#39;re saying it&#39;s worthwhile turning everything into events?</p>
