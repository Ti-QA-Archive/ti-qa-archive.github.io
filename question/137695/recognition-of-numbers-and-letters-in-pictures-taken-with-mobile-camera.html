			<h1>Recognition of numbers and letters in pictures taken with mobile camera</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, I am interested in doing an application for iPhone that will use the camera to take pictures of plastic labels showing part numbers, in order to use them to search in a remote DB the part description, price, etc.. The labels are white background, and the text is black colored, I just need to read this number when the user points the camera.</p>
<p>Is there any module, API or component that can be used in Titanium Appcelarator in order to do this?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>You might be able to tap in to a cloud-based OCR API do to this. eg : http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ocrsdk.com&#x2F;</p>
<p>There might also be some heavy JS based solutions around, since I&#39;ve seen colour and face recognition done with pure JS a while ago, so maybe there&#39;s been some development there. </p>
<p>It&#39;s also worth searching any Objective-C out there which might be able to do it. Then you could find something&#x2F;someone to be bale to build an ORC module. </p>
<p>good luck!</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>I have checked that cloud based service and it looks really nice, but the pricing schema is not feasible for me. The app would be checking unlimited P&#x2F;Ns per day that I don&#39;t know in advance, however the plan they offer is charging for each picture or page.</p>
<p>I need an alternative.</p>

										<p><p>If you&#39;re the one making the stickers themselves, you could always create a barcode or QR code instead of actual numbers (or simply print both) and use the barcode scanning module available to do this. </p>
<p>This would be a lot easier - and free! :)</p>

										<p><p>Yes, we are making the stickers, but I didn&#39;t know there was a module for bar codes. If so then this would be the easiest way to go. Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Here you go : http:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.google.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;tibar&#x2F;</p>
<p>It&#39;s open source too.<br>If you have any issues getting it working&#x2F;compiled, there are quite a few solutions in the Issues section.</p>
<p>It works very well for many different types of barcodes.</p>
