			<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Some one please help me to get any sample application or idea on SOAP webservice integration with Titanium Appcelerator.<br>All I see found so far by searching is that, providing the end-point url of the SOAP service in the code.<br>But, in my case, I don&#39;t have any services handy now. Where to develop the webservice and its client and deployment steps etc.<br>It&#39;s easy if we have the service url to hit it from titanium, but in case of everything from starting, what are all the steps we should follow to get it done.</p>
<p>Please help me and provide the steps as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Regards<br>Ravi.G</p>

							<div><p>Mauro,</p>
<p>Can you please let me know why SOAP is not recommended with Appcelerator?<br>I done a sample App with JSON, and deployed the string file on server, which is working fine.</p>
<p>Please provide me the valid reasons to avoid the SOAP. Bcz I need provide the justification before saying something with the team.</p>
<p>Regards<br>Ravi.G</p>

							<div><p>SOAP WebServices are usually not recommended when using mobile applications. Mostly for performance reasons. An XML file should normally be more <em>verbose</em> when serving information. Where with JSON, it is basically a simple dictionary.</p>
<p>Also, the XML parsing (while still fast) will never be as fast as loading a JSON object; especially with Titanium.</p>
<p>Of course, while using JSON over XML is the recommended way, there is absolutely nothing stoping you from using XML for your WebServices. This is usually the case when you already have a web service in place and want to leverage that actual service. But if you have the chance to develop the service from scratch, then JSON would be your best bet.</p>

							<p>Seems to me like you are having an <em>chicken or the egg</em> problem. You mention in your original post that you <strong>do not</strong> have access to the web service. And yet, you want to develop an mobile application that interacts with this (still inexistent) service.</p>
<p>I&#39;m pretty sure you agree, that it is pretty hard for anyone from the Q&amp;A to help you out since you have <strong>no service</strong> and <strong>no code</strong> whatsoever to show for.</p>
<p>My advice to you would be to develop a <em>mock service</em> that follows the specification you already have (I assume). This simple service can be developed using pretty much any language you are the most comfortable with. Once this is in place, you will be able to develop your mobile application.</p>
<p>Hope this clears it up a little for you.</p>
