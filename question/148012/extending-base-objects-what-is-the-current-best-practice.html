			<h1>Extending base objects. What is the current best practice.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Ok, I&#39;m pretty new to titanium and an not using Alloy.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been researching for the last couple of days the best way to extend base ui objects (e.g., make a custom button based off the view class). </p>
<p>So far it appears that the community is somewhat confused on this topic, largely because Appcelerator themselves have been changing their answers on this over time.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a blog post talking on two of the most common options, a wrapper class and parasitic inheritance: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;smorgasbork.com&#x2F;index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=133</p>
<p>There seems to be much disagreement on exactly what method you should use, many saying that parasitic inheritance is fraught with issues because you are extending native bridges, while others say you can use them, just be aware of the naming limitations.</p>
<p>This is represented in this oft-referenced Q&amp;A post here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;137094&#x2F;parasitic-inher%20itance-and-prox%20y-objects </p>
<p>In this Kevin Whinnery suggests parasitic inheritance is fine for the aforementioned reasons (and says they are working on new way of dealing with this, is this Alloy or something else???).</p>
<p>Meanwhile older documents addressed this issue straight on (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Mobile+Best+Practices) but I can&#39;t seem to find clear guidelines in the newer docs for this case (does this mean the old way is not recommended anymore?).</p>
<p>All this has left me in complete confusion. I need to create my own widgets based off existing widgets. Ideally this would be done through extending the older widgets somehow, but how?</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m supposed to be seeing there. It appears to be inheriting something but since it&#39;s heavily mixed with alloy I can&#39;t tell how it&#39;s useful for my non-alloy project.</p>
<p>So is this type of inheritance where you create the windows object, in this case, and pass it in. Then you just have your own methods that interact with that native window class?</p>
