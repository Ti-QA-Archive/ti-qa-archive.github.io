			<h1>TestFlight not accepting SDK</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am using Torsten Stelling&#39;s TestFlight iOS module to try and upload a build for testers, but I ran into an issue on the TestFlight site when uploading my .ipa file. It appears that they changed their policy on 2&#x2F;26&#x2F;14 not allowing any builds with their SDK. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.testflightapp.com&#x2F;customer&#x2F;portal&#x2F;articles&#x2F;1452760">policy change</a>. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;postimg.org&#x2F;image&#x2F;ts1wkhxt7&#x2F;">build issue screenshot</a> Has anyone run into this issue or know a way around this?</p>
<p>What is a good alternative to distributing a test build to around 20 people? Would it be best to email the .ipa file to the testers, get their UDID numbers and then individually create their test devices and new provising profile?</p>

							<p>We are moving to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.installrapp.com&#x2F;">installr</a> since the betrayal by testflight to screw over their long term testers. Free for small projects, reasonably priced for medium.</p>

										<p><p>the warning is about sdk versions.  If you must use testflight, the consider mads module. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;viezel&#x2F;NappTestFlight">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;viezel&#x2F;NappTestFlight</a></p>
<p>Pretty easy to update to the latest testflight sdk</p>

										<p><p>Hey Stephen,<br>Thanks for all of the responses. So it seems like TestFlight is out of the picture for Titanium support as of now. I took a look at Installr and am very intrigued, but it doesnt appear that they have any documentation. Do they offer any features that provide user tracked feedback (TestFlight features)? If so, is there a module for Titanium? Or is this purely an app tester distribution service?</p>

They added android support, which was great for us because of the dual platform nature of our work.  Then android disappears, and now we cannot set up new teams and utilize the sdk.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Connor - I&#39;m a Ti Dev and I started <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.installrapp.com">Installr</a>.  We will be adding Android support in the next 48 hours.  We don&#39;t have any plans for App analytics or crash reporting at the moment, but we will be doing a whole bunch of stuff to make App distribution even easier in the next months.</p>
