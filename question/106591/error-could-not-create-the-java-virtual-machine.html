			<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve just installed Titanium for the first time, and I&#39;m having problems getting the default mobile app to work.  I followed the installation instructions and have installed Python, Git, Java JDK, Android SDK, and Titanium Developer onto <code>C:\Program Files\Development\</code> in Windows XP.</p>
<p>I added the following to my PATH variable:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">C:<span class="hljs-command">\Program</span> Files<span class="hljs-command">\Development</span><span class="hljs-command">\Python</span>27;C:<span class="hljs-command">\Program</span> Files<span class="hljs-command">\Development</span><span class="hljs-command">\Git</span><span class="hljs-command">\cmd</span>;C:<span class="hljs-command">\Program</span> Files<span class="hljs-command">\Development</span><span class="hljs-command">\Git</span><span class="hljs-command">\bin</span>;C:<span class="hljs-command">\Program</span> Files<span class="hljs-command">\Development</span><span class="hljs-command">\Java</span><span class="hljs-command">\jdk</span>1.6.0_23<span class="hljs-command">\bin</span>;C:<span class="hljs-command">\Program</span> Files<span class="hljs-command">\Development</span><span class="hljs-command">\Android</span><span class="hljs-command">\android</span>-sdk-windows<span class="hljs-command">\tools</span>
</code></pre><p>I setup the JAVA_HOME variable as:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">C:<span class="hljs-command">\Program</span> Files<span class="hljs-command">\Development</span><span class="hljs-command">\Java</span><span class="hljs-command">\jdk</span>1.6.0_23
</code></pre><p>..and the android_sdk variable as:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">C:<span class="hljs-command">\Program</span> Files<span class="hljs-command">\Development</span><span class="hljs-command">\Android</span><span class="hljs-command">\android</span>-sdk-windows
</code></pre><p>I created a test project and in the Test &amp; Package section and set the SDK to &#39;APIs 2.2&#39; and Screen to &#39;WVGA800&#39; and clicked Launch.</p>
<p>This opens the emulator and I can unlock it and see the standard apps, eg. Alarm Clock, Browser, etc.  However, by the looking at the docs it should open the &#39;default mobile app&#39;, which has two tabs and some text &#39;I am Window 1&#39; - but I don&#39;t get this.</p>
<p>I then checked the (debug window?) and it shows two errors which I guess explain the reason why I&#39;m not seeing the default app?:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[<span class="hljs-preprocessor">INFO</span>] Launching <span class="hljs-keyword">Android </span>emulator...one moment

<p>Actually, this is starting to make sense. I have a feeling your software configuration is correct.</p>
<p>However, the error you see is:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[ERROR] Could <span class="hljs-keyword">not</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">create</span> the Java <span class="hljs-keyword">virtual</span> machine.
</code></pre><p>This is generated after the following command, which specifies a heap space of 1GB:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-special">[</span>DEBUG<span class="hljs-special">]</span> "C:<span class="hljs-command">\Program</span> Files<span class="hljs-command">\Development</span><span class="hljs-command">\Java</span><span class="hljs-command">\jdk</span>1.6.0_23<span class="hljs-command">\bin</span><span class="hljs-command">\java</span>.exe" -Xmx1024M ... <span class="hljs-special">[</span>etc<span class="hljs-special">]</span>
</code></pre><p>Hence, how much physical RAM do you have installed on your system? If it&#39;s at least 1GB, how much is available (free) after the emulator is booted?</p>

										<p><p>Note that the Titanium SDK determines how java.exe is executed and earlier SDKs, such as 1.4.0, required slightly less memory. Hence, you may have better success using 1.4.0 on a system with limited physical memory, although obviously this isn&#39;t a satisfactory longterm solution.</p>

										<p><p>This is pretty crazy. OK, another idea!</p>
<p>Did you definitely paste <code>adb.exe</code> <strong>and</strong> it&#39;s associated dll file into the <code>&amp;#x2F;tools</code> directory?</p>
<p>Close Titanium Developer and emulators, and move everything inside <code>C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Titanium\mobilesdk\win32</code> somewhere else.</p>
<p>Reboot and log in using the test user you created before, which should have admin rights while you troubleshoot this issue.</p>
<p>If you have any antivirus installed, disable on-access scanning while you are troubleshooting this issue.</p>
<p>Clear out the build files of the project you created on your desktop. </p>
<p>Start Titanium and it should show a link to update the missing SDKs. Install the first and when done restart Titanium and repeat the process until all the SDKs have been installed.</p>
<p>Start Titanium and press the &quot;save changes&quot; button for the project on your desktop, and then launch your app.</p>
<p>Let me know!</p>

										<p><p>Yes, I definitely copied <code>adb.exe</code> &amp; <code>AdbWinApi.dll</code> into the tools directory - I just double-checked.</p>
<p>I moved the contents of the win32 directory (1.2.0 &amp; 1.5.1 directories) onto my Desktop, rebooted, and logged in as testuser, then closed down ZoneAlarm.</p>
<p>I then deleted the build files and run Titanium Developer and clicked the link to download v1.5.1 of the SDK, then restarted it.  However I didn&#39;t get anymore update messages - I restarted again to make sure.</p>
<p>I noticed the 1.2.0 &amp; 1.5.1 directories had reappeared in the win32 directory.</p>
<p>I then clicked &#39;Save Changes&#39; and was about to click the &#39;Launch&#39; button but then noticed the value in the &#39;SDK&#39; &amp; &#39;Screen&#39; dropdown was stuck at &#39;Loading..&#39;.  After a few mins I restarted Titanium and retried but still said &#39;Loading..&#39;.</p>
<p>At this point I uninstalled and reinstalled the Android SDK as per the docs, and then recopied the <code>adb.exe</code> and <code>AdbWinApi.dll</code>, including deleting the AVD.  This cured the problem Titanium Developer saying &#39;Loading..&#39; but still gave the same error after clicking &#39;Launch&#39;.</p>

										<p><p>OK, that&#39;s disappointing.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t even realise Zonealarm had an antivirus product, as it used to be just a firewall&#x2F;security suite. If that&#39;s what you have, then fine.</p>
<p>Last thing I can think of is, under the user account you&#39;ve been using to troubleshoot this, with antivirus disabled, close Titanium and emulators, delete the directories listed in the bullet points below, clear your build files (just for good measure), and launch your app.</p>
<ul>
<li>C:\Users\username.android</li>
<li>C:\Users\username.deltafy</li>
<li>C:\Users\username.titanium</li>
</ul>
<p>If this doesn&#39;t work, I will struggle to think of something else!  :&#x2F;  Would you create another gist of your diagnostics output and pastebin your trace log, and we will try to attract the Appcelerator team to see if there is anything we&#39;ve missed.</p>

										<p><p>I have just noticed that the when I listed the three directories (<code>.android</code>, <code>.deltafy</code> and <code>.titanium</code>) above, the Q&amp;A reformated them and left out the forward slash after the username. I presume you found the directories, didn&#39;t you?</p>
<p>By deleting them, especially the titanium directory, should have meant that you had to reconfigure Titanium Developer (including the Android path and your projects). Did this happen?</p>

<p>It looks pretty good. However, due to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32238-titanium-mobile&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;2813">#2813</a>, even though it doesn&#39;t seem to be affecting you, install packages &quot;SDK Platform Android 1.5&quot; and &quot;Google APIs by Google Inc Android API 3&quot; just to be on the safe side. Carry on using &quot;APIs 2.2&quot; on the &quot;Run Emulator&quot; screen though.</p>

										<p><p>Did you have to configure the Android SDK path after deleting the Titanium folder this time?</p>
<p>OK, I <em>still</em> think the problem may have something to do with XPs memory management, although I have never heard of any other user having the issue. So, try this:</p>
<p>Close your emulator.</p>
<p>In the directory containing your Titanium SDKs (something like <code>Titanium\mobilesdk\win32\</code>, where you deleted the SDKs from before), there is a directory for SDK 1.5.1. Find the file <code>1.5.1\android\builder.py</code> and make a backup of it. Then open the file with a text editor, find the first occurrence of the string &quot;Xmx&quot;. Change the number after it from 1024M to 512M, and save the file. Then clear out your project build directories. Click the Save changes button in Titanium Developer for the project, and launch your app. Watch the trace, and if it seems to have stalled after a reasonable amount of time, launch the app again.</p>
<p>If that doesn&#39;t work after a few attempts, restore <code>builder.py</code> to the old version.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s hoping! :&#x2F;</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing that isn&#39;t the fix but instead probably highlighted the real problem?  eg. Memory management problem?</p>

										<p><p>Wow, fantastic! :D</p>
<p>This issue does not happen on Windows 7. Bearing in mind all the free memory your system has, I imagine that it is WinXP&#39;s inferior memory management causing it.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t worry, I will get in touch with the core team and let them know about it. Until you hear more, consider the above &quot;the workaround&quot;.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t close the question yet - I will create a ticket in the next couple of days that defines the issue, and post the URL back here so that others can find&#x2F;watch it.</p>

<p>OK, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;171205&#x2F;java-maximum-memory-on-windows-xp&#x2F;497757#497757">this</a> and <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;171205&#x2F;java-maximum-memory-on-windows-xp&#x2F;497961#497961">this</a> information explains the reason for the issue, and it is not a Titanium-specific one.</p>
<p>There are a number of things you could try. The results of each of them would probably be useful for other users, if you are prepared to do it.</p>
<ul>
<li>restore the original <code>builder.py</code> value, configure the WinXP &#x2F;3GB switch, explained <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.microsoft.com&#x2F;kb&#x2F;833721">here</a>, in boot.ini, explained <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dwf.blogs.com&#x2F;beyond_the_paper&#x2F;2009&#x2F;04&#x2F;enabling-3gb-switch-on-windows-vista.html">here</a>, reboot your machine and try to launch the app. If it doesn&#39;t work, reboot without the &#x2F;3GB switch (actually, from the depths of my memory I seem to recall that SQL server requires the &#x2F;3GB switch anyway)</li>
<li>the heap memory must be contiguous, as explained in one of the posts on stackoverflow. Install <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;technet.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;sysinternals&#x2F;bb896653">Process Explorer</a> to work out which applications, dlls, and drivers are not using your memory efficiently (are occupying the middle of the address space), and consider removing them </li>
<li>incrementally increase the Xmx value in <code>builder.py</code>, testing your app with each value, until you find the &quot;limit&quot; where the app stops working</li>
</ul>
<p>Not fun, admittedly, but interesting nonetheless! :)</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>No, the large amount of memory you have is a good thing; it&#39;s the way WinXP utilizes it that is bad. ;)<br>I haven&#39;t used Process Explorer for debugging this kind of issue before, but I read a post that said it would help to determine which software, services, drivers and dlls are residing <strong>in the middle</strong> of the memory rather than the edges. The reason why this is important is because heap space <strong>must</strong> be contiguous, ie located all together.</p>

										<p><p>Yeah, sorry what I was getting as was, I thought XP has certain issues when over 3GB is installed, ie. I wondered if the memory management would be better with 2GB.  But I guess if certain DLLs are set to use particular areas of memory then its going to use it anyway.</p>
<p>As you probably can tell I&#39;m a getting out of my depth hereâ¦ I downloaded Process Explorer (In fact I used it before around 12 months ago) but couldn&#39;t workout how I to determine what area of memory my DLLs are using, to determine what addresses to change to make a large enough contiguous block of available memory - and even if I could spot this, I&#39;m not sure how to change what area of memory certain DLLs use.</p>
<p>I even watched a 80min video&#x2F;speech of Mark Russinovich explaining debugging&#x2F;troubleshooting using Process Explorer called &#39;The Case of the Unexplained&#39;, but it didn&#39;t help!</p>
<p>Thanks for all your help though, I appriciate it.</p>

<p>I have just caught one of the leads on the android dev team on IRC, and he said this was an inherent problem with WinXP. </p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s a Microsoft issue, all dependent on what loads and where the OS puts it. The only solution, other than to upgrade to Windows 7, is to clean up the machine. It&#39;s amazing that 1GB was not available.&quot;</p>
<p>I have to agree. There are always ways that you can optimize Windows. As you have MS SQL Server installed, which is a server application, consider whether it is really needed, or whether an XP workstation is a suitable place to have it. Also, unload or remove any drivers that aren&#39;t absolutely necessary (you&#39;d be surprised how untested and inefficient a lot of drivers are). Especially look at resident programs (which sometimes load drivers when they start), because they are often only there to make the related software more responsive when you start them so serve provide limited value.</p>
<p>Again, good luck with it.</p>
<p>Would you close this question, so that others can find it if they have the same issue?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>Hi again, Jason. Despite what I said before, on further thought it is a really bad idea to modify the source code to workaround this issue, because it is likely to bring you other issues in the future that will be impossible to troubleshoot.</p>
<p>Your processor is 64bit, isn&#39;t it? I am sure you are aware that you are benefiting from only a fraction of its power by running 32bit XP, both in terms of memory management, memory limit (32bit XP can only provide 2GB in total to applications, and even some of that is wasted) and processor performance. Even 32bit Win7 would resolve your Titanium issues.</p>
<p>Failing this, you need to look at unnecessary drivers and memory-resident programs to prevent them from starting when you boot the machine (stopping them after boot may not be sufficient, because some may not be properly unloaded).</p>
<p>Good luck with it!  Please close the question, so that others can find it.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>Hi Paul.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve bit the bullet and purchased Windows 7 Pro, so will install the 64-bit version when it arrives next week.  So that should sort that out - hopefully I won&#39;t get problems with a bunch of other software! :-)  I think I might even get a Macbook too in the near future so I can simulate&#x2F;test&#x2F;debug my iPhone apps before forking out to join the Mac Developer Program.  I still cannot believe you have to be on that Program in order to put your own app on your own iPhone, simply fully to test it!</p>
<p>Thanks, Jason.</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s great, man!  I hope the potential benefits actually materialize. Certainly, Titanium will work, at the very least!  If you do get a mac, people say the development process is much quicker, because the simulator is so fast. Good luck with everything. Speak to you again in another thread! :)</p>
<p>You can <em>really</em> close the post now! ;)  &#x2F;wipes brow, after the mother of <strong>all</strong> threads</p>

<p>Make sure you have installed the 32bit (rather than 64bit) versions of python and SDK.</p>
<p>Please follow the instructions at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.appcelerator.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;installing_on_windows.html#install_diagnostics_for_windows">Install Diagnostics for Windows</a> and post the output to <strong>gist</strong> (not here, because it will reformat the text).</p>
<p>Do not edit the output in any way, as this may mask problems.</p>
<p>Then someone will be able to help you.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, use the &quot;Add Comment&quot; link to respond to answers, please, Jason.</p>
<p>Your configuration does indeed look ok. Did you install the Android SDK <strong>Platform-Tools</strong> package, and create the symbolic links for adb as explained in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.appcelerator.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;getting_started.html#preparing_for_android_development">Preparing for Android development</a>?</p>
<p>Please perform <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;104161&#x2F;31-to-42application-stopped-workin#184101">these steps</a> to clear the build files and force a rebuild, and try the app again.</p>
<p>If this does not fix it, please launch the app and then on the <strong>Run Emulator</strong> screen select the <code>trace</code> log and copy and pastebin&#x2F;gist the whole log please.</p>

										<p><p><strong>As your current user:</strong></p>
<p>Please stop the emulator and delete all the AVDs, as explained in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.appcelerator.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;getting_started.html#preparing_for_android_development">Preparing for Android development</a> (around the red box). </p>
<p>Note that <code>C:\Program Files\Development\Projects\</code> is not a good place to keep user files. For the purpose of troubleshooting this issue, create a <code>projects</code> directory on your desktop and create your projects in there.</p>
<p>Do you know why the word &quot;metalhead&quot; appears in your log? You haven&#39;t named your app, &quot;metalhead\testapp1&quot; have you? If so, the backslash will cause issues. Please use a simple name, ie testapp1.</p>
<p>&quot;[INFO] Tiapp.xml unchanged, skipping class generation&quot;</p>
<p>According to the above message in your log, the &quot;Save Changes&quot; button was not clicked after you deleted the build files and thus the <code>Tiapp.xml</code> file was not touched. Hence, please delete all your build files, press &quot;Save Changes&quot; to force a full rebuild and try again.</p>
<p><strong>If the above doesn&#39;t fix the issue:</strong></p>
<p>To rule out the possibility that the space in your user name is causing an issue, please create a new account (ie &quot;testuser&quot;, so with no space or special character), with administrative privileges. Log in with it, create a brand new default project and try to launch it.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>I deleted the AVDs.  Then I created a new project on in my Desktop directory, but I still got the same error.  In fact I got one additional error, which I remember getting the first time with my original project but wouldn&#39;t reappear after that:</p>

										<p><p>I always prefer not to reinstall everything just because there is a problem, because then you will never discover the cause and hence you risk not being able to resolve it when it happens again in future.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you reinstall, we would have to start the whole troubleshooting process from the beginning. :&#x2F;</p>
<p>I am almost certain that this is a configuration or environment, rather than a software, issue, so bear with me and I will suggest something for you to try.</p>

										<p><p>Jason, I&#39;ve had it in the past where the emulator has booted but the application hasn&#39;t installed and launched. Try launching the app 3 times, <strong>without</strong> closing the emulator window, just to make sure that the app won&#39;t launch. ie Click the launch app button, wait for a reasonable amount of time to allow the app to start and if it doesn&#39;t just press the launch button again (without clicking the save changes button or clearing out the build folders).</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m not sure what a &quot;reasonable amount of time&quot; is, but tried 3 times and left it 2mins between reclicking the Launch button, if that&#39;s long enough?  Nothing seemed to happen on subsequent clicks of the Launch button.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure if its significant, but the title of the emulator window is &#39;5560:titanium_6_WVGA800&#39; and I noticed the title of the window from the screenshot in the Window 7 docs is &#39;5560:titanium_7_WVGA800&#39;.</p>
<p>In the edit screen &#39;1.5.1&#39; is selected for the &#39;Titanium SDK&#39;, the only other option in the dropdown is &#39;1.2.0&#39;.</p>
<p>BTW, this may be what you&#39;d expect, but when you asked me to delete all the AVD&#39;s earlier, there were three AVD entries; I&#39;ve just rechecked and now there&#39;s just one (titanium_6_WVGA800).</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>You will have one AVD per Android SDK version that you have selected on the &quot;Run Emulator&quot; screen.</p>
<p>Probably you have chosen only &quot;APIs 2.2&quot; since you have cleared all the AVD entries, which is why you see only it&#39;s entry in the AVD Manager &quot;virtual devices&quot; screen.</p>

							<p>Yes I did install the Android SDK Platform-Tools package, however the <code>mklink</code> command wouldn&#39;t work (wasn&#39;t recognised) on my Windows XP PC so I just copied the files from <code>platform-tools</code> to <code>tools</code> as suggested in that doc.  Then I had to redo that because when I first loaded Titanium Developer it downloaded an update.</p>
<p>I followed the steps for deleting, saving, and rebuilding, but didn&#39;t make any difference.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve created a <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;802452">gist URL containing the trace</a> as requested.  Hopefully it helps. :)</p>
