		<section>
			<p>Hello</p>
<p>I got stuck in the process, can anyone tell me how I have to continue?</p>
<p>I have tried to package my application with titanium by using the &#39;distribute&#39; tab under &#39;test and package&#39;.</p>
<p>However it didn&#39;t create a file in the directory I entered. Now I went to my x-code and saw I had to validate my app there. So I went to itunesconnect, entered my app there, went back to x-code, clicked on &#39;validate&#39;, entered my itunes account and it gives an error saying :</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">No eligible applications were found

To submit <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> validate an <span class="hljs-type">application</span>, you must <span class="hljs-keyword">first</span> <span class="hljs-command">log</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> iTunes Connect 
<span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> provide information <span class="hljs-keyword">about</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> <span class="hljs-type">application</span> you will be adding.
</code></pre><p>But I have already done that, my app is there.</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me what I have to do now to upload my app to the store?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

										<p><p>I have followed the video provided by Titanium (is a year old now, so i think it&#39;s outdated). When the person in the video packages the app, it shows up in the folder he has given up. When I to the exact same thing xCode opens, and nothing is in that folder..</p>

										<p><p>which is why you have to follow the guides from apple, titanium is outdated in that part.</p>
<p>Do the process again only then follow the guides from apple. I went through them a few days ago, to see what im up against. Try it</p>

										<p><p>Hi, thanks for the answer,</p>
<p>I have already seen the video, but I think it&#39;s outdated. The steps aren&#39;t the same as itunesconnect is now.</p>

							<p>What is the version of your xcode? I know of at least one version that will reject your app when submitting because there is a SPACE character in your App Bundle Name.</p>

							<p>When you package the app, it automatically shows up in the Archive portion of the XCode Organizer. From there you can validate it, but you you need to have a record for the app in iTunes Connect first and its status must be Ready to Upload Binary.</p>
