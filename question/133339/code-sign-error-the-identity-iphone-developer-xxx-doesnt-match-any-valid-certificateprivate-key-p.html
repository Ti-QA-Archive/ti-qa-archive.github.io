			<h1>Code Sign error: The identity &#39;iPhone Developer: xxx&#39; doesn&#39;t match any valid certificate/private key p</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>When I try to compile my iPad app against iPad device (works fine in Simulator), I keep getting this error: </p>
<p>Code Sign error: The identity &#39;iPhone Developer: xxx&#39; doesn&#39;t match any valid certificate&#x2F;private key pair in the default keychain</p>
<p>The &quot;xxx&quot; is just me obfuscating the name of the developer that appears there. I was getting this error 3 hours ago, so I went back, deleted certs and profiles, etc, and redid the whole thing. Now I&#39;m back to this same error. How do I resolve this?</p>

							<div><p>That&#39;s what I was talking about. Provisioning profile which you are using in project should be valid and it should be visible as valid profile in your organizer or keychain access. Than after you just have to upload that profile in your Titanium. It should work.</p>

<p>Also you should examine the profiles in the XCode organizer with the device attached.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ve tweaked around with profiles, deleted and recreated them. I may be 1 step closer. Now I&#39;m getting &quot;Code Sign error: Provisioning profile &#39;ED0C1244-B77A-426B-A310-6874D7F89535&#39; can&#39;t be found&quot;. Previous to this I got a similar error, but the error stated a specific folder path where it couldn&#39;t find that file. So I copied a known good .mobileprovision file to that location and renamed to what it was looking for. Which was ED0C1244-B77A-426B-A310-6874D7F89535.mobileprovision. Now it gives the error I just mentioned without a path. How can I fix this?</p>

										<p><p>First, clean the project. Then rebuild, but don&#39;t just let the Titanium Studio use the drop-down for your mobile provisioning cert, actually use the folder icon and re-pick and re-upload it.  You should never need to copy it over manually.</p>

							<p>I went through 6 hours of hell to get this working, but it finally did. I don&#39;t know what exactly I did to fix it, but probably a combo of things. Also I created a new project and moved my files over. I deleted and re-created profiles and certs dozens of times.</p>
<p>It would be awesome if Appcelerator would create a troubleshooting tool to help developers identify what&#39;s blocking an app from deploying to a physical device.</p>
