			<h1>Titanium deleting my files without my permissions(android)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, Today I faced very strange behavior of titanium sdk. I am developing android application. my titanium work-space containing more than 25 demo projects. Suddenly when I tried to run my application it gives me error <strong>the selection can not be launched and there are no recent launches</strong>. I checked my project in project explore but tiapp.xml was missing. At that time I thought by mistake I deleted that file.</p>
<p>Now I moved on another project after doing some coding and testing I tried to run it but it gives me same error. and again tiapp.xml file was missing and this time it is headache to me to regenerate same tiapp.xml file again……   after regenerating that file and after few build its working fine. But again after few times I realize one of my code file also missing ……</p>
<p>currently I am trying to implement gcm inside project. I am including external module inside my project and its working fine without giving error. Why this happening so??????  Some time I am deleting build folder before executing my code. Is there any issue regarding sdk or I am doing some thing wrong because of which it&#39;s deleting my file…</p>
<p>Need help… Thank you…..</p>
