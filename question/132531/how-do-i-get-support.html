			<p>I&#39;ve asked my problem to the community but haven&#39;t received an answer. I&#39;ve ask for a subscription plan (enterprise) but haven&#39;t received an answer. How do I get support from the Titanium developers? Any ideas?</p>

							<p>There are also many developers like myself, Trevor Ward and many others who do freelance work to do things like code reviews and even training.</p>
<p>Trevor and I are both Appcelerator Titans, and can provide great insight to app development and debugging of issues on a level Appcelerator normally wont touch (they dont like doing things like code reviews).</p>
<p>On the flip side, Appcelerstor support will help you out more when you have real Titanium platform bugs when you need priority support on getting bugs fixed in the SDK itself</p>

										<p><p>Just out of curiosity, what sort of price&#x2F;hourly rate do you charge for a code review? It would be something I would consider before releasing an app to the app store. I think having some pro feedback would be good for the app and great for learning what I could do better next time.</p>

										<p><p>My rate is $100USD an hour with a commitment of at least 10 hours, or $150 an hour for no time commitment.</p>
<p>An average full review of an app takes anywhere from 8-10 hours… for more complicated apps it can take longer.</p>

										<p><p>Well, if you pay for subscription, you will certainly get an answer.</p>
<p>That is not required, many people here received help for free from community members. You need to have in mind that our time (and will) is limited and that we can&#39;t answer any question. If question is asked in right way, then it has good chances of being answered.</p>

										<p><p>I 100% agree… if you you have an issue that can be quantified on the Q&amp;A then there are many members who do all they can to answer as many questions as they can… however like Ivan said… community help is free help so the better you can ask the question the better answers you will get :)</p>
