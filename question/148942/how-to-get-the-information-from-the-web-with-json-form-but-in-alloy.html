							<div><p>Hello Mahmoud,</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll agree, that your question doesn&#39;t gives us much to work with. I strongly suggest you have a look at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;ask">the guidelines to follow</a> when asking a question.</p>
<p>Also, please include some code detailing what you are trying to achieve. This will give everyone a better understanding of the problem you are facing.</p>
<p>Simply asking for an entire solution without having experienced it yourself seems counter-productive.</p>

							<div><p>To continue what Christian said, you&#39;ve asked a number of extremely vague questions asking for full solutions over the past few days. This community has no problem helping out developers, but no one is going to write your app for you. You need to try to solve your problem first, THEN come to the Q&amp;A and ask specific questions about your code. You can also ask high level questions here, but expect high level answers in return.</p>
