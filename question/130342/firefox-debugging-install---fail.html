			<h1>Firefox debugging install - fail</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I received the prompt to install Firefox for debugging so I clicked on [Download].  After a few seconds it returned a dialog that it had been &quot;installed&quot; but then it just resulted in a web page coming up to install Aptana Studio 3.  So (knowing that Titanium used to be Aptana and thinking I really didn&#39;t need this) I downloaded it and installed it to another folder.  But Titanium still thought the firefox debugging extension isn&#39;t installed.  So I uninstalled Aptana Studio 3 and then tried to &quot;Install new software&quot; from within Titanium from &quot;Aptana Studio 3 Update Site - http:&#x2F;&#x2F;download.aptana.com&#x2F;studio3&#x2F;plugin&#x2F;update&#x2F;&quot;, selected the &quot;plugin&quot; and clicked [Next] but it says a newer version is already installed.</p>
<p>I was surprised that it never asked me to install Firefox because I didn&#39;t have it installed.  I went ahead and downloaded Firefox (9.x) but it still isn&#39;t recognizing it.  Then, when it again prompted me to get the debugger, I clicked [Check Again] and this time it went to the &quot;debugger configurations&quot; window and it pre-populated the location.  But when I click [Debug] it just brings up the &quot;Download Aptana studio 3&quot; page in a firefox browser.</p>
<p>Ideas?</p>
