			<p>I was surprised to see that there was no sessions in codestrong about testing your applications there is definitely no real in depth example apps out there that have any tests; especially no example apps from titans. Does anyone find this a little strange?</p>
<p>So I will endeavour to hunt to see what I can do; but not having tests is like coding in the 90s; cutting edge tech from appcelerator cool; no testing thats just poo;</p>

							<p>Yeah I agree with you that titanium haven&#39;t provide debugging feature in titanium studio for community user . This is only available for indie and enterprise users .<br>If we want to do debugging and testing best way is to use   Ti.API.info and alert at each points to check output.</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s not true. Debug mode is also available in community version.</p>
<p>First release was only available for some clients, but this changed a few weeks after.</p>

										<p><p>debugging is debugging; testing is testing; different worlds one is for fixing bugs and seeing what is going on in your app; the other is making assumptions about ur application and then running your test to see if its true; but I might be coming from a different universe</p>
