			<h1>Is appcelerator using poor support to push people toward subscriptions?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve been using Titanium Mobile for the last 6 months or so, and over that course I&#39;ve asked 3 questions in the Q&amp;A system… none of which have been resolved. The best I&#39;ve received is a follow up question, but after responding I receive no further response.</p>
<p>I would expect developers using community support to still receive a certain level of support from appcelerator, after all we have invested a lot of time in the appcelerator platform and it seems discourteous to just ignore us because we&#39;re not yet paying customers… and if the level of support is so bad, perhaps never will be.</p>
<p>The tickets to which I refer:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;117106&#x2F;double-tap-to-zoom-scrollview-at-point-of-doubletap">Double-tap to zoom Scrollview at point of doubletap</a></li>

							<p>Kelvin: Actually you should probably tone down the rhetoric a bit. If you paid any attention you&#39;ll notice that we&#39;ve clearly stated </p>
<p>&quot;This is a community forum. This is not a dedicated support channel.&quot;</p>
<p>Now having said that my team does answer questions here, but this isn&#39;t our only job. This forum exists for the community to help the community not for us to help YOU specifically. </p>
<p>If you have questions in regards to that or need any more clarification then by all means please do email me at tguntharp@appcelerator.com</p>

<p>My apologies for the delay; I have posted a response to each of your three questions. Thank you for bringing the Analytics issues to our attention. I will investigate it today, and report back when I have some information.</p>
<p>I&#39;d appreciate your patience in the meantime.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

							<p>IMHO, the phrase &quot;poor support&quot; needs to be put in context.  Put bluntly, at the free level there is NO guaranteed support from Appcelerator staff, period.  But neither are you paying for access to the tools.  You do have access to this <strong>community</strong> based Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>Even though there is no guaranteed support, if you take the sidebar link for the top 100 most active Q&amp;A members, 5 of the top 10 are Appcelerator employees and 17 of the top 100.  Collectively, by some quick math that adds up to nearly 95,000 &quot;points&quot; between them.  Moverover, the level of participation by Appcelerator staff has gone up significantly in the last few months, according to my casual observation anyway.</p>
<p>So if anything I would say they are providing <strong>MORE</strong> support than promised for community members.</p>
<p>That said, I also agree with a previous poster that suggested the volume of questions here could be greatly reduced if the documentation was better.  I also think they are working toward that goal.</p>
<p>Do I find it frustrating sometimes?  By all means a resounding YES.  Do I think it is their obligation to provide free answers?  No, as much as in a perfect world that would be ideal.</p>
<p>Might providing more &quot;free&quot; answers help them garner market share, or keep people on board who experiment with Appcelerator?  As an outsider it is certainly easy to say Yes.  My gut reaction is that is precisely why they have 95000 points among the staff members, and have 5 of the 10 most active members.  But that is just my SWAG as an outside developer myself.</p>

<p>Completely not true, 3 out of the 5 have joined Appcelerator in the last 8 months. Matt Apperson at #7 on the top ten joined Appcelerator on May 16th, 2011, before he joined he had 341 points. He&#39;s earned 5,700 points in about 7 weeks because he&#39;s in here 3-5 hours a day, 5 days a week.</p>

										<p><p>Yea srry i assumed that, just looked the join dates. But never the less, you appcelerator guys do know alot more about Titanium then us from the community. Compared to my 2 years of college experience in ict, im nobody.</p>
<p>Also ppl mark appcelerator staff awnsers alot faster then others.<br>But those who joined later on, especially the number uno, they are doing their best on the Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>Give matt a well deserved vacation, those stats are impressive.</p>

							<p>Could support be better?  Sure.  But there&#39;s already a wealth of stuff available between the kitchen sink + tweetanium + struct examples that you should be able to figure out just about everything.  The support isn&#39;t the issue; it&#39;s the documentation that needs fixed.  If doc was better (which it seems they&#39;re redoing at the moment) there wouldn&#39;t be NEARLY as many questions in Q+A.  Or, at least we&#39;d be able to say &quot;go read the docs!&quot; but we can&#39;t do that since they&#39;re meager <strong>at best</strong>.</p>
<p>When you consider how poorly worded most Q+A posts are and how little code is posted, there&#39;s not much the small support team can do.  Couple that on with the fact that <strong>anyone</strong> who knows javascript can at least get started with Titanium, you&#39;ve got all kinds of people (with varying degrees of skill in English) posting questions on how they think things <strong>should</strong> work.  A lot of these people (myself included, admittedly) have little to no prior mobile development experience.  They may have used an iPhone, iPad, or Android device, but they&#39;ve never written a lick of native code.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Andrew.</p>
<p>I think many people here comes with experience in web development, so you should consider that experience (with JavaScript in DOM environment) and not (only) experience with native mobile applications. Bearing that in mind, I for example, ask about functionality that differs from functionality that I&#39;m used to.</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s a really good point, Andrew. I do think there&#39;s an issue with support, but better docs would help a lot.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t seen a project yet that uses API documentation to any great effect, apart from jQuery possibly. It can be helpful, but not as helpful as the docs you find on php.net, for example.</p>

							<p>While i do agree that the support on the Q&amp;A can be alot better, its called a community Q&amp;A for a reason.</p>
<p>You can also contact some one with the devLink, send a mail with your problem to a few who might be able to solve it or push you into the right direction.</p>
<p>Fyi, i am developing using titanium appcelerator since januari&#x2F;februari, w&#x2F;out any payment to appcelerator. So i&#39;m in the same situation as you are.</p>

										<p><p>But is it good enough for Appcelerator to leave developers high and dry? Am I expected to hunt for people who may or may not be able to help me, who may or may not even work for Appcelerator? DevLink doesn&#39;t make it clear… I would even consider using DevLink it&#39;s such a poorly thrown together product.</p>
<p>And as to the point about payment: we&#39;ve all paid in kind. We&#39;ve invested a lot of time learning the platform and using the platform in client projects. That is of direct benefit to Appcelerator.</p>

										<p><p>Same here, we might start developing apps for our clients, but it will be under our licenses etc… this will not help appcelerator at all.</p>
<p>But is it good enought to leave us dry, no, not at all. They should drop the Q&amp;A and create a forum instead. Would be a big step forwards.</p>
<p>And see it like this, as i said in another Q&amp;A, the points where its lacking for free user made me a better programmer. </p>
<p>Also you can create free apps in titanium, while others are depending on their paid subscriptions. Im better off then they are. </p>
<p>But all of this does not change the fact that free titanium developers are left in the dark many times…</p>

										<p><p>How is it obvious?</p>
<p>Do you what seems obvious to me? </p>
<ul>
<li>You build a platform. </li>
<li>You support everyone who uses that platform to the best of your abilities.</li>
<li>You sell support with an SLA and premium add-ons to monetise the platform</li>
</ul>
<p>NB: I didn&#39;t mention anything about crappy support?</p>

										<p><p>Obvious is that they need this subscriptions. Appcelerator is VC backed company so they need to make profit. Premium add-ons are not profitable as subscriptions and they just have to force users to buy premium support.</p>
<p>Most companies which offer their products for free and then profit from support are working like that and a lot of users complaints about this.</p>

										<p><p>agreed to the last comment, if users like us are &quot;ignored&quot; then it can go 2 ways, either a subscription or none at all.</p>
<p>By getting a subscription doesnt give me the idea that its going to get better.</p>
<p>Adding premium support to indie would allready result in alot more subscriptions</p>

							<p>Maybe, maybe not. Although, I got same impression. :)</p>
<p>I don&#39;t like the fact that some valid bugs reported by the community are ignored. IMHO, that shouldn&#39;t be part of payed support.<br>Also, documentation shouldn&#39;t suffer because they have payed support.</p>
<p>As for community support, I think many problems here can&#39;t be solved because they are poorly explained and they lack minimal examples that reproduces the problem (I know sometimes it&#39;s hard to minimize problem to few line of code).<br>Problems that have good explanation are mainly solved (and few people from Appcelerator are of great help here).</p>
<p>I know they need to make money somehow, but I think this way they&#39;ll push people back to Java and Objective-C (because of above mentioned reasons - bad basic support, lack of product quality, bad attitude, …).</p>

<p>We believe well-defined reports of bugs created by Community members are essential to Titanium&#39;s success. If you have found a bug, then please follow the guidelines at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Contributing+to+Titanium#ContributingtoTitanium-SubmittingBugReports">Submitting Bug Reports</a>, and specifically the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Contributing+to+Titanium#ContributingtoTitanium-Summary%3AJiraTicketChecklist">Jira Ticket Checklist</a>, when raising tickets in the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC">Titanium (Community) (TC)</a> project.

										<p><p>Hi Paul.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve reported issues TC-50 and TC-51. They&#39;ve just disappeared after few days and have not been resolved (if I&#39;ve done something wrong&#x2F;haven&#39;t explained well, you could say that, so I can fix my report, erasing ticket is not right solution). They are not new issues, they are well known issues with provided solutions&#x2F;workarounds by the community.</p>
<p>First problem:<br><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;88891&#x2F;titaniumxml-undefined-on-android">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;88891&#x2F;titaniumxml-undefined-on-android</a><br><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;117751&#x2F;cannot-call-method-parsestring-of-undefined-please-help">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;117751&#x2F;cannot-call-method-parsestring-of-undefined-please-help</a><br>Second problem:<br><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC-113">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC-113</a></p>
<p>Now, if you say that you care about bugs reported by the community, why these trivial issues haven&#39;t been solved in months?</p>

<p>We don&#39;t delete any tickets. Please insure that redirection has not been disabled in your browser, and then check <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC-50">TC-50</a> and <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC-51">TC-51</a> again. If they had been closed, a reason would have been stated. As it is, they are good tickets, especially TC-50 as I have stated in my comments.</p>
<p>I understand what you mean; I too could list a set of bugs that I feel are crucial and need to be fixed without delay, as soon as possible and not a moment too soon. That&#39;s until I speak to the core team, and appreciate the tremendous pressures they are under, the workload they have to juggle and the diplomacy they must employ to reach fair bug priorities, all the while having the same objectives as you and I; to see Titanium as stable and featureful as it possibly can be. They are a finite resource that is governed by the finances of the company and, although I appreciate it may be frustrating, I can&#39;t think of a way that it could be any different.</p>
<p>Regarding the issues in the links, the 7 month old question related to 1.5 rather than the latest release. Doug Handy kindly helped the user find a workaround for the 4 month old question. With both of these, if the bugs do indeed still exist, you are welcome to create tickets for them in the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC">Titanium Community TC</a> Jira project, after reading the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Contributing+to+Titanium#ContributingtoTitanium-SubmittingBugReports">Submitting Bug Reports</a> guide, and then watch them to show your support for their resolution.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

										<p><p>Hi Paul.</p>
<p>Thanks for your answer.<br>As for TC-50 and TC-51, redirection is not disabled in my browser - I&#39;m redirected to other tickets (TIMOB-4371 and TISTUD-432). I could read them several days after I created them. That&#39;s strange because they are only tickets that are redirecting me to other tickets (I&#39;ll check with my system administrator if he&#39;s messed up something in firewall) and that&#39;s why I thought they were deleted.<br>As for other part of your comment, I&#39;m glad to see you understand me (and other developers that are in similar situation). I hope things will change in the future. Maybe Titanium management team should redefine their priorities, sometimes you need to stop developing new features and put bug fixes as top priority.</p>

<p>Would you mind reading <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Contributing+to+Titanium#ContributingtoTitanium-TheBugReportingLifecycle">The Bug-Reporting Lifecycle</a>, which explains how to establish whether a bug has already been reported and, if not, what to do in order to turn your suspicions into a well-defined ticket?</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

							<p>Hi Kelvin,</p>
<p>the first and most important question is: Are you making money or even making a living with building apps? Cause if you&#39;re going to make money, you should consider getting a subscription.</p>
<p>Apart from that there&#39;s also another option: The good old phone. Just call Appcelerator directly and you&#39;ll be connected with a technical person who&#39;s responsible for your region. Then you could send him an email with your technical questions, which are sufficient for the decision whether you&#39;ll pay for a subscription or have to switch to native development.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re not willing to pay for anything, you&#39;ll have to take what you get. Just as if you were developing on iOS natively, where you depend on forums and guys hopefully giving you good answers.</p>
<p>There are also IRC channels with good developers and external pages about appcelerator stuff. And the Twitter account&#39;s also frequently used for technical stuff.</p>

										<p><p>IMHO, everybody here are making money somehow (or at least are trying), but that doesn&#39;t mean everybody should pay for product that declares itself as &quot;free and open source&quot;.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Ivan,</p>
<p>you get a lot for free. In fact, I successfully created half a dozen professional apps for clients without paying anything. Personally, I think the documentation on this page is not that bad. I use the APIs almost every day, the wiki and tutorials are also very good as well as the example code we get from tweetanium and that stuff.<br>Then there are IRC channels with very helpful developers and here in Q&amp;A you also frequently get good answers if you are polite and your problem is described concretely with good example code.<br>If you develop natively for iOS (which I also do) you run into similar problems…there are also the little details you won&#39;t find that many answers to in the forums or the documentation by Apple. Of course the docs are more extensive, but the fine details and special use cases are always complicated, whether it&#39;s Obj-C, Java or Appcelerator javascript.<br>With Obj-C you have to consult forums and hope for answers, in the past also some hidden tricks with unofficial APIs and that kind of things….</p>
<p>So personally, I think you get a lot of good information for free on this site and also other sites about Appcelerator.</p>

										<p><p>Ahhh, the usual argument to poor support.</p>
<p>You are basing your argument on the fact that I&#39;m a tight arse who doesn&#39;t want to pay for anything. You&#39;re incorrect, although I won&#39;t pay for something without being completely sure that it will be valuable. Based on my experience of support from Appcelerator… I see no reason why I should fork money for the level of support I see they give, which is VERY low.</p>
<p>But just to re-iterate my point in an earlier comment. I have invested A LOT of time learning Titanium Mobile. If I could put a price on it, it would run into many thousands of pounds. An this is of direct benefit to Appcelerator… for people who develop platforms NEED developers to build on that platform, to create an ecosystem in which they can profit.</p>

										<p><p>The argument that you get all this for free is utterly false. You invest time and effort and that comes at a cost, and if you&#39;re unable to get any kind of support then that cost can be quite big.</p>
<p>Take for example my question about a published app not showing up in my apps. Appcelerator offer free stats on my apps as part of my community membership. This is part of the contract between us in me deciding to build in Titanium. If my app doesn&#39;t show up, and nobody can be bothered to look into it, where does that leave me? With a client who has expected something that I can&#39;t deliver and with no explanation, that&#39;s where. Is that good, what I got for &quot;free&quot;?</p>

										<p><p>If you&#39;d read my post correctly, you&#39;d see that I don&#39;t defend poor support. Instead I say &quot;the support is better than you say&quot;. Go on the twitter account for example. There are several technical detailed questions which are being answered for free…they&#39;re told to write an email to a certain address and their question will be answered by the staff. A service usually only premium customers get.<br>And as I wrote above, if you&#39;d get in contact with the team by phone, you&#39;d certainly also get a personal response to your problems….<br>you only have to pick up the phone and talk with the guys.</p>
