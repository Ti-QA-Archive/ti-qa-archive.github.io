			<h1>(solution) Android slow to render views?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Just wanted to share the solution to a problem I was having in case anybody else ran into the same wall. There are a few posts here that talk about Android running slowly. My own app was victim to the same defect. After probably a week of trying to refactor my code to improve the performance, I finally realized the incredibly obvious solution.</p>
<p>The images I was displaying in my views were too large. Funnily enough, iOS can render them much faster than Android. But yeah, if your views are taking forever to render on Android, first thing I&#39;d check from now on is the ORIGINAL RESOLUTION of the image you&#39;re trying to load. Chances are, it can be shrunk.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t mean to spam a meaningless question, but I didn&#39;t really find this anywhere online when I was trying to find a cause for Android lag. I&#39;m pretty sure someone else will run into this down the line and though its an obvious solution now, it certainly wasn&#39;t during debugging.</p>

							<div><p>Thank you. I too have noticed terrible lag, and will try to optimize my images further. As you say, my apps run beautifully on iOS, with no lag, no loading time, no slow rendering - it&#39;s just smooth sailling. And then I install on Android only to see my apps become to the point of unusable.</p>

							<p>Just wanted to add to this, in case anyone else stumbles over it:</p>
<p>Android apps made with Titanium get significantly faster if you enable hardware acceleration via tiapp.xml.<br>It requires &gt;= Android API level 11 though, so the older devices won&#39;t benefit from this.</p>
