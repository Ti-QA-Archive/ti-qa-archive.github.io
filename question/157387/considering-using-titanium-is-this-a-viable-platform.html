		<section>
			<p>Hi guys</p>
<p>After seeing Gartner&#39;s magic quadrant report for mobile app development platforms, we&#39;re leaning toward doing a proof of concept app using Titanium.  Everything I&#39;ve read so far seems favourable.  The problems I have been able to Google mostly date back to 2011 articles and forums.  These include things like:</p>
<p>•    Random crashes due to memory leaks</p>
<p>•    Difficult aligning GUI elements on screen</p>
<p>•    Focus event called repeatedly on specific devices</p>
<p>•    Poor documentation</p>
<p>•    Large binaries</p>
<p>•    Slow performance</p>
<p>In addition to this, I notice that many of the apps listed on their App Showcase page are only available for iOS.  As Android is the most popular OS, I can only assume these showcased apps weren’t published for Android due to some difficulties in getting a stable build.</p>
<p>I don’t know if these issues persist today so was hoping to get some feedback from developers currently working with Titanium and see if they would recommend or not.</p>
<p>Tks</p>

							<div><p>Hello,</p>
<p>disclosure: I work for Appcelerator. This is my personal opinion, and has nothing to do with my employer. </p>
<p><strong>Time warp</strong> – before working for Appcelerator</p>
<p>Being said that, before I knew Titanium (2009?), we were creating native mobile apps. We were having trouble to develop apps as fast as the customer required them, so we were able to produce less apps than we needed to (we were an only iOS little shop). </p>
<p>Once we found Titanium, there was a lot of changes in our methods to create apps. If we were having small apps, we just did it in Titanium, since it was A LOT faster than in native. And we did  start creating android apps as well! </p>
<p>Then, Appcelerator hired me. </p>
<p><strong>Time warp here</strong> </p>
<p>Nowdays, I see some BIG companies using Titanium for all kind of apps (either for internal and external usage), supporting either Android, iOS or mobile web (covering Blackberry OS and Windows Phone via mobile web) and they save a bunch of time. Not all the apps should be made in Titanium: some of them need really fine tuning, so you do it in native (or create a module). </p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro</p>

							<p>Titanium has improved a lot in the past couple of years especially for Android and the best is yet to come.</p>
<p>I have been using it for my clients for a couple of years now and I heard mostly positive feedback. Of course development is not easy and you&#39;ll face a lot of unfavorable surprises but once you master it you&#39;ll find your way through. Using Alloy MVC framework and CommonJS module specs will make it even easier for you and will drive down the possibility of memory leaks, and the XML and TSS syntax is familiar to web developers. When it comes to image intensive apps on android, large heap is your friend.<br>The other great thing about Titanium is the supportive community. Ask clear questions, add enough source code and feel the love.</p>

										<p><p>Tks Hani.  Helpful comments.  We&#39;ve adopted the MVC framework for all our web projects, so Alloy certainly looks familiar and a good approach.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve read in earlier posts that adopting the Tweetanium-like single app context model is the preferred way to handle memory leaks.  Is this still true today or does MVC trump this?</p>

										<p><p>Tweetanium uses and old coding style. This was valid three years ago but not anymore. If you need an alternative to Alloy you can use CommonJS. Info about it and about other good coding practices can be found here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Best_Practices_and_Recommendations</p>

							<p>If your going to do application development for android and ios then i would recommend using this. You do need to know how each platform works though and understand the rules for each platform. No IDE has a magic wand to just make things work the same. IOS with ios7 is now getting as strict as android as far as what it likes and doesn&#39;t like. </p>
<p>If your looking between this and some phonegap approach because your people are more webdesigners then you might as well go with this… you can still do html5 frontends and communicate to &quot;native&quot; calls through titanium with the web view….you can extend whats titanium has to offer with native modules…and its free…</p>

										<p><p>Tks Anthony.  Yes, we&#39;re targeting iOS, Android, and BB (I work just about 30 minutes from RIM head offices in Waterloo, Ontario, so there&#39;s lots of pressure to hit that platform as well).</p>
<p>I&#39;m familiar with Android development, but have never looked at the iOS framework.  The allure of Titanium for a small group of developers like ourselves is the cross platform nature of the tool set.  When you say you need to know how each plaftorm works, are you talking about a high level familiarity or do I really need to invest the time in learning iOS to successfully write my Titanium apps for the Apple platform?</p>

										<p><p>No but you should have a basic knowledge of how android and ios are differant. For example IOS uses navigation groups (getting phased out) while android uses heavyweight and light weight windows to deal with navigation. When you start designing don&#39;t focus on just one platform switch back and forth after you build a screen to make sure it works the same on both platforms.</p>

							<p><strong>• Random crashes due to memory leaks</strong></p>
<p>Crappy programming results in crappy memory management.</p>
<p><strong>• Difficult aligning GUI elements on screen</strong></p>
<p>You can place any object pixel by pixel.</p>
<p><strong>• Focus event called repeatedly on specific devices</strong></p>
<p>Cannot answer as &#39;specific devices&#39; is generic.  </p>
<p><strong>• Poor documentation</strong></p>
<p>This rumor has got to freaking die a painful, horrible death.  As dev who has been using Titanium for over 3 years, I don&#39;t want to even hear from new folks complaining about documentation.  Yea, it was horrible in 2010-2011, because the engineers were building out the framework, not writing documentation.  In 2011-2012 a change in best practice occurred, leaving some outdated docs floating around. Its 2013, the docs are not perfect, but definitely not lacking.</p>
<p><strong>• Large binaries</strong></p>
<p>At the moment, your ipa or apk contains a javascript engine.  This is due to restrictions of the target platforms.  At one point, for compatibility, on android, two javascript engines were packaged.  This could very well be changing in the next 6 months.</p>
<p><strong>• Slow performance</strong></p>
<p>Other than tableviews (and listviews resolves a bunch of this) this is another lie&#x2F;myth that needs to die.  Write good code, get good results.</p>

										<p><p>Tks Stephen.  For the record, asking if documentation is an issue isn&#39;t the same as complaining :). I&#39;m just regurgitating what I read on other forums and seeing if the consensus is still the same today.  As I mentioned in my initial post, this will be our first proof of concept and I&#39;m trying to ensure our efforts aren&#39;t wasted.  Many posts mention encountering issues with Titanium that eventually lead the developer to abandon the project and re-write in Native.  Personally I like what I&#39;ve seen so far and am excited to pursue, but have to do my due diligence first.</p>
