			<h1>How to manage Custom map for some shopping center in titanium</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello.. I want to develop a custom map for some shopping center. Can someone suggest, how I can manage that? I don&#39;t think it is possible in titanium and after the custom map I want to pin the position of items in the shelf. Suggestions required if it is possible.. :) Thank you in advance</p>

							<div><p>Hello,</p>
<p>how will you manage the gps reference here? Most of the time you won&#39;t have GPS service inside the store (I mean, not even in native level).</p>
<p>You can easily put sections of the store as clickable images, and you can have a search funcionality that can relate items with sections of the store. The only problem: how do you manage to know where you are in the store?</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro</p>

							<div><p>Zain,</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll agree, that your question doesn&#39;t gives us much to work with. I strongly suggest you have a look at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;ask">the guidelines to follow</a> when asking a question.</p>
<p>Also, please include some code detailing what you are trying to achieve. This will give everyone a better understanding of the problem you are facing.</p>
<p>Simply asking for an entire solution without having experienced it yourself seems counter-productive.</p>
