			<h1>Best practices for event listeners, using views as backgrounds, views without focus/off screen and requires, hide or remove/add?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>These questions are aimed at helping with lagging animation on Android.</p>
<p>Question 1:<br>My app requires 45 events are listened for. I have moved them all into one listener with a very long switch&#x2F;case so as to cut down on the number of listeners, some cases with if&#x2F;else ifs in them. Is this efficient or would 45 listeners be faster?</p>
<p>Question 2:<br>I have fashioned a tabGroup of a window with three views, two lists and a table, because it greatly improved animation on Android. I am currently animating one view off and the next on screen at the same time, turning off the touchEnabled and visible properties of the views off screen when animation completes. (hide&#x2F;show was causing unexpected results with animation). For sake of animation is this adequate enough or would it help animation to remove these lists and tables and adding them back as needed? One list has 1000 items, the others much lighter. </p>
<p>Question 3:<br>I have remedied the animation issue that occurs in windows that have borders not working correctly when animated by using a view with a backgroundColor, border and opacity as a background, placed inside of the window to be animated because I can scale them without losing quality. It solves the problem but wondering if an image, or imageview might be faster.</p>
<p>Question 4:<br>I am requiring module.exports in app.js and once again turning off the touchEnabled and visible properties of the views when off screen because hide&#x2F;show was sometimes causing unexpected results with animation. There are almost 20 of them in a window layer that I use as an overlay for forms, custom alerts and such, so as to block interaction with the tabGroup and it&#39;s views without constantly switching them on and off. Would it help animation to remove and add views as needed? Would it help animation to set the tabGroup and it&#39;s views touchEnabled property to false?</p>
