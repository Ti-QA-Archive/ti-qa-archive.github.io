			<h1>iOS5 app performance - iPhone 3GS</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m developing an app and after upgrading my 3GS device to iOS5, the app performs teribbly. Simply opening new views is visibly sluggish. Searching my database is also painfully slow. Am I missing something here?</p>

							<div><p>Cool, so profile it inside the emulator, or on the device? Do you have a link for some help on how to do that? The bit I don&#39;t quite get is that everything seems to run slowly.. not just a single aspect but the whole thing.</p>

							<p>Well, I figured it out. Turned out my database, which I bundle with my app and contains about 45000 rows, had no indexes and as a result of some changes I had made (I think I added a sort clause), it started to crawl. Adding some indexes to the db sorted it out and the app now runs fast. Yay.</p>
