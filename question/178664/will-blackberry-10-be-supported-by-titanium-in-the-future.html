							<p>I don&#39;t work for Appcelerator, so take this answer as you will.</p>
<p>As of now, BlackBerry support is not deprecated, so I believe the official answer is &quot;continue&quot;.</p>
<p>As a developer, I think BlackBerry as a mobile OS is on borrowed time.</p>

										<p><p>I wonder if there is any official statement anywhere…? I would love to develop a BB 10 app to learn the specifics of the platform, but if BB 10 support does not have any future, I can spare the efforts. Anyway, thanks for your reply!</p>

							<p>BlackBerry as a mobile platform is alive and kicking.  Whether Appcelerator continues to support BB10 is really their call.  Cordova appears to be a more active participant in the BlackBerry space along with the other platforms, so that might be a safer route to go.</p>

										<p><p>I started developing the App with Titanium and it&#39;s quite hard since a lot of stuff doesn&#39;t work as it should. So far I could find workarounds for all issues, and the most important stuff like HTTP and database functions are working fine. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, I&#39;m looking and BlackBerry WebWorks, too - mostly because there is no official statement from Appcelerator.</p>
