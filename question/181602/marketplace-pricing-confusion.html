			<p>Hi</p>
<p>I&#39;ve a doubt about how marketplace pricing works.<br>If I buy only one &quot;per-seat&quot; module and I share my account with 2 developers, they can use that module without problem?</p>
<p>Also, when I buy a &quot;per-seat&quot; module, is it added to my account forever?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>If you are buying a module that is priced per seat then you pay once for each developer that will use the module.  Anything else is either theft or fraud depending on your perspective.</p>
<p>Anything you buy in the market place is your for the period of the product was sold for.  So as long as you purchase something that does not state it is an annual licence of other such limitation you will have this forever.</p>
<p>Keep in mind however that the mobile world is faster than the internet world which is faster than real world time.  So the module you purchase may only work based on what is available right now.  If the company providing the module is good and support the product for as long as is reasonable then you can expect updates to reflect changes.</p>
<p>But keep in mind when twitter and facebook APIs changed from their first versions to their second versions many things only ever designed to work with the first versions would simply fail.  A new module would be required that did then deal with the new way.</p>
<p>Also as the Ti SDK and iOS&#x2F;Android SDKs change modules may simply no longer work as they no longer support something at all that was supported originally or need it supported a new way that the module has not been updated to handle.</p>

										<p><p>To add to this, module purchases are tied to a developers account, used to log in and to build an app.  That app has a GUID that is associated with that logged in developer account.  A developer that does not have the purchased module in their account cannot build a project that uses the module in an app.</p>
<p>There is some account magic that goes on in the back ground that ties your apps to the modules to your account.</p>
