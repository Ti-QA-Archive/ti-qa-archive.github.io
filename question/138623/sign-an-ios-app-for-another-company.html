			<h1>sign an IOs App for another Company</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My development team is working on an Ios App for another company. I want to sign The IOS App to publish it for the IPads of the company.<br>What Apple says : You need to be invited on the Company Developper Account. There is no other way.<br>What the Company Say : with all the others developpement team we only provide 3 files : the distribution certificate, the private key and the provisioning profile. No need to be invited on our Development account.</p>
<p>I try the Company Solution but impossible to sign the App with Titanium. So here are my questions :</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there any limitations with Titanium to use the Company way of signing an IOS App</li>
<li>Is it the good way to do it ?</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks by advance for any help you would provide.. I&#39;m lost in apple security…</p>

							<p>As your company is building iOS products for other company then your company will surely have an Apple account. you can create the development certificate from your account and can use those in the other company app. Even with your account you can even generate the production certificate that will help that app to go in marketplace.<br>but with this way the other company wont be able to manage or check the app review at all, as it was uploaded from your account.</p>
<p>The way is that tell the other company to have the apple developer account and either you or those company people generate the required certificates with same appID you used and then use those certificate for your development.</p>
<p>If the appID for the certificate is same as that of your project App ID then titanium will not create any problem.</p>

							<p>Thank you very much for your answer.</p>
<p>The company has an Entreprise IOS program so they distribute in-house iOS apps.<br>We give them the .app and they use MobileIron to distribute  it on the employes Ipads</p>
<p>If i understand well :</p>
<ul>
<li>The company create an appID on its accont and give it to me</li>
<li>I create the same appID on my account<br>Assuming i&#39;m not publish for the marketplace but for the Ipads of the Company, what are the next steps ?</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>If company is creating the appID for that App than you dont have to worry about it, just ask then for the provision profile with all the ipad UDID added in that provisioning profile.</p>
<p>on your end you just have use their provisioning profile to create the app and send the .app file to them.<br>As you will be using their provisioning profile then the app will run on all the devices whose UDID is added to the provisioning profile,</p>
<p>I am saying this approach because the app will be used within the company and if we use the distribution certificate here then any person outside of that company can use that app.</p>
<p>So in short just ask them the provisioning profile with the necessary UDID added in it.</p>

										<p><p>Just one thing :<br>when i look a t the details of a provisionning profile in the IOS Provisionning Portal, i have :</p>
<ul>
<li>the App ID</li>
<li>the devices</li>
<li>the certificate</li>
</ul>
<p>so what i was understanding is that the provisionning profile was the link between these 3 things : App ID &#x2F; devices &#x2F; certificate. Am i wrong ?</p>

										<p><p>yes you can build the App, but make sure the provisioning profile contains the device UDID in it.<br>and you can create 2 different provision profile 1 with your development certificate and other with your distribution certificate.</p>
<p>And we can continue our conversation in the same thread, all you have to do is just comment instead of writing in answer section.</p>

										<p><p>I think you should go through the portal in detail.<br>with one certificate you can create many provisioning profile… and many appID.<br>The appID differentiate between your apps you build. each app has its own unique Id that you give.<br>once you generate the appID using a certificate then you can use that App ID to generate provisioning profile that will be used while releasing the build</p>

										<p><p>The company give their distribution certificate, the private key and the provisioning profile because they want the developer to use their certificate which will have their company name and when the app is in the market they can monitor the sales, and can change any necessary information about the app in the store.</p>
<p>If the above conversation helped you, pls mark the answer as correct.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

										<p><p>Hi sorry for the late reply, Was out of town.<br>you have to check whether the provision profile is binded with your developer certificate.<br>As when you create a provision profile it ask for which certificate you want to associate.</p>
