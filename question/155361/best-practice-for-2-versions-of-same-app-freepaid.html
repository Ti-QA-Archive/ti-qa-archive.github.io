			<h1>Best practice for 2 versions of same app (free/paid)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m doing a lite version of my paid app, but I&#39;m not very fond of the idea of having two seperate projects with the exact same files in it. I rather check some parameter to see if some contents should be removed or not (free or paid version).<br>Can this be done easy in Titanium and what is the best practice for it?<br>I don&#39;t care if images&#x2F;sounds (content that won&#39;t be used) is included in the IPA for the free version.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>This is my understanding;</p>
<ul>
<li>Lite version <strong>&amp;</strong> Paid version as two separate apps</li>
</ul>
<p>Perfectly acceptable as long as the lite version is not considered a demo app, by this it means for example; if you provide 10 levels in a game those levels must be fully working levels and not have some mechanism to stop them functioning because it is a free version.</p>
<ul>
<li>Single version where additional content is available via an IaP</li>
</ul>
<p>Perfectly acceptable as long as the lite section follows the same rules as above.</p>
<p>The idea is that the user is not forced to pay to make something work - only for additional content if that is the terms of the game (or other app).</p>
<p>As to your original question; &quot;is there an easy way to manage to apps from one set of code?&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to have two different app ids, but I guess you already know that</li>
<li>The simplest method would be to add a new property to the <strong>tiapp.xml</strong>, you can then access that via the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.App.Properties">Ti.App.Properties</a>.  Use this property to determine if you are in the lite or full version.</li>
<li>I would recommend that you store all premium static content in a different folder, this way you could simply remove the folder prior to building the app or leave it there depending on which one.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you need to build for the store, simply edit the <strong>tiapp.xml</strong> set the <strong>appid</strong> and your own <strong>custom</strong> property, then decide to remove the static content folder.  </p>
<p>I would strongly consider removing the extra static content folder for the separate lite version as depending on the space it takes up it is always better for the user if they download as little as possible and there is the over-the-air limits to consider as well.</p>
<p>All done.</p>

										<p><p>I fully agree with the first part and my app is suitable for free + paid app.</p>
<p>On topic: Those advice are great. I have already made all programming changes and I used a property as you suggested. As for the tiapp.xml, it seems like a good solution. Maybe I can have two versions and just rename them whenever I&#39;m changing which app to build.</p>
<p>Your right of course about removing unused content, I shouldn&#39;t be lazy :)<br>Thanks!</p>

							<p>This is against the App Store Guidelines. Apple wants you to have only one App in the App Store using In App Purchase to unlock content &#x2F; functionality.</p>
<p>So the &quot;best practice&quot; would be to implement IAP and set a <em>pro</em> flag in properties or something when a user buys or restores your <em>pro</em> product from iTunes.</p>
<p>Actually, one single app is easier to maintain IMHO since you would not have to update two apps. Anyway, Apple will reject your <em>Lite</em> Version, so you better go by IAP.</p>

										<p><p>This is not true. Your only breaking the guidelines if you indicate that there is locked content in your app. For example a menu option with a padlock on it is not allowed, then you must have IAP and not a lite-version.<br>If you just remove content and call it lite, it&#39;s ok. Why else do you think there is millions of lite apps?</p>
<p>Also, I make apps for childrens and myself with many parents hate IAP in those kind of apps. It&#39;s not unlikely there will be laws against IAP&#39;s targeting children.</p>

										<p><p>ok. maybe this is helpful: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bluecloudsolutions.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;lite-in-app-purchase-game&#x2F;">lite vs. in-app purchase</a>.</p>
<p>Guidelines are still not available at the moment. Couldn&#39;t look it up ;)</p>
