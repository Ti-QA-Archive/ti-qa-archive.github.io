			<h1>Syntax Highlighting issue / bug on Titanium Studio 3.x</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My titanium studio 3.x has some sort of weird syntax highlighting &#x2F; broken intellisense bug.<br>Check this out: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;mSzDxmK.png">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;mSzDxmK.png</a></p>
<p>This code compiles and runs perfectly fine, it&#39;s just that the syntax highlighting and autosuggest &#x2F; intellisense of variables is broken now.</p>
<p>I tried clicking on Edit -&gt; Source -&gt; Format (doesn&#39;t help).</p>
<p>Does anyone else have this issue? All the lines of code above createHighlightRow() function is highlighting fine though. Just after that line, it&#39;s going nuts.</p>

							<div><p>Also, code folding is broken when syntax in the IDE isn&#39;t highlighting. It&#39;s getting harder to work on this project as the number of lines of code is getting bigger.</p>

							<div><p>Having a similar problem. In one file, this was probably due to many warnings in code (and it resolved when I cleaned said code) but now in another file, no way to get it to work :s Note that both were quite long files and highlighting ceased working pretty far away in them (like, around line 1000)</p>

							<p>old post, but i had the same issue, and i found a possible solution. Find where exactly the syntax highlighting stops, and start removing and replacing characters. most likely it has been caused by a copypaste which included an unknown character, in my case it was a space that caused this and as soon as i removed it the file was fixed. </p>
<p>Then you can just retype the character and it will not break the file highlighting.</p>
