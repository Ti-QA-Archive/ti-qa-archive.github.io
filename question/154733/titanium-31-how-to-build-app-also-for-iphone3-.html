							<p>You will need to use an older version of the Titanium SDK if you want to build applications compatible with iOS 4.2.</p>
<p>###As you can see on the Compatibility Matrix<br><img src="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;x0Ei60I.png?1" alt="Compatibility Matrix"></p>
<p>Looks like Titanium SDK version 3.0 could fit you bill.</p>
<p>There is one caveat though. You may encounter problems when submitting the application to the App Store though. Because, if I recall, Apple doesn&#39;t accept applications below iOS 4.3 anymore.</p>

										<p><p>unfortunately have the latest SDK as the minimum OS 4.3.3 compatible, so devices like the iPhone 3G that mount (maximum) iOS 4.2.1 are no longer compatible. Apple accepts App that have as a minimum the OS 4.3.3, not less.</p>

										<p><p>Unfortunately, you can make your apps only compatible with devices that support at least iOS 4.3.3</p>
<p>This unfortunately is the bad policy Apple</p>
<p>even if you should succeed with the old SDK to create your App, Apple, however, did not accept</p>

										<p><p>found maybe some workaround</p>

										<p><p>no , is not possibile</p>
<p>read the comment : </p>
<p>It&#39;s not possible to support below iOS 4.3 while building against iOS 6 SDK, but it is possible to use Xcode 4.5 to continue to build for armv6 and target iOS 4.2.1 and below.</p>
<p><strong>Apple accepts ONLY app that is compatible with at least iOS 4.3.3</strong></p>
