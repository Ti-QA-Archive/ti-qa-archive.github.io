										<p><p>Plus most of the example code that forms a basic app is for non-alloy style titanium code.  The community needs to work on providing good hello world style alloy app code to help those starting out.</p>

							<p>I only use Alloy now.  I have heard some say that it is not appropriate for all types of apps, but I completely disagree. I have been coding in Titanium since version 1.0.  I switched to the Alloy model as soon as it was available, and I haven&#39;t looked back.  The MVC style code separation is so much cleaner than &#39;classic&#39; Titanium.</p>

										<p><p>I agree with the disagreement; Titanium with the Alloy framework is always better than Titanium on its own.</p>
<p>Whilst Rick started with Alloy as soon as possible, I had a number of large projects already under development, so it made no sense to jump ship when the ship was so large as that is not a good business decision.  But now the Alloy framework is the only way to go for all new apps and those existing ones that need a good refactoring.</p>

							<p>there is learning curve, but once you make the switch, the efficiency makes it well worth it.</p>
