							<p>From the information given? Not a chance.  That is SO generic and lame response from them.  Follow up and ask them for crash reports or specifics.  Keep in mind, unless something has changed, they don&#39;t actually test on physical devices unless its an abnormal situation.  They have this weird emulation farm and the quality of the reviewers (read intelligence) has dropped off noticeably in the last year or so.</p>
<p>But that doesn&#39;t help you. Find someone with the same configuration they complained about, and test the snot out of your app.  Test it with an adHoc profile so you are as close to production as you can be.  Use the iPhone Configuration Utility to grab the crash logs from the device, it will be objective C errors and address&#39;, so it wont be as easy as &#39;x broke in adfasd.js&#39; or anything.</p>
<p>It is expensive, but we buy a lot of hardware to test on.  Here in the states, I troll ebay and craigslist for one off market stuff.  I know Shannon is even worse then I am. :)</p>
<p>But that allows me to counter Apple and say, I have actually tested this on physical hardware and we do not experience these issues.  Have had them yield and accept apps that failed their automated tests, but never crashed on hardware.  But you have to have the background to try the bully approach.</p>
<p>For managing our testing teams, we use <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;installrapp.com&#x2F;">installrapp.com</a> instead of testflight.  As a fellow Titan, I&#39;ll offer to run your app on one of our iPhone 5c (other than the cpu and sensors, its the same device) and and iPad 2 and an iPad 4, all running 7.1.2 to see if anything will jump out. If thats cool with you, ping me on devlink to get my email address.</p>
