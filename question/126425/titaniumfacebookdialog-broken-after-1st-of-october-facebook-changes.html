			<h1>Titanium.Facebook.dialog broken after 1st of october facebook changes</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>is it posible that Titanium.Facebook.dialog and other facebook api are broken in 1.7.2 after the new changes Facebook introduced the 1st of october. Basically facebook doesn´t allow http connections anymore only https. I have a app published that stopped working, I think that&#39;s the issue.<br>Regards,<br>Andres.</p>

							<p>good news it&#39;s fixed now as from yesterday. just go to http:&#x2F;&#x2F;builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;index.html select the master branch, copy the v1.8 link, then open Titanium Studio, go to help -&gt; install Titanium SDK from URL, paste the url you just copied. recompile and you are done.</p>

							<p>Likewise - seeing this on both Apple and Android platforms - on a published app.  It goes to Facebook to authenticate and then no dialog.<br>I&#39;m putting out a new release on Friday so I&#39;m figuring out whether I need to pull my Facebook functions.</p>

							<p>Not quite broken - have gotten both openGraph and Ti.Facebook.dialog to work on Android and openGraph to work on iPhone.  Be sure to set up your app properly with Facebook on their developer site.</p>

										<p><p>Ti.Facebook.dialog was working on the iPhone before Facebook new changes, and all of the sudden without changing anything on my code it got broken. It can´t be the settings on the facebook app because the same code works on android, it just doesn´t work on iPhone.</p>

										<p><p>Ti.Facebook mysteriously started working again for a few days last week. Now it is broken again, showing: &quot;Sorry, something went wrong&quot;. Any response from Appcelerator on this? Facebook sharing is a pretty important part of the social functions of our app, so a resolution would be great.</p>
