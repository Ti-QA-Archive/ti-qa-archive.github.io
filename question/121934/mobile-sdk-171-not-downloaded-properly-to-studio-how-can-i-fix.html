			<h1>mobile SDK 1.7.1 not downloaded properly to studio...(?) how can I fix?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Since updating studio to mobile sdk 1.7.1 I keep getting the following error when trying to build my project to run on the iPhone emulator:</p>
<p>&#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;python: can&#39;t open file &#39;&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx&#x2F;1.7.1&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;builder.py&#39;: [Errno 2] No such file or directory</p>
<p>When I look in &#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx&#x2F;1.7.1&#x2F;iphone&#x2F; that file is indeed missing - but in all my previous mobile SDK versions (e.g. 1.7.0 &amp; 1.6.2) it is present.</p>
<p>In fact there&#39;s quite a lot less files in 1.7.1 than in previous builds so it looks to me as if the 1.7.1 update didn&#39;t download properly.</p>
<p>Any idea how I fix this? I&#39;ve been searching around for the correct URL so I could try &#39;Install Titanium SDK from URL…&#39; but can&#39;t find the correct path anywhere.</p>
<p>Sorry if this is a bit obvious, I&#39;ve not really used Eclipse-based IDEs that much before.</p>

							<p>I had the same problem, but here&#39;s what happened to me:</p>
<ol>
<li>SDK Update found…do you want to update? Yes (started the SDK update)</li>
<li>Titanium Studio Update found…do you want to update? Yes (started Titanium Studio update)</li>
<li>Titanium Studio update finishes FIRST and asks to reboot.  I click yes, but the SDK update had not indicated its completion.</li>
<li>I try to run an emulator with 1.7.1, the new SDK, and it can&#39;t find some .py files…hmmm.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thoughts:<br>When you do the SDK update, you have to wait awhile.  There will be a pop-up acknowledging its success. (I did not do this the first time by restarting T. Studio in the middle of it, but did the second time, and now it works)</p>
<p>Solution:</p>
<ol>
<li>Quit Titanium Studio</li>
<li>Delete the 1.7.1 folder in (HDD)&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx</li>
<li>Start Titanium Studio - it should now say again that it needs an update</li>
<li>Start the Titanium SDK update</li>
<li>WAIT until the popup acknowledgement</li>
</ol>
<p>Voila!  It should work now.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Jack - I&#39;d already fixed by transferring the relevant data from my Mac at work but gave this a try out of interest and it worked a treat.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m having the same issue, plus a bunch more with android… it looks like the 1.7.x release is not production ready.</p>

							<p>Interestingly on my Mac at work this does seem to have downloaded OK… so am going to copy the files and put them on my kit at home - will let you know how I get on with this.</p>
<p>Annoying that the information on where to download this from is not available though.</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve downloaded version v20110630145837 from the continuous build site and I had no problems. Here&#39;s the direct link to the download: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;1_7_X&#x2F;mobilesdk-1.7.2.v20110630145837-osx.zip</p>
<p>But 1.7.1 is totally broken for me, so I removed completely.</p>
