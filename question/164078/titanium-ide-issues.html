			<h1>Titanium IDE Issues</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am having several issues with the IDE on Windows 7 machine.  I have uninstalled and re-installed several times.  Even installed to different locations and the problems persist.</p>
<p>When I first use the IDE, right after installation everything looks fine.  After closing it and reopening it, I am missing buttons on the IDE toolbar (like new project etc.) the only button is the Run button, and the theme does not stick to all panels it was originally applied to (I had selected the dark theme).</p>
<p>On top of all that the uninstall does not seem to work.  It runs very quickly, says its complete but then Windows says it may not have run correctly and when I look, nothing it installed is ever removed.</p>
<p>This is above and beyond the issues I am having getting a simple Hello World app to open in an Android emulator.  I seem to be having a common problem with the &quot;Application Installer abnormal process termination.&quot; error, but none of the existing sections in the help forums have actually helped.</p>
<p>Sorry for the rant, frustration is setting in :(</p>

							<div><p>I have tried this link but it did not solve my problem.  I believe the issue may be related to the emulator that Titanium in trying to open.  I can create and open emulators without issue using the android SDK directly.</p>

							<p>So I have calmed a bit and tried a few more things.  I think the android emulator issue set me off to much and I apologize.</p>
<p>My IDE toolbar issue seems to be related to having my Workspace in my User path (in Windows).  When I moved it to a different location, the toolbar buttons came back and, for now at least, seem to be staying between restarts of the IDE.</p>
<p>My theme issue seems to also be fixed but for a different reason.  I was originally changing it using the dashboard page, which seemed to change everything correctly at the moment of the change but did not completely stick after restarting the IDE.  After changing it in the Preferences - Colors and Fonts section it now appears to stick properly.</p>
<p>More information on my android Emulator issue<br>Many people are referring to a &quot;build.log&quot; but I cannot seem to find one, all of my information is based on the console window at this point.  I turned on Trace logging in the console.<br>I see no errors of any sort in the console during the build when I try to run a simple Hello World Alloy mobile app.  The last message I get is that it is copying the android.png image (which does not say it fails) but when I look in the target folder the image does not exist there (it is in the source folder though).<br>I tried cleaning the projects with no success.<br>When I try &quot;debugging&quot; instead of just &quot;Running&quot; the project I get a different message - the emulator (Nexus 7) does not have an SD card.  I can&#39;t find any place to configure these emulators so I am not sure where to proceed with it.<br>I went through all of the preconfigured emulators and I get one of two messages either the above missing SD card or a message saying that it &quot;cannot run titanium.cmd, argument has embedded quote, use the explicit CMD.exe call&quot;.<br>Again this is all using a straight out of the box installation of Titanium so I don&#39;t know what might be missing or miss-configured.<br>I have several other Eclipse IDEs installed, they all work perfectly fine, but could they be somehow interfering with Titanium</p>
