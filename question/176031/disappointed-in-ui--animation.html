			<h1>Disappointed in UI / Animation</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am new to Titanium, and I am having a hard time believing that Android UI animation only supports 2.0 linear and limited animation. Is there an updated module by the Titanium team that supports 3.0 and 4.0 animation capabilities while gracefully depreciating down to 2.0 when needed?</p>
<p>After all, as a cross platform tool - I would assume that the Titanium team would put a major focus on exposing the current UIs for all supported platforms. If i&#39;m stuck using Android 2.0 animations here, I might have to consider other options and I am hoping to stay in Titanium.</p>

										<p><p>I am going to see how well the module works. Unfortunately, my Java is rusty and my Android native experience is light - so I&#39;m not the best one to take over the project.<br>However, this is what I feel the Titanium team should be wrapping into the core services anyway. I get the feeling that Titanium gets iOS UI updates much faster than Android ones. This isn&#39;t the first area where I find rather current iOS UI options existing where Android support seems to reflect UI options from 4+ years ago.</p>
<p>With &quot;L&quot; as the new buzz, even having honeycomb animation solid would be helpful. Everyone is expecting the new apps to have more kinetic motion in the core interface. Which I prefer anyway. I can, of course, do it with JS, but I am sure it won&#39;t be as smooth as using the actual OS level UI transformations.</p>
