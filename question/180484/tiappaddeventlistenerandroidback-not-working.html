			<h1>Ti.App.addEventListener(&#39;androidback&#39;) not working</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, my application needs to customize Android&#39;s back button pressed event.<br>So I tried to do bind the androidback event listener to application as suggested in several other places:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Ti.App.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'androidback'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">e</span>)</span>{
    <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="hljs-string">"back button pressed"</span>)
    <span class="hljs-comment">//do something here</span>
}
</code></pre><p>However, it doesn&#39;t give me any output in the console. I then tried bind it to a specific window and that worked. I wonder if I am doing the binding at the wrong place or Titanium no longer support binding androidback event to Ti.App?</p>
<p>I both tried binding in Alloy.js and right after the initial window was opened, none of them worked. My current SDK version is 3.4.0 and the simulator is using API 19.</p>
<hr>
<p>By the way, what I am trying to do is create a &quot;waiting…&quot; modal with a activity indicator in the center(which is actually a window), which will pop-out as user send a request to the server. When user hit the &quot;back&quot; button in that case, I want to pause and exit the application instead of closing the modal to prevent user from doing other operation and pollute the model. </p>
<p>I wonder if I am thinking in the right direction by listening to back button event, or may be there is better practice in that case. I really appreciate any suggestion in advance!</p>

							<div><p>Hi Juan,</p>
<p>Thanks for answering. I tried android:back in the first place. However, it seems that since 3.2.0, it changed to androidback according to the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Event_Handling">documentation here</a>.</p>

							<div><p>you are right! the event &quot;androidback&quot; only available for ui.window. Ti.App doesn&#39;t have event &quot;androidback&quot;   http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.App</p>

							<p>I would avoid trying to mess with the androidback event wherever possible.  Most of the time when I&#39;ve been tempted to use that, I&#39;ve come to the realization that I was going about things the wrong way.</p>
<p>Instead of using a window for your waiting modal, just use views.</p>
<p>See my answer to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;179711&#x2F;activity-indicator-in-titanium-not-working">this question</a> for a sample module that implements a cross-platform modal wait popup</p>

										<p><p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>Thanks for your answer and I totally understand your concern. However, this may not completely solve the problem in my case. I actually have several windows and many of them can send event to the server. </p>
<p>For example,<br>window1 -&gt; window 2-(send request)</p>
<p>If I added the view to the current window 2, when user hit the back button, it will actually close window 2 that sending the request and user may still be able to do other operation with window 1. </p>
<p>I am not a heavy user of android device, so I wonder what is the typical interaction in that case if anyone may know?</p>

										<p><p>It&#39;s hard to know what the &quot;typical interaction&quot; would be – that&#39;s dependent on what the user is doing in window 1 and window 2.</p>
<p>It seems that if you back out of window 2, you should be able to modify window 1 and &quot;resubmit&quot; again to open a new window 2.</p>
<p>From an android user perspective, it would be unexpected to have a stack of windows with a &quot;waiting&quot; modal, and then the user hits &quot;back&quot; and the whole stack closes and the app exits (I think that&#39;s what you originally proposed).</p>
<p>If I see a &quot;waiting&quot; modal, the back button should perform a &quot;cancel&quot; operation, and I should go back to the state before the long network operation began.</p>

										<p><p>Yes. That was what I originally want to do - simply cancel the request. </p>
<p>However, just as an AJAX request, it may take several seconds for the server to process and returns the result. I don&#39;t think I can tell the server that the request is cancelled once it sent out, that&#39;s why I think I should block user by using the waiting modal.</p>
<p>By the way, I didn&#39;t mean to perform a activity.finish() action, but just pause the application as user was actually hitting the home button.</p>
