			<h1>ACS - how work image remote-cache?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, i&#39;m new on titanium and i&#39;m working on app that uses ACS service.<br>I look that when i download an image saved into ACS object, like a jpeg, png photo… automatically this is cached into this directory of my app:  data&#x2F; ID_of_my_app&#x2F; cache&#x2F; _tmp&#x2F; remote-cache.<br>i read on titanium docs that android got a cache size limited to 25mb and iOS don&#39;t have limit of memory but when need space it cleans the cache by yourself.<br>I need to know how this directory works, if i&#39;ve got any problems with memory in future, if i need to clean this directory by code or if the OS cleans it automatically… and what is the best practice for this purpose?</p>

							<p>If you are concerned about controlling the image yourself, then you need to be saving the image to a location that is not temporal, and manage the life of that file yourself.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks stephen , I think I have exposed the wrong question because of my English is not good .. the question was that when loading images taken from the cloud in a TableView for example , the system saves these images in the directory I wrote above , at least in Android . In iOS do not know how it works . I have noticed however, that most images are loaded and more increase the memory dedicated to the cache for the application. I would like to know if in the future I will have problems with the memory cache, and then if I have to manage this memory through code. Thanks again.</p>

										<p><pre><code class="hljs"> I need <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> know how this <span class="hljs-built_in">directory</span> works
</code></pre><p>Then YOU need to go read the NATIVE documentation to figure out how the host OS manages its cache directories.</p>
<p>And, AGAIN, if you are concerned that the your images may not be available when you need them, then you need to stop having the view download the images, download them yourself, and AGAIN manage the images yourself.</p>
<p>Your (spoken) language skills are not at issue here…</p>
