							<div><p>So does this mean no one is creating paid apps with Titanium? I would have thought it would have more votes.</p>
<p>Can you still have a paid app without this?  what are the implications?</p>

							<p>Yes, you can have a paid app without using the license verification.  I&#39;ve build both paid apps and in-app purchase apps and have them in the Android Market.  All you need to do is set up a Google Checkout account and set your price when you upload the apk file.</p>
<p>What Android&#39;s License Verfication does is make sure someone who knows what they&#39;re doing can&#39;t pay for your app and then set up a website to give it away for free.  While I&#39;d love to have an Appcelerator module that does that for us, I don&#39;t think it exists right now.  Fortunately, my apps are based on weekend events so I haven&#39;t really seen any pirating (that I know of anyway).</p>
