			<h1>Remove objects before view has focus</h1>

			<p>Problem: The remove function does not work on windows that have not yet been &#39;focused&#39;.</p>
<p>Titanium 1.6.2, mobile, iPhone</p>
<p>So this is partly a question and partly a comment to help others debug their seemingly glitchy apps.</p>
<p>I have created an application that uses a tab bar.  I instantiate each of the tab bar windows on application startup, but I do not load the windows contents.  Instead I wait until the contents of the windows NEED to be created.  Originally, those conditions were a) window has focus b) user modifies content from another view that affects a given &#39;not yet focused&#39; window.  I have made very sure the load condition now is ONLY condition a, because…</p>
<p>If I had loaded a window view via a reload fireEvent (condition b), and then the user navigated to the window view, everything looked fine.  However, if two or more fireEvents were fired BEFORE the user navigated to the window view, things became scrambled.</p>
<p>What I found was the remove function I used to reload a window&#39;s view objects DOES NOT work until a view has come into focus.  Be wary of remove before focus.</p>
<p>Is this a known issue? Any plans to fix this with 1.7?</p>
