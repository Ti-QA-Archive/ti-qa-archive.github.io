			<h1>Please Help! How to change icon name on iPad</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I need to change the name that appears below the icon, when installed on iPad. And I think I&#39;ve tried everything…</p>
<p>I have work around this for two days, any answer in this forum has not worked for me. </p>
<p>I have changed info.plist, I have clear the build folder and I have created a new titanium project copying only the resource folder, and all combinations of this. The name changes ok in emulator, but when I package to test on device, it uses the old name again. I think that is getting the name from some cache file. I&#39;m desperate!</p>
<p>Maybe is taking the name from somewhere in the apple developer&#x2F;distribution profile?</p>
<p>Please help, the app is already in itunes and i have to change this name urgently.</p>
<p>thanks in advance,<br>javier</p>
<p>using titanium 1.6.2 on ipad.</p>

							<p>Did you try to delete the app from ur iPad and restart it?</p>
<p>Deinstalled&#x2F;deleted apps don&#39;t have to be cache cleared until restart.</p>
<p>Delete from iPad -&gt; deconnect iPad  -&gt; restart iPad-&gt; Clean Target in Xcode -&gt; reconnct iPad -&gt; build  &amp; run on device</p>
<p>The app name is not taken from the prov profile. ( make sure you have the right bundle ID, when tryin to update ur app to appstore ;) )</p>

										<p><p>How do i clean target in xcode?</p>
<p>I see  that the .ipa file has the correct name and the .app file has the old name. So the problem I think is not on the iPad, but on building time.</p>

							<p>Ooooooooh my god, I found what is happening.</p>
<p>inside i18n folder one of the languages had a file called app.xml with the old name.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t believe how this has passed to me, I looked the name in the finder search tool several times.</p>
<p>thanks, anyway. I can sleep again.</p>
