			<p>Honestly this is getting to be really annoying. Chrome is an immensely popular browser and I&#39;m sure some of your employees use it. Now why is that the docs, etc haven&#39;t been fixed in order to load in Chrome? I figured it&#39;d be fixed soon after the 2.0 release but obviously not. This is a joke. I shouldn&#39;t have to open up another browser just to access documentation. Nor should I have to dig to find the 1.8.2 because you can&#39;t manage to get the new doc system to work with Chrome. It totally screws my workflow and it&#39;s something I feel should have never been overlooked.</p>

<p>Had Chrome on an OSX system suddenly decide it wouldn&#39;t save the login for gmail (remember me).  Uninstall, reinstall, nothing.  Ended up uninstalling, nuking the chrome directories down in Application\ Support, and reinstalling to get it to work.</p>

										<p><p>Up until that point, had never had a problem with Chrome on OSX and its been the only odd thing.  What was odd, was that the folder with the chrome settings, I had to enter my creds to delete it. So wondering if the perms on the folder had gotten munged up somehow.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m afraid your case is more the exception than the rule. </p>
<p>I use Chrome (Win7, Win XP and OSX Lion) without a hitch.</p>
<p>Which <strong>exact version</strong> of Chrome are you using? And on what <strong>platform</strong>?</p>
