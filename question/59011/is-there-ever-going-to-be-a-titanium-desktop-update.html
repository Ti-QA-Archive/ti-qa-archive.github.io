			<h1>Is There EVER Going To Be A Titanium Desktop Update???</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>In the 6 months since 1.0 released, you&#39;ll have released 5 updates to Titanium Mobile (since 1.5 is due soon). Meanwhile Titanium Desktop is not only stalled at 1.0, but it crashes with a completely unhelpful error message on 64 bit Win 7 when you enable PHP.</p>
<p>Despite this being a known issue for months, not even a 1.01 release of Titanium Desktop has been released to fix this show stopper.</p>
<p>Seriously, is Titanium Desktop a dead product?</p>

							<p>Thanks for everyone&#39;s patience.</p>
<p>Yes, we will be making a public release available later this Fall.  We have several large and small customers that we&#39;ve been working with over the past several months, so I can assure you that there is active development going on as we speak.</p>
<p>Thanks again - </p>

							<p>According to this thread (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;38971&#x2F;is-appcelerator-desktop-dead) the desktop version isn&#39;t dead, but it sure seems like it:</p>
<p>-There is hardly any news.</p>
<p>-No updates. The latest version&#x2F;milestone (1.1) was over <strong>one year ago</strong> with still no sign of release (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;25719-titanium-desktop&#x2F;milestones).</p>
<p>-the API (and other) documentation is minimal or incomplete.</p>
<p>-There are various bugs on the Windows platform (especially Windows 7).</p>
<p>-Forum questions remain unanswered for weeks.</p>
<p>I can understand that they are a startup and their business model relies on people buying support, but the current state of the desktop version doesn&#39;t really give a positive impression.</p>
<p>In fact, I was asked by my superiors to experiment with Appcelerator Desktop for a bit and see if it was a good alternative to Flex&#x2F;Air (which we have been using for cross-OS desktop apps). At first glance, Appcelerator seemed like a very good alternative, but in it&#39;s current state I can&#39;t recommend to my superiors that we try this for even one project, let alone all of them.</p>

							<p>I guess the best way to check if the project is dead is to look at the public code repository.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_desktop&#x2F;commits&#x2F;">Titanium Desktop Commits @ Github</a></p>
<p>They&#39;re still committing updates, so someone is working on it, though the pace of committs has slowed significantly from a few months ago. It&#39;s just a question of when, if ever, they plan to issue an official release, even if it&#39;s just a bugfix release that solves their primary showstopper issues.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m really curious about this too.  I&#39;m doing all mobile apps right now, but do plan to start desktop apps later this year so I&#39;ll need to decided between this and Adobe AIR.</p>

							<p>If everything else fails, you can simply fork it on <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator">github</a></p>
