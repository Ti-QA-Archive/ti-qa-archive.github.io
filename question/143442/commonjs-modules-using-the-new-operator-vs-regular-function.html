			<h1>CommonJS Modules: using the &#34;new&#34; operator vs regular function</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;m writing our first Ti app using CommonJS modules pretty much exclusively and I&#39;m trying to figure out what the difference is (if any) between:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> Person = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Person'</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> don = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Person(<span class="hljs-string">'Don'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'Thorp'</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> donsName = don.fullName();
</code></pre><p>and</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> person = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Person'</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> don = person(<span class="hljs-string">'Don'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'Thorp'</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> donsName = don.fullName();
</code></pre><p>Obviously one uses &quot;new&quot; to instantiate the object and the other one uses the Person module&#x2F;method as a regular function, but does it matter which one I use in my app, specifically if I am not using &quot;this&quot; inside the Person module? </p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>I don&#39;t think that Ashish&#39;s advice is 100% correct.  He&#39;s right in that if you&#39;re not using <code>this</code>, there&#39;s no real reason to use new().  But there&#39;s no harm, either, except that an object will be created and then discarded.  But this is a small inefficiency.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the new() operator helps make your code more readable if you&#39;re trying to emulate classical inheritance.  Many developers have been trained in languages like Java, C++, and C#, and they tend to develop using patterns they are familiar with.  The new() operator very explicitly indicates that a new object is being created.  Arbitrary function calls don&#39;t bring attention to that fact.</p>
<p>I encourage you to read <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;smorgasbork.com&#x2F;component&#x2F;content&#x2F;article&#x2F;38-titanium-mobile&#x2F;135-titanium-mobile-beyond-the-prototype">my articles on the topic</a>, especially the two articles on CommonJS.  I discuss the new operator in both.</p>

							<p>Hi Stoyan, it does not matter much and specially in your case you <strong>should not use new().</strong></p>
<p><em>When you use <strong>new()</strong> then your function return <strong>this object</strong> by default even you don&#39;t<br> return any anything.</em></p>
<p><em>and when you call without <strong>new()</strong> and making function call and returning nothing then <strong>undefined</strong> will be returned, else whatever you return.</em></p>
<p>so in your case as you are not using <strong>this</strong> so use normal function call.</p>

										<p><p>How can you say this without knowing what his Person class looks like? Judging by the code he has provided, it is possible that his Person class is using the prototype inheritance to attach a fullName method to every instance of Person that is created. If he wanted to add 10 similar methods to his class, then, sure he could write a function to attach them all to the new object, or he could do the smart thing and attach them to the create functions prototype and create <code>new</code> objects. Its going to be faster and its not going to balloon objects with separate properties for each method. This can be significant in performance and memory. Imagine grabbing a db of 100+ people, all of them creating a new <code>Person()</code> that clobbers together fullnames, addresses, notes, searchable items all from within the Person class and NOT using the prototype and a new object for each. Thats a mobile performance issue waiting to happen.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Anthony,</p>
<p>Thanks for you reply. </p>
<p>I am not sure that I understand your point here. Are you saying that if I am not using &quot;new&quot; I cannot use prototypal inheritance and the alternative (attaching methods and properties to instances instead of their prototype) can be wasteful? </p>
<p>Can I do the following and accomplish the same effect without &quot;new&quot;:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Person.prototype.doSomething = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
 <span class="hljs-comment">// something</span>
}
</code></pre><p>I grabbed the example from the Wiki and the full name thing is exactly what they are doing there: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.1&#x2F;index.html#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;CommonJS_Modules_in_Titanium</p>

										<p><p>I think I&#39;m about to answer my question (from the comment above). If &quot;this&quot; is not bound to my new oobject I can&#39;t do this:</p>

										<p><p>You actually wouldn&#39;t even get that far. If you didn&#39;t return anything in the constructor (without using new), the variable you assigned would be undefined. If you tried to return <code>this</code> in the constructor, then attempted to access the fullName method, you&#39;d get undefined because <code>this</code> would have referred to the global object. Now, wrap it in a commonjs module, and you&#39;ll get nothing â¦ the variable that you assigned would always be undefined. </p>
<p>My issue in this case was not about whether or not you should use new, it was about this particular answer that you got in regards to it. It all is still going to depend on how you code up your modules. Jason makes some valid points below, and I would recommend giving his articles a read. Also, there are tons of online resources if you search on the matter. You&#39;ll hear many arguments for and against, none of which are definitive, so long as you understand what happens when you let the new keyword off its chain then you can make a decision about how you like to proceed. When I was just a n00b, one of the pages that really helped me understand what was what is <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;joost.zeekat.nl&#x2F;constructors-considered-mildly-confusing.html">this old ass page</a> as it had pretty pictures. After that, you can go on to read about the raging battle between using new and not using new.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Anthony. I understand your points. I will look at the page you recommended. There is def a lot to think about when you are new-ish to JS and choosing the most suitable way to make objects and call their methods (hence all the arguing online).</p>

										<p><p>Hi Anthony, I think you do not understand a very simple concept that using <strong>new operator</strong> is not different than returning this by ourself.</p>
<p>and using JAVA SCRIPT as a programming language, it is recommended that new should be avoided as without using <strong>new operator</strong> everything is possible.</p>
<p>talking about code and class structure, so prototyping and other type of inheritance in java script can be implemented without new operator.</p>
<p>though its programmer choice to code the way he&#x2F;she want, so you do the way you want. Good Luck and Happy Coding.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Ashish,</p>
<p>As I said in my original question, I am not using &#39;this&#39; in my current code. But if I am not using the &#39;new&#39; operator and returning things manually, how would I return a reference to the object itself (given that by default &#39;this&#39; is bound to the global&#x2F;window object inside a regular function)?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>St</p>

										<p><p>Hi Stoyan, this is the code which can help you understand what happen when you use new operator in case of prototypal inheritance.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> person = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>)</span>{
 <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> person.prototype;

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> myname = person();

<span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(myname.name());
</code></pre><p>though i agree with one fact that, using new operator some time is really easy but when we miss something by mistake or typo mistake then debugging is painful.</p>
<p>Go Ahead Happy Coding.</p>

										<p><p>Ashish, I&#39;m sure you would like to think that I don&#39;t understand, but everything I said is absolutely true. And as I said, my issue was not with whether or not to use the new keyword, it was with the advice that you gave him, it was fairly terrible. I obviously was not the only one who thought so, as your answer has been down voted a number of times. I don&#39;t down vote answers as that would be counter-productive to my position, but if I did, I would definitely down vote this answer. That was my entire point.</p>
