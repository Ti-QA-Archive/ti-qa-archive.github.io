			<h1>Android device: HTTPClient POST parameters missing</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am working on an Android app, and have run into a problem where my POST parameters are being omitted (or stripped) from my HTTPClient during the send.  This is my code:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">//loginClient is an<span class="hljs-instruction"> instance </span>of Ti.Network.HTTPClient
loginClient.open('POST', Constant.loginAddress<span class="hljs-function">)</span>;
loginClient.send({
    <span class="hljs-string">"email"</span><span class="hljs-keyword"> :</span> Login.email,
    <span class="hljs-string">"password"</span><span class="hljs-keyword"> :</span> Login.password
}<span class="hljs-function">)</span>;
</code></pre><p>On the server side (at &quot;loginAddress&quot;) I can verify that the page was accessed, but it receives no parameters.  This same code works fine from the emulator, though.  I also noticed that if I changed from POST to GET, it worked OK on the device.  Does anyone have a guess why the device would be omitting the POST parameters?</p>
<p>I am using Ti SDK 1.4.2.</p>

							<p>i would suggest moving to 1.5.1, I had many issues with the httpClient and they were resolved once I moved to the most recent release.</p>

							<p>What format does the server expect the data?  You are sending it a JSON style dictionary, which may be fine if that is what the server expects.  But if it is expecting form data (as if you are filling out a web page in lieu of a browser), then I do something along these lines:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var formData = <span class="hljs-string">'email='</span> + Ti.Network.encodeURIComponent(email) +
               <span class="hljs-string">'&amp;password='</span> + Ti.Network.encodeURIComponent(password);
loginClient.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'POST'</span>, Constant.loginAddress);
loginClient.setRequestHeader(<span class="hljs-string">'Content-Type'</span>, 
               <span class="hljs-string">'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'</span>);
loginClient.<span class="hljs-keyword">send</span>(formData);
</code></pre><p>In form data posts, it is always a good idea to URI encode values a user may enter so the data does not get misinterpreted by a non-safe character.  Then the server should be expecting the Content-Type header so we place that between the open and send calls.</p>
<p>If the server is not expecting form data (and perhaps it is not if things work from the simulator for you), then just disregard this answer.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the suggestion - I gave the code a shot, and it works for the iPhone, but still no luck for Android.  It also looks like Ti.Network.encodeURIComponent does not work in Android (at least in 1.4.2), but even without encoding, I still wasn&#39;t receiving any data at all on the other end.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll keep debugging.  Maybe it&#39;s some setting on the site that I am trying to post data to (though I&#39;m not sure why that would only affect Android and not iPhone).</p>

										<p><p>I forgot you are using 1.4.x; yes, the encodeURIComponent was not added to the Android SDK until 1.5.x so you can&#39;t use it.  However you could roll your own or just hope nobody keys a non-safe character (such as &amp; or %) in the email or password.  I did have form post working with android 1.4.3 but moved to 1.6.0 continuous because I needed too many other fixes.</p>
