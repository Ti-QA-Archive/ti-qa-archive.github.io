			<h1>Logic behind Push-notificaitons?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello, I&#39;ve finally come to the point where I have to put some push-notifications in my app, towards the users.</p>
<p> The thing is I cant get a hold of how the logic should be handled. As far as I understand I should </p>
<p>1) prompt the user about the notification-availabiluty</p>
<p>2) If user accepts, put aside the device_token</p>
<p>3) When user logs in, save the device_token &amp; user_id together in my database (located in a web-enviroment)</p>
<p>After the above steps, another user contacts the above mentioned user, in a msg (or something similar) which triggers (on the server) a push-notification. My script can find that user (whom recieveing a msg from another user) has a device_token saved. Then the server kan fetch the device_token and send a push to the user.</p>
<p>My thought is, what should happen when a user logs out from the App? Should the device_token be destroyed on the server? And then when the user logs in again, we should save it yet again?</p>
<p>Also when I dug in to all this mess, I found something called &quot;channel&quot;, which in my ears are used to send global push, to all devices tied to my app?</p>
<p>How would you do this?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<div><p>Personally, I would use Urban Airship.  I tried the ACS method, and its a pain in the ass.  UA is a lot easier, and its easy to find the device token and send it to the database.</p>
<p>For logging out, I dont know believe new ones are generated (since a lot of apps dont  require you to login anyways, but can still send notifications).  You&#39;ll just need to build in an additional feature in your database, something like &quot;loggedIn&quot; as the field name, and change it to a 1&#x2F;0 depending on the status.</p>
