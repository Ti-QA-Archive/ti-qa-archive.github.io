			<h1>How can I get the raw binary data for an image?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m allowing a user to select an image from the photo gallery. I need to post the binary image data to a server as an &quot;application&#x2F;octet-stream&quot; part of multipart form data. It cannot be base64 encoded, it must be the raw binary image data. There appears to be no way of getting the data I need out from the Titanium.Blob. I&#39;ve even tried writing the image to a file and reading it back into a Titanium.Buffer. There also appears to be no way of getting the binary data out of that.</p>
<p>There are also some peculiarities when writing the binary image data to a file. The return value of write() is false but the file does actually get created correctly and it is the image. If I write text it works fine but if I write binary it says it fails. I can see the size and every possible aspect of the image when it&#39;s in the Buffer or Blob but I cannot get the binary data out of it.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried every possible way that I can think of and no luck. Anyone have any success in doing this?</p>
