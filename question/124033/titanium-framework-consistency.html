			<p>Hi all.</p>
<p>This is related to this issue: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-4945">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-4945</a> but can be applied on number of other issues.</p>
<p>Now … what bugs me is that change in behavior is considered normal in minor releases. Before SDK 1.7.2 we had one behavior, 1.7.2 (minor release) introduced different behavior. Can anyone explain to me is Titanium versioning different from common practice?</p>
<p>Also, I have concern about informing users about this kind of changes. The thing is that I (and I suppose others also) think this is a bug and for every this kind of situation, I need to isolate the issue so I can report it. Sometimes this is trivial thing to do, but most of the time it is very hard thing to do because applications can be very complex and debugging options are very limited. So, I spend a lot of time in isolating bugs and, regarding that, I think that it would be nice if Titanium core developers would be more informative about changes in behavior. JIRA is useful, but it&#39;s hard to track important changes.</p>

<p>Thank you for raising these points, and for the ticket. I will bring it to the attention of the core team. I hope I can rely on your patience, to give them time to respond.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>

<p>I&#39;m a little confused about this. As far as I am aware, the behavior has always been as per <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-4945?focusedCommentId=162344&amp;page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-162344">my comment</a>. If you disagree, would you mind stating exactly what was the behavior before, and in which release?</p>
<p>The core devs always keep in mind the way their changes will affect apps already out in the wild, and I hope it goes without saying that they avoid making changes that would break those apps.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s work through TIMOB-4945 as an example, so that we can better demonstrate your concerns to the core team.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

										<p><p>Paul,</p>
<p>as I said, this behavior changed after 1.7.2 release. </p>
<p>I did some testing now and I&#39;ve found some new info about this issue, but the principle is the same. I discovered that &quot;modal&quot; property has influence on navbar, not &quot;fullscreen&quot;. Anyway …</p>
<p>Before, setting &quot;modal&quot; property to &quot;true&quot; would hide navbar, after 1.7.2 release you needed to explicitly define &quot;navBarHidden&quot; property to hide navbar.</p>
<p>Test with this example (Android 2.2, Windows XP):</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> win</span> = Ti.UI.createWindow({
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    modal: <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
});

win.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>();
</code></pre><p>1.6.3 -&gt; navbar hidden</p>
<p>1.7.1 -&gt; navbar hidden</p>
<p>1.7.2 -&gt; navbar shown</p>
<p>It&#39;s like default setting changed.</p>
<p>There are more examples, but I don&#39;t have time to find them and present them to you.</p>
<p>My other concern is this:</p>
<p>1.7 release: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;06&#x2F;introducing-titanium-studio.html">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;06&#x2F;introducing-titanium-studio.html</a></p>
<p>blog post about new layout mechanism: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;06&#x2F;new-defaults-for-android-layouts-in-1-7.html">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;06&#x2F;new-defaults-for-android-layouts-in-1-7.html</a></p>
<p>See the dates … 11 days users didn&#39;t know about new layout mechanism in Android. Anyone who upgraded SDK did have &quot;WTF&quot; moment. I think blog post about new layout mechanism should be posted <strong>before</strong> SDK was released, not after so people can prepare and make changes in their code if they are necessary. That would save a lot of developer&#39;s time and nerves.</p>
<p>See other software products and frameworks and how are they releasing versions, this is common practice, I&#39;m not asking nothing that is strange or new.</p>
<p>I hope that now you understand my concerns. :)</p>
