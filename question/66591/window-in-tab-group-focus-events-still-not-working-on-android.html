			<h1>Window in tab group focus events still not working on Android</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am on the latest SDK (1.4.1.1) and the latest Titanium tool. I am building this app on my Mac. I noticed that, on Android, window focus events were not being called when the window is in a tab group. There are several other posts here that have been &quot;answered&quot; and tickets that are marked &quot;resolved&quot; but the issue remains. Can anyone explain what&#39;s going on? Maybe provide a valid work-around&#x2F;fix?</p>

							<p>1.4.1.1 is the same as 1.4.0 as far as the functionality on device. The blog <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2010&#x2F;09&#x2F;titanium-mobile-1-4-1-for-osx-only.html">post</a> clearly stated that this was a tooling only release for iPhone,. Many defect fixes and features are being continuously added to Android. You are welcome to use a continuous integration build, look in the Programming Guides section for documentation. </p>

							<p>I have the same issue.  The <em>first</em> focus event on a tabbed window does not trigger the focus event handler, but if you move to another tab then come back, it will trigger.  I am using 1.4.1.1 on Mac OS X with Android API 2.2.  I also tried Ti 1.5, but had so many errors trying to get the app to build&#x2F;run I gave up.</p>

										<p><p>I just managed to get Ti 1.5 working for Android, and found that the focus handler is now working with the build from Nov 4 off github.  However, it looks like it may be firing twice (I&#39;m seeing two debug FOCUS messages in the console).</p>

										<p><p>It never worked for me, so instead I ended up going with a combination of the tabGroup:focus event, as well as custom events thrown from a child window upon close (to notify parent to refresh, etc.)</p>
