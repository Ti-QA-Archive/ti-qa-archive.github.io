			<h1>What causes 2 emulators to launch?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>This has pretty much happened since I started with Titanium a couple years ago. Sometimes when I launch, two iOS emulators launch. One will say &quot;You cant have two running at the same time.&quot; with a quit button. It doesn&#39;t effect anything. It&#39;s just starting to get annoying. It happens like 1 out of 5 launches.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>This used to happen to me in the past, no longer though.  I am not sure if it stopped because I now have a faster mac or a newer Studio version and Titanium SDK version.</p>
<p>You are correct it does not cause any issues, it comes down to the sub-system initiating a start process on the simulator but in case it fails to launch it listens out for a success.  If that is not detected it tries starting a new one so you end up with a simulator.  Sometimes when the first fire command is called there is a delay long enough for the system to think that process request failed so it starts the second request process.  However the first one did not fail and was simply slower than expected so it finishes and you end up with two.</p>
<p>Weird but not a problem.</p>
