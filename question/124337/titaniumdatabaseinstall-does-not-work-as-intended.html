			<h1>Titanium.Database.install does not work as intended...</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>After fighting with my project for most of the day because I changed a data value in my database and just couldn&#39;t get Titanium Studio to pick it up when rebuilding my project, I have concluded that Titanium.Database.install does NOT work as per the documentation:</p>
<p>The documentation says &quot;install a database from the application Resources folder (at build time) and return a reference to the opened database&quot;.</p>
<p>It doesn&#39;t. If you have run your project before then a copy of the then-current database will be cached in either the iPhone simulator or android emulator. You&#39;ll need to reset this cache (iPhone simulator &quot;Reset Contents an Settings&quot;, android emulator just delete the virtual devices you&#39;ve set up and start again), delete your build folders in your Titanium workspace, probably also restart Titanium Studio and then run again. </p>
<p>You should then pick up the latest copy of your database from the Resources folder.</p>
<p>Apart from suggesting that the powers that be reword the documentation AND remove the fluffiness about the difference between Titanium.Database.install and Titanium.Database.open, I hope that this post will be of use to anybody else who&#39;s found themselves pulling their hair out cleaning their projects and deleting to no avail.</p>
<p>This seems like a huge fail in the design of Titanium Studio and the API: If it&#39;s not actually possible for install to work as documented then just give us a simple open statement that does and include notes on how to empty cache.</p>

							<p>I agree that the documentation could be more specific, But… it does clearly state that it will install IF the database does not exist already</p>
<p>&gt;install a database from the application Resources folder (at build time) and return a reference to the opened database. it is safe to call this method multiple times since this method will only install once if it doesn&#39;t already exist on the device. </p>

<p>the documentation could be more specific on how to actually remove the existing install, and thanks for including it in your comment above</p>
