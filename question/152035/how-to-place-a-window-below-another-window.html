			<h1>How to place a window below another window</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have an alloy application with (simplified) 2 controllers and 2 views. View 1 = index, View 2 = settings. I&#39;m trying to detect a swipe on the index window and then show the settings window BELOW the index window, by using an animation.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve used the zIndex property (which is documented on the website here) on the windows, but they are ignored. The window I open last (in this case the settings window) will always appear on top of the index window.</p>
<p>Can somebody tell me how I can open the settings window BELOW the index window? I&#39;m using alloy.</p>
<p>Thanks for helping out!</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Whilst I have not done this in Alloy, the principle should be the same;</p>
<ul>
<li>Create and open your settings window, leave the visibility as false</li>
<li>Open the main window above the main window</li>
<li>On the event of open for the main window - make the settings window visible</li>
</ul>
<p>Then simply use your animations.  The idea here is the windows are added in order so the first one is the lowest in the visual stack, the most recent is the topmost.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the suggestion Malcolm. I&#39;d like to close the window when a users swipes the settings screen away to save memory. That would require me to open the settings window again at a later point in time, causing it to go on top again isn&#39;t it? Should I then always load the settings screen and never close it, simply because the order cannot be changed afterwards?</p>

										<p><p>I agree with the logic of memory handling, but I balance this with speed of UI.</p>
<p>The app I use this on keeps a left window and right window &quot;hidden&quot; under the main window.  These are revealed as required - but left in context.  These &quot;hidden&quot; windows have a rich UI, but a considered one at the same time - nothing too heavy, well presented standard UI elements for example.</p>
<p>The delay in loading and the animation of sliding starting is too much - particularly on older devices.  Whilst the delay is minimal when the window is not loaded, it is still not perfect.</p>
<p>Remember you can remove the contents of the windows when not in use if you want - that will remove most of the memory.</p>

										<p><p>ok that makes sense. Too bad one can&#39;t remove and re-load the window only when needed but I&#39;m gonna give this a try and report back! Thanks for the tips</p>
