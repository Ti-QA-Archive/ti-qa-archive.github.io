			<h1>Brandable iPhone app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, I&#39;m about to embark on my first iOS&#x2F;Android app using titanium and before I get started I&#39;d just like to verify that a couple of things will be possible using the platform:</p>
<p>1) My client requires that I create an app that will be brandable&#x2F;configurable by various different businesses, to use as their own. Is it possible to do this by, for example, dynamically creating a different app key depending on which business is using the base app?</p>
<p>2) If this is possible, will apple allow the various users to add their branded app to the app store. Or would they consider this spam because all the apps are essentially the same&#x2F;similar?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any advice or pointers.</p>
<p>Carl</p>

							<p>There are  plenty of horror stories around about this.  Apple will eventually pull your app as essentially being spam if you keep on re-releasing it rebranded but with the same functionality.  Apple insist that either you use a main app and add the other brandings as &quot;in-app&quot; enhancements (usually not possible), or you ensure that each rebrand of the app is done under a separate IOS developer license, paid for by each fo the rebranding customers.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Nick, thanks for your response. I had a feeling this would be the case but needed to get a fast definite answer to my client. I had initially planned to do this using in-app enhancements, as you call them, and am wondering why this is usually not possible? </p>
<p>Basically the app will be linked to a service that offers webpages to certain types of businesses, all of which will be running on the same domain, DB, etc.. So my idea of how this would work was that when the app is started it will make a connection to the server, sending a user id, and retrieving the relevant logo, branding and content. Can you see problems in taking this approach? Thanks again. C</p>

										<p><p>Hi,  I only say usually not possible because the other &quot;brandee&#39;s&quot; dont want to be just an in-app purchase - they want a whitelabel version all for themselves.  Perhaps not a problem for yor clients ?</p>

										<p><p>Also, be wary of just creating an webview based app - Apple will reject it if it does not contain native functionality as well.</p>
