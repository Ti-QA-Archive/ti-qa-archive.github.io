							<p>I just received one today, when someone supplied an answer to a question I asked.  Therefore, I&#39;m guessing that you should receive one as a result of my posting this answer. :)</p>
<p>I have never received one when someone replies to a question that I&#39;m &quot;involved in&quot; due to having joined in the thread.</p>

										<p><p>Todd and Peter, you are both correct.</p>
<p>Further to this, I clicked on the &quot;android&quot; tag yesterday and am now receiving all new questions that are tagged with it. Surely there are very few people who would find this feature useful? I certainly don&#39;t want random people emailing me their new problems, especially when others have provided satisfactory answers to most issues within a short time. To me, the Q&amp;A then becomes an imposition, rather than something you can dip in and out of when you have the time.</p>
<p>The result of this is that the emphasis of this Q&amp;A system is on the &quot;askers&quot; rather than the &quot;helpers&quot; which, to me, is the wrong balance.  All the threads to which I have contributed, often requesting more information with the intention of returning when the asker has provided it, are so difficult to manage as I have to explicitly check each and every one for updates. Typically, the asker has &quot;moved on&quot; and so does not respond, so clicking on and reading through every thread listed in &quot;My Q&amp;A&quot; is very time-consuming and sometimes serves no benefit.</p>
