			<h1>Backgroundservices on iOS7</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello developers,</p>
<p>In a project I&#39;m using Titanium.App.iOS.BackgroundService to determine the position of the device after the app is closed. Like most of the Titanium developers I&#39;m facing the issue that after 3 minutes the backgroundservice is killed by the OS (iOS7). Note that this is on the device, in the simulator the backgroundservice doesn&#39;t get killed.</p>
<p>This is default behaviour of iOS7 and can be altered by adding the right parameters (UIBackgroundModes) to the <em>info.plist</em>. All this can be found around the forum. I tried serveral solutions mentioned around here but unfortunately there is no working solution for this issue. There is a <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-14658">Jira ticket for this</a>. </p>
<p>On StackOverflow I found that xCode developers are also facing this problem. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;18946881&#x2F;background-location-services-not-working-in-ios-7&#x2F;21966662#21966662">They found a solution here</a>. Basically they are restarting the background service every minute to keep it alive. As far as I know this is not possible with the Titanium API.</p>
<p>Is there someone who has solved this within Titanium or can provide me more information on how to get this solved (module, workaround, etc.)?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

							<p>Absolutely no problem using background location on iOS6 and 7 on simulator AND device. I was testing an app today that was running for hours (still is) and reporting back location changes.</p>
<p>The trick with background location is </p>
<p>a) ensuring you&#39;ve set background modes in the TiApp.xml, cleaned the project, deleted and redeployed the app</p>
<p>b) do NOT use a background service (bg.js examples etc), do everything in app, and here&#39;s the crucial bit</p>
<p>c) START the location event handler BEFORE the app is put into the background. Once you do that, the event is set and will continue to fire passed 3, 10 , 60 minutes and hours later.</p>
<p>I also use background fetch as a way to ensure the app is restarted on reboot &#x2F; crash. So <em>unless</em> the user has specifically stopped the app, so for a reboot, battery loss, or OS crash etc, background fetch will kick in soon after the phone restarts and this will kick off the location updates again.</p>
<p>Have tested on device, run it for hours in the background without a problem and location updates are not only ccaptured but I use a local notification to debug &#x2F; log the changes whilst testing and get these throughout the day as my location changes.</p>

										<p><p>Jason,</p>
<p>Thanks for the above comment as I&#39;m having a painful issue trying to get background location to work properly. As stated in the original question, my app stops processing a bkgrd service (after the app has exited) after 3 mins. I&#39;m trying to follow your instructions above but am a little confused. Do you mind clarifying a few things?</p>
<p>Above, you say &quot;do NOT use a background service, do everything in app.&quot; Can you elaborate on that?  I don&#39;t know what you mean by &quot;doing everything in the app.&quot;</p>
<p>Also, when you say &quot;start the location event handler BEFORE the app is in the bkgrd,&quot; are you referring to adding this line of code - Ti.App.addEventListener(&#39;pause&#39;, function(){ }) ?</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated as I&#39;m going nuts about getting the background service to work properly. Thanks in advance!</p>

										<p><p>Thank you for your solution Jason! Can you provide us with some example code? I&#39;m especially not sure about the implementation of my code mentioned at point C. </p>
<p>It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve seen this solution and I really hope I can get this to work.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

										<p><p>Forget about pause and resume events, I&#39;m not using these.</p>
<p>All you have to do is ensure that you create your location event-handler in the app, (I&#39;m doing mine in the index controller in Alloy by invoking a library called gps which I&#39;ve used to wrap the location handling services).</p>
<p>As long as you do that (so a location event is created and starts firing) then when the app is backgrounded, it will continue to fire. Don&#39;t use the Titanium.App.iOS.BackgroundService methods, don&#39;t have a separate js file that runs as a background service. Just add the code to your app, ensure the location event handler is created immediately and that&#39;s it!</p>

										<p><p>Thank you again for the explanation! I tried to implement this but again with no success. I used the basic eventlistener… </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Ti.Geolocation.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">"location"</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">handler</span>);
</code></pre><p>which fires once, then I tried to fire the location event myself (<em>fireEvent</em>) but with no succes. Also using the <em>heading</em> event didn&#39;t gave the desired results. </p>
<p>In my original code I used <em>setInterval()</em> which works to retrieve the location with the specified interval but when the app is put in background it stops (obviously). </p>
<p>So for now despite all the explanations and not using backgroundservices I still didn&#39;t get something like you suggested to work :(. </p>
<p>So an example would be appreciated!</p>

										<p><p>Lots - me that&#39;s all you need - location event should be picking up location changes - how are you testing this, on sim or device? What plaform, iOS&#x2F;Android?</p>

										<p><p>I figured that I should test it on the device to get a location change (not done that yet). But in an earlier comment you mentioned that your solution worked on the device AND simulator as well.</p>
<p>In my initial post I explained it was an issue with iOS7 so I guess that is what I&#39;m using at the moment ;)</p>

										<p><p>I got it working and actually it&#39;s very simple! So for everbody who is looking for an solution for background services on iOS just try this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> trackingEnabled             = <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>;
Ti.Geolocation.purpose         = <span class="hljs-string">"Determine device location"</span>;
Ti.Geolocation.accuracy         = Ti.Geolocation.ACCURACY_HIGH;
Ti.Geolocation.distanceFilter     = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;     

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> tracking = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{

     <span class="hljs-comment">// Only update location is app is paused</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(trackingEnabled)
    {
        <span class="hljs-comment">// Do some server stuff...</span>
           Ti.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">"Location: "</span> + e.coords.timestamp);
    }
};

<span class="hljs-comment">// Add eventlistener on location</span>
Ti.Geolocation.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">"location"</span>, tracking);

<span class="hljs-comment">// App is paused</span>
Ti.App.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">"pause"</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span>{ 
    trackingEnabled = <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>; 
});

<span class="hljs-comment">// App is resumed</span>
