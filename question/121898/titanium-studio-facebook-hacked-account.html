			<h1>Titanium Studio, Facebook hacked account</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Has anyone experienced, while using Titanium Studio, a hack on their Facebook account?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been logged in to my Facebook account while using Titanium Studio on my mac and I&#39;m seeing a lot of strange activity.</p>
<p>I get e-mails from my facebook security settings with an enclosed message that I&#39;ve requested a password change, which I have not.</p>
<p>Then once I recover my account I see that a &#39;workspace&#39; has changed my password and logged in to my account from my IP address.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure if anyone else has experienced this or if TS is only the &#39;host&#39; in the attack.</p>
<p>Either way I would like to know of a way to prevent this from happening.  Obviously, logging out of FB would probably work, but the fact that TS is either the host or seemingly involved in the hack is very troubling.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

							<p>I&#39;m sorry to hear that&#39;s happened. Thank you for alerting us. We&#39;re pretty stumped how it could even be possible with Titanium Studio. One thought is password sniffing, but we use Eclipse&#39;s encrypted secure storage mechanism for password storage, and we send all authentication requests over HTTPS, so that basically eliminates that attack possibility.</p>
<p>We&#39;d like to investigate regardless. Could you please file a ticket here with any log files (Help &gt; Titanium Studio &gt; View Log File), relevant screen shots of the emails, and what projects were you working on. I would be interested to know if any of them were web projects or mobile projects, if you had been previewing them, and if they involved any Facebook integration.</p>

							<p>Guys, so sorry to get back to this issue.  I had a major problem that is unrelated to this issue that kept me busy.</p>
<p>I have not left TiStudio and FF open (while logged into Facebook) since the second incident.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve taken a few other security measures to prevent any future attempts.</p>
<p>I&#39;m creating a new Facebook account to test.  I&#39;ll post any log files and findings.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>JDH</p>
