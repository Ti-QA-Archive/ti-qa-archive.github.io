			<h1>Why does Appcelerator not support beta software?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>We&#39;ve noticed in the Q&amp;A lately that some folks are reporting issues with beta versions of the platforms we support. We thought we should take a moment to remind folks that we don&#39;t officially support beta versions of the iOS or Android OSes in our released versions of Titanium Mobile.</p>
<p>Here is why:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Software that is in beta has bugs - we try not to spend our limited resources addressing issues in software still under development.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A lot of software that is in beta is usually under some kind of NDA (especial software from Apple) - pushing code to our open source repositories referencing beta software could (at least potentially) land us in trouble.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will support things like new operating systems, and Xcode versions once they are released, but again, we won&#39;t be able to offer official support in Titanium for beta releases. As such, it would be a big help to us if folks could refrain from creating bug reports or creating support topics for beta software before Titanium supports it. However, we will as always do our best to help folks out on platforms and tools that are GA (Generally Available) released. Thanks!</p>

<p>Just to clarify Matt&#39;s statement, this means that OSes and dev components, such as Xcode, are unlikely to be supported before they have been officially released. After this, once we have properly tested them, they will be added to our <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Titanium+Compatibility+Matrix">Titanium Compatibility Matrix</a>. This document provides the definitive information about what we currently support.</p>
