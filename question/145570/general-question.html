							<p>Dharmik,</p>
<p>Email me at community [at] appcelerator with proof of certification (you should have gotten a certificate with an id number) and I&#39;ll make sure that your account is updated accordingly.</p>

							<p>When you took the exam, did you use the same email address as you use to log onto Studio? (That&#39;s also the address you use to log onto the Developer Center&#x2F;QA forums) If so, results should be reflected automatically in your account. If you did not, your score results must be manually marked in your account. </p>
<p>This is by far the most common reason for certified developers not being listed in DevLink. Please, those of you reading this thread later, please use your Studio&#x2F;DevLink email address when taking your exams. The instructions on the exam ask you to do so, but those instructions are frequently ignored.</p>
<p>If you used an alternate mail, you&#39;ll need to email training@appcelerator.com with the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The email you took the exam under</li>
<li>Your DevLink email address</li>
<li>Proof of your score results (the summary email or the link to the certificate provided in that email)</li>
<li>A 300-word essay on why you didn&#39;t follow the instructions on the exam that asked you to use your DevLink email address….just kidding on this last one. :o)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two other frequent problems we see leading to people not being listed. These might not apply specifically to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>People don&#39;t sufficiently fill out their DevLink profiles and are thus not listed on the site at all. You have to complete your profile to an 80% completion level before you&#39;re listed. The &quot;completion meter&quot; will tell you when you&#39;ve provided enough information.</li>
<li>People leave the &quot;Show in DevLink&quot; option set to &quot;No&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>One last tip, if you tag your questions with the &quot;certification&quot; or &quot;training&quot; tags, the Appcelerator training team will get notification. I found this thread by chance. I&#39;d rather you folks tagged the questions so I&#39;m notified and can respond in a timely manner.</p>

							<p>You are on <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;devlink&#x2F;143">page 143</a>. Your account just hasn&#39;t been updated yet.  You will probably move to around <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;devlink&#x2F;34">page 34</a> or so then.</p>

							<p>My advice to you would be to have patience. Things will work out themselves eventually once the informaiton is propagated throughout all Appcelerator systems.</p>
<p>But, to be honest, while it is always nice to have those <em>&quot;badges&quot;</em> on your profile. I fail to see why this troubles you that much.</p>

										<p><p>As I explained, this task is done automatically and the badge will show up over time. If after a few weeks you still don&#39;t see it, then I suggest you contact  the community managers at community[at]appceletator.com . They&#39;ll straighten this out for you.</p>
<p>But I have to ask, why is this badge (a png) so important to you at this stage?</p>
