		<section>
			<p>With the deprecation of Ti Developer and introduction of Ti Studio, The 6-hour training course &quot;Building Native Mobile Apps With Titanium&quot; provided with a paid indie subscription is now out of date and not really of much use. Just saying.</p>

							<div><p>I tend to disagree - the videos focus on the code anyway, which is the same, as opposed to focusing on the tool used to run the code.  For info on Ti Studio there is documentation.</p>

							<div><p>But the videos a very confusing because they reference Ti Developer.  Why wast hours of a developers time showing then misleading information? In my opinion Ti Studio should never have been completely replace Ti Dev without proper training materials and documentation.</p>

							<p>The primary focus of the training course is on coding mobile applications with Titanium, not necessarily the tooling used to do so. I&#39;d hardly call that useless.<br>Studio does everything that Developer did, and the code doesn&#39;t change because the IDE did.</p>
<p>This does not mean that we are not working on new and updated training tools, but I believe that saying that the current training materials along with the current Studio documentation is of no use would be a bit drastic. We will constantly be working on docs and training and updating everything as we go but the core of how things work won&#39;t be rendered useless overnight.</p>
