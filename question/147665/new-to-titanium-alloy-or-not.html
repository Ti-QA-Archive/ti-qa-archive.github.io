			<h1>New to Titanium: Alloy or Not?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m new to Titanium. &quot;Traditional&quot; Titanium development looks easy enough and there are tons of code samples. Alloy appears to be the new hotness but it seems to be more complicated (node, file creep, etc). Should I stick with &quot;traditional&quot; Titanium development approach or force myself to use Alloy?</p>

							<p>This very much describes the scenario I&#39;m in too (but I&#39;m a bit further ahead with my stuff). I went the older, js route. </p>
<p>My reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Way more examples and useable code out there.</li>
<li>Usually when I end up doing stuff using code anyway (like in Cocoa, and other UI frameworks in the past). It often is the only way to achieve the dynamic UI&#39;s that I want to create.</li>
<li>Alloy is <em>VERY</em> new. </li>
<li>Alloy certainly has a steeper learning curve.</li>
</ul>
<p>I know there are are some good reasons to use alloy. I&#39;m personally a huge fan of node.js so that would be nice (and wish even their older stuff would incorporate it). Alloy makes your code more structured by default, otherwise you need to be careful (especially if you haven&#39;t written applications in js before).</p>
<p>In the end I&#39;m happy with my decision. The biggest challenge so far has just been unexpected behavior across the platforms (mostly Android really).</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve been using traditional Titanium for about a year now. I made a switch to Alloy a month ago. After the initial learning curve, I find Alloy 100% easier for cross-platform (iOS and Android) code and form-factor (handheld and tablet) specific code. Nearly all of the platform and form factor specific UI code that used to be in my JS files are now in xml and tss files.</p>

							<p>As far as i think new Alloy technology is far far good than previous one in which you have to do everything in js file.It has enabled the mvc structure which is really helpful in maintaining the code and could be called as the good programming techniques but if u are new then as start you could take the help of earlier method and then when you think you are expert and you can manage it easily.you could shift towards it</p>

							<p>I studied Alloy for a couple of weeks and it seems fine..</p>
<p>But, the problem is that it is relevantly new to titanium so you will have a hard time learning it (even if you have an xml-html background). Also, Alloy is not worth using for small projects with few screens..</p>
<p>Where you should use Alloy? In big projects, where themes and customisability is a must and in projects that will need a daily maintenance.. Why? Alloy is easy to maintain, and very customisable..</p>
<p>One more drawback, not &#39;strong&#39; enough community to support you in big alloy programs since few are very experienced in it..</p>
<p>YOU CHOOSE!!</p>

							<p>If you have a decent handle on javascript, I&#39;d stick with that, and learn Alloy later…I gave it a shot, but I dont have time to learn another framework</p>
