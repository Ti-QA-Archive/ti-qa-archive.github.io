I have mobilesdk 1.5.1 Titanium 1.2.2 (All Up to date). Also I checked my iphone sdk and provisioning profile as well more than thousand times. I checked images and made sure every single one of them were PNG files as well.<br>Please… I cannot figure out what is wrong with Titanium…<br>Thank you in advance and please help me..</p>

							<p>One trick you can try is to create a new project and then when it is created add all the files from the resources folder to the new one.<br>I had to do that today, I must have corrupted something.  I couldn&#39;t get emulator for android to work.  But after doing that it worked fine.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m having the exact same problem. Also tried everything, trashing Build files, copying resources, deleting from Titanium, creating new project and pasting resources there, reinstalling… Even clean install on another Mac, none worked.</p>
<p>I&#39;m looking forward to working with Titanium but so far I&#39;m having a very bad experience.<br>Hope you can sort this out. If I do I&#39;ll let you know.</p>

							<p>Hi Justin,</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if this will help or not, but I was having a similar problem yesterday and found a way past it.</p>
<p>In my case, I traced the problem to my deciding to use a regular expression in my app.  This shouldn&#39;t be a problem, but for some reason it is.</p>
<p>When I wrote it like this, it worked fine in the simulator but would give install errors when trying to deploy to my iPhone.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> exp = <span class="hljs-regexp">/blahblahblah/</span>;
</code></pre><p>When I changed it to this the install error went away but I&#39;d get a red screen error in the simulator.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> exp = RegEx(<span class="hljs-string">'blahblahblah'</span>);
</code></pre><p>BUT, even thought it did install to my iPhone the app would halt when it hit that line, so it wasn&#39;t really working, it just wouldn&#39;t crash.  LOL</p>
<p>So for my app, I got rid of the regular expression completely and am using string.indexOf instead and now things work as expected.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>I would always quote the regexp, and have never had any issues with it.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> exp</span> = <span class="hljs-string">"/blahblahblah/"</span>;

							<p>I am experiencing the same problem. I wanted to add that after attempting to import the app into iTunes and receiving the same error, I am then unable to open the app in the emulator, receiving the following error:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[<span class="hljs-keyword">ERROR</span>] Script <span class="hljs-keyword">Error</span> = Result of expression 'Titanium.UI.iPhone' [undefined] is not <span class="hljs-keyword">an</span> object. at <span class="hljs-keyword">app</span>.js (<span class="hljs-keyword">line</span> 1).
2011-01-06 14:14:56.129 Bongo[6776:207] The <span class="hljs-keyword">view</span> controller &lt;TiRootViewController: 0x7309590&gt; returned <span class="hljs-keyword">NO</span> from -shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation: <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> all interface orientations. It should support at least <span class="hljs-keyword">one</span> orientation.
</code></pre><p>Before trying to import into iTunes, it worked perfectly in the emulator, so something when trying to compile for iTunes breaks the app. The only way to fix it is to delete the build folder and rebuild which gets the emulator working again.</p>

<p>Hey guys I found out the problem. It was my appicon.png and Default.png that weren&#39;t actually png….</p>
<p>So people who have same problem as me should definitely go to &#x2F;build&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;build&#x2F;build.log and find out your </p>
<p>flaws and if it says something about images or icons definitely convert your photo to png. ( I thought mine was</p>
<p>png too b&#x2F;c it had png extension and it said png on the &quot;Get Info&quot;.) </p>
<p>P.S: Special Thanks to Hal H</p>
