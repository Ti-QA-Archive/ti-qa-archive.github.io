			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This seems a common issue with no real resolution, but I seem to be having a problem this morning after applying some SDK updates.</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to build and run my mobile application in the iOS simulator as an iPhone 5 app.</p>
<p>Basically, I&#39;m getting the following error.</p>
<p>[DEBUG] Detecting modules in &#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;modules<br>[INFO] Titanium SDK version: 1.8.0.1 (12&#x2F;22&#x2F;11 13:09 fbdc96f)<br>[INFO] iPhone Device family: universal<br>[INFO] iPhone SDK version: 5.0<br>[INFO] iPhone simulated device: iphone<br>[ERROR]<br>[ERROR] Error: Traceback (most recent call last):<br>  File &quot;&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx&#x2F;1.8.0.1&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;builder.py&quot;, line 1274, in main<br>    execute_xcode(&quot;iphonesimulator%s&quot; % link_version,[&quot;GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS=<strong>LOG</strong>ID__=%s DEPLOYTYPE=development TI_DEVELOPMENT=1 DEBUG=1 TI_VERSION=%s %s %s&quot; % (log_id,sdk_version,debugstr,kroll_coverage)],False)<br>  File &quot;&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx&#x2F;1.8.0.1&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;builder.py&quot;, line 1180, in execute_xcode<br>    output = run.run(args,False,False,o)<br>  File &quot;&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx&#x2F;1.8.0.1&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;run.py&quot;, line 39, in run<br>    sys.exit(rc)<br>SystemExit: 65</p>
<p>Version wise, I&#39;m using:</p>
<p>Titanium Studio, build: 1.0.8.201201262211<br>(c) Copyright 2011 by Appcelerator, Inc.  All rights reserved.</p>
<p>Build: jenkins-titanium-rcp-master-136 (origin&#x2F;master)<br>Date: 26 January 2012, 22:14:21</p>
<p>I tried the various things suggested, such as Project-&gt;Clean, and removing my build folder.  These didn&#39;t work.  The other suggestions seem too extreme, i.e. removing XCode&#x2F;Titanium and reinstalling (which didn&#39;t always seem to work anyway), and creating a new user (this is the silliest suggestion yet, this user account is used for everything else too, not just Titanium, so why do that?).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also tried going to project properties and changing the Project Build Path to Titanium Mobile 1.8.1 (instead of 1.8.0.1), but still no joy.</p>
<p>Any assistance greatly appreciated, as this is my first outing with Titanium.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.<br>D.</p>

							<p>Hello Darren,</p>
<p>I had the same problem and my solution was to create new user, i posted here my problem and the solution of creating new user because 6 days i tried to do everything you can imagine and nothing helped!</p>
<p>i undrstand that this solution is realy silly but there wasnt another solution!</p>
<p>now i got at the morning an answer to this problem:</p>
<p>hey just found the solution, maybe you have tryed to keep your project &quot;clean&quot; an delete all unused files like LICENCE, README so thats why you get this error, just copy paste this files back from other project, and you can run in again!</p>
<p>try this one maybe it will help you!</p>
<p>lukc,<br>Eliza</p>

							<p>Thankyou for your responses.  I&#39;ve managed to get around the issue this time by renaming my project.  I right-clicked the project, selected rename, did a clean and rebuild, and it now seems fine.  Very strange.  Not ideal having to rename the project really, but at least I can continue after losing three hours ;)</p>
<p>Thanks once again.<br>D</p>
