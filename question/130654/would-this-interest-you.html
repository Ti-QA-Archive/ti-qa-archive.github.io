			<p>Hi Guys</p>
<p>Moderators please remove this if you feel it&#39;s not appropriate but the only people who can answer my question are the people in here.</p>
<p>Is it worth me spending hundreds of hours on the following…?</p>
<p>Like everybody here I love titanium and believe Appcelerator have done a great job in creating such an excellent development platform for us to use. Many great apps have been developed using titanium but I can&#39;t help but feel that many of them lack in the graphics department and need a little extra sparkle, after all we all know good looking apps attract more downloads.</p>
<p>Currently there are a few design templates in the marketplace but they where not designed and developed with titanium in mind, which makes them more difficult to integrate into your app.</p>
<p>My idea is to create a large range of design templates and design elements complete with video tutorials and code examples so you can more easily integrate them into your titanium apps. </p>
<p>The Template packages would include all the main design components you would need in an app including, icons, splash screens, buttons, tabs, badges, backgrounds and more, plus the psd photoshop and illustrator files so you can alter colours and anything else.</p>
<p>Initially I will create templates for the iPhone, followed by Android and the iPad.</p>
<p>The graphics will be of the highest quality and will cover many industry categories.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure of the price yet but each Template package will probably cost between $59 to $99 depending on how much I decide to put in each package.</p>
<p>Please let me know what your think.</p>
<p>I have created a mailing list so I can send updates to people if I decide to go ahead, based on the interest shown here. </p>
<p>You can add yourself to the list here -&gt; <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;eepurl.com&#x2F;irc1g">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;eepurl.com&#x2F;irc1g</a></p>
<p>Thank you for reading…</p>

							<p>I for one would purchase that pack. Being a coder I have a real eye for positioning and layout, but design and producing graphics a dead parrot has more talent than me.</p>
<p>So I am always on the look out for good application graphicacks, especially if they containing all the required sized icons and splash screens.</p>

										<p><p>Trevor,  I picked up the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;icons.empoc.com&#x2F;">Icons app</a> from the App Store.  Throw a 512x512 iTunes sized image and export your 3 iOS icon files, some extras, your androids and a few others.  Great little tool for the home stretch.</p>

							<p>Daryl,</p>
<p>I&#39;d purchase quality graphics packs from a reputable designer.  I can modify in photoshop, but I sure can&#39;t create.  I know whats not looking good, can point a designer in the right direction, but thats where it OUGHT to stop. <em>grin</em>  The chrome and leather packs in the marketplace right now won&#39;t ever work for anything we are working on.</p>

										<p><p>Cheers Stephen</p>
<p>Are the chrome and leather packs the type of style you&#39;d be looking for or would you prefer something more original as the chrome and leather are getting quite old these days. What type&#39;s of styles are your clients asking for at the moment?</p>

							<p>imho, not sure about $99… I think one could get a complete custom work for a bit more from 99designs or the likes.</p>

										<p><p>Not too sure about that. Looking at 99designs it looks like you need to pay at least $145 for a single icon design. You&#39;re then probably looking at another $600 to $900 (or more) for the same designer to continue the theme through all the other design elements you would need to complete your app UI and marketing graphics.</p>
