			<p>I am trying to create a form with both text and photo attachment that will be pushed to a remote server and handled there.</p>
<p>I have been able to create a form that pushed up to the server but when I try and add the photo component I get lost. Currently this code http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;1521726 allows a user to select a photo from either the camera or the photo gallery. I&#39;m just not sure how to add the selected photo to the information that will be sent to the server. </p>
<p>Basically how do I get the image content (which is called out with imageView.image = image;) into my form </p>
<pre><code class="hljs"> alert(contents);  
        // Create our HTTP Client and name it <span class="hljs-string">"createReq"</span>
        var createReq = Titanium.Network.createHTTPClient();

        createReq.open(<span class="hljs-string">"<span class="hljs-keyword">POST</span>"</span>,<span class="hljs-string">"http://example.com/"</span>);
        var params = {
            user_id: userId,
            title: title.value,
            ingredients: ingredients.value,
            directions: directions.value,
            notes: notes.value,
            photo: contents
        };
        createReq.send(params);
</code></pre><p>Any help would be appreciated. </p>

							<p>If line 195 is a image and your program is looking for an Event, you may need to do a full rebuild of your project to have the classes regenerated.  Follow the steps below to do so.</p>
<p>Have you tried updating your tiapp.xml file.  Just add a space in the tiapp.xml file, delete the space, and save again.</p>

										<p><p>fyi, you don&#39;t have to add space to your tiapp.xml file…just change the titanium sdk to a different version, hit save, then change it back to what you want and save again.</p>

							<p>In order for &quot;event&quot; to be valid, it must be used within the success callback of the showCamera() call.  In the original postie, that was lines 192-215.  As soon as that code block completes, &quot;event&quot; goes out of scope and it no longer valid.</p>
<p>Is the line 195 within the success callback?  If not, then during that callback save the contents of event.media somewhere else and reference it on your line 195 instead.</p>
<p>Or link to an update postie of drink_upload.js so we can see everything in context to give you a more accurate answer.</p>

										<p><p>Doug,</p>
<p>What your proposing sounds like what I was trying to do. Using the code from the orginal postie</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> image = event.media;
        <span class="hljs-comment">// set image view</span>
            imageView.image = image;
        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">tempFile</span> = Titanium.Filesystem.createTempFile();
        <span class="hljs-keyword">tempFile</span>.write(image);
        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> contents = <span class="hljs-keyword">tempFile</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">read</span>();
</code></pre><p>I thought that I was creating a temp file (tempFile) then adding the image to it (<code>tempFile.write(image);</code>) then creating a variable (contents) I could then call when I pushed to my server (line 121 of my postie  <code>photo: contents</code>.</p>
<p>Obviously I&#39;m missing something in how to save the image on success and call it back later.</p>

										<p><p>Forrest – I finally see what you are trying to do.  You don&#39;t need the temporary file at all.  The problem you are hitting is that you define variable contents within the success callback, lines 192-215 of the original <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;1521726">pastie</a> but then try to reference it in another code block around line 121.  However, variable &quot;contents&quot; is going out of scope when the success callback completes.</p>
<p>Add this near the top of the file, say around line 2:</p>
<p><code>var contents;</code></p>
<p>Now around line 213 change:</p>
<p><code>var contents = tempFile.read();</code> </p>
<p>to</p>
<p><code>contents = image;</code></p>
<p>And get rid of the temporary file stuff – you don&#39;t need it.  Actually, you could just define var image at the top of the file and use it instead of &quot;contents&quot;.  The whole problem is what is known as the &quot;scope&quot; of variables.  Those you define within a function are only valid during that function call.  Those you define at the top of the file persist their value across calls and are available throughout the *.js file.</p>
<p>For the same reason, you could not use &quot;event&quot; around line 121 either.  Here is one explanation of <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.webdevelopersnotes.com&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;javascript&#x2F;global_local_variables_scope_javascript.php3">scope</a>.</p>

										<p><p>Doug,</p>
<p>Thanks, I&#39;ve had scope issues in the past, still working on that.  I made those changes and now when I submit my alert shows I am submitting a [object TiBlob] which appears to be my image. Should my web server see this as a regular image file?</p>
