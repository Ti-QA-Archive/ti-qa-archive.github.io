			<p>Hey,<br>at the moment I&#39;m trying to use multiple scrollableViews above each other containing partial translucent images, so you can see all of them.</p>
<p>My problem is now, that you can&#39;t &#39;touch&#39; the lower views. What I want to do is, that when the user touches the top third of the screen, he can drag the topmost view, when he touches the bottom third of the screen, he can drag the lowest scrollable view.</p>
<p>If&#39;ve implemented this app already on iOS and when i did this, I just had to limit the height of the UIScrollViews, because in iOS a subview MAY be bigger then its superview, but then you can&#39;t touch the part which is not inside the superviews borders. That was exactly what I needed back then. In Titanium, when I reduce the height of the scrollable view, it also reduces the height of the imageviews inside the scrollable view.</p>
<p>If nobody has a better idea, i would use 3 scrollable views on top of 3 scrollviews containing the real images. The scrollable views listen to scroll events and forward them to the scrollviews. But this is pretty much code to write, and I don&#39;t want to do this when there may be easier possibilities ;)</p>
<p>Thank you for your help!</p>

							<p>have you tried something with touchEnabled property? I did something similar, it was a transparent canvas over a photo. When user wanted to change the photo (on the scrollableview), I set touchEnabled = false on the canvas, so any event went to the back layer.</p>
