			<h1>Is there a way to protect themselves from the iDevice Jailbreak?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello to all guys …<br>I am a developer and a user of the Jailbreak on the iDevice. Now I wonder if there is some trick to stop the hacking of our paid app store on other side, as Apptracks, Installous etc etc.</p>
<p>And &#39;possible to do all this? I ask because I&#39;ve already been a user on my blog telling me how to download an app from installous does not work on your device jailbrekkato, as was shown a warning message that does not disappear anymore and that made ??it unusable &#39;s app … unfortunately I do not remember which app it would be helpful ..</p>

							<p>We had a beta tester keep complaining that nothing we ever sent him would run.  Just hang at start up.  Learned he had jailbroken his ipad2.  Sure enough, Titanium apps wouldn&#39;t run.  Don&#39;t know the reason, don&#39;t know if it was just him.</p>

							<p>You are wrong.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not beceause his device is jailbreaked that your application will not work.</p>
<p>Your application don&#39;t work, that&#39;s all.</p>
<p>And you have to know : some people have a jailbreaked iDevice AND buy their apps.</p>
<p>Ridiculous.</p>

										<p><p>no, you do not understand me.<br>I told her that user&#39;s blog has informed me that on his jailbroken device has proven an application<br>that was paid and who has downloaded illegally, and the app once it has started showing the<br>message that the app was not legally acquired.</p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what he meant by his question. </p>
<p>When you say: <em>&quot;Your application don&#39;t work, that&#39;s all.&quot;</em> That&#39;s a pretty bold statement to make considering you have no idea of <strong>which</strong> application he is referring to and what it actually does.</p>
<p>So, if I may give you some advice, just take it down a notch will you. It will just make for a more enjoyable experience for everybody.</p>
