			<h1>Titanium Studio - Android Simulator doesn&#39;t work on Windows 7 x64</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Using Windows 7 x64 I&#39;m trying to get Titanium Studio working for the first time. I imported my 1.7 project into Titanium Studio (which works perfectly in Titanium Developer.) I made sure that the android build folder is empty. I try launching the Android Simulator from Ti Studio however this huge simulator window opens and it never opens the app. </p>
<p>Here is a screenshot of the weird android simulator:</p>

							<div><p>What Android version is your Run configuration set to use? The 1.7 builds have been rather unstable the last couple of days as we have been making some big changes and implementing a couple new features. Are you able to run other versions of the Android SDKs? I would be interested to know if that makes a difference.</p>

							<div><p>It&#39;s been three weeks and I couldn&#39;t setup Titanium Studio and Android Simulator. It seems Titanium &amp; Android Simulator couldn&#39;t run in Windows x64. I hope there will be a dedicated blog post How to setup Titanium and Android development in Windows x64. I googled, but there are no solutions for errors like Failed to Fetch URL or  [ERROR] Required jarsigner not found[ERROR] Required javac not found[ERROR] Required java not found[ERROR] One or more required files not found - please check your JAVA_HOME environment variable</p>

							<div><p>Those last few errors seem pretty self-explanatory, you need to install the JDK and add the path to the java bin folder to your PATH environment variable in control panel &gt; system &gt; environment variables.</p>

							<div><p>Yes, I did it, but nothing changed. I think someone from core deployment team should help us, since I know there are many other people having same problem. Now my only option is to install a VM that runs on windows 7 x86.</p>
