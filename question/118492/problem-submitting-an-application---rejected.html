			<p>Hi<br>I am trying to update my application, however, I am starting to have the following error</p>
<p>Missing Push Notification Entitlement - Your app registers with the Apple Push Notification Service, but the application signature&#39;s entitlements do not include the required &quot;aps-environment&quot; entitlement. Make sure you have enabled Push Notification Services for this app, and that you have downloaded a Distribution provisioning profile that includes the &quot;aps-environment&quot; entitlement. </p>
<p>I did not change anything on my apps, anyone knows why?</p>

							<p>The problem is not from Titanium but Apple,<br>refer to this link http:&#x2F;&#x2F;community.redfoundry.com&#x2F;redfoundry&#x2F;topics&#x2F;invalid_binary and it&#39;s work for me, </p>
<p>1) In your Provisioning Portal, click App IDs in the left-hand column.</p>
<p>2) Click &quot;Configure&quot; next to your relevant App ID.</p>
<p>3) Check the box that says something like &quot;Enable for Apple Push Notification Services&quot;.</p>
<p>4) Click &quot;Configure&quot; next to Production Push SSL Certificate.</p>
<p>5) Follow the instructions on-screen to create your Cert with the help of Apple&#39;s Keychain Access application.</p>
<p>6) Click &quot;Provisioning&quot; in your left-hand column.</p>
<p>7) Click &quot;Distribution&quot; tab. Delete your old provisioning for your app and create a new one.</p>
<p>8)Download it.</p>
<p>9) SIgn your app and submit!</p>
<p>10) ???</p>
<p>11) Profit!!! </p>

										<p><p>Yes, but the nicer way on Appcelerators side would be to generate a binary which doesnt contain any push notification code if you actually didnt use it…</p>

										<p><p>tiapp.xml is clean, my only thing i can think of is that i installed titanium studio in between updates but I am not using it. is it possible that titanium studio manipulated any core files that titanium developer uses?</p>

										<p><p>Hopefully, once the Titanium team see these reports, there will be a loud &#39;facepalm&#39; moment, followed by a swift fix&#x2F;update. Either that, or a loud &#39;growl&#39; at Apple for changing something beyond their control. ;)</p>

										<p><p>Then that settles it…it must be apple…I was on the phone with them for 20 min and no one would do anything to look into the problem.  Everyday apple makes me ask myself &quot;why am i developing for them?&quot;</p>
