			<h1>Titanium ignores my @2x icon file when building the iPhone xcode project</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>The title pretty much says it all. I have supplied an appicon.png ( 57x57px ) and an appicon@2x (114x114px). </p>
<p>The generated xcode project&#39;s Info.plist references both files, so that&#39;s good.</p>
<p>But: Titanium <strong>never copies</strong> appicon@2x to the generated xcode project&#39;s Resources folder. It copies appicon.png, Default.png and Default@2x.png - but silently ignores appicon@2x.png</p>
<p>Any idea what I need to do?</p>
<p>Right now, obviously, I&#39;m manually copying the file. But that&#39;s a <em>bandaid</em>: I would prefer to have Titanium copy the file as part of the build process.</p>

							<p>After much searching, I found <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;117722&#x2F;appicon-on-iphone-not-working.html#answer-205022">this post</a></p>
<p>As a blind stab in the dark I renamed appicon.png and appicon@2x.png to Icon.png and Icon@2x.png and now both are correctly copied into my generated application bundle.</p>
<p>I have <strong>no idead why this works</strong> and it seems like a bug to me.</p>

										<p><p>It&#39;s not a bug. If you want to specify custom-named icons, you would have to modify your Info.plist file accordingly.</p>

										<p><p>How is this a bug? When I used the &quot;default&quot; appicon.png (provided when I created the project) Titanium refused to copy over appicon@2x.png. <strong>But the generated Info.plist correctly listed both</strong> , as I mentioned in the original post.</p>
<p>But when I renamed it to Icon.png and Icon@2x.png, Titanium still correctly generates Info.plist, but now it copies the files over, too.</p>
<p>Seems like a bug to me.</p>

										<p><p>It was the default appicon.png in Resources&#x2F;iphone - I&#39;d copied over it with my artwork, and created an appicon@2x.png alongside it with my retina icon artwork.</p>
<p>If the correct place to put iPhone icons is in the Resources&#x2F; root folder instead of Resources&#x2F;iphone, it seems to me that the default project template is buggy, or at the very least, misleading in a nasty way!</p>

										<p><p>in Android you have the 9-patch system, where any file named .9.png is preferred over it&#39;s normally-named counterpart: test.9.png should be chosen before test.png.</p>
<p>Ti does the opposite</p>
<p>You can also put a generic image, a platform specific image and a platform&#x2F;resolution specific image in your folder structure. Ti will always take the generic first, then the platform-specific and lastly the platform&#x2F;resolution specific. This means that if you want specific images for one or two resolutions, you have to do ALL resolutions, totally counter-productive and wiping out 95% of the advantages of the native Android image system.</p>
<p>Developer-workflow is a sadly neglected aspect of Ti, and a lot of hours are wasted on fighting it …</p>
<p>I keep mentioning it when I can, because in my daily work, the workflow is the big killer, taking the joy out of working and adding hours of unproductive work to my projects, and I have not seen appcelerator acknowledging this yet … and it might end with my company totally abandoning Ti. Only reason we&#39;re still using it, is my being stubborn, and I am about to give up honestly - I have clients that expect good work from me, and I keep sending them prototypes of perfectly working code that gets packaged wrong. Adding another hour or so with testing of code that I have already tested 100s of times.</p>
<p>Right now I am not able to deploy for Android without a rewrite of my perfectly running library code. I prefer not to do that until I really have to, because maybe the next iteration of TiStudio fixes it. and on and on and on ….</p>
<p>I am not being negative, it&#39;s just such a huge barrier to enjoyment, productivity and profitability that it has to be mentioned again and again until something decidedly positive happens.</p>

										<p><p>Well, renaming it to Icon.png seems to be the wrong way to me, because when I try to build the android project then I get naming errors stating only [a-z0-9] are allowed.</p>
<p>So any real answer for this? It seems like a bug to me, because neither my appicon@2x nor my appicon-72 or appicon-72@2x are copied right. I always have to open the project in XCode again.</p>
