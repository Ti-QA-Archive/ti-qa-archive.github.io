			<p>Hello folks,</p>
<p>We just uploaded Titanium4j to the marketplace (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;5420?2037282889).<br>Titanium4j lets you write Titanium application in Java and used the GWT and Closure compiler to output a high optimized JavaScript.<br>We are looking forward to reading your feedbacks and reviews.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>It s pretty simple actually. We leverage the GWT compiler to compile Java to JavaSctipt and use GWT JavaScript Native Interface  to call Titanium functions from JavaScript. This def. gives a lot of advantages over pure JS development.</p>

							<p>As far as i think titanium was built on javascript for supporting the web developers and persons who have not enough knowledge of java and objetive c</p>
<p>By the way tow doubts</p>
<p>1)How you are handling memory management</p>
<p>2)The modules which were used earlier how to use that now</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>We also started with JavaScript too. The problem is that the language dont scale well  with big scale projects. Java simply offers a bit more in term of software engineering patterns. Also most of our backends were Java, so beeing able to use the same language on the client and the server was a big plus</p>
<p>To you question.</p>
<p>1) How do we handle memory management<br>   First the GWT compiler will generate the most optimized JS you can get out there. The output is also on a single file so that the momory footprint is really low.</p>
<p>2) We also wrap a lot of existing modules. wrapping your own module should be pretty easy  to do since Ti4j is opensource or you can contact us and we do it for you.</p>
<p>&quot;And i think it would be very annoying and would slow down the app much<br>java–&gt;javascript—&gt;objective c or java&quot;</p>
<p>Well titanium already does &quot;javascript—&gt;objective c or java&quot;. What we offer is &quot;Java–&gt;JavaScript&quot;<br>In the case of ti4j this process is very fast because we implemented our own GWT Linker.<br>Also this about what you get on the other side. Strong typing, Refactoring, Compile time errors, etc..<br>We believe it s a fair trade :)</p>

							<p>To me the best framework around titanium so faar.<br>You really see the benefit when the code size grows and you add more people to the project.<br>We were able to port (almost) all our applications from pure JavaScript to Java.<br>It also integrates pretty well with our J2EE based backend.</p>
<p>The only thing missing is something like Alloy  though.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m currently using it and you can think of it this way, so you have a mobile application to develop (for Android and iOS platforms) and given this conceptual API which allows you to write once and deploy to both platforms,you can either develop it by making use of this API via JavaScript (via Titanium) or Java (via Titanium4j). Essentially this is how seamless it feels. The benefits of developing it in Java over JavaScript are but not limited to: IDE Tooling (code refactoring), Source Code analytics and optimisation of readable code, Compile-time safety of the Java language, you can even use Google&#39;s great &#39;Guava library&#39; that&#39;s for GWT. Ti4j all the way!!!</p>
