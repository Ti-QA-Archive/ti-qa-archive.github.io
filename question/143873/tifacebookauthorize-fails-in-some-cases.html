			<h1>Ti.Facebook.authorize() fails in some cases</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,<br>Just got our first app in the App Store, but unfortunately some of the users have reported problems signing up using Facebook. When the user click the signup button, I block the UI with a &#39;spinner&#39;, call Ti.Facebook.authorize() and on cancel or login event remove the spinner. The problem is that the Ti.Facebook.authorize() seems to fail silently, leaving the user with a blocked UI - not the best impression for new users.</p>
<p>Does anyone have a clue as to why this happens to some users while others are unaffected?</p>
<p>Anything in app-settings at developers.facebook.com I should be aware of, that could cause this problem?</p>
<p>The app is setup to use SSO.</p>

							<div><p>Thank you for responding! I have a a lurking suspicion that this it isn&#39;t caused by Facebook being down a couple of hours though, since this has happened throughout the day. I don&#39;t know what happens behind the curtains, but I would expect the app react in some way, either by switching to the Facebook app if SSO is possible, or present the auth dialogue, and fail here is the service is down.</p>
