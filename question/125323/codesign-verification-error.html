			<h1>Codesign verification error</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m at a loss.  I&#39;ve googled, and googled, and googled. I&#39;ve contacted support at Apple, and I&#39;ve perused the Q&amp;A, and I can&#39;t seem to find a fix.  </p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to submit an update to an app I created that&#39;s in the app store, but when I submit my .zip file to the Application Loader, I get the dreaded &quot;Application failed codesign verification. The signature was invalid, or it was not signed with an Apple Submission certificate.&quot;</p>
<p>I reformatted my mac and forgot to export my keys, which has put me in this predicament. So, here is what I have done to try to rectify this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fresh install of Mac OSX 10.6.7</li>
<li>Fresh install of xCode 4.1</li>
<li>Fresh install of Titanium 1.7.2</li>
<li>Imported project from backup</li>
<li>Deleted and revoked ALL certificates and provisioning profiles in the provisioning portal.  This includes developer and distribution certs&#x2F;profiles</li>
<li>Downloaded and added the Apple Worldwide bla bla certificate to the login keychain</li>
<li>Created a new distribution certification per Apple&#39;s instructions</li>
<li>Created a new distribution profile per Apple&#39;s instructions</li>
<li>Downloaded the distribution certification and added it to my login keychain</li>
<li>Downloaded the distribution profile and added it to the xCode organizer</li>
<li>Opened the project in Titanium and performed a distribution build. No errors occured</li>
<li>Compressed the .app file into a .zip file</li>
<li>Opened Application Loader and logged in</li>
<li>Chose my new version app from the drop down</li>
<li>Said yes to the &quot;has it been tested&quot; question</li>
<li>Picked the zip from the finder</li>
<li>Clicked upload.  This is when it gives the codesign error.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everywhere I have read says dump your certs&#x2F;profiles and start over.  I&#39;ve done this probably five times now, with no luck.  </p>
<p>I even changed the id of the app from com.bla.bla to com.bla.blaNew, and tried to submit a brand new app to the store, not an update, and still got the codesign error.  That is when I knew something was definitely wrong, because I can&#39;t even submit new apps now.</p>
<p>I also read that the codesign error was a &quot;general error&quot; and probably doesn&#39;t even mean that it&#39;s certificate related. Someone mentioned they were using a beta SDK and that was causing the problem.  I am not using a beta SDK.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any kind of help, suggestions, ideas.  This is getting really frustrating.</p>

							<p>Well, I FINALLY figured this one out after a painful stroll down Apple&#39;s evil path. First, I had to build the app for distribution in Xcode using the .xcode project file in the build directory of my Titanium app.  Then, I found a blog by Brian Engage that saved the day <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;useyourloaf.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;1&#x2F;3&#x2F;app-store-whitespace-validation-failure-with-xcode-325.html?lastPage=true#comment15013429">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Application Loader</strong></p>
<p>The best workaround I can find until Apple fixes Xcode is to use the standalone Application Loader application that is bundled with Xcode. You will find this in &#x2F;Developer&#x2F;Applications&#x2F;Utilities, I currently have v1.4 installed with Xcode 3.2.5. The first time you run Application Loader you need to enter your iTunes Connect login information. After that the procedure is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build and Archive the app as usual with Xcode.</li>
<li>Find the archived application in Xcode organiser, select it and then use the Share button, ensure you have the correct iPhone Distribution code-signing identity selected and then use Save to Disk… to generate an ipa file.</li>
<li>Run Application Loader and select File -&gt; New (command-N) and choose the application that you want to submit. This assumes that you have already added the new version to iTunes Connect.</li>
<li>You then get asked to confirm if you have tested and qualified this binary on iOS 4, to which you probably should respond “Yes”…</li>
<li>You can now use the Choose… button to select the application binary “ipa” file you previously saved and then click Send to upload to the App Store.</li>
</ul>

							<p>You might be having identical certificates in both login and system in my keychain.</p>
