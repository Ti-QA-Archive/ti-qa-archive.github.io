			<p>Hello everybody,<br>i have recently found the great .parent property existing out there, but im wondering why this very useful property is NOT documented,<br>so my question is is it a good practice to use this property? is it gonna be deprecated or removed in the future? if no, why its not exposed in docs, and if yes, which alternative methods do the same thing, say for example to find if some view is added to another one before?<br>all comments are welcome and, thanks.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Firstly the documentation or lack of it - good question, it is not being deprecated anytime soon as far as I am aware.</p>
<p>The benefits of using it - it does make it easy to know where this child was placed;</p>
<ul>
<li>how many times did you forget where you added something?</li>
<li>how many times does the knowledge of the parent affect the behaviour of the child?</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally speaking you should never use this property, not because it is wrong, more that your code should know where things are and children should not need to understand their parents in order to function.</p>
<p>So in short the use of the patent property in my opinion is not necessary and at worst used rarely when all other techniques have been considered first.</p>
<p>As to a better way if doing things - keep in mind you only just found out about it so you already know how to work without it.  There are so many ways in which to maintain links between parents and children to manage the scope - that they are simply too many to explain here.</p>
<p>I am not sure what your example was trying to achieve - I always work on solving a problem rather than providing an answer.  They are rarely the same thing.  So explain a situation where you think the patent property would assist you that cannot be resolved any other better way.</p>

										<p><p>thanks Malcolm for your reply,<br>You are absolutely right, ofcourse there are alternatives  but, at least for my case, .parent is the simplest, but maybe not the best with performance in mind.<br>here is my case for parent usage:<br>i have a multi-window app that all windows share a single view(a custom drawer with same functionality and look returned by a commonjs module that should appear on all windows on demand),<br>so each time a window gain focus(its activity starts or resumd) im gonna remove the drawer view form its old window(current parent) and add it to the newly opened window as below:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// drawer.js</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> drawerView = Ti.UI.createView({
<span class="hljs-comment">// some props</span>
)};
extends.addToWin= <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(newWin)</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> oldWin = drawerView.<span class="hljs-keyword">parent</span>;
    oldWin.remove(drawerView);
    newWin.add(drawerView);
}

<span class="hljs-comment">// anyWindow.js</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> win; <span class="hljs-comment">// createWin</span>

win.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'focus'</span> , <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'drawer.js'</span>).addToWin(win);    
});
</code></pre><p>it works as expected but im not sure it will do so in the future or on all devices or conditions, &#39;coz of use of parent.</p>
