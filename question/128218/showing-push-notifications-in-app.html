			<h1>showing push notifications in app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am using Urban Airship to show push notification (when another user likes your content for example) and it works great. </p>
<p>I would now like to show a badge on a tab then link to a page that shows a list of all pushes to you (show who liked your content).</p>
<p>I can show a badge on a tab by using the following </p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> moreTab = Titanium.UI.createTab({
    title:<span class="hljs-string">'More'</span>,
     icon:<span class="hljs-string">'images/more_icon.png'</span>, 
     badge: <span class="hljs-keyword">true</span>,
    <span class="hljs-built_in">window</span>:more
});
</code></pre><p>My issue is how I show the actual number of current badges. In theory I&#39;d get the number of active badges set it to a variable then set badge to that var.  But I dont know where to pull that info from.</p>
<p>I&#39;m also guessing that I should be able to pull all the badge data from somewhere as a json file then just show that on one page but again not sure where to find that data. </p>
<p>Has anyone done this?  If so where do I get the data from?  Any info you can share on this would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

							<p>According to Urbanairship documentation.</p>
<p>&quot;When a push is received in a background, the OS sets the badge number; so the best way to get that is to pull it off the shared application object, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">badge = <span class="hljs-comment">[<span class="hljs-comment">[UIApplication sharedApplication]</span> applicationIconBadgeNumber]</span>
</code></pre><p>Does anyone know if there is a method to get this (find badge number from OS) using titanium?</p>

										<p><p>Hi Forrest, were you able to find a solution to read the current&#x2F;last-pushed badge # via Titanium function or via Urbanairship?  Ti.UI.iPhone.getAppBadge() always return zero and there seems to be no way to read from UA…..</p>

							<p>I don&#39;t know your setup. But to have persistent data, you&#39;ll need to have a backend server to store all the likes. You can then request the current users likes from your backend in a JSON file.</p>

										<p><p>I do have a backend server where likes are stored however, if my app is showing a badge with the number of pushes why can&#39;t I find that number and show it in my app? Then on my page listing all the likes I could clear out the existing number of pushes. </p>
<p>Showing a page of the info (who likes what) by doing a back end query is a fine idea though.</p>

<p>That only allows a badge to be set so it is not really helpful.</p>
