			<h1>New to Android, What device for Testing?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve been working for a while with Titanium for iOS, however I&#39;d like to start developing for Android as well, I have a few doubts about it:</p>
<p>To my understanding there is problems with fragmentation, to what extend is this true? When they talk about fragmentation is it because the various hardware OEMs? or the numerous Android versions out there? Can my app target all Android versions or should I focus on an specific release?. </p>
<p>I&#39;m also having a hard time picking up a device for testing, my questions are:</p>
<p>-Should I get a phone or a tablet? Is there meaningful differences other than UI formatting between an Android tablet or a phone?<br>-Do I need a developer profile a la Apple, or can I just load apps into any device?</p>
<p>I know my questions are a bit vague, but I would like to hear personal experiences, what Android device actually works well with Titanium for testing. </p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

							<p>Hello Omar,</p>
<p>the reason for fragmentation is not the variety of manufactures. Because of some OEMs that don&#39;t provide updates for all of their Android devices to newer versions. So, as you can see in the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;dashboards&#x2F;index.html#Platform">Android Dashboards</a> there are still a lot of Gingerbread devices out there. It would be nice if you target them too but IMHO it&#39;s more important to target the last version.</p>
<p><img src="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;chart.googleapis.com&#x2F;chart?chs=500x250&amp;cht=p&amp;chco=c4df9b%2C6fad0c&amp;chd=t%3A2.4%2C30.7%2C0.1%2C21.7%2C45.1&amp;chf=bg%2Cs%2C00000000&amp;chl=Froyo%7CGingerbread%7CHoneycomb%7CIce%20Cream%20Sandwich%7CJelly%20Bean" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>When I develop Apps for Android, I test them on my Nexus devices with stock Android (latest version). I also test my Apps on my old HTC with Android 2.3.3 Gingerbread - just to be sure it runs and looks okay. I finally go through some virtual devices on the Android emulator to see my App on common screen sizes and resolutions.</p>
<p>You can also see the most used screen sizes and resolutions on the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;dashboards&#x2F;index.html#Screens">Android Dashboards</a>. That doesn&#39;t seem to be that many tablets. Anyway, the Android system is not designed to distinguish between phones and tablets, it&#39;s more flexible across all screen sizes. I mean, there is no borderline between all possible screen sizes from 2 inch to 10 inch where Android decides &quot;this is a tablet&quot; etc. You can read about supporting multiple screens here: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;guide&#x2F;practices&#x2F;screens_support.html">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;guide&#x2F;practices&#x2F;screens_support.html</a></p>
<p>You don&#39;t need profiles like on iOS to install Apps, you can install them straight from Titanium Studio on your device. When you release an App on Google Play, then you have to sign it with a private key. But this is also done by TiStudio (including the creation of the key) - very easy!</p>
<p>OEM Firmwares don&#39;t effect the UI of Apps. So, you don&#39;t have to worry about developing for multiple manufactures ;)</p>
