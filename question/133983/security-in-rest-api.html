			<h1>Security in Rest Api</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi everybody!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve got some quedtions about security. I&#39;ve created a Rest Server with basic auth. In my app i call with Ti.Network and i specified user and pass in headers, question is, can anybody read this credentials when my app is in AppStore and copy them to use for their own? I mean can anybody read my source code or monitor network request¿</p>
<p>Or how it&#39;s best way to securize my api¿ Thanks</p>

							<p>Nobody can read your source code.</p>
<p>I guess it&#39;s possible to monitor a network request via the iPhone somehow, but regardless you&#39;ll be safe enough if you replace the user&#x2F;pass being sent in your headers with an encrypted token instead. Then, on your server, decrypt your token to get the information you need out of it. Alternatively, to be more secure, make the token encryption one-way and store it along with the users details in a database or something, and authenticate them that way. </p>
<p>Secure your REST API with SSL for additional security if it&#39;s that important.</p>

										<p><p><strong>Nobody can read your source code</strong>- I would actually say ALWAYS assume they can. </p>
<p>Titanium only base64&#39;s your code into an Object C file it does not encrypt it, so some one with the correct knowledge could extract.</p>
<p>I would suggest that if it is a username and password that is typed in when your app is running then if it is always over SSL then your headers will be encrypted as well so you should be fine, BUT if you are saying that you have a master username and password hardcoded into the header then this is a BAD idea.</p>
<p>Boydlee&#39;s suggestion about using one way tokens in this case would be slightly more secure, but again if the token is the same all the time it&#39;s a bit like MD5&#39;ing the same phase (not a lot of point).</p>
<p>If you encrypt on your app and then decrypt on the server, again be careful how you store the encryption key (and how you identify it within your code - i.e. var secretkey=1234567890) - that would be easy to extract.</p>
<p>At the end of the day the security of you application and server is a direct measure of how confidential your service is and how long it would take someone to discover how to get into it.</p>
<p>Hope this helps as I have had a few apps PEN tested (penetration) with external security companies and this a some of the feedback.</p>
