		<section>
			<p>i&#39;m on my last step in uploading my first app to itunes. I&#39;m getting this error… The binary you uploaded was invalid. The signature was invalid, or it was not signed with an Apple submission certificate.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve made sure there are no spaces in the file name and i have changed appicon.png to icon.png</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>thanks in advance.</p>

							<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>Yes - there must be some registry-type info in the app.zip package that detects changes.</p>
<p>For a Windows convert the &#39;open package contents&#39; option in Finder is just too tempting ;)</p>
<p>To change the filename I created a new Titanium project and copied the contents of the resources folder across. Doing this means you&#39;ll need to create a new app id and reference the new app id in a new distribution profile (unfortunately there doesn&#39;t seem to be a way of deleting App Ids in the ADC).</p>
<p>You&#39;ll need to copy&#x2F;rename the icon in either the &#39;&#x2F;build&#x2F;iphone&#39; or &#39;resources&#39; folder - I think I did in both places to be sure.</p>
<p>Once I did that it went through OK.</p>
<p>cheers,<br>Chris</p>

							<p>Hi Dave, did you open or make &#39;any&#39; changes to the app.zip after it was produced?</p>
<p>The app.zip produced should be uploaded to iTunes Connect without any interference. i.e. you can&#39;t make those changes within the app.zip, which mean&#39;t for me going back and creating a new Ti Mobile project, a new &#39;app id&#39; and generating a new distribution certificate.</p>
<p>Sorry, that probably doesn&#39;t help too much, but it&#39;s a very unhelpful message, like &#39;an error has occurred&#39;. Maybe others have had this in other circumstance and might have better thoughts.</p>
<p>cheers,<br>Chris.</p>

							<p>Hi Chris, thanks for your help. What I did was take a space out of the file name (after it was packaged) and copy the appicon.png file to icon.png (before it was packaged). </p>
<p>do you think that could have caused the problem?</p>
<p>thanks</p>
