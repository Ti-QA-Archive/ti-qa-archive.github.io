			<h1>Using Symbols in app name</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>When I submit an app to the app store with a symbol in the name, I am not allowed to do this because symbols are not allowed in the executable name found in the info.plist file. However, I would like to change the Product Name so that the app name the user sees does have a symbol. I tried just copying the info.plist file from the build directory to my project directory and editing the two variables, but then it no longer builds.</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to add a symbol to your app name in Titanium?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>Rather than changing the info.plist file, have you tried just changing the name in your tiapp.xml file? I added a &#39;+&#39; to my app name there and it seemed to take ok. Of course I haven&#39;t tried to deploy this to the app store, but there doesn&#39;t seem to be an issue.</p>
<p>If you are having an issue with the symbol, it might be due to changing the name elsewhere. I would suggest first trying to change the name in your tiapp.xml file and rebuilding. If that fails, try creating a new project with a name that contains the symbol and an appid that does not and run that as a test.</p>

										<p><p>My name in the tiapp.xml file has always had the +. That has never been an issue. Also, the appid does not have the symbol either. The only thing that has the symbol is the App name.</p>

							<p>This is an old question but I figured the solution might help someone.</p>
<p>There are a few different ways to make this work but this seemed like the easiest&#x2F;fastest to me. I just copied the Info.plist out of the build&#x2F;iphone directory, put it at the top level of my titanium project directory (for an example see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Custom+Fonts), and then modified it. </p>
<ul>
<li>First, I changed the <code>name</code> param in tiapp.xml to exclude the special character (&#39;+&#39; becomes &#39;Plus&#39;). </li>
<li>Next, I changed the <code>CFBundleDisplayName</code> and <code>CFBundleName</code> in my Info.plist to be hardcoded to have the &#39;+&#39; in it rather than referencing the ${PRODUCT_NAME} variable. </li>
<li>Finally, build your app and Apple should not complain about the character when you validate. Your app should still show up with the &#39;+&#39; sign on the homescreen when you run on a device because of the hardcoded bundle keys.</li>
</ul>
<p>I left the Executable name as-is in the Info.plist because the ${EXECUTABLE_NAME} variable it references by default is comprised of the ${PRODUCT_NAME} and a couple of other variables that I did not want to mess with.</p>
