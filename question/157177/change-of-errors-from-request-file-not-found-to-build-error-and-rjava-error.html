			<h1>Change of errors from &#34;Request file not found&#34; to Build error and r.java error</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>For a very long time I&#39;ve been trying to figure out why I was getting the &quot;Requested file not found&quot; referring to a module id in my project. Then, with no changes at all, I started getting build errors and others, but they seemed to change frequently with no pattern. Now I have &quot;Build process exited with code 1&quot;. So I re-installed Android SDK, Titanium Studio and the Java JDK. Now I get the &quot;Build Process&quot; error along with &quot;Error generating R.java from manifest&quot;. Anyone with any information that would clear this up for me would be appreciated, My goal, as strange as it may seem, is to get back to the &quot;requested file not found&quot; error. Thanks in advance</p>

							<div><p>Yes. I&#39;ve done everything the documentation indicates. However, the error is gone. It is one of those nonsensical Titanium Studio errors that suddenly pops up and eventually disappears! Another one is if you fail to connect your device to your pc when &quot;Run&quot;ing you app, of course you get a timeout error. However, subsequent &#39;Run&#39;s&#39;  error out with all red lines repeatedly. To cure this, I run the application on the emulator until it doesn&#39;t error out. Sometimes that works. Other times it takes several tries at many different things. These errors are similar to the errors I see in Eclipse.<br>Thanks for your comment.</p>
