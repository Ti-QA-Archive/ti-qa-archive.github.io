			<h1>New Builds not being deployed on the emulator or device</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a problem on an Android app. My new builds are not being recognized by the emulator or device. </p>
<p>I modified my code (to fix an error) and made a new Build. Then did &quot;Run on emulator&quot;  (and device). </p>
<p>But I still the log statements that i removed from the code, and the code itself is not changed.This is causing the app to crash because my changes (to prevent the app crash) are not going in. I have tried this for several hours with no change!</p>
<p>Does anyone know why this is happening? Or how to clear the cache on Titanium, maybe?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Sri</p>

							<p>I had this issue many times. What worked was either :</p>
<ul>
<li>cleaning the project</li>
<li>but most often : going back to the menu of apps before relaunching my app a second time</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>Thanks for your response Kathrin!</p>
<p>Yes, I did a clean, completely deleted the build folder, restarted Titanium, restarted the machine - everything possible!</p>
<p>I even checked my code to make sure the changes were in the correct place.</p>
<p>I am totally baffled!</p>

										<p><p>Hmm, sounds strange. Have you deleted the emulator and the app on the device? Have you tried creating a new project and copying the Resources only?</p>

										<p><p>Anyone have an answer? I actually deleted everything in the function except one log statement saying &quot;Here&quot;. It still is executing the old code, throwing the same error and printing out all the log statements that are not there anymore.</p>
<p>I just dont know what I should do. Maybe a re-install of Titanium? I am trying to avoid that, since I have to create all the projects again.</p>

										<p><p>Oh wait! I forgot, I actually did delete it in the Galaxy emulator as well.</p>
<p>I checked the file in the build&#x2F;android&#x2F;bin&#x2F;assets&#x2F;..&#x2F;filename.js file, to see if the changes were in, and yes! the changes I made show up there.</p>
<p>Isnt that what gets deployed on the emulator? Why dont my changes show up on my emulator?</p>

										<p><p>You said you tried it on a real device as well? Same problem? And I meant deleting the emulator (with the android sdk tool), not only the app on the emulator - so that the emulator has to be completely recreated when you build your project.</p>
<p>You really don&#39;t have a copy of the project do you changes on that, but building the original? Sorry, just running out of ideas here..</p>

										<p><p>No, I did not delete the emulator completely. Let me try that. </p>
<p>How do you delete the emulator? I had deleted all the virtual devices from the AVD manager. But I dont know if that is it?</p>

										<p><p>So, I guess I deleted the virtual devices on the AVD manager yesterday morning when I was trying to get something else working (and I did get that to work then). </p>
<p>So, I deleted the virtual devices again, and rebuilt and re-ran the project on the emulator. I dont see the project on it anymore on the emulator. I ran it again twice (while the emulator was still running) and nothing.</p>

										<p><p>So, when I install it on a device, I get the message in the Application Installer -<br>&quot;Installing application on device…<br>….<br>Installed on the device. App is running on the Home..blahblah.<br>&quot;</p>
<p>But when I run it on emulator, I get this message -</p>

										<p><p>That explains why you don&#39;t see any changes - the new app version never makes it onto the emulator or device.</p>
<p>Have you made any updates? Studio? SDK? Changes in the tiapp.xml&#x2F;AndroidManifest.xml? Permission changes in the relevant filesystem?</p>
<p>Otherwise I would suggest you open a new Q&amp;A regarding the new findings (with your error message).</p>

										<p><p>I got it going! I think I know what the problem was.</p>
<p>The problem was I had added a lot of images in the Resources&#x2F;&lt;preload&gt; folder, so I dont have to go to the server to get them -atleast while testing (because I am having problems with Ti.Network.HttpClient - but thats another problem!!). I forgot about this till just now. I dont know if Titanium (or Android) has a limit on the size of the app. (I know iOS has). </p>
<p>But I thought it would be ok on the emulator, because it was for testing. Apparently not. So, i guess thats why it didnt deploy the new build file.</p>
<p>So, now, I can see the changes, though I still cant load one part of my app.</p>
<p>But this is a start! i can do anything else, once I know the build is being deployed! Phew! I wasted so much time on this!</p>
<p>Thanks, Kathrin for your help and responses!</p>
