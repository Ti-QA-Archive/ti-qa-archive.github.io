			<h1>Switch a view from being a keyboard toolbar to being a standalone view.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello! I&#39;m trying to get a view to remain on screen, but when the keyboard appears it slides up, locked to it. Similar in a sense to the messages view where the input box is always at the bottom of the screen but slides up when the keyboard is shown.</p>
<p>I have previously done this using the <code>keyboardframechanged</code> event and animating the view to the height of the keyboard, but it&#39;s so slow, the keyboard slides up and then about a second later the view slides up and they definitely don&#39;t look locked together.</p>
<p>I&#39;m wondering what the best way would be to go about this? Could I possibly take the view out of the normal hierarchy whenever the keyboard is opened and attached it as a toolbar? and then when the keyboard is hidden put it back into the main window?</p>
<p>I&#39;d also like to note this isn&#39;t a simple scrollView &quot;keyboard cover the input&quot; issue. I actually want a view locked, pixel-perfect to the top of the keyboard, exactly as a toolbar would be, but to remain on screen when the keyboard is gone.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
