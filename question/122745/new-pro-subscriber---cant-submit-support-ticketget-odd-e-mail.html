			<h1>New Pro Subscriber - can&#39;t submit support ticket/get odd e-mail</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I just upgraded to Ti Pro on Friday, but cannot submit a support ticket.</p>
<p>From the support website, I get the message, &quot;Oops! There was a problem creating your ticket. Please try to submit it again&quot; and I also receive the below e-mail (every time I try to submit) from the support system thinking that I was trying to submit a ticket via e-mail (when I wasn&#39;t).</p>
<p>From: Appcelerator HD &lt;&lt;e-mail for help desk&gt;@appcelerator.com&gt;<br>To: &lt;my e-mail&gt;<br>Sent: Monday, July 18, 2011 8:54 AM<br>Subject: Delivery failed: &lt;my issue description&gt;</p>
<p>Thanks for emailing the Appcelerator Helpdesk. While you can update existing tickets by email, we require that all new tickets be created through the web interface located at: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.appcelerator.com</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Appcelerator Support Team</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m still having the issue, how about you?  I sent an e-mail to the help desk and the sales and did get an initial response last night.  I also noticed it&#39;s very picky about special characters (even apostrophes on basic words)</p>

							<p>I am still having the same issue. I don&#39;t think the special characters are a problem if it goes through the first time, they just show up different when the textbox is populated again after the error.</p>

							<p>Meant to close this out.  I e-mailed sales@appcelerator.com and they passed it on to support for me and eventually got it resolved in a about a week.</p>
