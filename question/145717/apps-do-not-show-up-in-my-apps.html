			<h1>Apps do not show up in my apps</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We have the problem that several of our apps do not show up at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;my.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps</p>
<p>When I start a completely new titanium project I notice that it does show up immediately. The problem might be that most of our existing apps are created by copying a folder from an old project (renaming it and then imported into titanium and then the tiapp.xml is changed).</p>
<p>We also tried to remove all acs lines from the tiapp.xml and then the button &#39;Enable Cloud Services&#39; did appear, but clicking that gives an returning error: java.io.IOException: Server returned HTTP response code 400 for URL.</p>
<p>We spend a lot of time getting the apps we see in Titanium studio to show up at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;my.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps too, but we have not yet figured out how to do that. Some of them are already in the markets.</p>
<p>Is there someone who can guide us in the right direction? I&#39;ve seen similar questions like this in the q&amp;a, but not one with an answer which helps us out.</p>

							<p>Hi Paul, you can see your apps in <strong>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;my.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps</strong>, when you login to your titanium studio with the same id you are using over web.</p>
<p>and one more thing is that, if you are using any shared project initiated by someone else, then that will be visible in the person account who initially created that.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Nigel, thanks for your answer. However: 1 - I am logged in, because I can see other apps which are created from scratch. 2 - If that is also true for projects we started by copying a folder, how do you change the ownership? Because that is clearly not the person who created the app.</p>

										<p><p>to change the ownership, you can do 2 things,<br>1: create the new project from scratch and copy paste the code file.</p>
<p>2: change the app ID and it GUID, if that reflects properly in Titanium analytics the will update the same.</p>
<p><strong>second approach seems good to go, but changing ID and GUID, should be done from all the reference point. like tiapp.xml and manifest file and other if any.</strong></p>

										<p><p>Hi Ashish, because the apps are already in the market, I think neither of the two is an option? Or can you change the app id of an app which is already in the market?</p>

										<p><p>apps in the market? i think <strong>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;my.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps</strong> this is the link you are talking about.</p>
<p>and if you have  source code then can do anything.</p>

										<p><p>For those apps, i think Sorry, you can not change the ownership… unless you write to Apple and Google for such problem and request change.</p>
<p>If they agree to take care of your problem.. then fine and Good Luck.. else No Luck.</p>
