			<h1>iPhone w/o Tab Group Issues</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>In order to make my app as cross platform as possible I didn&#39;t use the standard tab group but rather one posted here in the forums.  When building for Android it met my needs quite well.  Now that I&#39;m finally testing on iPhone I&#39;m finding a lot of things don&#39;t work quite right when not using a tab group.  Am I doing something wrong or is this a known fact?</p>
<p>The two major things I&#39;m hitting right now:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I can&#39;t get any type of navigation bar without a tab group.  Thus I have to manually build a back&#x2F;close button on screens that load open other windows.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When opening window to window {animated:true} doesn&#39;t seem to do anything.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Any advice is appreciated.</p>
<p>FYI, the &quot;custom tab&quot; solution I&#39;m using can be found here for reference:<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;46801&#x2F;giving-to-the-community-custom-tabgroup-class-working-on-android-and-iphone</p>

							<div><p>I would be wary of using solutions posted in the forum until you have checked the version of the SDK the solution was provided for, and the version of the SDK you are currently implementing. </p>
<p>This framework evolves quickly and bug fixes come just as fast so as as suggested below, you might want to use the default TabGroup that is available with 1.6.1, it might actually work.</p>

							<div><p>If I recall I switched away from the default tab group due to some limitations on how it could be styled, as far as I know those haven&#39;t been changed.</p>
<p>If the answer is that without tabgroups window transition animations don&#39;t work then I&#39;ll need to reconsider, however I&#39;d like to confirm this as I can&#39;t find it documented other than in comments in the forums.</p>

							<div><p>For anyone who finds themselves on this thread. What I ended up doing was sticking with the custom tabgroup for Android and the ootb for iPhone.  This has led to much less rework than I expected and a better solution IMO.</p>

							<p>Hi.,</p>
<p>In-order to make your app cross platform you can use Ti&#39;s default Tab group itself as Tab group is available on both iPhone and Android.</p>
<p>You can use Ti.UI.currentTab.open(wnd2,{animated:true}); to open child windows and this will work on both platforms but the difference is that on iPhone it will create a Child window with a navber+back button while on android it opens a new window and you can always go back using the back button on Android.</p>
<p>Hope this helps …</p>
