			<h1>Android Same Device, One Works Other Does Not</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I&#39;m pretty sure this isn&#39;t a Titanium Mobile issue, but hoping someone knows what may be the issue.<br>SDK 3.0.2.GA and tried 3.0.0.</p>
<p>I have a customer with 15 Samsung Galaxy Tabs SCH-i800 devices.  The application works on some and not others.  I&#39;m looking at settings on two of the devices and their software&#x2F;hardware match exactly.  One device works, the other does not.  They are running Firmware v2.3.5 and there appears to be no update possible for the OS through Verizon or manufacturer.  Since they are used on a cell network and it production, I wouldn&#39;t be willing to suggest rooting to upgrade the devices.</p>
<p>Has anyone seen an issue like this or have suggestions on what to look at to start resolving it?  The customer didn&#39;t send the cabling so I can&#39;t easily hook them to my computer for debugging.  I&#39;m looking at buying the cables to hook it up.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Martin</p>

							<div><p>Sorry to fully answer, it does run initially.  It is a table that opens a tabgroup.  When you hit the hardware back button, it is suppose to close the tabgroup and show the screen that has the table on it.  On one device this works, but the other it crashes out with the unexpectedly stopped message and force close option.</p>

							<p>I traced this problem to a function where I create table rows after querying data from my local database.  If I dynamically change the row&#39;s make-up (labels, images, etc) based on if there is data to populate a label, it will crash when I open my tabgroup and then return to the table in cases were an element is removed because there is no data.  If I don&#39;t dynamically change the row and just put in &#39;No Data&#39; so that all the rows in the table are uniform, it doesn&#39;t crash.  I&#39;ve removed all the dynamic row creation code and it appears fine now.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure what is happening when I show the window with the table again.  Perhaps there is an event someone is aware of.  Maybe a focus.  The odd thing is that it works fine the first time and shows the data in the table with the dynamic rows as expected.  The second time I just show the window with the table on it, it crashes.  I do not close this window, it is always in the background waiting to be shown again.</p>

							<p>After an exhaustive series of troubleshooting, I just update my field I was removing from the table view row with &#39;No Description&#39; instead of removing it.  It completely eliminated the problem.  No idea why the table works the first time and blows up when I re-show that view.</p>
