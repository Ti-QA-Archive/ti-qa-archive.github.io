</code></pre><p>So I have added objects to the &#39;service_down_tray&#39;, and then added the &#39;service_down_tray&#39; to the main window.<br>on the iPhone this displays the icons as expected.<br>But on Andriod only the tray appears, no icons.</p>
<p>Seems that I can&#39;t add nested objects in Andriod?<br>Any fix or work around for andriod, as I am building a complex interface.</p>

							<p>Nested views <em>do</em> work on android.  I often put a view onto a window and add views like buttons to that view.</p>
<p>Your code is obviously part of a much larger body of work, so it&#39;s very hard to see what might be going wrong without seeing everything (which I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t want to do, nor do many readers here have the time to sift through multiple modules).</p>
<p>Can you boil this down to a minimal case (preferably one that fits into a single app.js)?  It&#39;s a tedious exercise, but I find that it&#39;s part of life with Titanium.  What you&#39;ll probably find is that when you try to make a minimal case, it does in fact work.  Then you can look at what you&#39;re doing wrong with your richer codebase.  </p>
<p>If you <em>can</em> build a minimal case that exhibits the problem, I&#39;m sure somebody can help you out!</p>

										<p><p>Sounds like a pretty good guess – I&#39;ve never tried adding views to a label, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if that doesn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>I only use the android emulator as a last resort when I absolutely have to do some visual debugging.  Otherwise, I rely on debugging on iOS and running on my android device.</p>
<p>That android emulator is a DOG – slow, unreliable, ugh.  I wish a few of those thousands of PhDs at google would do something about that!  :-)</p>

										<p><p>Yeah. I agree. My dream is for the Andriod emulator to work like the iPHone one, but I guess that is too much to ask.</p>
