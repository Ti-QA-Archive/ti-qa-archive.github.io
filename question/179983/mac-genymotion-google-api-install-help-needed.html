			<h1>Mac GenyMotion Google API Install Help Needed</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m about at my wits end here. Currently I have the following installed:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Mac OSX <span class="hljs-number">10.9</span><span class="hljs-number">.5</span>
VirtualBox <span class="hljs-number">4.3</span><span class="hljs-number">.20</span>
Genymotion <span class="hljs-number">2.3</span><span class="hljs-number">.1</span>
</code></pre><p>I&#39;ve got several virtual machines installed but the one I&#39;m currently working with is for the Galaxy S4. Since native Google support was dropped from Genymotion a while back, I&#39;ve seen people install the apis on windows boxes so Genymotion loads apps like the Kitchen Sink. On mac though, nothing&#39;s working.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve downloaded multiple versions of the google api&#39;s as well as an ARM translation file. On Windows, you can drag and drop these files into the open emulator and they will auto install. On Mac however, it just says this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Files successfully copied <span class="hljs-string">to:</span> <span class="hljs-regexp">/sdcard/</span>Download/
</code></pre><p>When I try to access the download area to potentially manually install, they aren&#39;t even there. I&#39;ve also opened up VirtualBox and changed the following settings:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">General <span class="hljs-regexp">/ Advanced /</span> Drag<span class="hljs-string">'n'</span><span class="hljs-string">Drop:</span> Bidirectional
Shared <span class="hljs-string">Folders:</span> [path to unzipped google apis]
</code></pre><p>Rebooted and still no installed Google Apis. Tried dragging and dropping both zipped and unzipped versions again and still got the same &quot;Files copied&quot; dialog.</p>
<p>I would like to run the KitchenSink on Android and I&#39;ve also got some previously deployed Android apps that need updating, which use the Google apis. Without the emulator working, I can&#39;t get in there and update them properly. I&#39;ve really got to get this app updated.</p>
<p>Any and all assistance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks guys! :)</p>

										<p><p>No arm Translation support, un-needed, and will actually HINDER your development, as a binary built with out x86 support WILL run on your emulator and you wont know you have no x86 support. Didnt have to jump through any hoops of editing&#x2F;changing the virtual machine settings. </p>

										<p><p>The only thing I can conclude is that re-zipping the auto-unziped file somehow &quot;invalidated&quot; the zip. Not sure why that&#39;s the case, but it was indeed the case.</p>

							<p>I figured it out. For anyone else who is having this problem, this is what happened:</p>
<p>My mac auto unzips zip files when downloaded. If I re-zipped them and dragged or tried dragging the unzipped files, they wouldn&#39;t flash. I had no idea how to turn off this feature, so I dl&#39;d them on a windows computer and transferred them over. Once the new files were on the mac I dragged them over and they flashed. Kitchensink is now working. Hope this helps someone else.</p>

										<p><p>That is a real security issue you have there.  Not all zip files are honest decent things.  Some are specifically designed to cause you harm.</p>
<p>Find it and plug it.</p>
