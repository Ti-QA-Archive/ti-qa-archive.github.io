			<h1>Module licensing issue</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all,<br>I am having licensing issues with titanium detecting an unpaid module. I currently have 3 modules in my app</p>
<ul>
<li>Google maps for iOS (Paid)</li>
<li>ImageFactory (Open Source)</li>
<li>Star rating module (Paid)</li>
</ul>
<p>I downloaded the first two off my account and the last off a colleagues account. (We both needed the same module for different apps and were paying with the same card).<br>In the past I have read to change the guid in my ti.app.xml to be the same as the guid in the module&#39;s manifest, however, since I have 3 modules, this cannot be the solution as I can only use one of the module&#39;s guid.</p>
<p>I also read to use a random guid generator online to solve the issue, but this hasn&#39;t worked fully either. It gets rid of the error initially, but it resurfaces after a couple of days.</p>
<p>How can I fix this issue? Any help appreciated</p>

							<p>NO NO NO NO</p>
<p>You ONLY change the GUID of the MODULE IF the module WAS in the marketplace and THEN was open sourced and the author didn&#39;t change the guid themselves..  You should NEVER EVER EVER change the GUID of a PURCHASED module.</p>
<p>I am not sure where this errant information is coming from.</p>
<p>Second, if by change you purchased a module after you started a project, SOMETIMES the new module license isnt applied to your project (contact support) and you MIGHT be able to work around this by changing the GUID of your PROJECT and fooling the system into seeing the project as new and applying the proper licensing to it.</p>
<p>IF the module was bought on your coworkers account, you must login to ti as the coworker, work on a project created by the coworker.</p>

<p>So go spend another $35 for the license for the second seat.</p>

										<p><p>@Stephen Feather thank you for your response. There are a few things I need to clear up.</p>
<ol>
<li>I did not change the guid of the module. I changed the guid in my own ti.app.xml.</li>
<li>So the issue is that I need to be signed in with the account that the module was purchased from, even though I already bought 2 seats, they are only associated with 1 account?</li>
<li>This issue was arising before I purchased the third module using a different account. We are using a beta version of the google maps module which the developer sent to us as we had issues with the one in the marketplace, I think the issue arose then, but I&#39;m not sure.</li>
</ol>
<p>One thing for sure is that the modules were purchased after the project was created. So is a solution to purchase the third module on the same account as the other two and then create a new project and import the existing project to it.</p>

										<p><p>@Stephen Feather if you have the time, could you please respond to my follow up comments as there were a couple of misunderstandings from when you posted your first reply. I want to be completely sure what the issue is&#x2F;was so that this does not happen again. Regards</p>

										<p><p>account + purchase + module id + app id combine to allow you to use an app, in your project, with your account.</p>
<h4 id="purchased-modules">purchased modules</h4>
<p>Purchased module can only be used when building under the account it was purchased for and (near as I can tell) for projects created by that account.</p>
<p>Purchase all modules under one account, and if working on a shared&#x2F;common project, both devs log in as the same user.  </p>
<p>Sometimes you need to email support to have the licensing reset.</p>
