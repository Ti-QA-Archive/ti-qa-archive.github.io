			<h1>hide keyboard when text field clicked?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a view I show with a date picker when a user clicks a text field. That all works fine but the keyboard pops up too. How can I prevent the keyboard from showing on that text field only. I want the keyboard for my other text fields to work on the rest of the window. Thanks!</p>

										<p><p>That won&#39;t work on Android (at least not as intended) because &quot;click&quot; event is fired after text field has focus (so, first click triggers &quot;focus&quot; event, second click triggers &quot;click&quot; event).</p>

										<p><p>Tried that, it does not fire the opening of the view, because enabled=false ignores the user&#39;s click.</p>

										<p><p>My bad, not enough coffee this morning read that wrong. editable=false works too. Not sure about the blur() and Android comment above. I am developing on Android and it worded great…still new to this, is editable=false better than calling the blur event for cross compatibility? If so why? I am not following the order of events logic as it works for me. Thanks for the help so far!</p>

										<p><p>If editable=false works on both platforms, then it is certainly simpler coding than needing to add the event listener – you just add one more property as you create the field. In theory, it is also nominally less overhead.  But from a performance standpoint, it is probably like standing on a chair to get closer to the moon.</p>

										<p><p>Makes sense Doug, in this particular case I already had the event listener to create the view with the picker and show it so I just had to add the line to blur it prior to making the view, etc.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    txtAssessmentDate.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'focus'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">e</span>)</span>{
        txtAssessmentDate.blur();
        .
        .
        rest <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> code to create view, show, etc.
        .
        .
        })
</code></pre><p>And it did work fine on my Android system, but I changed it to editable=false. Will see how it works on iPhone later in this project. Concentrating on Android for now. Thanks again all for the quick turn around.</p>

										<p><p>Rich, first drink coffee or two and then read again what I&#39;ve wrote: <strong>&quot;click&quot; event is fired after text field has focus (so, first click triggers &quot;focus&quot; event, second click triggers &quot;click&quot; event)</strong></p>
<p>This code of yours works because you&#39;re listening to the &quot;focus&quot; event and not &quot;click&quot; as Doug said.</p>
<p>P.S. I&#39;ve reported that behavior as a bug, if you&#39;re interested, watch the JIRA ticket: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-4630">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-4630</a></p>
