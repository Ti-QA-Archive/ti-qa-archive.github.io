			<h1>Async code hangs, freezes UIF on iOS</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Is there any way to find out what code is running in Titanium in iOS? The debugger just says there is one thread <a href="Running">kroll$1</a> and it has no variables.</p>
<p>There is a lot of async activity happening in the background (network driven) and I&#39;d like to know exactly what code is running and stuck, blocking the UIF thread. This problem only happens randomly, and never when single-stepping after a breakpoint.</p>
<p>Any ideas on how to track down this problem? Needless to say, the customers are not very impressed with random freezes.</p>

							<p>All your javascript code is synchronous, there is no async code in Titanium.<br>The http requests are asynchronous, but only the request itself, at the native level. As soon as you&#39;re back in the JS land, you&#39;re again in the single thread.</p>
<p>So you might want to have a look at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.slideshare.net&#x2F;ronaldtreur&#x2F;titanium-making-the-most-of-your-single-thread">this post</a> and <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tidev.io&#x2F;2014&#x2F;02&#x2F;17&#x2F;keeping-your-app-responsive-part-1&#x2F;">here</a> on how to optimise a little this stuff.</p>
<p>For iOs there is <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rborn&#x2F;ti.worker">a solution -  a worker module</a> however this won&#39;t work in the UI thread, you can use it only to make heavy operations behind but not to update the UI, or at least not directly.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, Dan. I&#39;ve seen those articles, and I think I have a good handle on the javascript call stack.</p>
<p>I have an iOS native module that is calling Javascript callback methods asynchronously, so the Titanium Javascript thread is indeed getting additions to its call stack asynchronously.</p>
<p>But that&#39;s beside the point. The problem and the question remain.</p>
<p>The Titanium UI is freezing, and nothing on the Javascript call stack is getting executed, including _.delay(). This means that either the Titanium Javascript environment has crashed, or my code is in an infinite loop.</p>
<p>How can I use the debugger to find out what code is running? If I pause the debugger when the UI is frozen, it says nothing is running.</p>

										<p><p>Didn&#39;t mean to offend you :)</p>
<p>Related to the debugging part, I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t use the Ti Studio and my debugging methods are more like the &quot;poor man debugging&quot; -  console.error all over the places I need to see what&#39;s going on, and reading the console.</p>
<p>I&#39;d say to start removing stuff from your module callbacks and see where it start or stops working.</p>

										<p><p>Not offended, Dan. I&#39;m always happy to get any hints or help.</p>
<p>console.error gives nothing. It is stuck.  :(</p>

										<p><p>Comment out all the code in the callbacks, and start small, with a </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">console.<span class="hljs-keyword">error</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'callback here blah blah'</span>);
</code></pre><p>then start adding back parts of code.</p>
<p>It&#39;s tedious and crapy but it works :)</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, I have a lot of that, still no joy.<br>I&#39;m starting to suspect that there is a JS error happening in one of the callbacks from the iOS module. I know from experience that when that happens, there is no Ti error warning or anything in the console log.</p>
