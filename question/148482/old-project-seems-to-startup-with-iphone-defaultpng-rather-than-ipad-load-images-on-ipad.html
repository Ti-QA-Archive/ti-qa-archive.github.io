		<section>
			<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I have newer projects on iPad which start up with the correct iPad loading screen for each orientation. This one however seems to always start with the iPhone one before the correct iPad ones kick in.</p>
<p>Would this be something to do with a setting somewhere? I looked in tiapp.xml for differences but couldn&#39;t see anything that might be doing this?</p>
<p>From what I can recall, this project which I started on the old Ti builder [before Ti Studio] has always had this problem. Can&#39;t work out what it is..</p>
<p>Any ideas would be appreciated..</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Dave</p>

							<p>Ok, so not really sure what I did that made a difference, but it seems to be fixed now. All I did was compare the tiapp.xml to a newer project and copy over a few bits which were missing and re-order all the items to the newer projects order. Now things are working fine. Bit confused but if anyone has a similar issue maybe doing that may help.</p>

							<p>There was some startup screen bugs in 3.0.0.GA that were fixed for 3.0.2 when we recently added support for localized startup screens. I tested 3.0.2 startup screens a couple days ago and everything works as expected in 3.0.2. When 3.0.2 is released, I recommend upgrading and giving it a shot.</p>
