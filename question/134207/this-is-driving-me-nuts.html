			<p>Here is the story: I install JDK, the Android SDK, ensure that the right SDKs are installed and then install Titanium.  It tells me that the SDKs are missing.  I click on the Install&#x2F;Update button thinking I will tell it where to find them and it comes up with the message &quot;The Android Update was completed successfully&quot; - immediately.  And then we begin the same cycle over and over and over and over again.</p>
<p>I am absolutely sure that I have all the right SDKs.  From what I can see Titanium does not want to know.  What do I do?  Any help would be HUGELY  appreciated.,</p>

							<p>Regrettably I have to reach this conclusion - Titanium is cr<em>**</em>p.  I have spent the best part of 24 hours and I still cannot get it to run</p>
<p>a. For starters it failed with the message could not launch JavaVM or the like.  I eventually found that this was down to an incorrect titanium.ini setting.<br>b. Then it tells me that the Android SDK is missing.  Thanks to Ingo I figured out that it was actually looking for the SDK in the wrong folder!<br>c. So I import the ToDo List project and try to run it in the emulator only to be told that it requires JDK1.6 and I have JDK1.7!  Once again, trawl the net and discover that I have to muck about with a .py file to overcome that hurdle.<br>d. Then I try to run ToDo in the Android emulator only to find that Titanium crashes so I have to restart.<br>e. One more attempt and it presents me with a long list of &quot;errors&quot;.</p>
<p>And they have the temerity to ask for £££ for this?  Like I said, cr<em>**</em>p</p>

							<p>You are welcome to your opinions - if you cannot handle criticism. I moved to Corona-Lua and it is quite simply great.</p>

							<p>$349 a year for iOS + droid or just $199 for one platform as opposed to $49 per month?  I note that the free version offers only &quot;basic APIs&quot; - which are not specified.  Chances are I would have found that notifications etc are &quot;Premium&quot;.</p>
<p>At that kind of price the least one expects is that the system will install and run!  Not wanting to run with a later version of JDK, an ini configuration that results in &quot;JavaVM not started&quot; messages… . Come on!  MoSync too is driven by Eclipse and it works out of the box.</p>
<p>b.t.w - I have no ties with either MoSync or Ansca</p>
