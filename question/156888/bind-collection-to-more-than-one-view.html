			<h1>Bind collection to more than one view?</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Is it possible to bind a collection to more than one view? </p>
<p>First I bind a collection to a ListView on my first window and call fetch(). It displays all the models. The next screen binds the same collection to a new ListView then calls <code>Alloy.Collections.retailers.trigger(&amp;#39;change&amp;#39;);</code> but the list never displays. I can see the transform function getting called but nothing is displayed. If I comment out the fetch() on the initial window and do it instead on the second window then the list is displayed. </p>
<p>Any ideas on what is causing the collection to not display on the second window?</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

							<div><p>As you said the same collection binding on the next screen - I would suggest to pass this data in the form of shared references or by firing an event. <a href="As I assume you are trying to show detailed information on the next screen for the list view that you had in the first screen">Which reduces the hit to the server.</a></p>

							<div><p>Thanks for the replies.</p>
<p>However, I did not describe the situation properly. My apologies for that. I actually have a custom tab bar. Depending on the tab clicked it loads one of two different views into the main view of the window. Each view has a ListView bound to the same collection. Once loaded I would show or hide the view based on the tab clicked. I believe the problem is they are in the same context or some such. If anyone can expand on this I would welcome the explanation. </p>
<p>Anyway, I decided to do it the right&#x2F;better way. I am going to use only one view and change the template used to display the list based on the tab clicked. </p>
<p>Tony, I appreciate the need for a test case but could you confirm or deny that a collection can be bound to two different views existing in separate windows?</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

							<div><p>I think this has more to do with ListViews not refreshing when a bound collection is changed than binding collections to multiple views. Try replacing the ListView with a table view and see if it makes any difference.</p>

							<div><p>The method of dynamically changing the template works nicely. Once the new template is assigned I simply call <code>.trigger(&amp;#39;change&amp;#39;)</code> on the collection and the ListView is updated using the new template and newly transformed data!</p>
