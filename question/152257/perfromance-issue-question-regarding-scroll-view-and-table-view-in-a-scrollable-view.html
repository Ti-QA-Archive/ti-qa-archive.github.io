			<h1>Perfromance issue question regarding scroll view and table view in a scrollable view.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<h2 id="the-set-up">The set up</h2>
<p>I am developing a horizontal news feed using the scrollable view. In each view, there is a background image that can be scrolled horizontally in a scroll view. Additionally, overlaying the image is a table view with about a max of 10 rows.</p>
<p>Since this is a news-type feed, it will continually load new views as the user scrolls. I can remove views if the load becomes too great.</p>
<h2 id="the-question">The question</h2>
<p>What sort of performance can I expect to get with this setup of a scrollable view with each view containing a scroll view and a table view? Testing has showed no issues so far, but I am using the simulator and an iphone5 - I&#39;ll be testing with a 3gs soon.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>You do not provide enough information about the numbers of views within the main scrollable view to be able to determine total size.</p>
<p>Your reference of &quot;…feed, <strong>it</strong> will continually load…&quot; does not reference WHAT <strong>it</strong> is, so it could be the scroll view, the scrollable view or the table view.</p>
<p>You will come across a problem with Android which does not like to mix up scroll views and table views in the same context - so depending on what and how you are adding what to what - this may be a problem.</p>
<p>You may want to provide a sketch of what things are going where or the code you are using (usable snippet only - not the whole thing) to help determine exactly what you are aiming for.</p>
<p>BTW to perform real tests, spend at least an hour but hopefully longer actually using the app on a device - make sure you enter and exit the windows and views and constantly load new feed entries (fake them if required).  This will help determine memory leaks, also check out the use of xcode instruments to help determine memory leaks.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the reply. Looking back, I realize I was a bit too vague. I think I will redesign this based on the Android issues.</p>
<p>In reference to number of views, it could be as few as 10 and as many as the user scrolls to view. I haven&#39;t set a limit to the number of views - that&#39;s party why I was curious about performance and number of views.</p>
<p>Additionally, in reference to what will continually load, I meant to indicate that each view in the scrollable view will continually load.Each of those views contains an image in a scroll view and a table view.</p>
