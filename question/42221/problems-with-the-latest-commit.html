			<p>I am experiencing problems with the latest commit (ea2b629af257f2c28ab6).</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know what was changed but scons updated another file during the build and after that, none of my apps created with this SDK work anymore.<br>They work in the simulator but as soon as I install them to my iPhone they refuse to start.</p>
<p>It&#39;s possible that it has nothing to do with the latest commit but you should be careful what you do.<br>For me, the work day is over until there is a fix for this annoying problem.</p>
<p>btw. where is long-promised 1.4.0?</p>

							<p>Working from git mainline comes with risks - hence having official releases and RC updates for people to test.  The upside is if you find an issue - you can track down the cause &amp; lend a helping hand :)</p>
<p>The other option is to create a <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32238-titanium-mobile">lighthouse</a> ticket with some logs to help identify the issue.</p>
<p>Personally I wouldn&#39;t use any unofficial builds on anything but test projects.</p>
<p>Luckily if you&#39;re using healthy dev practices - you won&#39;t have committed any changes to your personal project that came about due to using the SDK. So you should be able to git checkout&#x2F;reset your project to blow away any changes &amp; switch to an earlier SDK.</p>

							<p>The issues persists with the latest build thus I begin to think that the update that was downloaded by &#39;scons&#39; during the build messed it all up.</p>
<p>The question is: What was changed and how can I revert it. And most importantly: Why isn&#39;t anyone else complaining about this problem?</p>
