		<section>
			<p>I just installed Titanium Studio on Windows XP.<br>I followed the instructions here (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Getting+Started+with+Titanium#GettingStartedwithTitanium-InstallingTitanium) which basically said download and run the installer.<br>When I try to run Titanium Studio, I get a popup saying &#39;Failed to create the Java Virtual Machine&#39;<br>The only answers on this forum I have found has to do with Win7 and says<br>&quot;remove –launcher.XXMaxPermSize 256m from titaniumstudio.ini and start again&quot;<br>I tried this but it doesn&#39;t make any difference.<br>I tried uninstalling and reinstalling<br>Any help please?  What am I missing?</p>

							<p>Hmm, I thought I posted my resolution here about an hour ago - but no… (not sure where I posted it!!!)  but was definitely not a DOH!</p>
<p>Anyway…</p>
<p>After a ton of searching and testing and trying a gagillion things, I added –debug to the titaniumstudio.exe and got some more info then just ‘Failed to create the Java Virtual Machine’ (pretty useless error message)</p>
<p>I saw the error message - ‘could not reserve enough space for object heap’<br>So more searching and testing, I tried changing a line in the titaniumstudio.ini<br>from</p>
<p>-Xmx1024m</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>-Xmx256m</p>
<p>And that worked.</p>
<p>Like I said, definitely not a DOH!   </p>
<p>The installation documentation for this product really needs some work.  Currently it says, download and install and good to go!  Obviously NOT true!  Almost 5 hours trying to get this to work… seriously frustrating.  I hope development in this goes a lot smoother!</p>

										<p><p>The main reason this happens is that you simply do not have enough available memory. For instance, my work machine has 4GB of RAM. However, with my normal work applications open and two virtual machines, I had well under 1GB of RAM free.</p>
<p>Using the default -Xmx1024m, my machine needed well over 1GB of RAM to be free for Titanium. After a reboot and without starting up my VM&#39;s, I was able to use Titanium without issue.</p>
<p>However, changing from Xmx1024m to Xmx256m or Xmx512m should be fine for most people. You will run into performance issues though if your project becomes bigger and bigger. It all comes down to buying&#x2F;freeing up more RAM if your project requires it.</p>

										<p><p>Bravo, Thank You!<br>…<br>I tried to find the link but i think it was the first page that comes up after you click download. I Remember seeing if XP 32 bit 2 GB of continuous free ram needed or recommended….<br>Titanium studio now running on m single core 1.5gb RAM pc 2700 machine…. bleh…</p>
<p>Thank you for the awesome ini fix!</p>

							<p>At first no, because nowhere in the instructions does it say I need to install java first.  Yes I am a complete newbie to Appcelerator, installing it to learn about it and start on a new project.<br>But after reading the error message I thought that might be the case, so I did install it.  I un-installed Titanium and re-installed Java and re-installed Titanium, but am still getting the error.<br>My Java version (installed today).<br>java version &quot;1.6.0_26&quot;<br>Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_26-b03)<br>Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 20.1-b02, mixed mode, sharing)</p>
