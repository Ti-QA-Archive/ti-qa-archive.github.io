			<p>Hi,<br>i just started making a new App.<br>The App is starting right in all iPhone Simulators.<br>I created all the certificates just like usual, AppID, the Provisioning Profile…<br>Put the Profile on my phone to get the App.<br>I&#39;m able to put the App on my iPhone but when i&#39;m launching the App only the Splashscreen appears. It&#39;s a fresh project with a TabGroup and two tabs, nothing special.<br>This behavior is the same on all my developer devices (iPad mini, iPhone 5, iPhone6).<br>I already deleted the Profiles and Certificates, the App and made all new but nothing seems to help.<br>Does anybody ever had the same problem and knows what to do?<br>Thanks!</p>

							<p>I got the Mistake, i had an &quot;ä&quot; in the project name. Seems like the App doesn&#39;t like that. I&#39;m not sure why, but after renaming and removing the &quot;ä&quot;, the Project works fine. I checked that multiple times and every time i had an &quot;ä&quot;, &quot;ö&quot; or &quot;ü&quot; in the Project name, the App freezes on startscreen. I did not know that i can&#39;t use that chars…</p>
