			<h1>Dictionary App Approved</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am pleased to announce that our first App has been approved on the App Store. We developed using Titanium, and I can confirm it has been a great help, since we are preparing now for the Android version of the same App.</p>
<p>Our App can be seen at this link:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunes.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;english-spanish-reference&#x2F;id416235166?mt=8&amp;ls=1</p>
<p>Thanks for this great product and for all the community that has created a great knowledge base here in this forum.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Ricardo</p>

										<p><p>Thanks! Regarding your questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The display of the dictionary results are displayed on a web view. I used CSS to accomplish this.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To make a universal app, you will have to modify builder.py under Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx&#x2F;1.x.x&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;builder.py and modify the TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY to be &quot;1,2&quot; instead of just &quot;1&quot; or &quot;2&quot;.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope this information helps!</p>

							<p>Ricardo, quick question on how you approached coding this application?  I am looking to implement a glossary-type option into the mobile application I am currently developing.  I am resourcing a local SQlite database for my records.  I would like to be able to link to other records from within a record.  Much like your screenshot on the App Store, if one were to look up the word <strong>bank</strong>, it lists <strong>banking</strong> and <strong>house</strong> along with the definition.  <em>Banking</em> and <em>house</em> link to their corresponding records.  How did you do this?  Great app by the way!</p>

							<p>Kyle, you can do this using an id column in your table. Then, in the table where you like the reference, use the id column as well. For example, in table word, use idWord, and in the table synonym use idWord as well, to reference to all the information in table &quot;word&quot;.</p>

										<p><p><strong><em>Ricardo</em></strong>, would you please consider providing some sample code?  Thanks for your suggestions and wonderful insight, but it would be so helpful to see something in context. I guess I&#39;m struggling with understanding how you are calling your data from your SQlite database, and then using the id param such as idWord to link to other records. I would be willing to offer some monetary compensation through Paypal for your time. I am a learning student and am struggling with completely wrapping my mind around database implementation.  It would be great to have someone that could give me a little guidance and steer me in the right direction. Thank you again so much for your time! -Kyle</p>
