			<h1>Where to download the Barcode module as a paying Indie customer. Provided solutions do not work for me and SUPPORT neither</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Can anyone please help me. Best would be if someone knows someone at support, because they don&#39;t seem to react.</p>
<p>My problem: I am an Indie developer and I have payed for one year. I want to download the barcode module, but the mentioned &quot;Titanium+&quot; link on the Helpdesk page is just not visible! When I want to download via Marketplace, I have to pay a monthly subscription of 19.99 USD and there is no way to indicate that I am an Indie developer.</p>
<p>I have been trying to reach support since last friday (today it&#39;s wednesday) but they don&#39;t seem to react. The only guy I could reach was a sales guy, who suggested me to contact &quot;support&quot; ;). </p>
<p>I actually need to barcode module as soon as possible, because I need to incorporate it into a demo for a client. If there is no demo, then there is no client. </p>
<p>I have payed 499 USD for my Indie account, so it would be nice to have some help from the people at Appcelerator. </p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

							<p>Hi,</p>
<p>You should find it now in the &#39;MarketPlace&#39; store under the &#39;Commerce&#39; section:</p>
<p>see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;770</p>

							<p>I&#39;m in the same boat as David &amp; am I a tad confused.  I too forked out 499 USD for the yearly Indie account &amp; as an Indie we have access to the Titanium+ Modules.  Therefore do we use the Titanium+ modules (eg: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.appcelerator.com&#x2F;kb&#x2F;73&#x2F;tickets">barcode</a>) or fork out another $20pm for the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;770">Marketplace Appcelerator module</a> ? Thx</p>

							<p>@Kosso: thanks, this is the location for the barcode module in the marketplace. But it still requires me to pay an additional 19.99 USD. Where I, as a Indie customer, should be able to use this module for free! </p>
<p>@Sharry: glad to hear that I am not the only one with this problem. Have you contacted support? And did they answer?</p>

										<p><p>David, have you visited the TitaniumPlus+ Modules section in the developer part of the site? <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.appcelerator.com&#x2F;kb&#x2F;category&#x2F;20">here</a></p>
<p>Haven&#39;t brought it up yet with support, but noticed that I cannot find the on-demand videos which were aimed at paying users only any longer.</p>

							<p>It seems that we have only &#39;community&#39; support. But in my opinion, not being able to download the modules we have paid for, is not a community issue. So, how can we ever make them clear that their is something wrong. I am a believer in Titanium, and I promote it to my customers and other freelancers, but if this issue isn&#39;t fixed soon, I am seriously considering writing some not-so-nice blogposts and posting some questions on stackoverflow. This is really not-done! Hope they solve it soon.</p>

							<p>Yes. This is clearly an issue if you had paid for the Titanium+ module before they moved over to the Marketplace.</p>
<p>Contact support directly, if I were you.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m sure it will be a simple case of you using the Marketplace download and then them sending you a license from your old purchase&#x2F;subscription.</p>
<p>BTW: There is a totally open source option available too for barcode reading, but it&#39;s a bit complicated to get working, and also, as you say, you have already paid for the right to use the Titanium one.</p>

										<p><p>@Kosso: that&#39;s an option, but I don&#39;t like to enter my payment information for a recurring payment just to hope they will refund me afterwards. But it seems I must do if they don&#39;t respond, because my customer wants to see the demo on both Android and iPhone asap.</p>

										<p><p>I would have thought so.  It seems this move to the Marketplace scenario has caused some confusion in accessing what you&#39;ve paid for. But if you contact them directly, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll sort it out, if you have paid for something.</p>

							<p>@Kosso: I did, without any result.. :( And it seems that Indie accounts only have community support. So there is no easy way to solve this issue. Will they even consider support questions from Indie dev&#39;s? Let&#39;s hope so..</p>
