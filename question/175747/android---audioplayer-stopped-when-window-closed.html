			<h1>Android - AudioPlayer stopped when window closed</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Running on SDK 3.2.3, Android 4.4.</p>
<p>My app&#39;s root is a tab group. Users may open new windows on top of the tab group. On new windows users may start an audio player. The problem is if I close the window and return to the tab group, the audio player stops. This is not what I want. Since I haven&#39;t exited the app, I want the audio player to keep playing.</p>
<p>Is it possible?</p>

							<p>Think this through Shawn….. You are hosting a player in a window… Its a child object of that window ? If you close a window, what happens to the child objects inside ?</p>

										<p><p>No it&#39;s not a child object of the window, at least it&#39;s not added to the window explicitly. See <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Media.AudioPlayer">docs</a> here for how it works. I wonder how it associates with a window&#39;s activity. At least on iOS, closing a window won&#39;t stop the audio player.</p>
<p>Btw, allowBackground of the audio player is set to true, and I have a global reference to the audio player (in a commonjs module).</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>Did you ever get a solution to this?</p>
<p>I am having this exact same issue now. </p>
<p>I&#39;m even creating the audio player back in the root app.js and firing events back to it, to start playing.<br>Works perfectly in iOS, calling back from a stack of windows and staying playing when the windows close. </p>
<p>But on Android, while it starts playing when called from a window, it stops when the window up the stack closes. </p>
<p>It could have something to do with now, since 3.2.0 all Android Windows are <em>heavYweight</em> windows and as such, are running in their own Activity. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried with both heavyweight and also lightweight windows (by using the legacy window property as provided in the Ti.UI.window docs). Audio stops, despite the player being in the root window.</p>

										<p><p>Update: </p>
<p>The only way I have found to work around this is by adding an audio player to Ti.App. </p>
<p>from this solution years ago : https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;118302&#x2F;android–audio-stops-in-navigation</p>

										<p><p>Yes that&#39;s one way. What I ended up to do is just use Ti.UI.View instead of Ti.UI.Window. I think that&#39;s less memory usage, and the audio player will be only created when users want to play the audio.</p>
