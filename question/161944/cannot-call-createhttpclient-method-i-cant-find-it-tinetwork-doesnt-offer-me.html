							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The best thing to do is start with the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#">documentation</a> site and enter your search in that.</p>
<p>The autocomplete is only useful if you know the path to the thing you are after.  The documentation will let you type in &quot;thing&quot; you want and then you can find the method and path to the method there.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Network.HTTPClient">Example Usage</a></li>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Network-method-createHTTPClient">createHTTPClient</a> documentation.</li>
</ul>

							<p>Look down at your system, try to find a piece of hardware that looks something like this:</p>
<p><img src="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;upload.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wikipedia&#x2F;commons&#x2F;9&#x2F;96&#x2F;Apple-wireless-keyboard-aluminum-2007.jpg" alt="keyboard"></p>
<p>Now, don&#39;t freak out! Your&#39;s might be a different color, just because its not an exact match, does not mean it will not work!</p>
<p>Now, pay close attention, you need to press those mini &#39;buttons&#39; called &#39;keys&#39;.  Using this input device you can actually TYPE</p>
<p><code>createHttpClient</code></p>

										<p><p>You might be thinking you are just getting told off here - that is not the case - just helping you get to where you need to be, so if something is pointed out it is to help you next time - here is another one - sorry.</p>
<p>Quick tip; next time - please do not create a new answer when your contribution is actually a comment - it confuses things in the future when trying to work out relevance, simply add a comment to the answer it is related to, or if the additional information is a follow up to the question or general information then add it as a comment to your own question at the top.  You are NOT being told off.</p>

							<p>I mean… and my question is: Is this normal?…</p>
<p>I came from microsoft tecnology, frameworks and SDKs.</p>
<p>If I write createHTTPClient regarless titanium didnt offer me that method and nothing happens when I run the app, I must ask what happens.. </p>
<p>… because nothing happens if I write createHTTPClient or create999HTTPClient.or createHTTP232928Client</p>
<p>Stephen, if this is normal, and you know the answer, maybe you should just help answering what the people is looking for and not being sarcastic for feed your esteem</p>
<p>Thanks anyway</p>

										<p><p>I guess you did not read my answer then?  As I said the autocomplete is only useful as you traverse down the path of objects.  You may have been used to other things but this is no longer that I am afraid.</p>
<p>Which is why both Stephen and myself recommended the documentation site - it provides rich information on all methods and properties of all objects.  Additionally there are example usages for many of the the main concepts.  </p>
<p>I pointed out both where the documentation was so you know what properties you have available and a usage example that gives a &quot;how to&quot; use the method.</p>
<p>Clearly you are annoyed by an answer given here and you are welcome to be annoyed - rightly or wrongly.  But keep in mind the Titanium system is provided with many additional resources that are all pointed out as you progress through the process.  So it can be frustrating when people either do not bother referring to the examples and documentation provided to them or hope that what they were used to with other languages will remain the same for all future languages.</p>
<p>There is work to do before you start writing code in any new language or framework - much like learning a new foreign language it would not be smart or easy to simply try talking that language without learning some basic words and phrases and then progress from there.</p>
