			<h1>crash on Android restarting app after being in pause mode</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have the following problem:<br>If I put my android mobile to pause mode, while the app is running, all is fine. If I click to the home screen and return to the app all is fine. But if I&#39;m on the home screen and try to start the app again after being in pause mode I get only a black screen and nothing happens anymore. </p>
<p>After ca. 10 sek. I get a message that the app is not reacting and I can choose to wait or force to kill the app.</p>
<p>Any idea what the reason can be? </p>
<p>thanks in advance<br>Frank</p>

							<div><p>I found out the app allways crashes after entering the sleep mode from the home screen while the app is running in background. It&#39;s not crashing on return to the app. It just crashes when going to sleep. </p>
<p>If the mobile goes to sleep while the app is open, then it&#39;s no problem, all is running fine.</p>

										<p><p>I installed the new SDK now and compiled it again with this version but the problem is still the same. I have a radio app and when I&#39;m on the home screen of my android phone all is fine. When the phone now goes to sleep the app crashed. The only thing that is better now, is that the app is reseting when I start it again. Bevor the the new SDK version is appears only black and the mobile was no longer reacting.</p>

										<p><p>same as before. While the app is open and the mobile goes to sleep all is fine, the music is still playing. If I switch to the home screen the music is also playing. But when the mobile goes to sleep from the homescreen it seems that the app is killed. Music stops directly.</p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t know what happend. Since my last post here all was running fine. Today I Installed a new version of my app to my phone and now it&#39;s the same problem as before. I&#39;m still using the SDK Version 2.0.0.xxxx </p>
<p>The only thing that changed is that there was a titanium studio update last week.</p>

										<p><p>Ok, it&#39;s running fine now and I found out the reason for the strange behavior a few days ago. With the original Andoid launcher all was running good since your last SDK build, but after installing Go Launcher Ex as launcher the app got killed after being in sleep mode from the homepage. Uninstalling GO Launcher EX, all was running fine again. </p>
<p>I thought it might be usefull to have this info. </p>
<p>Thanks Mauro for your help. </p>
<p>Best Frank</p>
