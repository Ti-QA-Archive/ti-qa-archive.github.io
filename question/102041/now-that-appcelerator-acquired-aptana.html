							<p>Good question.  I seem to remember that the Aptana plug-in for Eclipse did exactly that for Android dev.  I might be thinking of something else though.</p>
<p>Still, I agree with you.  WYSIWYG is definitely needed.  There&#39;s nothing &quot;cool&quot; about crafting the UI by hand.  :-)</p>

							<p>To be honest I wouldn&#39;t be surprised. The people running Appcelerator seem to have a penchant for finding things to distract them from all that boring stuff (fixing bugs, increasing code quality and improving documentation). Why spend money hiring engineers when you can acquire a multi-million dollar corporation?</p>

										<p><p>As a user not affiliated with Appcelerator, let me say I hope your post was sarcastic (which rarely comes across well in written language).  Since getting the last venture funding, I think they have more than doubled their staff size and shooting for at least triple.  And from where I sit, it seems like they have fixed numerous bugs and increased quality.  I do find the documentation lacking, but then having an IDE which offers code completion and argument tooltips will help too.</p>
<p>Personally, in the few months I have done more serious work in Titanium, I have gotten way more than my money&#39;s worth:  I have never paid them a cent.  Have I had frustrations? Sure, but some are my own doing, like coding a callback listener as &#39;onError&#39; instead of &#39;onerror&#39; and taking way too long to figure out why it was not getting called.  Having IDE integration will minimize that type of mistake.</p>
<p>I for one am looking forward to the webinar and a preview of the roadmap. Bring it on!</p>
