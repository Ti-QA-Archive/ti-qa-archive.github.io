			<h1>Desktop - http links and flv video not working</h1>

		<section>
			<p><strong>Firstly I think Titanium is great. Well done to all that are involved in its making.</strong> </p>
<p>But (there is always a but!) I am having a few problems and I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s me or the program (probably me, eh?!) - but any help from anywhere would be so greatly appreciated.</p>
<h2 id="brief-">BRIEF:</h2>
<p>I want to make a <strong>desktop application</strong> that simply opens a website I have already designed (in a local folder). It will go on a usb for a client and must be cross platform compatible.</p>
<h2 id="problems-">Problems:</h2>
<p>a) I&#39;ve downloaded &amp; installed Titanium (on my mac) and signed up etc all correctly, as well as downloading the desktop version of KitchenSink to start just for experimental testing. </p>
<p>But when I launch KitchenSink within Titanium, it just gives me a blank screen when I open it. I have looked in your Q&amp;A and there seems to be an issue with file linking? Even with a few workarounds all I get is a blank accordian menu only. <strong>What is wrong?</strong></p>
<p>b) Meanwhile, I have managed to put my website in the Resources folder (replacing the index.html file) and all works fine until I click on an external link, when the screen fades black 50% and a little image question mark appears. Again what&#39;s wrong?</p>
<p>c) I also have a .swf calling a .flv flash video (in the resources folder) on the homepage but it wont play the video - the .swf loads fine though.</p>
<h2 id="help-please-">Help please!</h2>

							<p>Hmmm…I get the feeling c) is a bug, since I&#39;m experiencing similar issues. I&#39;m on Snow Leopard as well, using a .swf that uses the user&#39;s webcam. The .swf loads fine, does what it&#39;s supposed to do, but the video never shows. </p>
<p>Since I just picked up my project again where I left it 9 months ago, and it all worked fine then, I think something changed in Titanium Desktop since then.</p>
<p>Your issue and mine both are about displaying video in an embedded flash object.</p>

							<p>Ah! A little more browsing through the Q&amp;A section revealed the answer from David Kaye in this thread: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;12181&#x2F;flash-player-10-swf-files-wont-display-in-titanium-developer-1-for-linux)</p>
<p>Adding the wmode=&quot;transparent&quot; parameter to the &lt;embed&gt; tag solves c) (and therefore my issue as well)</p>
