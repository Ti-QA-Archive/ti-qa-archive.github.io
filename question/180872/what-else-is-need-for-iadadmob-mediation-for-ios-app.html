			<h1>What else is need for iAd/AdMob mediation for iOS app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I did the following:</p>
<p>1) Added iAd.framework into iOS project. i imported iAd&#x2F;iAd.h and .m into project. </p>
<p>2) I opened AdMob account. In mediation i made iAd cpm higher than AdMob cpm.</p>
<p>3) Downloaded the AdMob SDK iOS 7.0 SDK into project and it comes with AdMob adapter. Imported GoogleMobileAds into .h and .m files in project</p>
<p>4) Downloaded the iAd adapter into project.</p>
<p>5) Under Build Settings in  Other linker flags I added -ObjC so it&#39;s in debug and release.</p>
<p>It states in Admob Mediation instructions &quot;There is no need to write additional code to create ad views from each ad network. The AdMob mediation SDK will invoke each ad network&#39;s adapters and SDK as necessary to create ads&quot;</p>
<p>Following above steps and not adding any code, doesn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>I have 1 ViewController that ads share with 3 methods in that 1 VC. 1st= viewDidLoad method 2nd= Start Game method and 3rd= GameOver method. Then back to viewDidLoad after GameOver.</p>
<p>So Then I added iad code in viewDidLoad and made iad hide in didFailToReceiveAdWithError and AdMob show.</p>
<p>This made iAd load and iAd stays showing test banner for like 5 minutes before it fails and AdMob loads. However, AdMob instantly change back to iAd after I leave the GameOver page and go to viewDidLoad.</p>
<p>So I don&#39;t think mediation is working properly because the ad banners aren&#39;t supposed to be affected by any of the methods. What did I do wrong? How do I set up mediation properly?</p>
