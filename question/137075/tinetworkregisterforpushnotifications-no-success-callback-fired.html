			<h1>Ti.Network.registerForPushNotifications no success callback fired</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>latest mobile 2.0 using on device 5.1;</p>
<p>No matter what I try I cannot get any callbacks from Ti.Network.registerForPushNotifications to fire; In notifications settings the application is shown and all notification types are &quot;on&quot;; so the applicaltion is registered with the phone; but no callbacks;</p>
<p>This is a major blocker for me; as I have tried just about everything there is no debug or stack trace to indicate what might be wrong if anything; I am totally up shit creek without a paddle; </p>
<p>if anyone has come across this issue I would be must grateful for any help;</p>
<p>yep full rebuilds; regeneration of all the certificates just about everything I can think of I have done about 5 times double checking each way; still no callbacks are fired;</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

							<div><p>I can only confirm what you are seeing, Richard.  I am trying to register push notifications for the iPhoneI have looked at this every which way, checked out my certs over and over again but to no avail.  I make a registerForPushNotifications call and it goes away into the void with nothing coming back - no error, no success, no UUID ….  .   This is driving me nuts!</p>
