			<h1>App rejected : What do they call a bug</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I submitted an iOs App that basically fetches Json streams. I was rejected for this reason :<br>2.2: Apps that exhibit bugs will be rejected<br>As I tested the App pretty much before submiting, I&#39;m trying to figure out what they call a bug. </p>
<p>-I have alerts(Titanium alert) when a stream is not available. Could this be a reason. Or do I need to have a more explicit message on<br>the alert text. Is content unavailable a reason for bug rejection?</p>
<p>-Also the App id pretty unresponsive on 3.1 systems(but works), can this be considered as a bug?</p>
<p>-is it better to request a newer version of the OS than 3.1<br>Thanks for sharing your experience.</p>

							<p>Yes, for starters I would suggest putting a limitation on the minimum iOS version needed to run your app. If the app is causing machines on iOS 3.1 and lower to crash, then Apple would definitely tell you to either fix the app or simply just not put it on the App Store.</p>
<p>If Apple still rejects the app after putting the minimum iOS requirement, I would suggest Emailing the App Review Team directly and asking them what their reason for denying your app was. I did this once and they got back to me within 3 days and I got my problem solved, they even gave me some code to fix it.</p>

										<p><p>In fact I went through the resolution center from App Review and found a screenshot of the bug. My app relies on a weather prediction Json stream. When the stream is not available I display an alert saying &quot;server error…&quot; apparently this is considered as a bug. What should I do un such a case:</p>
<p>Display a more explicit alert or present a default screen saying &quot;data unavailable please come back?</p>
<p>What are the best practises dealing with external data streams?</p>

										<p><p>I would suggest something like:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">The server has encountered <span class="hljs-operator">an</span> error. Please <span class="hljs-keyword">try</span> again <span class="hljs-operator">or</span> contact <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> developers <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> this problem persists.
</code></pre><p>That way at least the user knows that they can try again and it should work, if not they should contact you. That&#39;s much better than simply saying &quot;Server error&quot;, which could mean a whole deal of things and gives the user no information on what to do or where to go for help.</p>

										<p><p>Do you think alerts are OK or interpreted as bugs wether they display an explicit message or not?</p>

										<p><p>Definitely not. Apple uses alerts themselves to display messages and other things. Many apps out there use them to display deals, information, etc.</p>
<p>In my opinion it is just the way the alert was worded that caused them to think it was a bug. I believe if you gave more explanation to what happened (No internet connection, server could not be found, etc.) they would have let the app through.</p>
<p>But because it was a simple &quot;Server error&quot; and gave no reason to why it happened or what the user could do, it seemed more like an error on the apps part than anything else.</p>
