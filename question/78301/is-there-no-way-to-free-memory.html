		<section>
			<p>i have an app with a scrollable view with 15 images and an index. when i open the app on my ipad the available memory is 132. just pulling up the index drops it to 72. flipping through a few pages drops it down to 2 and then it crashes.</p>
<p>am i doing something wrong? i&#39;ll post the code if necessary but as stated its just a very simple scrollable view with a scroll view index. Help would be greatly greatly appreciated.</p>

							<div><p>Assuming that the code you&#39;re using to implement this is pretty much similar to what&#39;s provided in Kitchen Sink, the next thing that comes to mind as possible suspects would be the sizes of those resource image files you&#39;re adding into the view object. Some code would be cool as well to properly diagnose.</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;m just starting a project that was originally done using web app tech using phone gap, I was hoping titanium would be a good solution, but it seems like memory management is an issue here as well. I guess there is no way around object-c - unless someone here can convince me this can be resolved without a bunch of hacks. I miss action script.</p>

							<p>Seems similar to this bug: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;46061&#x2F;serious-memory-leak</p>
<p>I also have the same issue, every scroll is decreasing the Free memory available… Unless this is fixed soon, this makes the scrollableView component useless.</p>
<p>If anyone from the dev. team is reading this, what&#39;s the best way to tackle this please?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>This could be due to an iPhone4 having twice the RAM of an iPad.</p>
<ul>
<li>iPhone4 has 512M RAM</li>
<li>iPad has 256M RAM</li>
</ul>
<p>Apple may need to launch a new iPad with 512M to get fast app switching and multitasking working smoothly in iOS 4.2</p>

							<p>I agree, memory management is very disappointing in Titanium. You cannot imagine how it&#39; hard to tell client &#39;sorry, we cannot finish your project because of SDK failure&#39;. You are investing millions so HIRE SOMEONE TO FIX IT!! This is critical bug.</p>

							<p>Same here, I am big disappointed with the Titanium background worker, memory management, threading, packaging etc. Its really hard to tell client &#39;sorry, we are taking time because of SDK failure&#39;. Titanium is having critical bugs.</p>
