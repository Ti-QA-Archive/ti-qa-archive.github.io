			<h1>iPad Ad Hoc builds in Xcode getting Failed to Install</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Im having an issue getting my Titanium App installed on an iPad - specifically when building from Xcode. (I&#39;m using the Ad Hoc distribution method so that can give the ipa file to a client).</p>
<p>What happens is after syncing the iPad with iTunes the app attempts to install then terminates with the message on the Device:</p>
<p>&gt; &quot;My App name&quot; failed to install.</p>
<p>I have seen this error before and typically is the error you would get if the Device&#39;s UDID is not in the Provisioning File, which it is.</p>
<p>If I build the app for <strong>iPhone</strong>, and deploy to the iPad this <strong>DOES work</strong>.  So very much iPad specific, I&#39;m guessing its something to do with my Build Settings in Xcode.</p>
<p>Also, to note if I use Titanium Studios &quot;Distribute app via Ad Hoc&#x2F;Enterprise&quot; for the iPad this <strong>DOES work</strong>, so again only Xcode builds not working.  I&#39;ve compared the Provisioning file that Titanium is building with and it is identical to what I have chosen in my &quot;Code Signing&quot; (Build Settings) in Xcode.  So again - if anyone can tell me what Titaniums Ad Hoc distribution method is doing differently from how I&#39;m building in Xcode?? As ideally I want to use Xcode to manually build the ipa as Titanium is doing. (A small point to note is that the ipa file size is slightly bigger after Titanium builds the ipa vs. Xcode doing it, as in 21mb to 19mb).</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> I need to build the App via Xcode as I&#39;m have to apply a bit of code to embed a custom push notification service.</p>
<p>Any help or recommendations on this topic would be very well received as this is causing me to tear my hair out!!</p>

							<div><p>I actually struggled with the same thing last week (a whole night before pre-release day). My ipa&#39;s don&#39;t get signed properly if I compile it from xcode. Still not sure why, but at least the Distribute in Titanium Studio works. The error I get on my ipad is <code>installd unrecognized status -67068 from codesigning library</code></p>

							<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I was able to resolve the Original issue here and will post in case its of use to anyone else that hits this issue.</p>
<p>In the end what I did was the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Xcode click my project so that I get a list of my Targets (i.e. they were iPhone, iPad and Universal).</li>
<li>Duplicate the iPhone Target, and call it iPad or whatever.</li>
<li>For the duplicate Target change the Device to &quot;iPad&quot;</li>
<li>Change the Target (Top-left) to the my duplicated target (iPad) and build and archive.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that works.</p>
