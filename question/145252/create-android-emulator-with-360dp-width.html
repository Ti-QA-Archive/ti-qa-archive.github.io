			<h1>Create android emulator with 360dp width?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m developing an application for android devices (2.1+) using titanium sdk 2.1.4GA, titanium studio build: 2.1.2.201208301612, running on Mac OSX.</p>
<p>When adding images and other elements to the app, I&#39;m specifying element width in DP, i.e. 300dp. The total screen width is considered to be 320dp. </p>
<p>However, some devices, such as HTC Radar and HTC Sensation 4G have screen width  = 360dp and on these devices some elements of my application are positioned incorrectly (as some of the testers complained). I do not personally have any of these devices, and would like to test the behaviour in android emulator. However, all titanium emulators have 320dp width. I&#39;m wondering if it is possible to create an emulator with screen width = 360dp and test my application in that emulator. Would appreciate if you give me a link&#x2F;instruction on how to do that.</p>

							<p>You can alter the settings of an AVD using the AVD Manager. See if this blog post helps at all: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;08&#x2F;how-to-resize-the-android-emulator.html">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;08&#x2F;how-to-resize-the-android-emulator.html</a></p>

										<p><p>Hi Anthony! Thanks for the link. I tried to do the step-by-step from the post, but I still can not reproduce the issue that appears on the HTC Radar on the emulator. HTC Radar is 540 <em> 960 pixels with 360dp (?). When I edit the titanium emulator as per instruction and start the application in it, the emulator screen size is different from 540 </em> 960 and the application shows up there just fine.</p>

										<p><p>I think now that manipulations described in the article still keep the width 320dp. In telnet they suggest to type &quot;window scale n.nn&quot; which in my understanding will be just multiplying 320*480 by this factor, so the ratio width&#x2F;height stays the same. And what I want to do is to change this ratio…</p>

										<p><p>Try opening up your AVD Manager and hilighting your AVD. Instead of starting it, choose &#39;edit&#39; from the list on the right. When the edit screen pops up, set the width and height in the &#39;Skin&#39; section. In the properties, try setting the screen density to 360.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you for the answer! I&#39;ve tried to do as you suggested, but I&#39;m unable to set Abstracted LCD density parameter to anything except {120, 160, 240, 213, 320}. Those are the only values available in the dropdown for the Abstracted LCD density and it does not allow me to type in anything else. Do you know if there is way to set it somehow through the command line, to avoid AVD manager GUI limitations?</p>
<p>Thanks!!!</p>

										<p><p>Just found a way to do that, so in case anyone else needs to do the same:</p>
<ol>
<li>In AVD manager, select the device and click &quot;Details&quot; button.</li>
<li>It will show AVD details, among which there would be specified Path variable</li>
<li>Go to that folder and edit config.ini file, in that file set hw.lcd.density as needed (it corresponds to Abstracted LCD density). May be the same should be done with hardware-qemu.ini file, I&#39;m not sure (looks like the latter is overwritten every time the AVD starts from the config file).</li>
</ol>
<p>After that it is possible to start project as usual from the Titanium Studio. I was able to reproduce my original issue on the emulator!</p>
