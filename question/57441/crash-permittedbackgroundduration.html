			<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Layout: Tabs</p>
<p>Scenario:  Transition from one window to another.  It is not creating the window and displays a blank screen.  When I checked the device log, it says the following:</p>
<p>Application Specific Information:<br>&quot;TestApp&quot; has active assertions beyond permitted time:<br>{(<br>    &lt;SBProcessAssertion: 0x7376970&gt; identifier: Suspending process: TestApp[310] permittedBackgroundDuration: 10.000000 reason: suspend owner pid:28 preventSuspend  preventThrottleDownCPU  preventThrottleDownUI<br>)}</p>
<p>I just have a simple window with two tableview rows and a background image.  In the table view click event,  I&#39;m using the current location.</p>
<p>Please advise.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Sravan</p>

							<p>Yes, it seems to be happening because of the analytics. When i was testing for network status by turning on AIRPLANE mode, my app showed a &quot;no-network&quot; pop-up. But when i close the app and try to open it again, I could see a crash report with the same exception and the app could not load after the default splash screen. </p>
<p>When i turned analytics off, I no longer had this kind of crash reports. Thanks for finding this out Sravan!</p>

							<p>I too am seeing this with SDK 1.4.1.1, on iOS 4.1.  However, it seems that it is possible that this is when you do a &quot;Run on Device&quot; from Titanium Developer, and even though you&#39;d &quot;quit&quot; the app on your phone, it was still actually running (because of Fast App Switching), so it gets aborted when the new version of your app gets installed.  That&#39;s just a theory, but it seems to happen that way for me.  I just watched that happen.  I had had my app running on a phone via Run on Device, had quit the app by pressing the home button.  Then, I went and did another Run on Device with a new build, and voila, right after it got installed I see a new crash log pop up in Xcode&#39;s Organizer for that phone&#x2F;device, and with this same message.</p>

							<p>Interesting. In my case, I have UIApplicationExitsOnSuspend set in my Info.plist, so my app should be fully closing when I press the home button. I&#39;ll look into this a bit more…</p>

							<p>Additional Info:  Its not happening when I set UIApplicationExitsOnSuspend property set to false.  </p>
<p>Is it a serious issue?  I could see a lot of crash reports saying the same. Whenever I call openUrl or press home button I guess this is happening.</p>
<p>Please advise.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Its been about 5 weeks I since I posted this.  Still unable to get any help.  Could anyone give me the details about the error,  how to avoid this etc.</p>

							<p>Atlast, I was able to figure out the root cause of this exception.  It was the analytics.  When you exit the application,  it still tries to send some information I guess, and that is the reason why we are getting the exception.</p>
<p>By making &lt;analytics&gt; to false in tiapp.xml resolved the issue.</p>
