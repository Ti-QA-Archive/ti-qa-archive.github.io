<p>The problem still persists. I am still prompted to download&#x2F;extract the 1.2.2 package everytime I started Titanium Desktop. </p>
<p>I have tried to re-install the program, no luck. Tried to run the program under admin, no luck. </p>

<p>Would you mind posting a screenshot of the message that asks you to upgrade, or does it attempt to upgrade without your authorization?  Also, another screenshot would be helpful of 1.2.2 being downloaded next to the title bar of Titanium Developer, to show that you have 1.2.2 already installed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, what operating system (including service packs) are you running Titanium Developer on?</p>
<p>Are you able to ignore this issue and use the software, or does it render Titanium Developer unusable?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Are you running the 32bit or 64bit version of Titanium Developer?</p>

							<div><p>@Paul,</p>
<p>I am running 32bit TI on my Vista 32bit with latest patches (Simplified Chinese version).</p>
<p>When I click the icon for TI to launch the desktop, a UAC dialog prompts and after I say &quot;continue&quot; in that Vista dialog, it automatically starts the downloading. The screen shot is shown in the link I posted yesterday. </p>
<p>There is no upgrading progress indication when I get into TI desktop interface. </p>
<p>If I cancel the downloading dialog, I am not able to run TI. </p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Have you followed the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.appcelerator.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;installing_on_windows.html#titanium_developer">Titanium Developer</a> section of the &quot;Installing on Windows 7&quot; guide?  I know you are on Vista, but that part of the procedure should be the same. Are you certain you aren&#39;t running the installer again, rather than the &quot;Titanium Developer&quot; executable (which should be in one of your &quot;C:\Program Files&quot; directories)?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>Hi Paul, </p>
<p>My TI installation is in d:\Program Files. My C: drive is very crowded and that is why I install it to D:. </p>
<p>I am sure I execute the right exe file as I am clicking that exe file in my explorer. </p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

										<p><p>OK Taylor, I would recommend you to completely uninstall and reinstall Titanium Developer as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>close all Titanium and android programs</li>
<li>run the Titanium Developer uninstaller, which is located in the folders where Titanium Developer is installed (usually <code>C:\Program Files</code>)</li>
<li>delete the Titanium application settings directory. On Win7, this is <code>C:\Users\appcel\AppData\Roaming\Titanium</code></li>
<li>delete the directory where Titanium stores the android sdcard. On Win7, this is <code>C:\Users\appcel\.titanium</code></li>
<li>delete the <code>.deltafy</code> directory. On Win7, this is <code>C:\Users\appcel\.deltafy</code></li>
<li>Once Titanium Developer has been completely removed, reboot your machine</li>
<li>disable your antivirus and local firewall (not your router firewall, or else your system will be completely unprotected from Internet threats)</li>
<li>reinstall Titanium Developer</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me know if that improves matters.</p>

										<p><p>@Paul, </p>
<p>Thanks for your remarks. I will NOT take this approach as this is also very terrible for me. </p>
<p>Anyway, today I have reviewed the shortcut for Titanium Desktop and found that it links not to the exe file in my installation but to a Windows registry item. So I decided to create another shortcut to directly point to my exe file. </p>
<p>With this, when I click the shortcut, it still prompts me to upgrade but I can cancel it and start the Titanium Desktop anyway. </p>
<p>So considering this, I would say this problem is circumvented. </p>
<p>Rgds!</p>
<p>Taylor</p>

<p>The aim of this question is to resolve Taylor&#39;s issue. The cause of your issue <em>may</em> be completely different, so just explain your problem properly in a new question, rather than confusing this one. Thanks</p>
