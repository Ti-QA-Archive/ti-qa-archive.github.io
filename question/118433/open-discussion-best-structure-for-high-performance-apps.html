			<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>actually we are quite experienced in developing applications with titanium. Since applications are becoming more and more complex, I&#39;m wondering about a &quot;best way&quot; to build complex applications…</p>
<p>first: Ti.include is not very good… so how do you handle things like this? include everything in app.js, include when needed with the most ugly piece of code ever written (Ti.include(&quot;..&#x2F;..&#x2F;..&#x2F;..&#x2F;..&#x2F;..&#x2F;..&#x2F;..&#x2F;….) or absolute paths within folders?</p>
<p>second: at some point we experience that event calls are getting lost or, which happens quite often on a 3GS, they are queued and all fired at once. This becomes to a real issue when opening windows within an event listener on a table e.g. (window opens multiple times). we started to remove&#x2F;add eventlistener or&#x2F;and force to overwrite existing objects. however: the event listener is queued multiple times because of cutty user tapping on his iphone :)</p>
<p>thirdly: SQLlite… e.g. we store local data on a sqlite datebase, we have to close and open database connection every time we update, insert or delete something… actually it looks like the titanium database connection is some kind of &quot;funnel&quot; in every app, because of using only one thread.</p>
<p>to sum up: there are many pitfalls when you app becomes bigger &#x2F; more complex. I would love to hear your experience and maybe your solutions to common problems. I really love building applications with titanium but I&#39;m not sure about &quot;where it is all going&quot;: It feels like blackberry release is some kind of duke nukem, while some core performance issues are still not getting fixed… but I&#39;m sure you can handle this ;)</p>
<p>best,<br>flo</p>

							<div><p>Hello,</p>
<p>Here our first big project we used Ti.include a lot in app.js, the project now is one year old.<br>Performance wise it was ok, and we were starting bulding apps so the best practice on how to use or structure our app using Titanium it was minimum, Ti.include was our approach for doing things.</p>
<p>Now with the new sdk versions of titanium we are porting things to only use require, like small modules inside the app.<br>This way the code will be more structured and we can re-use a lot of things in a better way, with increase in performance also.</p>
<p>local data storing until now only used properties, but our next project we will use database, so im doing now a lot of tests with local data, going to database this time for creating a simple table log of data inserted by the user, the table will be 50 records more or less.</p>
<p>Had some problems also lol, most recent was the require bug not working in destribution but its fixed now :)</p>
<p>Cheers, Daniel</p>
<p>ps: only see this post now lol its nice to share experiencs using Titanium</p>

							<p>Ti.include is not so good when you have large number of files, you can&#39;t use it inside functions and that&#39;s why you can&#39;t load other JS files &quot;on demand&quot; (after some time application load time starts to increase considerably). &quot;require&quot; seems better choice, but I didn&#39;t try it yet.</p>
<p>Titanium events system is unstable and unreliable (at least on Android). If you&#39;re not careful, you can create a lot of exceptions - &quot;sending event on dead thread&quot;. Even if you are careful, sometimes this happens also. That&#39;s why I wrote my own event system that registers all events and unregister them when window closes. It&#39;s far more reliable and it works pretty good (although, some improvements can be made).</p>
<p>Titanium memory handling is also poor. I&#39;ve seen some solutions but they didn&#39;t work for me. That&#39;s why I wrote my own components system, in which I add (generic) components to other components and to the contexts - windows (single-context heavy-weight windows). When window closes, all components are removed manually. That way my memory stays constant over time.</p>
<p>So basically, I do same thing for components and for events. Register them and then remove them when window closes.</p>
<p>My application at current time has about 850 files (each file is basically a component), I&#39;ve built complex forms and UI structures with this approach and it works fine (although it has some issues that I think are Titanium related anyway :) ).</p>
<p>I hope I will have time to write a little more about this in the future. :)</p>

							<p>I use the Single Context pattern when organizing my code.</p>

							<p>Hello,</p>
<p>im using has a reference from now the CommonJS modules structure, for example the: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;08&#x2F;forging-titanium-episode-2-a-cross-platform-navigation-controller.html">CommonJS navigation controller </a> and other episodes of CommonJS that titanium is doing. Doing this way it only loads the modules that is necessary.</p>
