			<h1>Impossible to comply with Apple guidelines using Titanium?</h1>

			<p>In a two-pane layout, Apple requires that the master view selection be obvious to the user.  In proper apps, this is usually done by keeping the master view table cell in the selected state.</p>
<p>Since this basic functionality is not supported properly in Titanium, nor is hasCheck, nor selectRow, or deselectRow, or even changing the colour of the row Titles, I wonder how such apps have passed review?</p>
<p>I presume there have been two-pane apps made with Titanium.</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve found the bug in the Titanium source code.</p>
<p>You need to open:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-regexp">/Library/</span>Application Support<span class="hljs-regexp">/Titanium/m</span>obilesdk<span class="hljs-regexp">/osx/</span><span class="hljs-number">1.6</span>.<span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-regexp">/iphone/</span>Classes<span class="hljs-regexp">/TiUITableView.m</span>
</code></pre><p>And change setSelected: from:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">-</span>(void)<span class="hljs-tag">setSelected</span>:(BOOL)<span class="hljs-tag">yn</span>
{
    <span class="hljs-attr_selector">[super setHighlighted:yn]</span>;
    <span class="hljs-attr_selector">[self updateGradientLayer:yn|[self isHighlighted]</span>];
}
</code></pre><p>to:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">-</span>(void)<span class="hljs-tag">setSelected</span>:(BOOL)<span class="hljs-tag">yn</span>
{
    <span class="hljs-attr_selector">[super setSelected:yn]</span>;
    <span class="hljs-attr_selector">[super setHighlighted:yn]</span>;
    <span class="hljs-attr_selector">[self updateGradientLayer:yn|[self isHighlighted]</span>];
}
</code></pre><p>The problem is with UITableView reusing cached cells and the selection state of the reused cell not being cleared. TiUITableViewCell overrides setSelected: but doesn&#39;t pass on the message to the super class.</p>
<p>For the change to take effect you will need to delete the contents of your <strong>build&#x2F;iphone</strong> directory to force a complete rebuild of your project.</p>

							<p>I actually said &#39;properly supported&#39;.  All of these functions seem to suffer from the same problem as allowsSelection:true - they don&#39;t work.</p>
<p>All you have to do is add 25 or 30 lines to the Selectable Rows &quot;test&quot; in the KS so it actually resembles a real-world app, and scroll it up and down a few times.  It doesn&#39;t even work properly in the simulator.</p>
<p>The same thing happens with those other functions you claim are &#39;supported&#39;.</p>
<p>If you read these forums you will see this sort of thing has been complained about many times.  It (i.e. basic functionality) has been assigned a &#39;low priority&#39;.</p>
<p>regards,<br>JH</p>

										<p><p>Then don&#39;t use Titanium. It works for me and thousands of others. This forum has 1 - 2,000 users. There are 1.5 million Titanium developers, 6,000+ apps out there that serve over 20 million app buyers. If a couple hundred people in the Q&amp;A Forums are having problems with a function that I myself have even used multiple times in Apps on the iTunes App Store and Android Marketplace, I don&#39;t think that is a very high priority for Appcelerator when there are much more pressing matters, such as high-end bug fixes and features that must be added for more users and higher revenue.</p>
<p>There are other open source projects out there like Titanium. If Titanium doesn&#39;t work for you, go ahead and try the others out. But I am 100% certain none will be as easy as Titanium. There is a reason Titanium is <em>free</em>. If you don&#39;t like it, there is nothing stopping you from leaving.</p>

										<p><p>Also: allowsSelection:true is a nullified property. The default for allowsSelection <em>is already true</em>. The only difference you would see is if you set it to allowsSelection:false, which would disallow all selecting of any rows in your TableView.</p>

							<p>&lt;sigh&gt; I shall ignore the reflex aggression, although it is true that NimbleKit is coming along nicely and might even be worth paying for.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know what the technobabble &#39;nullified property&#39; means, but what you say is so obviously rubbish that it calls your competence into question.  Why pray do you think there is a separate test for it in the KS?  I notice that you do not mention whether or not you did in fact carry out the simple test I suggested, and got a different result.</p>
<p>Will you please direct me and other readers of this forum to the &#39;multiple apps&#39; you have on the App Store in which allowsSelection:true is working properly with more than 25 or 30 table view rows?</p>
<p>After that, perhaps you could then suggest why the same test does not work properly in the Kitchen Sink?</p>
<p>regards,<br>JH</p>

										<p><p>Tell me what you want to do with &quot;allowsSelection:true&quot;. What it is supposed to do is allow people to select a row from the TableView, which is default. If you set it to &quot;allowsSelection:false&quot;, you will <em>NOT</em> be able to select a row from the TableView.</p>

										<p><p>A simple test would, and does, show that the default state of a table view is not allowSelection:true. At the risk of repeating myself, that is why there is a separate test for it in the Kitchen Sink. </p>
<p>The purpose of allowsSelection:true is to keep a table view row in the selected (blue) state.  Pity it does not work properly in the real world.</p>
<p>Unless of course those apps of yours have found a way around the all-pervading Titanium bugs?</p>
