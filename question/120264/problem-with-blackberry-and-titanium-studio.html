							<p>Jorge, I ran into the same problem, you have to download the entire 450MB Blackberry plugin with eclipse.  Then from that version of Eclipse you can download the 5.0 BB SDK.  That should fix your problem. </p>

										<p><p>Hello Karl</p>
<p>Thanks for your fast answer. But after installing a new Eclipse with Blackberry correctly, I still have the same problem in Titanium Studio (the other Eclipse). Probably I didn&#39;t understand you. I see two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Eclipse with Blackberry install Titanium Studio as a plugin (couldn&#39;t do it)</li>
<li>In Titanium Studio somehow point to the Blackberry SDK (I don&#39;t know where is it)</li>
</ol>
<p>Regards, Jorge</p>

										<p><p>Jorge, you might want to go back through the instructions that Appcelerator posted and just double check each step.  You will need to go into the Blackberry Eclipse IDE and go through the update to download the 5.0.0.25 component pack.  Once that is done point Titanium Developer to the installation directory where Blackberry Eclipse is installed(should be c:\eclipse).  You should be able to build the kitchen sink from there.  I have not been able to create any new apps, they build but do not run on the emulator or the device.  I have another QA question open on that one I am hoping to get some help from.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Karl, I installed the BB Java SDK 5.0.0.25 in Eclipse and pointed to it Titanum Studio (not Developer), but same problem… I&#39;ll double check everything, but I have not many hopes. Thanks again.</p>

										<p><p>Same issue for me as well.  It&#39;s frustrating that we don&#39;t see anyone from Appcelerator comment on this.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve got both the 5.0.0.25 and 6.0.0.30 SDKs installed in the c:\eclipse setup yet Titanium won&#39;t recognize them.</p>
<p>Can anyone offer suggestions?</p>

										<p><p>Tried getting blackberry up and running with my Indie package on Titanium Developer along with Titanium Studio. Still no luck. Although I do think I am one step closer since finding the bb mobile sdk, which is not included in the new Studio or Developer downloads.</p>
<p>Look for mobilesdk-bb-1.6.0-win32.zip in the helpdesk and the blackberry version of mobilesdk_bb-1.7.0.RC1-win32.zip.</p>

							<p>I was finally able to work this out by downloading the backdated 1.7.0-RC2 version of the Titanium API.  The problem was that the newer versions of the Titanium API don&#39;t have the blackberry dir under the titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;win32&#x2F;$TITANIUM_VERSION   If that dir (titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;win32&#x2F;$TITANIUM_VERSION&#x2F;blackberry) isn&#39;t there Titanium Studio won&#39;t find the blackberry SDK. </p>
