			<h1>Downloading Sqlite Database vs. Http REST API Calls</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Interested in what is best practice and why. I control my own API. I want to download data one of two ways for local consumption on mobile phones (both iPhone &amp; Android). </p>
<p>I have tested both solutions. </p>
<p>1) Make RESTful API calls and insert &#x2F; update the data into a local sqlite database. This option works great but takes some time. Often I have more than one http request to make. Sqlite INSERTS are sort of slow. Not to mention the extra time of parsing the json that was returned.</p>
<p>2) Download a complete Sqlite database that was generated at the webserver. Install this database locally on the phone. When I need to refresh the data download the database again and replace the older database. Seems this is pretty fast as there is no parsing or INSERTing once the data as arrived.</p>
<p>I ask the question because downloading the database gives me much better results. However I do not see any other app developers doing this. Since no one else is doing this it seems there might be a hidden reason not to do this that I am not seeing. </p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>
<p>Thanks.<br>~Spicer</p>

							<div><p>This is how I have solved this. I am getting great results. Most of my data needs are over 10,000 rows spread across 10 tables. When I start an app for the first time I make a call to the webserver to dynamically build a sqlite database. We build it at the server and download it to the app. This is really really fast. </p>
<p>Then we have what I call a &quot;since&quot; call. We make this api call every so often. We send a restful API request to the server with a timestamp. This is going to return a json blob of everything that has changes since that timestamp. We then take that json data (using transactions) and update the local sqlite database.</p>
<p>We try to avoid making tons of sqlite inserts at any one time. We try to avoid too many http requests to the server. Focusing on both these really makes for a fast data driven app.</p>

							<p>If your inserts are slow try using transaction. It speeds up!</p>

										<p><p>Yep. Doing this. If you have something like 10,000 rows it still takes time. My answer above as to how I am solving this. Thanks for the reply.</p>

							<p>If you have some data at app install then deliver it with your app as a resource. All further updates piece by piece. If your changes are that big you could zip the json and unzip @ Client. It depends on the data size difference but downloading the whole database will slow your app as the data grows vs. single updates.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the comment. It is not data I can ship in the app. It is dynamic data for sure. The reason a complete download of the database is so nice is there is a big amount of data even on &quot;refreshes&quot;. The bottle neck seems to be the inserts into sqlite as inserts seem to be expensive.</p>
