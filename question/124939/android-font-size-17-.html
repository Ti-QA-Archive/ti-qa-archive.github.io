			<h1>Android Font Size (1.7 +)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am in the middle of porting an iPhone App to Android, and I am trying to follow the new guidelines for 1.7. I specified every size value as &quot;dps&quot;, and for the most part this has worked great. However, on high density devices, the font size is really small. I have even tried testing for high density and manually setting the font size, but this doesn&#39;t seem to fix the problem. What am I doing wrong?</p>

							<div><p>If you can provide a non-working sample, we can take a look at that.</p>
<p>Also, you may just want to not support multiple densities based on what you&#39;re telling me - check out my blog post about densities in 1.7 for more info on how to set that up in your android manifest.</p>

							<div><p>I would love to not support multiple densities, but when I add that to my android manifest, the sizing and placement of ALL of the UI elements are way off. Some views have 50+, and it would be a nightmare to set them all up again. If the placement was consistent across the two platforms, then I could avoid this all together.</p>

							<div><p>As an update, I just bit the bullet and removed multiple density support, but the font is still very small on my Nexus S. everything else is positioned correctly now - I think this is probably a bug…</p>

							<div><p>Ok - I have tracked down the issue, and it has nothing to do with dips or densities. If a textField height is too small (less than 25, on any density&#x2F;resolution). One of two things might happen. </p>
<ol>
<li>The text is shrunk to about 4 pixels, and center aligned. </li>
<li>The text is top aligned and above the text area (so it appears invisible).</li>
</ol>
<p>I assume this is a bug, but it is strange that I seem to be the only one that has run into it.</p>
