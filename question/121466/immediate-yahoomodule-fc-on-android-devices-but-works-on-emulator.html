		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello community:</p>
<p>For the last few days (I&#39;m currently at SDK 1.7.1 and 1.0.1 of Studio), I&#39;m having problems running Titanium applications on a device. They work fine on emulator.</p>
<p>This is true for Kitchen Sink or a default project (like the Geolocation project or even the &#39;I am Window 1&#39; project). Sometimes a brand new project will work (sometimes it will crash) but then if I change even one line it will crash.</p>
<p>Crashes immediately upon startup trying to create the initial activity with a NullPointer exception. I don&#39;t know much about Ti internals, but it seems (from the stack trace) that the application is dying while trying to bind to a YahooModule.</p>
<p>Yes, I&#39;ve tried deleting everything in my build directories. I&#39;ve even deleted and reinstalled Ti studio. I upgraded to Ti Indie. I tried multiple physical devices. I was not having this problem until very recent versions of Studio and SDK.</p>
<p>A representative ddms log is at http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;2109661</p>
<p>Any ideas? I&#39;m completely stuck and need to demo on a device tomorrow.</p>
<p>TIA</p>

							<p>I had exactly the same problem today, but when I did a full rebuild the problem went away.</p>
<p>You can force a full rebuild by running the following command in your terminal:</p>
<p>touch tiapp.xml</p>
<p>HTH</p>

							<p>Were you able to figure it out? I&#39;m running into the same issue, works perfectly on the simulator but gives the YahooModule error on the device.</p>
