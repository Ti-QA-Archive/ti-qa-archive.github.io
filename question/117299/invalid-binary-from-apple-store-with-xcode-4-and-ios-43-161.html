			<h1>Invalid binary from Apple Store with xcode 4 and iOS 4.3, 1.6.1</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I updated to xcode 4 and iOS 4.3 after I got the email from Appcelerator.<br>I happened to have a new release of my app.<br>I was able to build, package and upload it without any issues, until apple store showed &quot;Invalid Binary&quot; to me after a minute.</p>
<p>I think Appcelerator only tested their new release 1.6.1 up to package the code, they didn&#39;t really test the release with apple store.</p>
<p>So, I am screwed, now trying to roll back to xcode 3.2.6 with iOS 4.3 to give it a shot.</p>

							<p>just to follow up. I deleted all the certificates in keychain and revoked both dev and distribution certificate in apple store, then recreated everything, then  repackage it, it si fine now, it has not been rejected as invalid binary yet. </p>
<p>It is a very strange thing though, I have been using Titanium to release last 5 versions of my two apps, never encountered such thing. still don&#39;t know what could cause that. </p>
<p>most likely, it is not titanium&#39;s fault. I think you all can update to xcode 4 and iOS 4.3,  I guess I was the first one who did the release with this combination. </p>
