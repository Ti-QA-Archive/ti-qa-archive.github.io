			<h1>Blackberry Database Performance</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello, let me start by saying I realize the blackberry - titanium sdk is in a &#39;preview&#39; state and all that.</p>
<p>That said, I am having terrible performance with the database on the blackberry.  Not on the simulators but on the device itself. I have a Curve 8530, and after doing a number of different variations and tests, I&#39;m averaging about 2700ms per query on device, which when you need to update or insert a couple hundred rows is a real problem.  The device is clearly slower than the simulator with everything, but not by a factor of 100 like with the database calls.</p>
<p>Has anyone else had that experience?  I&#39;ve written database apps for iOS and android using Titanium, so I&#39;m confident I&#39;m not doing anything bizarre with the code.  It may be just that Titanium&#39;s database functions for BB are slow at this point, but I wanted to check with everyone else.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>I have an app in the wild using the BETA BB SDK and yes I have noticed it is slow. I have not had the luxury of benchmarking it… but I could tell it is slow.</p>
<p>I was going to write a small native test app to see if it was the API or just the device before I opened a ticket</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for responding. Nice to know it&#39;s not just my problem. For the record, I was able to do my on device debugging (benchmarking) via the Blackberry JDE debugger.</p>
<p>Just connect the device via USB, make sure the settings on device allow everything that needs to be allowed, open the JDE, go to debug -&gt; attach to device.  It can be touchy, sometimes you need to unplug and replug the device, and its looking for a bunch of files it can&#39;t find (you can show it where the titanium files you want are though), but it does work.</p>

										<p><p>you are my new HERO!!!</p>
<p>my team has no BB experience and we have been wondering how to integrate debugging into our process and I think your approach can help.</p>
<p>do you mind if I take this offline to get specifics on how to device debug using OSX? aaron@clearlyinnovative.com</p>

										<p><p>sure thing.  To clarify, in case someone comes behind us, I was not able to do on device debugging via OSX directly.  It has to be done on a windows platform (I use parallels desktop on a mac).</p>
