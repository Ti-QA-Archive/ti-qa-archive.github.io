			<h1>Manage multiple windows on iPhone without NavigationGroup</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;m attempting to create a full screen application that will use entirely custom UI components.  I&#39;ve created a navigation which that loads each page in this application from a separate .js file.   This navigation itself is included on each page from its own .js file. </p>
<p>There&#39;s going to be a lot of multimedia content on each page so I need to reclaim memory by closing the active page once the new page has loaded.  Going through the Q&amp;A archives it seems that a common problem for iphone is that when you use the window.close() method it closes all windows leaving you with a blank screen, not just the one you&#39;ve targeted.   </p>
<p>So my code below which is the click event on a custom image button:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> currWin = Ti.UI.currentWindow;

secondButton.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">"click"</span>, function()    {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (currWin.title != <span class="hljs-string">"second"</span>)    {                                           
        Ti.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">"button 2"</span>);
        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">win</span> = Ti.UI.createWindow({url:<span class="hljs-string">"second.js"</span>, title: <span class="hljs-string">"second"</span>, parentWindow: currWin}); 
        <span class="hljs-keyword">win</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>();
        currWin.<span class="hljs-keyword">close</span>();
    } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
        Ti.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">"second window already open"</span>);    
    }    
});
</code></pre><p>First checks to see if the current window is the one associated with the button, and if not, it opens the new window and closes the current window.   I&#39;ve been careful to not refer to the new window.  </p>
<p>There have been a number of suggestions:</p>
<p>1) Use a setTimeout() to delay the close of the window </p>
<p>Doesn&#39;t work, just pauses and then closes all windows.  </p>
<p>2) Use a NavigationGroup</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t a hierarchical navigation and it needs to be 100% custom UI.</p>
<p>3) Pass a pointer of the current window (which I&#39;m doing using the parentWindow property on the createWindow() method) and use the pointer to close the window within the new window.</p>
<p>Same effect, the window.close() method closes both windows.  </p>
<p>This is really frustrating me and there doesn&#39;t seem to be a resolution listed anywhere in the Q&amp;A archives.  Is the NavigationGroup the only method to handle multiple windows for iphone? </p>
<p>This code works just fine on Android but its for an iPad so I need it to work on iOS.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<div><p>Hi Joshua,<br>Seems like we are building apps with similar need - and I&#39;m struggling with window management as well.  Would be great if you could let me know if you have or eventually do come up with something helpful.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll post any progress I make here as well.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>where is this know issue documented? First I have heard of it…</p>
<p>Going through the Q&amp;A archives it seems that a common problem for iphone is that when you use the window.close() method it closes all windows leaving you with a blank screen, not just the one you&#39;ve targeted.</p>
<p>Also if you use a transition, you can avoid some of the &quot;blank&quot; window problems that I think you might be referring to.</p>
<p>Overall, coming up with a completely different UI experience is tricky, since most users of apple products have an expectation of how the UI should perform, this isn&#39;t Android where pretty much anything goes… </p>
<p>And finally, the small amount of code makes it difficult to really understand what your overall approach is for managing your windows, could you provide a little more code in pastie.org?</p>
