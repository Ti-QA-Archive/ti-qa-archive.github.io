		<section>
			<p>I just made a new application on titanium. Before I edit it at all, when I load it to the iPhone emulator, I get the message &quot;Build failed. Please see output for details.&quot; I&#39;ve uninstalled and re-installed Titanium, deleted and re-made the app, and downloaded a patch that was supposed to fix this. However, the message still shows when I launch the app. Ideas? I have no clue what to do about this.</p>
<p>Ok, so I tried the things recommended in the first two comments and now it is saying there is an error and it is failing to build the app because the app is missing… so i located the file that TD was &quot;missing&quot; under my project folder then build&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;build&#x2F;Debug-iphonesimulator…and when i click on the file, it says it is damaged. I have no clue what is going on with this. </p>

							<p>Titanium is a code generator that uses the build capability of the native SDK, whether iPhone or Android.  Since you are launching an iPhone build, check that the desired iPhone SDK is listed to the left of your Launch &#x2F; Stop buttons.  </p>
<p>I got a &quot;Build Failed&quot; message when I tried to build an iPhone 4 app with Titanium but hadn&#39;t yet upgraded XCode to the Xcode version containing the iPhone SDK 4 called &quot;Snow Leopard Downloads:Xcode 3.2.3 and iPhone SDK 4.&quot;  I downloaded and installed this newer XCode, re-opened Titanium, selected &quot;4.0&quot; from the SDK drop-down, and then successfully built my iPhone 4 app.</p>

							<p>I was in a similar boat for a while. I was getting a build failure after upgrading my Xcode and iPhone SDK. Previous projects that I had been working on would no longer run.  After doing the same TD uninstall&#x2F;reinstall and developer patch from the blog post, what fixed it for me was to create a new project and then copy all the resources from my previous project to the new one, essentially cloning the project but letting TD lay down a new project framework from the start.</p>
