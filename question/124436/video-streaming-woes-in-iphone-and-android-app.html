			<h1>Video streaming woes in iPhone and Android app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Please forgive me, as I am new to the Titanium Studio development software, and mobile development in general. I&#39;m sure my issue is simple, but I&#39;ve been unable to figure it out, nor have I found anything useful in the documentation to help solve it.</p>
<p>I am trying to display a live video stream within my application. I am targeting both iPhone and Android.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the link to the video stream: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;bRqcpV">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;bRqcpV</a></p>
<p>If I use either the iPhone or Android web browsers, the video displays as expected. However, if I attempt to open the link from within my app, I either receive nothing but a black screen, or, in the case of the Android app tested on my Android phone, I receive an error about unauthorized access, even though I can access it normally through the device&#39;s web browser (not through the app).</p>
<p>I also tried opening the video link from Titanium&#39;s video player that&#39;s part of the Titanium.Media API. Still no success.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any idea what the possible issue could be for the video not playing from within the app?</p>
<p>Any code examples would be great!</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Joel</p>

										<p><p>I take that back, I did pass the apple test streams to Titanium.Media.VideoPlayer and it works.</p>
<p>Ok, in your case:</p>
<p>If you request the url you showed above, it checks your browser capabilities and returns what it thinks is the best method of delivery.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, in the absence of flash, if hands you a play list via the .m3u8 file.  the session id IS relevant.  If you ask for the play list without it, it returns a playlist with a new session id in it.  That new playlist then needs reparsed. The VideoPlayer hangs as this point because it doesn&#39;t know how to pull a recursive playlist.</p>

										<p><p>Stephen - I have a dumb question (because I should really know better) - how, on my Android device, do I determine the actual video file being referenced when visiting the URL? For instance, you stated above that the .m3u8 file is passed to the iPhone. This path works great on the iPhone, by the way. However, none of the paths work on my Android device using Titanium&#39;s videoPlayer object. I can&#39;t view page source from Android&#39;s web browser, so I don&#39;t know exactly what file to reference. Do you know how it can be done?</p>

							<p>I know the focus of your post seems to be around using a webView, but the below post might help you on the option of using the videoPlayer object (see link to sample code down in the comments within the separate post)</p>
<p>Separately, what format is your video stream in?  How is the html constructed that you are trying to read from? (e.g., using the HTML 5 video tag, etc.)</p>
<p>Please share any code you can on your side as that might help explain the problem or provide you with more options.</p>

										<p><p>Brian, thanks for the quick response!</p>
<p>The video is hosted by a 3rd party, so I have no control over how it&#39;s embedded in the reference page. When I follow the link from my web browser (don&#39;t have my phone handy at the moment), this is what I see in the page source:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">&lt;object id=<span class="hljs-string">"player"</span> type=<span class="hljs-string">"application/x-shockwave-flash"</span> data=<span class="hljs-string">"osmfplayer.swf"</span> width=<span class="hljs-string">"480"</span> height=<span class="hljs-string">"320"</span>&gt;&lt;<span class="hljs-built_in">param</span> name=<span class="hljs-string">"movie"</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">value</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"osmfplayer.swf"</span>&gt;&lt;/<span class="hljs-built_in">param</span>&gt;&lt;<span class="hljs-built_in">param</span> name=<span class="hljs-string">"allowFullScreen"</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">value</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"true"</span>&gt;&lt;/<span class="hljs-built_in">param</span>&gt;&lt;<span class="hljs-built_in">param</span> name=<span class="hljs-string">"allowScriptAccess"</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">value</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"always"</span>&gt;&lt;/<span class="hljs-built_in">param</span>&gt;&lt;<span class="hljs-built_in">param</span> name=<span class="hljs-string">"flashvars"</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">value</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"isLive=true&amp;RTMP=rtmp://mobile.influxis.com/ljbcga993aviy45224_live&amp;file=hayatv_768&amp;noServerDetect=true"</span>&gt;&lt;/<span class="hljs-built_in">param</span>&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
</code></pre><p>As you can see, the video is served up from what appears to be an Adobe media server, using the RTMP protocol.</p>
<p>I suspect that the page determines the browser type and embeds the video accordingly, since the link works on the iPhone, even though the page source from my computer shows it being a Flash object. It also works from my Android phone.</p>
<p>So, do you know if it would be possible to directly access the RTMP video link from an HTML 5 video tag or the videoPlayer object?</p>

										<p><p>I did a quick test by simply altering the html5video.html file in Kitchen Sink app to point to the above url in the html line you shared and it did not work on iOS sim (I tried first by lopping everything off before &#39;rtmp:&#x2F;&#x2F;&#39; and then I tried the entire thing (not expecting that to really work either). You may want to experiment further. The other KiSink video examples use the videoPlayer object, so you can use the test app code in the other post to try that.  However, per Android&#39;s supported media formats site, I don&#39;t see RTMP listed at least and I expect the same for iOS.</p>
<p>Also, check out http:&#x2F;&#x2F;videojs.com for an option for using HTML5 videoâ¦</p>
<p>If you can&#39;t control the media formats, protocols or delivery options, than obviously your situation is constrained thoughâ¦</p>

										<p><p>Thanks again, Brian. That&#39;s the same road I started downâ¦ using the Kitchen Sink examples for testing, with no success.</p>
<p>The strange thing is, the URL works when using either iPhone&#39;s or Android&#39;s browser. But when trying to access the same link from within my Titanium mobile app, it doesn&#39;t work. Is the browser that Titanium uses different than the actual device (iPhone&#x2F;Android) web browser?</p>

										<p><p>Yes. The webkit browser used by all apps (at least in the iPhone, that I&#39;m aware of) is different to the built in Mobile Safari browser. No idea about Android. </p>

										<p><p>Brian, I was able to use the Ti.Platform.openURLâ¦. code that you posted above to open the video in the native browser. Thanks! I think this option provides a better video player. However, I was also able to get Titanium&#39;s videoPlayer object to work, with the help of suggestions from you and Stephen Feather. The issue I have with both of these methods is that once I leave the tab that the videoPlayer is launched from or that the web browser is launched from, when I go back, it doesn&#39;t re-open the videoPlayer or relaunch the web browser. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a simple fix, but I haven&#39;t figured it out.</p>
<p>Also, does anyone see an advantage of using the videoPlayer object over launching into the native web browser to use the service&#39;s video player?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

										<p><p>Regarding the videoPlayer not re-opening when you go back, w&#x2F;o having seen your code, I would look at what how you are creating the window you putting the videoplayer in, and see if you are closing the window out and re-creating it properly (if desired) before the user goes back again.  Sometimes you need to &#39;release&#39; the videoplayer as well (check the available methods on the vp api and the examples again).  To me, the advantage of the videoplayer object is that it is &#39;embedded&#39; in the app, as opposed to opening a separate browser window - so it just goes to user experience.  Also, for iOS, I would review the HIG and make sure this wouldn&#39;t cause Apple to raise any eyebrows.  (Also, thanks @Stephen for shedding some light on stuff I wasn&#39;t aware of with this dynamic stream type and it can be handled)</p>
