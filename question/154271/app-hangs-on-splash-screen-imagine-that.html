			<h1>App hangs on splash screen (Imagine that)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>My Android app runs fine when running in the debugger on my Galaxy S3.  When I package the APK and install it, it hangs at the splash screen.</p>
<p>Where can I begin to find out what&#39;s going wrong?</p>
<p>I&#39;m using:</p>

							<div><p>When I run it that way, it runs fine.  When I package it as an APK with the &quot;Titanium Android Application Installer&quot;, it also works.  If I build it with &quot;Titanium Android App Store Distribution&quot;, then load the APK, it hangs.  If I build it with….</p>
<p>Get this…. as I was going through and typing this, I was testing concurrently.  I built it with &quot;Titanium Android App Store Distribution&quot; and it failed.  I then <em>accidentally</em> built the same one again, using the same build and having not changed a single thing.  Just for grins, I installed it again, and this time it worked.</p>
<p>I&#39;m just now seeing this:</p>
<p>06-29 15:51:00.170: E&#x2F;TiApplication(11609): (KrollRuntimeThread) [206,206] APP PROXY: ti.modules.titanium.app.AppModule@426916f0<br>06-29 15:51:00.220: E&#x2F;dalvikvm(11609): Could not find class &#39;ti.modules.titanium.network.NonValidatingSSLSocketFactory&#39;, referenced from method org.appcelerator.titanium.TiVerify.run</p>
<p>I love the idea of Titanium, but it is the most frustrating platform I&#39;ve ever used.</p>

<p>Whenever the app hangs I get this exception immediately after app start:</p>

<p>Whenever the app runs successfully, I do NOT see that exception.</p>

							<div><p>I have the same issue. Just created a new project and it hangs when starting without debugger from Titanium Studio. The issue does not appear when the app is started with debugger attached. I already disabled the analytics and clear the workspace to force a rebuild. My Android device is a LG P880 with Android 4.0.3 running on it.</p>

							<div><p>+1. Same issue here using a Galaxy S3. Below are the steps that got me in this situation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up the developer options to wait for debugger to be attached</li>
<li>Debug app on device from Titanium Studio</li>
<li>App hangs on splash screen</li>
</ol>
<p>From then on I was never able to run the app again. I&#39;ve tried: turning off developer options entirely, installing the app from previous working apks, clearing app data, restarting my phone. I can&#39;t seem to make my app run again on my phone with any combination of options. Very frustrating.</p>

							<p>Hi, there is a JIRA for this issue: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-15306">TIMOB-15306</a>. It also has a workaround to have the app run again which I will try it later.</p>

<p>Connect your device with adb and start DDMS from the sdk tools. When there is an exception throwing at app start, you will see it in the logs.</p>

										<p><p>These kinds of issues are exactly the issues that have led me to recommend <em>against</em> Titanium as a viable platform for development of apps with any kind of sophistication.  I love the idea, but the time it takes to jump through the debugging hoops, especially on Android, overcome any sort of &quot;cross-platform&quot; advantage.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll keep my eye on it, but until it improves, none of my clients or my company&#39;s clients are getting Titanium apps, and that&#39;s a shame.</p>
