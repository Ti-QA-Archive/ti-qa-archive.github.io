			<h1>Updating WebKit in Titanium Desktop on Windows</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Is it possible to update WebKit in Titanium Desktop on Windows without building Titanium from source? WebKit runtimes are located in &#x2F;runtime&#x2F;win32&#x2F;[SDK_VERSION]&#x2F;, however when I replace files from WebKit Nightly Build (WebKit.dll, WebKit.resources, …), I get an error saying &quot;Couldn&#39;t load file (runtime&#x2F;win32&#x2F;…&#x2F;khost.dll): The specified module could not be found.&quot; Maybe someone successfully managed to update the WebKit in Titanium Desktop? I would be grateful for any advices how to do that.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,<br>Piotr</p>

							<p>Your questions for Titanium Desktop should be addressed to the TideSDK mailing list or posted on Stack Overflow. As you are no doubt aware, Titanium Desktop has continued as a community led initiative under TideSDK. Please review the following FAQ or visit <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tidesdk.org">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tidesdk.org</a> for details:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;142044&#x2F;tidesdk---stack-overflow-tag-created-for-q--a">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;142044&#x2F;tidesdk—stack-overflow-tag-created-for-q–a</a></p>
<p>The short answer is no.</p>
<p>This longer answer is as follows:</p>
<p>Titanium Desktop is complex software that relies not only on WebKit but has other dependencies. These dependencies are satisfied per platform. WebKit on Windows is satisfied by the wincairo port. Further to the dependencies, WebKit requires patching to work in Titanium Desktop. This is not a trivial task since WebKit itself is a fast moving project with up to one hundred commits per day. It is also a very large project and compilation is on average approximately 4 hours for results. WebKit works hand in hand with libkroll that is contained in the Kroll project. When Titanium Desktop was available in the past, Kroll was managed as a git submodule and itself is a complicated piece of software. There are other enhancements to WebKit, some of which have been made obsolete over time. The sources must be compiled, linked and tested to verify a working WebKit.</p>
<p>TideSDK is reaching 1.3.0 release this week. You can simply consume it. You can also offer time to contribute to it or donate funds to the project to ensure its long term success. TideSDK is now an &#39;Affliate Project&#39; of SPI (Software in the Public Interest), so is non profit and can receive donations to assist in funding the team, development, and promotion. There is is a team of 15 dedicated to TideSDK including skilled programmers and advisors (that include the original developers of Titanium). Hope this helps.</p>
