							<p>Hi,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For Submission you must use Distribution certificate.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When you build Using Distribute from Titanium it just opens Xcode.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now navigate to Windows -&gt; Organizer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Archives tab will show you the list of Archives that were generated during your previous builds, so choose the one with the latest Date&#x2F;time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Selecting the Latest Archive will display 3 buttons at the top(don&#39;t worry if you Don&#39;t see your App icon).</p>
</li>
<li><p>First we must validate the App.</p>
</li>
<li><p>During validation it will ask you for your Apple Developer Credentials and the bundle identifier for the App.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It will verify this against the ones that you entered on the itunes connect portal.</p>
</li>
<li><p>After Successful validation you can Either Share for Ad-hoc Distribution or Submit the App.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>

										<p><p>this answer makes certain assumptions seeing as you did not put down any details concerning your development environment such as TiStudio, xCode, OSX version, etc.</p>

										<p><p>Also odd that Xcode didn&#39;t launch and bring you to the Organizer after your project was built (i again am making assumptions that it actually completed the build)</p>

										<p><p>Not entirely sure why I got marked down, seeing as my answer is correct.  He says he has the certs, he ran the distribution packaging.</p>
<p>If it was finished it would be in the xCode organizer.  It would appear that he hasn&#39;t waited long enough for the packaging to finishing (noting the SINGLE LINE OF THE LOG he posted) or the build failed.</p>
