			<h1>Module Use App Size Question</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>There are a couple levels to this question -</p>
<p>The problem:  Upgraded to indie account to get access to the barcoding module.  Worked wonderfully.  However, when I deployed to my iOS test device, I realized that the file (.ipa i believe) that I load onto the phone went from 8MB to 35MB!</p>
<p>My questions are these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the app compress anything more when I make an official &quot;deployment&quot; of it, beyond just loading it onto a test device?</li>
<li>When I installed the module, I unzipped it.  I saw some install guides that made no mention of unzipping, and inferred that I leave it zipped.  Is this the cause of the bloat?</li>
<li>When I installed the module, none of the guides that recommended installing in the Library&#x2F;application support&#x2F;titanium folders actually worked.  I ended up creating a folder called &#39;modules&#39; in the project folder (save level as the Resources folder).  Could this be the cause of the bloat?</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope I&#39;m not a alone on this - I think a 35MB app is basically a death sentence for me.  Comments appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>PS - using TI 1.7.2, running on iOS 4+ for now.</p>

							<p>1) Are you talking about the build to device? or are you talking about the final distribute for the app store? The final distribute size will be much smaller.</p>
<p>2) Are you using PNG files for your images? these are crushed when you distribute the app, and are thus smaller.</p>
<p>Also… Have you tried placing the module in <code>~&amp;#x2F;Library&amp;#x2F;application support&amp;#x2F;titanium</code>?</p>

										<p><p>As a note, we have found that the location of the module being local can cause this issue too, we have created a bug ticket for this <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-5026">here</a>. In the mean time moving your module to <code>~&amp;#x2F;Library&amp;#x2F;application support&amp;#x2F;titanium</code> should fix this.</p>

							<p>Okay an update since I was playing around a bit more.  Previously I was loading the app in the debug folder that just had the app name and no extension.  This was 35mb. I tried loading the appname.ipa file instead, and it worked.  Brought it down to 15mb.  Much better, but still too big.  same questions apply.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>Have anybody tried, and succeeded, getting the distribution files for iPhone and Android smaller? I know there is a small javascript engine included but I don&#39;t know the size of it? Is it possible to remove unused frameworks and modules from the build? In native my ipa should be ~200-300k but Titanium gives me 12,9MB.</p>
