			<h1>Max number of line of code ?</h1>

		<section>
			<p>I just ran into a huge problem. It seems that my app reached the maximum number of lines of code on iOS simulator. It is not happening on Android.</p>
<p>My application has suddenly memory leaks, and launches exceptions randomly. When I comment some code, wherever in my app, it then works again. I tried to divide my code into sub-contexts, but it has no effect.</p>
<p>Does somebody know if there is a way to extend the capacity ?</p>

							<p>It&#39;s not possible, it&#39;s not about number of lines of code, but just the way maybe you structured your app. Do you open&#x2F;close your db after every query? have you optimized the way you refresh the data in your tables? and so on…</p>

										<p><p>The DB is opened at the start of the app only. Is there a way to know how much memory my app is using ?</p>

										<p><p>it&#39;s good practise that you open and close the db for each query. It&#39;s very strange, I&#39;m sure you tried cleaning your build folder (that solves my problems half of the time). I&#39;m sure that there&#39;s no maximum number of line set, it&#39;s just the way you structure your code. Try to put some setTimeout before the opening and closing of windows, and stuff like that.</p>

							<p>you can use <code>Ti.platform.availableMemory</code> to get available memory (this value is misleading in emulator, but lets you compare between two implementations). Appart of this, use xCode profile tools for memory leaks analysis.</p>
<p>¿is all your code in the same file or in the same scope? Do you use common JS modules or structured code as tweetanium app?</p>

										<p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I use Base.js so only my classes are in the scope. No common JS modules.<br>May be I should mention that if I run my code step by step I don&#39;t get this problem. As soon as I let it run with&#x2F;without breakpoints, some of my variables in my classes have wrong values. For example when I call a function with a parameter, this parameter has another value inside the function than before the function. This is happening randomly.</p>
<p>Strange, no ?</p>
