		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m on my way to submitting an iPad only app with SDK 1.2 (iphone SDK 3.2), there&#39;s an option that says &quot;Do you want to limit your app to only run on devices with specific capabilities?&quot; It&#39;s a yes or no option and then if yes, you have to specific that field on info.plist. </p>
<p>How did you go about this option?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>Answer to my own question, just in case some of your ran into this topic.</p>
<p>Select &quot;NO&quot; and go ahead with submission, the store will determine automatically from your binary app. In my case, after uploading the app, it says &quot;Compatible with iPad.&quot; on the application overview panel as it&#39;s built with SDK 3.2.</p>

							<p>Sorry this is irrelevant to this question Daniel but I prematurely closed the earlier discussion and I can&#39;t get your email.  I asked one of my <em>nice</em> customers if he would make sure all his contacts had last names and try again on his iPad.  He said it made no difference.  </p>
<p>I then had a head-slapping moment and tried the buggy Ti Picker in non-detail mode and I might actually have found a better solution.</p>
<p>Would you do me a huge favour and just paste this bit of contact picker code and test on your iPad?</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F; holman.id.au&#x2F;bugs&#x2F;PickerCode.zip</p>
<p>TIA,</p>

										<p><p>Hi John, just tested on ipad and it worked. I have list of 68 contacts, terribly unorganized ones, some even has both first and last name blank but it all shown up just fine. </p>
<p>One thing i noticed about 1.3, update development app the first time does nothing, it&#39;s still showing the same old code despite success. Second compilation and re-installation will only update it correctly.. odd. I&#39;m not 100% sure about it though.</p>
<p>good luck</p>
