			<h1>App Crashing Sporadically on Android</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Here&#39;s what&#39;s happening.</p>
<p>My app is crashing on Android, after opening windows several times. I currently suspect it has something to do with how Android is stacking the windows. Here&#39;s my code.</p>
<p>I create the window DOM object, which passes to a variable to open the window (because I am opening in a TabGroup on iPhone and just using <code>.open()</code> on Android)</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// Create the window we're opening</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> NewWindow = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
            title:                        <span class="hljs-keyword">e</span>.rowData.title,
            url:                            <span class="hljs-keyword">e</span>.rowData.URL,
            backButtonTitle:    'Back'
        });

        <span class="hljs-comment">// Open the window in the current tab group</span>
        OpenWindow(NewWindow);
</code></pre><p>In the <code>OpenWindow()</code> function, I add some additional properties to the Window object, for universal styling…</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">// Set <span class="hljs-keyword">some</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">window</span> properties
    WindowDOM.backgroundImage        =    <span class="hljs-string">'images/BGSalad.png'</span>;
    WindowDOM.barImage                    =    <span class="hljs-string">'images/NavBarBG.png'</span>;
    WindowDOM.barColor                    =    <span class="hljs-string">'#a7c5cf'</span>;
    WindowDOM.backButtonTitle        =    <span class="hljs-string">'Back'</span>;
</code></pre><p>Then, I open the window, using <code>.open()</code> with the <code>fullscreen</code> parameter set to <code>false</code> making it a lightweight window.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">WindowDOM</span><span class="hljs-class">.open</span>(<span class="hljs-rules">{
            <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">fullscreen</span>:<span class="hljs-value"> false
        </span></span></span>});
</code></pre><p>All windows appear to open properly several times, but then crash the app with an unexpected error.</p>

							<p>Hi Alex:<br>It is not completely clear to me as you are not posting the full code.<br>If I&#39;m not mistaken, the Titanium Android SDK is supposed to release the memory of the open windows as you close them. </p>
<p>That is definitely what happens in IOS, and the Tabgroup object manages the memory of the windows as you open, close them and navigate them.</p>
<p>By having a more complete overview of your code, we could see if you are leaving some object references in the windows which then prevent garbage collection.</p>
<p>A way to test if the window objects are not released is if you set an eventlistener in them. When you fire an event, you&#39;ll get more than one eventlisteners to react if the windo objects are still active…</p>

										<p><p>Actually a good way to check for window status is to use the debugger. </p>
<p>Regarding my comment of using event listeners, it was just a thought, but actually there is no way to trigger ui events on windows which have no focus. synthetic events wouldn&#39;t work either because they are not bound to a UI object but to an app instance.</p>
<p>Without the debugger, you could add an event listener to the window on event &#39;close&#39;, and see if it is triggered.</p>

							<p>As it turns out, my issue is not with opening and closing windows. My app is leaking memory and I can&#39;t figure out why. I added an event listener to the window close event and confirmed that every window was closing properly.</p>
<p>My tables are all simple (just titles and hasChild set to true), but I am using a 256Kb-ish PNG for a background image, which I wouldn&#39;t think was causing a problem.</p>

										<p><p>I had a large PNG for a background image and it totally killed my app on android. I switched to using it as a compiled resource by placing it in platform&#x2F;android&#x2F;res&#x2F;drawable and using android native theming&#x2F;styles to use it as a background and it worked a charm. Maybe try that?</p>
