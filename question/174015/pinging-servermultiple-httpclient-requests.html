							<p>Well if you insist to do it this way, try to create a redundant function that has a httpclient in it.<br>And in the onload&#x2F;onerror event set a timeout of 5 seconds that will call again the function but ONLY AFTER all it had to do it&#39;s finished (update UI, write in db, etc).</p>
<p>This way you will not risk to have multiple clients started - like using setInterval - and also you will allow the UI part to execute.</p>
<p>If you have access to the server, send a timestamp param, and if there is no new data then send back an empty reply. This will keep things a little smoother.</p>
<p>As you said, this is not the way. The best way is to use push notifications, this is what they are for or sockets.</p>

										<p><p>Well, all depends  on where you need it.<br>Assuming you are saving that data in a db or something, app.js is the place to do, and then you build the UI in other windows based on the saved data.</p>
<p>About the example, this is what I&#39;m thinking of (pseudocode)</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">doSomethingWithData</span><span class="hljs-params">(data)</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-comment">// save data to db</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// do stuff with data in UI</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// anything else we need to do with the data</span>

    <span class="hljs-comment">// make coffee</span>

    setTimeout(getData,<span class="hljs-number">5000</span>);  <span class="hljs-comment">// we start a new cycle in 5 seconds</span>

}


<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">getData</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
    httpclient({
        onLoad: doSomethingWithData(<span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.responseText),
        onError: doSomethingWithData(<span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.responseText)
    )
}


getData(); <span class="hljs-comment">//  first call</span>
</code></pre></p>

							<p>You really want to do that on a separate thread. Did you look at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;117199&#x2F;how-to-create-multithreading-in-mobile-sdk#answer-257976">this</a> post about using WebWorkers ?</p>

										<p><p>well what i want is that app checks if there is a message for client on the server, and since i am very new with this, i am not surehow to do it.</p>

										<p><p>You are right to think that checking a network resource every few seconds is likely to block your UI as javascript is single threaded. It would also be a fairly battery intensive operation which isn&#39;t great for the device user either.  Can you elaborate what kind of messaging you need ?</p>

										<p><p>well other user will send some data for this user, and i want app to check on server kind of &#39;Do you got something for me?&#39;<br>I know i would usually do this with socket but this is kind of irrelevant part and i just want to do it simple as possible and continue my work…<br>any advice?</p>

										<p><p>Ok, you may do better with a Push Notification model where you manage the notifications on your server and send them to the device user. It&#39;s not a &#39;simple&#39; answer though.</p>

										<p><p>i know that is better, but first currently i cannot configure server side but was thinking about doing that in later.<br>To be honest i have a presentation on Monday and til then i would just like it to work.<br>Is that managable like this, that client &#39;asks&#39; server all the time, like every few seconds?</p>
