			<h1>What is the default HTTPClient timeout?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am seeing some timeouts that when our app is posting to the server, and an increase in the timeout seems to be  required… but from what?  </p>
<p>I am thinking of changing our HTTP client creation to:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var xhr = Titanium.Network.createHTTPClient({timeout : ?????})<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
xhr.validatesSecureCertificate = app.config.checkSSLcertificates<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
return xhr<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>but I want to know what the default value of the timeout is… the Appcelerator docs do not appear to mention it, and I assume it is OS specific.</p>
<p>Any pointers appreciated!</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The timeouts will be OS specific, but I would not worry what the defaults - simply set your own.</p>
<p>As you noted - it is very simple;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var xhr = Titanium.Network.createHTTPClient({
    timeout: <span class="hljs-number">1000</span> * <span class="hljs-number">60</span> <span class="hljs-comment">// for 60 seconds</span>
});
</code></pre>

										<p><p>Thanks, Malcolm!  That&#39;s the problem: I&#39;m not sure what to set?  60 seconds seems too long…  I&#39;m aiming to double the timeout from what it is now.</p>

										<p><p>As you do not know what it is right now - doubling that is just going to make it twice another number.</p>
<p>What you need to do is work out what is likely to be the longest timeout required.  In most cases the timeout will never be reached - so setting 60 seconds is not a problem as most of your data throughput could occur in less than 2 seconds.</p>
<p>So the upper limit is to taker into account when things go wrong - for example server is busy with many connection, the data requested it large, the bandwidth is low or your processing is time expensive.</p>
<p>So the upper limit should be the point at which you feel the user should no longer need to wait beyond and your error handling for that scenarios take over at that point.</p>
<p>So to get the right balance you should spend some time perform stress tests on the process.</p>
<p>You can hope it will take X seconds, but a good app will work out the standard cases and manage the timeout for those with a extra amount for tolerance.  Then manage failures correctly, for example a low timeout and auto retries in the background might be best for your app.  You may however prefer a longer timeout and aim to catch all issues within that time.</p>
<p>It really depends on what sort of communication is being performed.  Short Text, XML or JSON data can have very low timeouts.  Uploading large images should have bigger ones.</p>
