			<p>Dear Fellow Developers</p>
<p>Titanium 3x ; Android ; Mobile ; NFC ; Camera ; GPS</p>
<p>I&#39;m working on an App for Mountain Bike Orienteering … and I need to record accurate time and place at the moment a BLE Beacon, NFC tag or maybe barcode is scanned. I have already established and tested Bar Code and NFC [soon Beacon] … this part of the tech I&#39;m familiar with.</p>
<p>However using the Device time is not good enough as this can be set by the user. I need to use something more universal and accurate to nearest second. I was thinking of GPS time signal … i.e. devices with GPS will record the same time in a given location. How is this possible in Titanium?</p>

							<p>For any non-rooted carrier-connected device, the device&#39;s time will be synced to the carrier&#39;s signal clock automatically. Few users would be savvy enough to override that. And most devices would drift from that clock only fractions of a second per day if out of signal range.</p>
<p>I&#39;m pretty sure that the GPS time is returned in the payload of a <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Geolocation-event-location">Geolocation location event</a> but you&#39;ll have to check</p>
<p>If you expect 3G&#x2F;4G connectivity in the field, you could do a query to a server-side script that queries the NTP time servers. Depending on how accurate you need the result to be, you will have to make some calculations to account for transmission time and server delays, but that would probably be on the order of fractions of a second.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Tim. Ive checked 3 Samsung devices running 3 different mobile networks. They varied a max of 5 secs. This should be acceptable. Re GPS I&#39;ve not found any reference yet of how to &quot;get&quot; the GPS time from the payload … shall research more today. Yes I shall need 3G&#x2F;4G connectivity anyway … I&#39;d like to write participant info and time to a webserver in addition to keeping race data on the device … using server side date&#x2F;time stamp could be an elegant solution.</p>
