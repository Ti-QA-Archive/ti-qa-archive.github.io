			<h1>Android - will there be native async processing available in appcelerator?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p><em>Android SDK 2.2, Ti SDK 2.0.</em></p>
<p>Seems that there is no nice and simple way to run javascript code asynchronously in appcelerator which is a big problem if it comes to data processing. Consider this simple code for performance testing:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// run iteration thousands of times to see how the app is responding</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> fn_test = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>)</span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> i = <span class="hljs-number">100000</span>;
    <span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> (i--) {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> data = <span class="hljs-string">'Sample data read from a file'</span>;
        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> hash = Ti.Utils.sha256(Ti.Utils.base64encode(<span class="hljs-built_in">JSON</span>.stringify(data)+<span class="hljs-built_in">JSON</span>.stringify(data)+<span class="hljs-built_in">JSON</span>.stringify(data)+<span class="hljs-built_in">JSON</span>.stringify(data)));
        Ti.App.Properties.setString(<span class="hljs-string">'SF_Temp01Async'</span>, hash);
        <span class="hljs-comment">// imagine you have to resize 500 images here or do any other data processing</span>
    }
};
</code></pre><p>Calling this directly is a nonsense as it blocks the javascript thread completely until the function finishes execution so there is no chance to respond to button clicks, etc. I tried several other workarounds:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>setTimeout(fn_test, 1);</code> - not really helped, once the func starts executing the JS thread is blocked again.</li>
<li><code>Ti.Android.startService(...);</code> - I initially thought that running the code in separate service context will help me resolve this issue. I was terribly wrong. The fn_test was executed in the main JS context anyway so it was blocking the entire app again. Got nowhere only wasted few days. This also raises question what good are services for, since they&#39;re blocking the main JS thread anyway.</li>
<li><code>createWindow</code> - same as above, main JS thread is being blocked.</li>
<li><code>HTTPClient</code> - runs in its own thread, but onload is called on main JS thread, thus blocked so no solution here either.</li>
</ul>
<p>This leads me to a conclusion that there is no real asynchronous processing. The only way I see so far is writing native module utilising <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;reference&#x2F;java&#x2F;lang&#x2F;Thread.html">threading</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a plan to support asynchronous javascript execution i.e. by using WebWorkers or similar approach anytime soon? Or does anybody know of a solution that works?</strong></p>

							<p>An ugly hacky way of getting this to work is to start the process off in its own context.  In other words open a window using the <code>url</code>  property and it will execute on its own thread.  I dont know if this is an &quot;approved&quot; technique but it works for me :-)</p>

										<p><p>There is no true asynchronous support in Titanium I am afraid. Even using any framework, this doesnt help. The functions are executed in one main single threaded JS context so there isn&#39;t really anu solution to this unless going native &#x2F; writing native modules. I think this is something the Titanium team needs to consider if they want to keep their consumer base. I&#39;ve already leaned over to JAVA &#x2F; Objective-C and getting much better results if it comes to final APK&#x2F;IPA size and the app performance. Appcelerator is starting to be secondary now only to maintain existing products.</p>

										<p><p>I agree to you. There are a number of serious issues with Titanium. It is not abstracted properly. On one platform I have an API return true and false and on the other it returns a number. Also, using table views in you app crashes randomly. There are huge memory leak problems. Now we are finally scrapping titanium and have already started building natively on Android and iOS. The investment is less developing natively over titanium.</p>
