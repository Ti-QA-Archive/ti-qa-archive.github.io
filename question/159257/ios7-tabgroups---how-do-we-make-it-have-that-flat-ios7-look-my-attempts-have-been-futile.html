		<section>
			<p>iOS7 has that flat theme look and even in the guidelines it instructs you that is the way to go to keep the feel consistent. How can i achieve this? Is a custom TabGroup the only way? Is it possible with just the TabGroup properties?</p>

							<div><p><code>latest xCode</code> is not a legitimate answer within the context of these forums to &#39;what version are you running&#39;.</p>
<p>A day from now, the version you are having a problem with may not BE the latest version, and the answer may not be relevant. Please be respectful of those, such as Muhammad, who are here, assisting you for FREE and actually take the effort to supply the pertinent information.</p>
<p>Missing from your question are a number of important pieces of information.

							<p>Ok I have fixed the problem. Although I updated Xcode to the latest version. I had to actually open up Xcode and accept the license and go through that initial process. After doing that, I closed titanium and opened it back. Now I see that flat awesome look and everything is great. Don&#39;t know why any of this is not mentioned anywhere when upgrading. </p>
<p>Anyways back to developing for me!</p>

										<p><p>You are correct this is somewhat annoying, once you have hit this once or twice before you remember the next time - but it should be more obvious.</p>
<p>Shame you cannot mark your own answer as accepted so other can find this information.</p>

										<p><p>Yes shame and I got down voted. Real neat! Thanks for the reinforcement Malcom. I will surely remember now, but if I had known, that could have saved me 2 or 3 hours at work :(.</p>
