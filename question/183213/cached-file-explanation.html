			<p>I had an issue today that took me about 5 hours to fix but I still don&#39;t understand why it was a problem.  Perhaps someone can explain this to me.</p>
<p>I have a function that downloads HTML and image files from a webserver for local storage.  It works perfectly fine and has for years.  Today I updated one of the HTML files on the webserver but when my function downloaded the files they were not the updated versions.  I verified the files in the browser and at the command line with &quot;curl [download url]&quot; and the files were correct.  This was ONLY affecting existing files so I thought it was a caching issue.  If I RENAMED the file on the webserver it would download properly but if I set the name back to the original name it would again result in the old version.  This was happening even if I DELETED the file in the Ti.filesystem.applicationDataDirectory folder, that was to be replaced.  I restarted the webserver which didnt help. </p>
<p> Finally, I deleted the Ti.filesystem.applicationDataDirectory folder entirely and relaunched the app, which fixed the issue.  So it appears that there was something somewhere in the simulator or appcelerator that was replacing&#x2F;overriding my new copy of this file with a cached copy.  It works perfectly now that I deleted Ti.filesystem.applicationDataDirectory and a new folder was created at the next build.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>David</p>
