			<h1>Setting Alarm and executing app through a view</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m in search of some specific informations.<br>Most of alarm questions i&#39;ve found are 1+ year old.</p>
<p>I&#39;m creating a calendar which contains events that must have alarms to notify the user. I might need to open some screen views when the alarm triggers.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t want to use the native OS calendar but I might consider to use it ONLY to set alarms if that&#39;s the only option I have.</p>
<p>1- First I would like to know if with the current Titanium sdk is possible to set an alarm in Android OS (and eventually IOS), so that I won&#39;t need to have my app running in the background.</p>
<p>2-  I saw some people talking about using a service but I&#39;m not sure on how that works… Is it possible to keep the service running after restarting the phone? </p>
<p>3- Assuming I&#39;m able to set the alarm, is it possible to trigger an event to open a specific view in titanium app? Can I do this if I choose to use a Service?</p>
<p>4- What if I use outside (via webservice) notifications will I be able to make these to open a specific view in my titanium app?</p>
<p>Excuse my english :)<br>Thank you in advance</p>

							<div><p>I was able to execute the app by notification, and put the notification with vibration… but the sound is not working. Another question came to my mind.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been defining an var activity = Ti.Android.currentActivity;  creating an intent and a pending intent in order to end up with a notification… </p>
<p>but what if i want to use an activity from other app. with what am I suppose to fill this parameter?</p>
