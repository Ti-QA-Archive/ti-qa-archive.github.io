			<p>Hmmm… was waiting today for all the new software to hit, I see now that iOS 4.0 is available for public download….  went into my Apple Dev account and still see the &quot;GM Seed&quot; from June 7th is the latest download</p>
<p>Interestingly, Engadget notes that the build number for what was released today is the same as the seed</p>
<p>&quot;Interestingly, the build is 8A293 – the exact same that was released to developers before as a GM seed – so Apple apparently found no showstoppers pressing enough to necessitate a new build before pushing it to the public at large&quot;</p>
<p>Just thought I would share that in case there are others like me waiting to upgrade the SDK</p>

							<p>there&#39;s also a bug where group-style tableviews are not rendered as such, however this doesn&#39;t happen evertime<br>my searchbar and index also dissappeared from the tableview</p>
<p>i guess appcelerator is working on it at the moment, and despite those bugs everything seems to work so far</p>

							<p>I figured that iOS4 compatibility means iPhone 4 SDK compatibility. Certainly you won&#39;t be able to run the project in the Simulator unless you do upgrade. Since this version of Ti Mobile supports things like iAds it&#39;s gotta be compatible with a v4 SDK for that to work.</p>
<p>Simple apps work OK in the iOS4 sim, but there are sporadic issues regarding XHR requests - I&#39;d be surprised if these relate to v4 of the SDK, but you never know.</p>
<p>cheers,<br>Chris.</p>

							<p>I had the tableviews issue also, this new version works fine, no random lines. But now we have to resubmit it to apple. </p>
<p>Also, the GM seed u downloaded is the same one apple launched as the final version, if you go to your itunes, and hit update phone software, they&#39;re both the same build numbers, they didn&#39;t do a new build for the release.</p>
