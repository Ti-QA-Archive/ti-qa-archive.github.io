			<h1>Swipe event and orientation - inconsistent?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I have a swipe event listener on a window that contains some small header elements (views) and then a webview, which takes up the majority of the window.  This is an article viewer application, and a swipe left or right displays the next or previous article.  There are actually two instances of this window, so that I can use the CURL_UP and CURL_DOWN transitions while alternating which window is opened.  </p>
<p>After struggling to get the webview scrolling behavior the same regardless of orientation - the solution to which was destroying and recreating the webview each time the swipe occurs OR the orientation changes - I have everything looking correct.  However, the swipe does not occur on the webview in landscape… swiping on the header elements fires the swipe event, but swiping on the webview does not.</p>
<p>Has anyone run into this behavior, and if so, solved it somehow?  I&#39;m happy to include some code, but I&#39;m not sure what would be relevant and&#x2F;or helpful.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Liam</p>

							<p>I am seeing this exact same behavior right now. I have multiple webviews nestled in a scrollableview, and the idea is to swipe right or left to move to next and previous views. This all works great until I try it in landscape orientation for the ipad. In that case, the swiping left works fine, but the swiping right stops working, which is very strange. All other platforms and devices seem to work fine, but iPad either in the simulator or on the device itself shows this problem.</p>
<p>I did find that if I initiate the swipe gesture in the area between my webviews (my webviews don&#39;t take 100% of the screen in the scrollable view, only a portion), then the swipe right does work.</p>
<p>So it definitely seems to be related to the webview inside a scrollableview, during landscape orientation. In portrait orientation, the swiping works fine.</p>
<p>I am on Titanium SDK 3.0.2 and am compiling to iOS 6.</p>

										<p><p>I just wanted to follow up with this. I did some more digging and the webview does not even fire the scroll events at all for iPad when I am in landscape mode and do a scroll to the right. A left scroll or a scroll of either  direction in portrait orientation fires the scroll events constantly as you&#39;d expect while you move your  finger&#x2F;pointer on the screen.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I could not find any workarounds for this. Finally I tried upgrading to Titanium SDK 3.1.1, and now magically it all works great. I guess it was a bug that has since been fixed between SDK 3.0.2 and 3.1.1.</p>
