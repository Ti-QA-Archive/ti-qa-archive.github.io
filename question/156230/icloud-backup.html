			<h1>iCloud Backup</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>I am currently trying to get my app to be published onto the iOS App Store but keep coming across iCloud Backup issues. I am currently working with the iOS 6.1 SDK and I am testing with an iPhone 5.<br>The message I get from Apple App Store is the following:</p>
<p>We found that your app does not follow the iOS Data Storage Guidelines, which is required per the App Store Review Guidelines.</p>
<p>The iOS Data Storage Guidelines indicate that only content that the user creates using your app, e.g., documents, new files, edits, etc., should be backed up by iCloud. </p>
<p>Temporary files used by your app should only be stored in the &#x2F;tmp directory; please remember to delete the files stored in this location when the user exits the app.</p>
<p>I have browsed the forum to look for what this issue could be and found an article which explains that you need to use a <code>remoteBackup = false;</code> attribute. Here is what I currently put in my app to try and stop the iCloud backup:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> sPath1</span> = Titanium.Filesystem.resourcesDirectory+Titanium.Filesystem.separator+'packaged_data'+Titanium.Filesystem.separator;

sPath1.remoteBackup = <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>;

<span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> sPath2</span>     = Titanium.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory+Titanium.Filesystem.separator;

sPath2.remoteBackup = <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>;
</code></pre><p>However this does not seem to change what is backed up to iCloud.</p>
<p>Any help and assistance on this would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>Hi Kieran, </p>
<p>i had the same issue a while ago, as far as i understand, you are trying to set the remoteBackup flag for a directory, but this is not working properly.</p>
<p>take a look at this (monologous) <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;149604&#x2F;prevent-icloud-backup-for-entire-folder">thread</a> i posted a solution for setting the remoteBackup flag recursivly</p>

							<p>Hi Moritz,</p>
<p>Thank you for your post and quick reply. I have tried to implement the function you have linked to in the thread however I am now getting an error when compiling on the device which reads. </p>
<p>error setting remote backup flag: at main.js (line 1)</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>

										<p><p>i think you are calling the function in a right way, you don&#39;t have to put a separator at the end…</p>
<p>just try this when you don&#39;t need iCloud Backup at all (copy the code into js file named iCloud.js and put it in your Resources directory)</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'iCloud'</span>).disableBackupForFolder(Ti.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory);
</code></pre></p>

										<p><p>sure, that makes sense. Currently I am still having a few issues sfter tweaking the application. The images which I do not want to backup are stored in the resources directory under a folder called packaged data. I assumed that in order for this to function correctly I needed to change the line above to reflect the folder backup to a different folder.</p>
<p><code>require(&amp;#39;iCloud&amp;#39;).disableBackupForFolder(Titanium.Filesystem.resourcesDirectory);</code></p>
<p>however this now still returns Error setting remote backup flag: at iCloud.js (line 1)</p>

										<p><p>resourcesDirectory is not writable, so the backup flag can&#39;t be set. You don&#39;t have to set the flags on on resourcesDirectory because it will not be backed up anyway. Only applicationDataDirectory can be synced with iCloud.</p>

										<p><p>Oh I see, excellent. Well that solves that. I didn&#39;t realise that the application I am looking at also downloaded files to the applicationData folder. That works great now. Thank you very much for your help.</p>

										<p><p>your answer has nothing to do with the question, the question was how to completely DISABLE iCloud, not to use it and of course it&#39;s spam, you posted the link to your module in EVERY thread related to iCloud. -.-</p>
