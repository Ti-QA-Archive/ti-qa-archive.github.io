			<p>Hello everyone.  I&#39;ve been using admob in my free apps, as I heard iAds had a very low fill rate.  After running admob for a few weeks, and doing more research, it seems the best way to generate revenue is to have iAds, and if those don&#39;t fill, fall back to admob.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve spent hours getting all of that setup, and was about to submit my apps, when I noticed that if an iAd is clicked in landscape, it loads in portrait, and then when you close the iAd, the app is hidden, and you only see a blank screen.  If the iAd is clicked in portrait, it all works fine.  (This happens on both iPhone and Ipad.)</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried to catch a click event on the iAd by adding event listeners, and found that &quot;click&quot; events don&#39;t seem to have listeners.  I can catch an &quot;action&quot; event, but it doesn&#39;t fire until after the ad loads.  My hope was to switch the app to portrait when an iAd is clicked, which will probably fix the issue.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve found this thread which also confirms the issue, but not any resolution.<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;122793&#x2F;how-to-get-iad-to-display–480x32</p>
<p>I&#39;d love to hear any advise on getting iAds to work in landscape.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
