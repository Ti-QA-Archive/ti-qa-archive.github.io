			<h1>ListView performance slow.. Even laggy.. (iOS) Why?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, I&#39;ve rewritten all of my feeds in my app to listview items. One thing I just noticed is when I create a &quot;listviewitem&quot; that has alot of views, it runs really slow the first time I scroll it through. To make it faster, I&#39;ve removed a bunch of auto-heights (height: Ti.UI.SIZE). Visually, the feed looks like the Facebook-app feed.</p>
<p>So my problem, when I scroll through the feed it really lags. Odd in my point of view, since the listview performance has been awesome until now. But even more odd is when I reach the bottom of the page, and scroll back to top. No lag. After I&#39;ve scrolled through the feed, everything is really smooth.</p>
<p>It&#39;s like the items hasnt rendered until it has been &quot;scrolled over&quot; or something.. I dont know.</p>
<p>(Developing in Ti 3.2.3, for iOS)</p>
<p>Anyone who might know what to do?</p>
<p>(Since the code-highlighter here are broken for me, here&#39;s one template of my items: </p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;JvWHFkKK">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;JvWHFkKK</a></p>
<p>All suggestions appreciated. Im kind of stuck here, cant launch when the feed is slow like this..</p>
<p>I have tried to remove all things and so on, but the only reason I found that it lags is the &quot;Big&quot; image provided (bindId: &#39;image&#39;) and the (bindId: &#39;avatar&#39;).  But even if I remove them and let everything else be in place, it&#39;s some lag..</p>
<p>Please help :)</p>

							<div><p>Hi, I didnt have this layout&#x2F;approach before, but I just compiled the app to 3.2.0 and there was no difference. So I still have no clue about why the performance is &quot;way better&quot; when I have scrolled through all items..</p>
