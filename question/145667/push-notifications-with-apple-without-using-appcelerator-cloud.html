			<h1>Push notifications with apple without using Appcelerator cloud</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Wondering if this method is to register the device in the push service uses the appcelerator cloud or goes directly to apple:</p>
<p>Titanium.Network.registerForPushNotifications()</p>
<p>I can&#39;t afford the appcelerator cloud system or any other paid system so i&#39;m looking for something to implement it directly.</p>
<p>Can someone give me some hints or orientation please?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The method <strong>Titanium.Network.registerForPushNotifications()</strong> is part of the push mechanism but does not require the use of Appcelerators implementation.</p>
<p>You will need to either host your own server (not shared web space), SSLs and other services to keep everything running.  Chances are this may cost more than using another service.</p>
<p>If you are starting out - check out urban airship.</p>

										<p><p>so Malcolm, does this mean that we can implement push messages for free if we have our own server and SSLs?</p>

										<p><p>Yes - as you are not paying another service provider but very much NO in the total costs you will incur.</p>
<p>In order to achieve your own implementation you will need to host a DEDICATED server and that server must be available 24 hours a day to handle the interactions.</p>
<p>You will need a suitably secure SSL - I do not think you can use a basic certificate.</p>
<p>You will be responsible for handling ALL in bound and out bound communications, including creating suitable API end points on the server.</p>
<p>You will also have to handle all token generation.</p>
<p>By the time you have added all these things - including someone suitably capable of administering the server to set it up, keep it running and lock out any man in the middle attacks, viruses, load balancing for demand etc - you will have spent much more than Appcelerator, Urban Airship or other company are likely to charge.  Not forgetting most of the expense you will have to spend up-front.</p>
<p>There is also the point of is the business of running a APN server cost beneficial to your business or a distraction to your main goal of selling apps, IaPs, advertising, subscriptions or any other revenue generation you aim for.</p>
<p>So Yes you can - but make sure it is actually a sensible decision.</p>
<p>ps I am not available to help - it is hard :)</p>
