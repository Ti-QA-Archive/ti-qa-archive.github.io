			<p>I searched a little about this argument but i didn&#39;t find anything exaustive.<br>I heard that If someone install my titanium app (from the market or from &quot;Install from device&quot; in titanium studio) they can see the code of my application searching in the filesystem of the device. (I surely can see my js and resources files if i unzip the apk).<br>Isn&#39;t this a big drawback against native coding(if my supposition is confirmed)?<br>Thank you for your feedback<br>Regards<br>Andrea</p>

							<p>When you package for deployment your code in encrypted. This doesn&#39;t happen when you build for testing, which is probably why you could see your code. As with anything, including native development, code can be decrypted if someone is willing to take enough time to do so. This is not something that you should have to worry about.</p>

							<p>Hi Thank you for your feedback. </p>
<ul>
<li>I just wanted to know more about the argument because i found link like this: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;javascript.deveronline.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;27&#x2F;when-you-write-a-titanium-app-is-the-source-code-visible-to.html </li>
<li>I use SDK 3.0.0 v20121204… one of the most recent i think</li>
<li>I opened an apk in the folder: &quot;…&#39;projectname&#39;&#x2F;build&#x2F;android&#x2F;bin&#x2F;app.apk&quot;  </li>
</ul>
<p>I admin that i don&#39;t know much about signing apk and encrypt the code. I just started coding in titanium and i want to know more about this framework! It is important for my boss that the code of my app is not visible so every information you can tell me is really helpful! Thank you!</p>

<p>If it was built for the emulator, then it won&#39;t be encrypted.  If it was build for android store distribution, it should be. (I just built one out to test to be sure)</p>

							<p>(I surely can see my js and resources files if i unzip the apk) &lt;— In a signed, ready for release APK you can see your code?</p>
<p>Your code is not encrypted in emulator builds as it wastes dev time.</p>
<p>Your code should be encrypted unless you have intentionally set a flag in your tiapp.xml to prevent it.</p>
<ul>
<li>How about you tell us &#39;where on the internet&#39; you heard this.</li>
<li>How about you tell us which version of the TiMobile SDK you are using.</li>
<li>How about you tell us which APK you used to build your supposition upon.</li>
</ul>
