			<h1>Deployment in an educational computer lab?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I hope this is the forum in which to ask if it is possible to deploy Titanium in a computer lab situation. Our university would like to use it in our labs and for instruction on mobile and web development. The issue is that the free version of Titanium is a single user license that requires a login on first launch. Because we use Microsoft SCCM to image our workstations, we create a template of Windows 7 and package the software to push out remotely. The result would be that the single user software would be used in the lab with 50 to 100 simultaneous logins, which I imagine would not work with the Titanium licensing. Of course students can install it on their own computers; but without the instructional opportunity in the lab, they would be less likely to adopt Titanium as their dev platform of choice. </p>
<p>Does anyone know if there is a way to deploy the free version in an educational computer lab environment? The sales representative was unable to answer this question. I&#39;m looking at deployment to 300 workstations or more.</p>

							<p>Each student could still create their own account.<br>Simply log out at the end of each session on the system.</p>
<p>In the bottom right hand corner, click the user name, and you will be prompted to log out, leaving the system ready for the next student.</p>
<p>Problems may occur with managing projects.<br>The answer there would be for each student to use their own drive space as the project target area for Titanium.</p>

							<p>Thanks so much for the reply. I&#39;ll ask the IT team if this would work.</p>

										<p><p>Hello again,</p>
<p>I&#39;m still chasing down an effective way to deploy Titanium in our university IT computer labs using an unattended installation. It&#39;s been a year since I last asked the question and I am hoping that there have been developments that address the issues. I recently requested for the second time that Titanium be installed in our labs. ITS investigated and came back with the following deployment and maintenance issues:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Can&#39;t be silently installed.  This product was not designed to be flexible in terms of unattended installations, therefore any installation we made would have to be manual and repeated whenever there is an image refresh in a lab.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Installs against user profile rather than the machine itself.  The problem here is twofold: software that operates like this is difficult to manage (As each machine can have many user profiles and, thus, many instances of Titanium) and the licensing situation can become rather costly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Initializing the program requires a Titanium Studio account and work is seemingly tied to this account.  We would have to reset the accounts semester to semester (To prevent access to previous account holders&#39; work) or create new accounts, neither of which is an attractive proposition.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The software is dependent upon numerous subordinate pieces of software (Titanium SDK, NodeJS, Titanium CLI, and Alloy).  The deployment and update of these would also be manual.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Updates are stored in user accounts.  Not only would ongoing maintenance of those subordinate pieces of software be manual, but we would have to perform the maintenance per each user profile on the machine due to the way that the update handler works.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Given all this, I would say that the software is untenable in our environment.  It appears to have been developed with a boutique environment in mind (Low number of users, limited need for automation of installation, etc.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for considering…</p>
