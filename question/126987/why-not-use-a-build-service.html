			<h1>Why not use a build service?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, I was wondering why did Appcelerator not have a build service for packaging the mobile apps in the cloud? I mean I don&#39;t have a Mac and I am not able to compile iOS devices. I have to invest in buying a Mac just to create iOS apps.</p>

							<p>Hi Gauvrav, You can say this is the limitation of an iOS apps development.You cannot develop iOS apps on windows, but for sure using titanium you can, first develop your application on windows for android and later you can run same application for iPhone as well by making few changes in to your application.</p>
<p>if you are satisfied with this answer,  reply your feedback</p>

										<p><p>@shlomi and @mathew : True and that is why I am attracted towards Ti but I just feel that if Phonegap can achieve cloud build process so can Titanium. I have experimented with Phonegap and its not to my liking but I do like their cloud build process as it makes the life easier.</p>

							<p>hey I know how it feels when we planning to develop the application for the iphone but you don&#39;t have the MAC and the even the cost is too high for it so not easy option to invest in it. But the Snow leopard OS can be installed on many Intel based PC. You only need to have the 512 MB NVidia Graphics card for that. If you can share your PC configuration i may help you in installing the snow leopard on that. That will solve your problem and then you can start developing like a rockstar for Iphone.</p>

										<p><p>Although is may work with the right hardware, people should be aware it breaks the license terms of Snow Leopoard (or any OSX version) to install on hardware which is not &quot;Apple branded&quot;.  Thus even if you buy an OSX license, you do not have the legal right to do it this way.  This also applies to VMWare or similar virtual devices.</p>

							<p>You can even find some VMWare snapshot with Snow Leopard on some underground websites ;) </p>
<p>It works like a charm with a Intel processor wich support virtualization.<br>No need to buy a MAC !</p>
<p>By the way, of course it&#39;s not really legal</p>
