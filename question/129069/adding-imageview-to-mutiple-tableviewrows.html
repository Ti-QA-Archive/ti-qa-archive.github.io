			<h1>Adding ImageView to mutiple TableViewRows?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>For memory saving purposes I&#39;m currently trying to add an ImageView to multiple TableViewRows instead of creating this ImageView over and over again.</p>
<p>Is this impossible? I have a variable containing that ImageView, let&#39;s call it <em>imageView</em> for now and some TableViewRows in a TableView. All I want to do, is to do something like:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var imageView = Ti.UI.createImageView(...)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

tableRow1.add(imageView)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
tableRow2.add(imageView)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
tableRow3.add(imageView)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>But if I try it this way, the image is shown only in <em>tableRow3</em>…</p>
<p>Is there something I&#39;m missing?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>
<p><em>Chris</em></p>

							<p>in Ios is impossible -  you have only one image that is moved from one row to another. In Android the result is how you expect it but I&#39;m not sure is the best practice :)</p>
<p>Tip: (I guess you know already) -  if the tablerows share the same layout use the sam className - it will improve a lot the performance and memory consumption.</p>

										<p><p>Dan,</p>
<p>thanks for your advice!<br>The TableRows will use the same layout, indeed, but I&#39;m hasitating to use JSS for styling. Please be so kind as to answer <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;128818&#x2F;best-practices-for-styling-listviews">this Q&amp;A post</a> about whether to use JSS for TableRows or not. Any help will be highly appreciated!</p>
<p>Thanks again, in advance!</p>

										<p><p>The problem is that in this case the imageView is one object only.<br>When you are trying to reuse it is the same object and not a clone of it.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t worry about images -  they are loaded in the memory only when they are in view and pretty soon after the go out of the screen (you scroll) they are freed.</p>
<p>A good thing would be to server the device the image in the exact size(no downscaling to appear).</p>
<p>Having so many rows (hundreds) would imply though some tweaks -  try to load only 10-20 rows (depending on complexity) and load the rest by request (a &quot;more&quot; button) or when the table scrolls close to the bottom.<br>Also avoid transparent backgrounds, gradients and rounded corners if possible.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you again!</p>
<p>I wasn&#39;t aware of the fact, that Images outside the viewport will be freed. This is a great advice! I&#39;ll try to take care of that transparent backgrounds, etc.</p>

							<p>your <code>imageView</code> var is a reference to an object. what you are doing is putting that object in row 1, so the actual object is being associated with row 1, then you tell your app &quot;add this object to row 2&quot; so what it does is take the object and change it&#39;s container to row 2 and so it goes until the last row.</p>
<p>What you need to do is 3 different objects. If you were looping some data then you would have created your object inside the loop and you wouldn&#39;t have that problem (because the loop has it&#39;s own scope).</p>
<p>Also, I also recommend paying attention to Dan&#39;s tip on className</p>

										<p><p>Shlomi,</p>
<p>thanks, but for my understanding of object-oriented programming it&#39;s absolutely okay to refence an object from multiple other objects, thus I&#39;m wondering why this shouldn&#39;t be possible here.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not just the 3 TableViewRows I gave as an example here, but rather some hundreds of Rows whereof each will be attached this image to.</p>
<p>But okay, as Dan said, it&#39;s not possible in iOS, and so I&#39;ll use some hundreds of ImageViews.</p>
