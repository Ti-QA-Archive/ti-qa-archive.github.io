			<h1>Upgraded to Titatnium 1.4 but App still showing 1.2.1</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am having a lot of difficulty getting any mobile apps to run in the emulator. I initially installed both iOS SDK 4.0.2 and the latest Android SDK 2.2. I initially installed Titanium 1.2.1 and then upgraded to 1.4. I created a test mobile application and tried to run it in the emulator and received the following error:</p>
<p>[ERROR] Build Failed. Please see output for more details</p>
<p>I wanted to see more about the errors with this build so I tried accessing the build.log file, however there was no such file. I assume since it never built this file was not created but how can I get more details about why it failed?</p>
<p>I tried running this with SDK 3.2 and 4.0 both failed. I also noticed that even though I upgraded to Titanium 1.4 the version still says 1.2.1.</p>
<p>Has anyone run into this problem? What am I doing wrong. I can run a simple desktop app with no issues, it&#39;s just the mobile side that will not run.</p>
<p>Thanks<br>Mike</p>
