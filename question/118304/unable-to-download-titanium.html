			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>   Just wanna ask if anyone has just started with Titanium for development? Did you manage to download the program? Been trying for a couple of days but not able to get the file at all… it always tells me &quot;This webpage is not available&quot;… anyone knows where did I go wrong or maybe I miss out on something perhaps??? Thanks for your time</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>glenn</p>

<p>Where are you downloading the installer from?  Which platform are you downloading for?</p>
<p>The links to download the installers for each platform work fine for me. See the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;download&#x2F;#downloads">download page</a>.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>   Logged in before I tried to download the file. Tried to download for windows and mac but both failed, giving the same error. Tried the link u just listed as well but also gave the same error. So was just wondering if it is just me or did I did something wrong. Thanks for your time though :)</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Glenn</p>

<p>I tried downloading using a different browser and without logging in, and they worked fine again.</p>
<p>Out of interest, where are you located (country&#x2F;closest large city)?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>It doesn&#39;t sound like a browser issue. However, you could confirm this on your OSX machine by using <code>wget</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">wget <span class="hljs-string">http:</span><span class="hljs-comment">//www.appcelerator.com/download-osx</span>
</code></pre><p>What kind of network are you on? How do you connect to the internet? What is the router&#x2F;firewall between you and the internet? Is there a proxy on your network?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
