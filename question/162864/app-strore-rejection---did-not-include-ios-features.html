			<h1>App Strore Rejection - Did not include iOS features.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve created an app using alloy MVC framework which includes custom TabBar and few table views and web views. I&#39;ve submitted the app on the play store and it is live but Apple reject it giving me the following reason:</p>
<p>Reasons</p>
<p>10.6: Apple and our customers place a high value on simple, refined, creative, well thought through interfaces. They take more work but are worth it. Apple sets a high bar. If your user interface is complex or less than very good it may be rejected<br>10.6</p>
<p>We found the following issues with the user interface of your app:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did not include iOS features. For example, it would be appropriate to use native iOS buttons and iOS features other than just web views, Push Notifications, or sharing.</li>
</ul>
<p>These examples identify types of issues discovered in your app but may not represent all such issues. It would be appropriate to thoroughly evaluate your app to address these types of issues.</p>
<hr>
<p>What Am I doing wrong. Any Suggestions?</p>
