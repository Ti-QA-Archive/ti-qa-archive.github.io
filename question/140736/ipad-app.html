			<p>Hello,<br>   does anyone have an idea for this app?</p>
<p>in this screenshot, they are not using any tabs, and this is not a scrollableview i think, because background and the front menu sliding at the same time, what can it be? if background is scrollableview and the front is a view can we link them? and when you click the front menu ( carrer menu ) it opens like modal window but not modal it is something different? </p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-string">http:</span><span class="hljs-comment">//blog.mobileroadie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/photo-1.png</span>

							<p>Hi Gurkan </p>
<p>This is a technique known as parallaxing, in simple terms they have several views placed over the top of each other, when the user scrolls one view the app tells the other views to scroll as well but as a percentage of the distance the top one scrolls.</p>
<p>So by moving the top layer the middle layer moves at the same time but only 80% of the distance travelled by the top layer, the bottom layer travels only 60% of the top layer.  The % a guides only people use there own.</p>
<p>By using this technique it gives that weird view - looks magic and special, but really easy to make yourself.</p>
<p>It is certainly not the scrollView, just normal views or imageviews stacked on top of each other with the top layer responding to events <code>touchstart</code>, <code>touchmove</code> and <code>touchend</code>.</p>
<p>This technique also pre-dates computers, look at old traditional cartoons, particularly when they are moving across the screen, the background moves slower than the grass layer, with the characters on top moving the fastest.</p>
<p>Hope that explains it.  Look forward to seeing your app in the store using the technique.</p>

										<p><p>Hi</p>
<p>I have not tried the code you mentioned, but if you want to learn the principle - you start by following a few steps.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Add three views; <code>viewBottom</code>, <code>viewMiddle</code> &amp; <code>viewTop</code> (in this order)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add an image to each of these views that has transparent region so you can easily see each layer through the other.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add an event listener to viewTop for <code>touchmove</code> and use <code>Ti.API.info(&amp;#39;your debug code&amp;#39;)</code> to write out the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>set the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> of the <code>viewMiddle</code> to be the SAME as the values you received.</p>
</li>
<li><p>move around the screen - both <code>viewTop</code> AND <code>viewMiddle</code> should be moving at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>now play with the <code>x&amp;#x2F;y</code> by multiplying by a factor like 80%.</p>
</li>
<li><p>test again, the <code>viewMiddle</code> should now be moving at a different speed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Continue down this path and see what you achieve.</p>
<p>Do not forget to mark the question as answered so others can benefit in the future.</p>
