			<h1>Bug - Splash screen rotates when using Landscape mode (iPhone)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>This is a known bug and there are several threads about it, none receiving any attention by developers.</p>
<p>Since we got no way of creating issues in the new Jira system, I&#39;m trying here to either report the bug or ask if anyone has found a workaround.</p>
<p>The problem is when you got an landscape only app, the splash screen first loads default.png correctly, but just as the first window is opened, the splash image will rotate 90 degrees in a distorted way before the window appears correctly in landscape. The shortly rotated image is clearly scaled as to fit a portrait window - it&#39;s partly outside of the screen and theres a black empty area..</p>
<p>There is no difference if I remove all orientations from tiapp.xml or info.plist, or set the orientation through code..</p>
<p>I think this is a critical bug since there is no way to create a landscape only app with Titanium as it is now.</p>
<p>Anyone that has any ideas at all?</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;m looking into a workaround. Allow all orientations in tiapp.xml, and then set orientation modes for every window I create.</p>
<p>I think this will work if all windows are one orientation, but it gets more complicated with mixed orientation.</p>
<p>If you have a tab group and some of your tabs&#39; windows switch orientation to say portrait, then swapping back to your landscape tab will result in a portrait view of it. </p>
<p>I&#39;m thinking of adding a focus event handler and resetting orientation there. Anyone tried that with any success?</p>
<p>My 2 pence worth, it should be possible to create a landscape only app just by editing tiapp.xml. Looking forward to a fix from Appcelerator soon.</p>

							<div><p>After I posted I realised that allowing all orientations would still trigger the rotation to say landscape on startup.</p>
<p>Have you tried restricting the orientations to portrait only in the tiapp.xml, then programmatically switching to landscape in the app window?</p>

							<div><p>Yes I have, it doesn&#39;t work. This is a known bug and a crucial one, you can&#39;t make landscape only apps with a correct splash! I&#39;ve made a very ugly workaround that looks ok but I&#39;m not even sure Apple will let the app through to be honest.. Not sure if it&#39;s even worth posting here.</p>

							<div><p>I submitted my app 2 days ago, it will be very interesting to see what Apple says about this. I will post here again.</p>
<p>There&#39;s no black area for me now, but the splash is displayed in portrait (it&#39;s rotated 90 degrees so it looks nice when you hold the phone landscape wise). When the first window loads though the orientation change animation is shown. But why! I have set the app to start in landscape in both xml file and in app, theres no need for a rotation animation, argh..</p>

										<p><p>Thank you for taking time to comment. I think the JIRA system was new when i posted this and I thought only paying customers could insert tickets. </p>
<p>Anyway, I just created a issue, describing the problem and including some very simple code examples.<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC-203</p>

							<p>This work around is working for me up to a point :</p>
<p>Set orientation to landscape only in tiapp.xml, add the dummy window to the app.js in this Q+A.</p>
