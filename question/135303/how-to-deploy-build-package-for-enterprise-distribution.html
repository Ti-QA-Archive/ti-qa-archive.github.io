			<h1>How to deploy build package for Enterprise Distribution?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>After countless hours of trial&#x2F;error and failure, I finally was able to successfully create a build from Titanium&#39;s &quot;Distribute - Apple iTune&#39;s Store&quot;. But I am not sure what to do now because it didn&#39;t seem to create an ipa file. </p>
<p>Note: I have an Enterprise program from apple, rather than standard iOS developer account. My app is for in-house distribution only, and won&#39;t go to the app store.</p>
<p>Previously when I did a dev build (targeting specific apple device IDs), it created an ipa file. Then with the help of the BetaBuilder app, I was able to create a series of files (ipa, plist, html) that I copied to a web server for download and install. But now I don&#39;t see an ipa file and I&#39;m not sure what&#x2F;how to deploy this to the web server.</p>
<p>Instead of the IPA, Titanium created some kind of package named the same as my app in this location: build\iphone\build\Release-iphoneos\Daily Report. The &quot;Daily Report&quot; (my app) is shown as Kind = Application in finder. I can look inside this app&#x2F;package and see a bunch of folders and files, but no ipa. I suspect this entire package gets deployed, but how? Do I still use BetaBuilder? Can this package be deployed on its own to the web server and downloaded?</p>

							<p>You can deploy an enterprise package with Titanium, that is not a problem. Once you made the so called Archive with Titanium (by using Distribute - Apple iTunes Store), you have to switch to xCode though. Open xCode -&gt; Window -&gt; Organizer,  in Organizer click on Archives, look for your application, click on it and use &quot;Distribute&quot;, xCode will ask you what to do, one of the possible selections is Enterprise distribution. Thats about it, it will save a ipa file and also the other necessary files, upload those and enjoy enterprise distribution.</p>
