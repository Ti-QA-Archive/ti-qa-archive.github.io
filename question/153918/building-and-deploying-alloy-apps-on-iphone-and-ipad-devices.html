			<h1>Building and Deploying Alloy Apps on iPhone and iPad Devices</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all-</p>
<p>I have a question on deployment of Alloy apps.  In the past, I have created apps specifically for iPads or iPhone via the Titanium framework.  With Alloy, I have one Alloy project, and using the conditionals within the tss&#x2F;xml view&#x2F;controller functions, I utilize the single project to generate views specific to the iPad or iPhone platforms (retina&#x2F;non-retina), which all work well in the simulators.  Also, when opening the builds up in XCode and running the apps on my physical devices with the Device settings set to iPhone or iPad as appropriate, I can run&#x2F;install the dev release to my device and also run as expected.</p>
<p>Here is the question.  When I build my production application, can I build one app, which will work on both devices, or do I need to build one app, targetting the iPhone within the XCode iOS Application Target settings, and another targetting iPad, to pick up the iPad views&#x2F;settings?  I was wondering if there were docs&#x2F;guidance for others building&#x2F;deploying for universal targets out there.  I&#39;d love to build one app that users could grab that would work as expected on iPhone&#x2F;iPad since it is all compiled within the one project.</p>
<p>Thanks for any guidance.</p>
<p>Talk soon<br>Chris</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>When you initially create the app project you are asked if you want to target; hone, iPad, android (and now Tizen &amp; blackberry).  Concentrating solely on iOS for this conversation.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you choose, JUST iPhone, then you app is only going to compile as iPhone, if you run it on an iPad if will appear as an iPhone app.</li>
<li>If you choose JUST ipad then your app will not work on iPhone.</li>
<li>If however you choose BOTH iPhone and iPad, then your app is compiled as a universal app and will run as iPhone on iPhone and iPad on iPad.  As you have already noted the alloy framework enables you to make light(re) work of targeting sections of you UI to each platform relatively easily (you still need to be a good coder).</li>
</ul>
<p>So if you want to have one code base and target both iPhone and iPad, simply choose both targets when you start the app.</p>
<p>Two important notes;</p>
<ul>
<li>you can change your target platforms AFTER you have started the project, just remember to code for both of course.</li>
<li>this ability has nothing to do with Alloy, you can do this with or without using Alloy.  Alloy just makes managing the differences easier from a UI stand-point and a few other tricks of course.</li>
</ul>
<p>Have fun</p>

							<p>Thanks so much.  Like I mentioned, I had coded for both already, and had tested via the simulator, but was more concerned with deployment, and if there were additional steps required to target a platform, or if a simple Universal target is sufficient, and it would pick up the differences I had coded in, which it seems it will, provided I have set the flags as indicated.</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>
<p>Chris</p>
