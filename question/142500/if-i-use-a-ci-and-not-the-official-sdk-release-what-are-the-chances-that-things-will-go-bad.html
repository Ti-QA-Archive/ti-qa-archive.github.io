			<p>I need to use a feature which is available in the CI but will be supported only by 3.0 Official SDK release. I want to know, if my apps works ok with the current Official SDK, are there chances that t will fail with the CI? Or is it that I can only encounter problems with the features that the CI has and are not available in the official SDK.  The feature I want to use is: </p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-10739</p>
<p>This is the only thing that I need so I want to know from your experience how risky this is</p>

							<p>I mostly use CI builds in development because they contain newest bug fixes. Mostly they work fine, but sometimes problems can occur because they are not fully tested. I recommend that final version of application is compiled with released version or with CI build that seems the most stable one (usually, by the time you finish application, something gets released).</p>
