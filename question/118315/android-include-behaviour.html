			<h1>Android include behaviour</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am having a strange problem with Android.</p>
<p>On one page there is a nice table list with data being fed from a server. Then you go a child page from this list and although both the list page and the child pages have </p>
<p>[code]<br>Titanium.include(&#39;common.js&#39;);<br>[&#x2F;code]</p>
<p>at the top, the child page fails with an error saying that a particular function call is not defined (when this function is in the common.js file and all the js files are in the same folder).</p>
<p>This is quite odd behaviour isn&#39;t it?<br>Or is this a java thing where the error you get is about 10 lines away from the problem (sorry cant help having a dig at java error detection).</p>
<p>Anyone had anything similar?</p>

							<p>This isn&#39;t an answer, but if you search for &quot;android include&quot; in the Q&amp;A you&#39;ll see a number of issues that sound very similar to yours, including a couple of recent ones.  So if it&#39;s any reassurance (although I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not), you&#39;re not the only one having problems like that.</p>

							<p>Hi,<br>You are right, it is not an answer, but i can assure you that i did search before posting.</p>
<p>I have searched again and again to find possible clues and it seems that this is a major bug in the Android side of Titanium. One post says to use the latest nightly build, however i cannot take the chance on using dev code, as it could cause me more problems that it solves (as has happened in the past).</p>
<p>So, i have abandoned the idea of includes, just copying and pasting the included functions in each file that needs them… breaking some basic rules of coding.</p>
<p>I appreciate that every effort is being done to get Android into a working product with Titanium, but my experience so far has been that Titanium is not really ready for it with very odd behaviour and different outcomes from the same actions each time you do them.</p>
<p>Hopefully i can get this app finished with these hacks but i will be very cautious about Android in the future as development time has doubled due to these inconsistencies and that just does not make sense.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
