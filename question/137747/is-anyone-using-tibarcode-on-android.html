			<p>I sent a post 2 weeks ago that I can&#39;t get this module to work on Android. The module loads fine, but when I attempt to capture() or parse() in their example app it crashes both emulator and device. I haven&#39;t got any reply to my post and AppC&#39;s support is loathsome, so now I&#39;m wondering if anyone even uses it. Is there a better alternative?</p>

							<p>I am using it. I have found that the new version for android has some code in it that does not allow all phones to work. It gives a missing hardware error so i have had to fall back to 2.1 for now. Other then that it is working fine for QR codes</p>

										<p><p>I didn&#39;t get it until after 2.3 was first available. Is there any way&#x2F;where to download 2.1? I&#39;m getting a crash on any AVD when I attempt capture() or parse(). Not sure this is the same issue as you were encountering. Really frustrated.</p>

							<p>I am using Ti.barcode 2.3.0, and I am crashing on two Android devices:<br>… an Android Samsung Galaxy 7 inch tablet (2.6.35.7)<br>… an Android Moto Droid. 2.2.3<br>I am testing using the example code that comes with the module.<br>The Crash happens on the Barcode.capture event.<br>However, this works fine on an iPHONE device.</p>

							<p>Well, I eventually gave up on this, which forced me to switch to Java development. When I integrated the Java version of Zxing I found several issues with Android SDK 1.7. Minor code issues dealing with changes in the use of switch&#x2F;case statements that were easy to fix, but I&#39;m guessing may be tripping up the module as well. It seems Zxing is not tightly maintained and, at least for Java developers, is often modified to suit their needs. I am still angry at AppC for not being more responsive, but now also realize this is a difficult module to maintain on the Android side.</p>
