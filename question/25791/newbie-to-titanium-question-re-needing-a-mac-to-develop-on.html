		<section>
			<p>I looked at the second 101 tutorial where it tells me that I need a mac and to download the iphone SDK (I want to do iPad development). I&#39;m a newbie to Titanium and thought I could develop iphone&#x2F;ipad apps using only Titanium on my windows 7 machine? Did I miss something? Why is the tutorial video telling me I need a mac and to install the iphone SDK on it? I&#39;m confused now.</p>

							<p>Then Titanium is totally misleading people. There are NUMEROUS statements on their website that say you can develop an iphone&#x2F;ipad app using Titanium. Their tutorial videos <em>clearly</em> show and state this and none of the statements or videos say you need to have a mac and the iphone SDK. The Titanium impression is very clear that you can write iphone apps using Titanium.</p>
<p>I am totally confused at this point. The Titanium website clearly says I can develop iphone&#x2F;ipad apps using Titanium and all of you kind folks trying to help me say I can&#39;t, say that I need a mac and their iphone SDK to write iphone&#x2F;ipad apps. Is it April fools day or something?</p>

							<p>Though Titanium Developer does run on windows, unfortunately you will need a mac to develop iPhone&#x2F;iPad applications. This is a restriction by Apple, not Appcelertor. You can still develop android applications on windows, and much of your code would work on iPhone&#x2F;iPad if you do get a mac down the road.</p>

							<p>@ralph<br>Developing for iPhone requires the iPhone Development SDK , no matter what.<br>You could go the jailbreak way, that won&#39;t let you upload apps in appstore, or you could try to use a hackintosh, but I&#39;m not sure you will be able to upload to appstore( yes you can compile and install the app on the testing device ) </p>
<p>Titanium is only doing your life easier, helping you doing this with what you already know ( javascript). The rest of the operations ( compiling , submit to appstore, etc) needs to be done the way Apple asks.<br>There is no other way.<br>The iPhone SDK runs only on Leopard OSX on Intel machines.</p>
<p>If you want to develop for iPhone first thing is to find out more about( especially that is about Apple which is so restrictive) then start blaming Titanium or other similar tools….</p>

<p> Look for anything recent and use caution when following or downloading  anything.</p>
