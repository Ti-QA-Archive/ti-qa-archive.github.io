							<p>I had the same requirement for dynamic searches. What I did was abort the last xhr request if it hasn&#39;t complete if the user types another key. This way you only have a single xhr instance at any time and this prevents the problem of the xhr calls stacking up.</p>

							<p>All currently active HTTP requests?  I think I read somewhere that the HTTP client code is not thread safe, and you should never have more than one active at a time.  But I can&#39;t find a reference to that effect now.  Maybe it is old info.</p>
<p>At any rate, to abort a HTTP client you need to have a reference to the object so that you can issue the obj.abort() method.  So if you are creating multiple concurrent requests, you should keep an array of the object references then when you want to abort all of them, iterate over your array.</p>
<p>If I am right about not running multiple HTTP clients concurrently, then you should consider implementing code to serialize the requests you need to make.  One such method to do it is <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;35991&#x2F;multiple-httpclient-get-requests-asynchronous#72411">here</a>.  </p>
<p>I also remember seeing a post in the Q&amp;A with a js class somebody graciously posted which handled multiple requests for you (but in a serial fashion).  Alas, I am not finding it in a quick search.</p>

										<p><p>Well basically my app populates a tableview with live suggestions as the user searches, with the suggestions coming from a remote source. Problem is, if the user types too quickly, the XHR requests start stacking up, and then the UI becomes unresponsive until all of them are complete.</p>

							<p>Add a delay that will start your xhr after 500ms or 750ms of the <strong>last</strong> letter was typed in the textfield.<br>You will have to clear the timeout on each keystroke and start it again. This only the last keystroke will start the xhr.</p>
<p>Why the UI becomes unresponsive? Are you using opening with async=false ?</p>
<p>Anyway, despite the fact it&#39;s a cool feature I&#39;d suggest you to let the user decide when the search should start. Some people have issues on typing so you might not be able to adapt the delay on each user typing speed.</p>
