			<h1>Application Failed to Install Error</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m trying to install an application to an Ipad2 but it keeps telling me &quot;Application X Failed to Install&quot; where X is the name of the application.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve set the provisioning profile to run in all registered devices and I doubt it&#39;s the code as I ran it with the most basic code, and still couldn&#39;t install it. I&#39;ve been stuck with this error for a couple of days, and have been unable to make progress. I&#39;d appreciate any help that can be given</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The first thing I would check is that the certificate and the app id match, so it you have the app id of <strong>com.somecompany.someapp</strong> that needs to be used as the app id in your <strong>tiapp.xml</strong> file and in your provisional profile certificate that you must have installed on your machine.</p>
<p>The only exception to this would be if you created a testing provisioning profile with a wild card, for example; </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">com<span class="hljs-class">.somecompany</span>.*
</code></pre><p>This is only useful for testing and would not be allowed in an app store app of course.</p>
<p>I would also check that you do not have MORE than one version of the certificate installed and your build process is using an old one that does not include your device information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Type <strong>xcode</strong> in the spotlight search and then press enter.</li>
<li>Menu <strong>Window</strong> &gt; <strong>Organizer</strong> </li>
<li>Locate your <strong>provisioning profile</strong> list</li>
<li>Delete <strong>ALL</strong> that match your app id</li>
<li>Re-download the provisioning profile from apple</li>
<li>Double-click it to have it appear in your <strong>provising profile</strong> list</li>
<li>Close the simulator if it running</li>
<li>In Titanium us the menu <strong>Project</strong> &gt; <strong>Clean</strong> and then select your app and confirm clean</li>
<li>Re-build your app for your device, and you will be asked to choose your <strong>provisioning profile</strong> again as it is unlikely to know which to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Does this work?</p>
<p>If not, create a brand new app with a brand new app id, create a new provisioning profile.  Then compile for device.  If this works then it is your code, if it does not then it is how you are creating provisioning profiles, your installation and unknown.</p>
<p>Let me know how you go.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the quick response. It appears there was a second provisioning profile in the Organizer Window, I deleted all as you said, re-downloaded it, double-clicked it, cleaned the project and now I&#39;m building it….  will take like 40+ min. I&#39;ll let you know… and thank you very much for the quick response and hopefully the solution to my problem :)</p>

										<p><p>Haha, not so much, it does have a lot of images, but I have to move the .IPA to another computer and then upload it to the device… and that computer and iTunes don&#39;t get along xD iTunes loads so slowly there, and if you make any click, it takes the computer 5-10 seconds to act. As of now, the application finished compiling. Fingers crossed indeed :P</p>
