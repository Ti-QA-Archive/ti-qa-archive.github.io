			<h1>First App: Kids and Home </h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>So after 7 months (8 if you count the latest update)<br>Our app has finally been released worldwide, in 2 languages.</p>
<p>It&#39;s completely made with titanium and html5.<br>our painting module was created using the ti.paint.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank Adriano Paladini for his flipbook component, laying the base for a great flipbook module.</p>
<p>Kids and Home is an interactive, educational application for kids to learn and just have fun.</p>
<p>here is the url: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunes.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;kids-and-home&#x2F;id424248838?mt=8&amp;ls=1</p>

							<div><p>Patrick, I came across your name a couple of times in the Q&amp;A section, already thought you were busy with something big. The end-product looks great, judging from the screens and appcelerator I sure think it was one hell of a ride building this :)<br>&#39;Mooi werk!&#39;</p>

							<div><p>Thanks.<br>Yeah it was a big project, especially because I was the only one working on it (and a designer ofcourse), but coding this with only javascript, jquery, actionscript (and a little objective-c) knowledge was a heck of a ride.<br>In the whole process we got from TiSDK 1.2 to 1.6 and the app uses 1.5.2 (because of the facebook issue in 1.6).</p>
<p>I still feel that these kind of apps are not really made to be coded in Titanium, but we got there…I still have a huge list I want to update but time is money, and am already buys creating a 2nd application.</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply!</p>

							<p>Looks good, congrats!</p>
<p>Is there a FB problem in 1.6?  I have it in an app that I&#39;m waiting approval on, and didnt notice anything (but I&#39;ve never used it in the earlier releases either).</p>
