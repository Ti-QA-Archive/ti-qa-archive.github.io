		<section>
			<p>Hi. Instead of using XCode directly I was advised by a friend to look at Titanium because it supports cross-platform development. </p>
<p>So I downloaded it. But when I look at the &quot;Getting started&quot; guide, it&#39;s a bunch of links in Wiki format full of articles. </p>
<p>Is there a simple tutorial somewhere that: </p>
<ol>
<li>Shows how to create a real, simple app that submits data online and gets data back to show to the user?</li>
<li>Works on iPhone + Blackberry + iPad + Android? </li>
</ol>
<p>I am hoping there&#39;s one app I need to develop and maintain, and the Titanium platform will automatically generate the code for iPhone, Android, etc? </p>
<p>Thanks for any pointers or direction, because that Getting Started guide is really quite nonsensical to a beginner. </p>
<p>I am good with PHP and databases, and willing to learn Objective C type languages, but hopefully I don&#39;t need Java or anything. </p>
<p>Thanks! </p>

										<p><p>Not sure what constitutes &quot;great&quot; for you, but I see three tutorials on that site. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Oldest one is a useless piece that tells me what I already knew after 5 minutes of googling. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The second one shows me &quot;iPhone transitions&quot;. Yea, super useful for a beginner. </p>
</li>
<li><p>And if that&#39;s isn&#39;t super useful enough, there&#39;s the most important thing in a tutorial for a beginner – &quot;custom fonts&quot;!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to share the link, but that is one useless waste of time. I&#39;ll keep looking. Welcome any other suggestions.</p>

<p>I can see how the guides were confusing before. I have rewritten the <em>Documentation Guides Homepage</em> and, specifically, the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Home#Home-NewUsers&#x2F;GettingStarted">New Users &#x2F; Getting Started</a> section.  I hope this clarifies it.</p>
<p>A great tutorial that explains how to create an app that works with a remote webservice is available in the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;HTTPClient+with+PHP+and+MySQL">HTTPClient with PHP and MySQL</a> guide.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

										<p><p>Thanks. That HttpClient example – how is that different from having a webpage opening up in a browser window? The user interface looks drab and boring, as it would if I had a common HTML &quot;form&quot; in a webpage. </p>
<p>As I missing something? I thought Titanium would create device-specific UI automatically. So, for iPhone, it would use the iPhone specific UI elements so the user experience felt like iPhone instead of the boring form elements shown in that example. </p>
<p>Or is Titanium just a simplistic JavaScript layer for people who can live with NOT having a device&#39;s own UI in their apps? </p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Are you referring to the following screenshot?</p>
<p><img src="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;sQMJv.png" alt="screenshot"></p>
<p>If so, the elements displayed are indeed native controls. Similarly, none of the code demonstrated in that guide contain webviews.</p>
<p>Designing a user interface is outside the scope of that particular document, as was stated in the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;HTTPClient+with+PHP+and+MySQL#HTTPClientwithPHPandMySQL-BuildingTheUI">Building The UI</a> section. Instead, try working through <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Designing+the+User+Interface">Designing the User Interface</a> to discover this information.</p>

										<p><p>@paul - I have a few suggestions about the API Docs, Wiki and other tutorials.</p>
<ul>
<li>A long tutorial about making a twitter client is not really useful for newbies. I would rather prefer to have few small tutorials highlighting the use of specific controls, or to make a simple form, or to create a menu, etc.</li>
<li>Regarding API Doc, I think it is still not 100% complete. For example I wanted to create a Password field and I could not find any option for it. A search in Google revealed the <code>passwordMask</code> property. Then I went back and checked the API Doc, and it is not mentioned there.</li>
<li>It would be nice if we could have a small example code for each control in the API Docs, like jQuery API Docs.</li>
<li>The Wiki left menu is arranged in alphabetical order. Which is good if you know what you are looking for. But for beginners, it would be better if it progresses from basic topics to more advanced ones.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just my 2 cents</p>

										<p><p>@paul - I am sorry, I missed these points in my previous comment</p>
<ul>
<li>I am supposed to be working on Android only, and many times I find that a certain feature is available in iPhone but not in Android (Like Dashboard). The autocomplete is of no help as it shows it as available in Android. I understand that there are differences, but it would be nice if I knew in advance. Could have saved many hours of research.</li>
<li>For the same point above, it would be nice to have a list of all the features which are not there in Android but are available in iPhone, and vice versa.</li>
<li>Moreover, most of the tutorials target iPhone (maybe because iPhone emulator is faster) and I am always uncertain if the same will work in Android or not.</li>
</ul>

							<p>Thanks. I downloaded it, imported it. It shows me some black window with &quot;com.appcelerator.kitchensink&quot; stuff in there. </p>
<p>I click &quot;Save Changes&quot;. </p>
<p>It shows me a message on top right, &quot;Your changes have been saved&quot;. </p>
<p>Then what? This window just stays there. What now? Where do I start? </p>
<p>Would appreciate a simple starting tutorial that explains how to use this thing, how the different functions and features work, etc. Something that&#39;s a little smarter in its construction than the crap &quot;Getting Started Guide&quot;. </p>
<p>Thanks much. </p>
