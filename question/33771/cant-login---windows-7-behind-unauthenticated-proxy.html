			<h1>Can&#39;t login - WIndows 7 behind unauthenticated proxy</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Seems to be lots of questions on this but few answers - particularly with reference to unauthenticated proxy on Windows. Any ideas how I can get to 1st base (ie login!)?</p>
<p>I am behind an unauthenticated proxy. IE is configured to use it, and works. Is there anywhere I can configure proxy settings for Titanium Dev 1.2.1 ?</p>

							<p>There&#39;s half a dozen support queries in here asking how to configure a proxy, and no satisfactory response.  Pretty poor.  You&#39;ll find lots of people wanting to try your tool in a corporate environment are stuck behind hideous proxy servers and will give up if you make it this hard.</p>
<p>There&#39;s useless documentation here:<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;installing_on_windows.html#proxy_needs_to_be_manually_configured</p>
<p>No mention of the format for the environment variables is given.  I&#39;ve used the standard format HTTP_PROXY=username:password@hostname:port.  Doesn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>I notice there&#39;s mention of proxies in &quot;&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;appcelerator.xml&quot; but it doesn&#39;t follow any format I&#39;m familiar with: &lt;proxy&gt;@{rootPath}proxy&lt;&#x2F;proxy&gt;</p>
<p>So what say you put some effort into answering these queries?  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s pretty basic.  A GUI or, [gasp], using the already-defined OS-level or Java-level settings would be better yet.</p>

										<p><p>Simon, OP clearly states in bold in his title &quot;unauthenticated&quot;.</p>

<p>There is a guide to setting environment variables on Windows <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;installing_on_windows.html#environment_variables">here</a>, the very same document that you have (attempted) to link to.</p>

										<p><p>Simon, if you have a specific issue, rather than dragging up an old post that is probably no longer relevant to the OP, simply open your own Q&amp;A question. I am sure someone will work through it with you.</p>

										<p><p>The point of this kind of question&#x2F;answer forum is to provide a single definitive answer rather than FAQs getting a thousand separate permutations of the same question.  Still waiting for an answer.</p>
<p>Hal says there&#39;s a guide to setting environment variables.  I know how to set environment variables.  What I asked for was the format of the HTTP_PROXY variable.  Sure, the original poster asked for &quot;unauthenticated&quot;.  But what&#39;s the format for that?  host:port?  And what about for proxies that require authentication?</p>

<p>Have you seen the Q&amp;A search tool?  It&#39;s very useful. You will note that useful, more relevant answers are usually newer, and have nice yellow stars next to them.</p>
<p>The &quot;point of this <strong>kind</strong> of question&#x2F;answer forum&quot; may be exactly as you have stated. However, the point of <strong>this</strong> question&#x2F;answer forum is to have a focused discussion where the OP is helped through to a solution. If the thread dies, as this one obviously has, there is no point dragging it back up. This is because, even if an solution is found, it is doubtful that the OP will return to mark it &quot;best&quot; and hence it will be lost again.</p>
<p>You obviously have good intentions, so I urge you to use them to the maximum effect by opening your own question and ensuring it is followed through to a resolution.</p>

										<p><p>Okay I give up. I can&#39;t be bothered trying your tool, and I suspect others in corporate environments with mandatory proxies won&#39;t either.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
