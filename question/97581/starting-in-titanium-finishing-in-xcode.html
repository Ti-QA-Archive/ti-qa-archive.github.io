			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This project looks awesome compared to trying to learn objective c like I&#39;ve been doing for a while. I have a very specific app in mind that has an open source openGL ES library that I need to use for the app.. or learn how to code it myself, but it is very heavy in image manipulation. </p>
<p>Have there been any advancements in openGL&#x2F;other graphics support with appcelerator lately? </p>
<p>-or-</p>
<p>As I read it, the &#39;front end&#39; compiler takes the javascript and turns it into native code (objective c in my case). Looking in the build folder for the kitchen sink iphone app I&#39;m seeing what looks to be everything xcode would ever want to compile that application. Following this line of thinking, could I build everything initially in appcelerator for this app except the image manipulation part (still need networking, buttons, a lot else), front-end compile it into objective c, then open the build folder in Xcode and take it from there with the openGL library I need?</p>
<p>Any ideas, suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks<br>Josh</p>

							<p>Josh,</p>
<p>While technically you could do that, instead IMHO it would be much better long term to integrate whatever obj C extensions you need into a custom &quot;module&quot;.  Doing so would allow you to continue to manage the rest of the project in titanium, including taking advantage of SDK improvements.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;module_ios.html">Here</a> is a the starting point for how to do that.  You may also want to do a web search (or at least search github) for existing 3-rd party modules for titanium to help give you ideas or code samples.</p>

							<p>That sounds perfect! I was thinking I may also be able to do it with HTML5, but many people seem to navigate away from that way of doing things. Would it be best to stick with the custom module instead of going the HTML5&#x2F;CSS3 route?</p>

							<p>Josh,</p>
<p>That would be my vote, but I&#39;m just a user too looking to create modules to extend titanium for other reasons.  But I&#39;m thinking it gives us the best of both worlds: the RAD benefits of titanium for the bulk of the app, with custom obj C thrown in to cover what is not (yet?) supported in a titanium SDK.  </p>
<p>Personally, I like keeping the application feeling like a native app instead of a web app running locally.</p>
<p>YMMV.</p>
