			<h1>PNG is losing transparency</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I have this really weird issue. I have created an app where i&#39;ve created a &quot;custom tabview&quot;. That means that every &quot;tabs&quot; content is inside a view, and i&#39;ve created buttons at the bottom to control which tab is active. Now, i&#39;ve added a image at the bottom of my window (the main window) to make the design look a little nicer. The image is a PNG with a transparency-gradient that ends with 0% opacity. Now, for every time i change &quot;tab&quot; that gradient is loosing some of its transparency, and after a couple of tab-switches it is almost no transparency-gradient at all. What could cause this kind of behaviour? I don&#39;t do anything with the gradient image when i change tabs at all in the code. It&#39;s just a static picture supposed to be there all the time.</p>
<p>I am running 1.8.0.1 and testing for iOS</p>

							<p>You must add the image over and over again. You have something fishy in the code that doesn&#39;t remove the old image or adds the image again each time you are hitting the tab.</p>
