							<p>Kinetic Media have a few video tutorials for alloy on YouTube.</p>
<p>Each video demonstrates how to complete a particular function in &quot;classic&quot; and Alloy code.  It&#39;s a pity there is no Alloy only option but still a great starting point.</p>

							<p>This is actually something that I am working on now. </p>
<p>In the meanwhile, the TCD (titanium certified developer) and the TCE (titanium certified expert) training is fully updated to teach alloy. </p>
<p>I have been hosting classes online as well as in classroom.</p>
<p>However as far as videos are concerned, I&#39;ll let you know when the videos are done.</p>

							<p>I have some content on my blog <a href="blog.clearlyinnovative.com">blog.clearlyinnovative.com</a> I also have code on my <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aaronksaunders">github account</a> and have posted <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;aaronksaunders">code snippets on gist</a>.</p>
<p>I wrote a sample todo app and a port of the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aaronksaunders&#x2F;alloy_fugitive">fugitive app</a>.</p>
<p>I am working on a book on Alloy &amp; ACS which should hopefully be out in the fall</p>

										<p><p>That is what I have based some alloy code I wrote from. </p>
<p>Doesn&#39;t seem like Alloy is too serious if that is the best we have to learn Alloy?</p>
<p>Should have:</p>
<p>1) Detailed Documentation.</p>
<p>2) Video Tutorials (would be good)</p>
<p>3) Official Demo App like KitchenSink.</p>

										<p><p>Hello Steven, </p>
<ul>
<li>Classic Titanium won&#39;t be away anytime soon.</li>
<li>Alloy is still evolving, so the docs are trying to get in sync with the quick development pace, and that&#39;s the reason there is no videos yet. </li>
<li>AFAIK, The newer version of the courses will include alloy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro</p>

										<p><p>I guess without documentation it is hard to guess if Alloy is easy or really hard to use.</p>
<p>As I find classic mode super easy, as I have setup my own way to write apps, so I can charge clients setup fees for a standard app structure.</p>
<p>I have however created an alloy app, and seemed ok, but I guess the real test will be if it can make a difference on the Andriod platform, as some chalenges are still present using classic mode.</p>
<p>But I pull no punches and will not say something is good, unless I really think so.</p>

							<p>i think there is some info about in in the wiki and there is the documentation: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Alloy_Quick_Start</p>
<p>its a good place to start.</p>

							<p>Maybe if I get harassed enough I&#39;ll resurrect the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeopro.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;forging-titanium">Forging Titanium</a> video series with some Alloy videos. Time, of course, is the resource I have least of though.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Tony</p>
<p>These are the sort of things newbies would like:</p>
<p>1) General Alloy Structure, best practice, so no memory leaks.</p>
<p>2) Table Lists, and child view with Alloy.</p>
<p>3) Animating UI objects in Alloy.</p>
<p>4) Dynamic UI with Alloy.</p>
<p>5) Building a UI with Alloy.</p>
<p>6) Themes with Alloy.</p>
<p>7) Using Models, and the UI with Alloy.</p>
<p>8) Location Services with Alloy.</p>
<p>This should be a good starting list. </p>
<p>Would be great to get some videos from the experts.</p>
<p>Hope you have time!!</p>

										<p><p>{&quot;Sales_pitch&quot;:  &quot;all of the above mentioned things and more are offered in the TCD and TCE courses. Codex Labs, LLC has just announced the January online and classroom schedule. http:&#x2F;&#x2F;training.appcelerator.com&#x2F;schedule &quot;}</p>
<p>Most if not all of these topics are covered in the Alloy example code.</p>

<p>As for Forging Titanium, stayed tuned.</p>
