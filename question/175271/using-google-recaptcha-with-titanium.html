							<p>Hi</p>
<p>A better surely would be &quot;why?&quot;.  Captcha and its derivatives were designed to solve a problem of bots auto filling forms.  I will partially leave out my hatred of these so called &#39;solutions &#39; that simply server to make a bad problem worse for all involved.</p>
<p>Why do you think you need such a thing in your app?  One of your tags suggests <em>authentication</em> however captcha has nothing to do with that sort of security.</p>
<p>As the documentation for captcha itself says;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Protect your website from spam and abuse while letting real people pass through with ease</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Whilst trying to ignore the phallusy of the last part of that sentence - never has a single solution designed to stop less than 1% of users managed to stop genuine people filling in forms due to the often very poorly designed and ill consider versions - those with accessibility consideration are treated even more poorly.</p>
<p>So in short you need a very good reason to use such a solution on a web page - you need a significantly better one to add it to an app.</p>

										<p><p>While I understand your hatred of captcha, it has real value in that you can determine if a post is being made by a bot or a real person.</p>
<p>Just because we are developing outside the browser does not mean that a bot can&#39;t get ahold of the url and send hundreds and hundreds of false posts. It doesn&#39;t need to autofill anything but just mimic the request being sent by my app.</p>
<p>The only other solution is to get the user to login, however, I want to avoid this as I want to make it as easy as possible for the user to send me information. Don&#39;t want to have to send them through the registration, verification process just to send some info.</p>
<p>However, I am considering OAuth as a possible solution, however, that will also require a user to have a Facebook, Google or Twitter account.</p>

										<p><p>I most certainly went off on one there - more than required - but still less than I feel ;-)</p>
<p>The thing to keep in mind is that captcha does not stops bots working on a web page from auto-filling in a form.  So back to the actual issue - stopping people&#x2F;bots from filling in your forms.</p>
<p>I will assume that your app will post data from your app (not inside a web view) to your server that will accept the data and process it.  So this is where the solution is placed and here are some choices;</p>
<ul>
<li>Encrypt the data before it is sent and decode it when received - it if matches superb - process</li>
<li>Add a token to the form that acts as a honey trap, the value of the field does not matter but if it is filled in then the form is not valid - as you would never fill it in and bots fill every field.  BTW this single technique on a web form will mean less than 0.5% of bots get through - without annoying the user and before any encryption.</li>
<li>Add a checksum field or token.  This takes all the data you are passing and runs a sum on it - the result is the token.  The sum is of your making, so they would need to know this.  The best sums change - so if include the day or date in the calculation so the answer is different each time it is sent.</li>
<li>Send a request to the form api with half the info - then a second with the balance, randomise which fields each time for even more honey pot traps.</li>
<li>Add authentication; basic type will get you started and again - make the value change each time but both sides know what that change will be.</li>
</ul>
<p>Five different ways without annoying the user, letting the bots in and without using a login or social oauth solution.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for these suggestions. </p>
<p>Any chance you have info on the encrypting data option? Are you talking SSL?</p>
<p>The last suggestions you said Authentication? What do you mean by that?</p>

										<p><p>I have provided code to show you how these things work - they are both basic examples of each but contain both the JavaScript send and the PHP receive (as the server side script examples)&#x2F;</p>
<p>Simple encoding example, you use this function to return encoded data</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> key = <span class="hljs-string">"SXGWLZPDOKFIVUHJYTQBNMACERxswgzldpkoifuvjhtybqmncare"</span>;

    }

</code></pre><p>To add basic authentication to outbound xhr calls you add a header between the open and send methods</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// create xhr then</span>
xhr<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>open(url);

xhr<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>send(<span class="hljs-built_in">data</span>);
</code></pre><p>Very simple php example of code that forces validation and confirms it passed</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">/*
    same username and password values used on app should be used here
*/
&lt;?php
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (!isset($_SERVER[<span class="hljs-string">'PHP_AUTH_USER'</span>])) {

  }
