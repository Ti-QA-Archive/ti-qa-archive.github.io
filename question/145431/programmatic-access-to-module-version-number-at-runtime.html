			<h1>Programmatic access to module version number at runtime</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve created an Objective-C iOS module using the 2.1.3.GA SDK.  At runtime when my module is loaded, I would like to programmatically access the module version number that was specified in the manifest file of my module.  Is that version number available at runtime, and if so, how do I access it programmatically?  Thanks.</p>

							<p>Hi Art,</p>
<p>it&#39;s not programmatically possible to have the values specified in the manifest available.</p>
<p>I think you might of course just put a method in your module indicating also there the version and just change it there too when your module version changes, but it depends of course on which is your use case.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

										<p><p>By the way, there is a Jira new feature request logged here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-7357</p>
<p>It is still not scheduled, so it will be in case considered for future releases.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Federico.  I had the same idea re: storing the version number in a second place, but was hoping to use the existing one to avoid problems down the road (e.g., forgetting to bump the other one).<br>I would appreciate any pointers to good documentation re: module development, exactly how module code gets combined with the JavaScript to create an app, etc.  The iOS module dev guide is not very detailed and is a bit dated.  Thanks!</p>

										<p><p>I do the same thing  setting a static variable somewhere to check my version at runtime.<br>I agree with Art Thomas, it could be time time to publish a new document (especially with the 3.0 version coming).<br>I learned a lot from the ModDevGuide module on GitHub  but there is still some pieces of the puzzle missing for me.</p>
