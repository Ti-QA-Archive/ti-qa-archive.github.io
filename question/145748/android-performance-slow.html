			<h1>Android Performance Slow</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve started building my first Android app and I&#39;ve noticed that the overall performance is extremely slow and laggy. I&#39;m not testing in the emulator, I&#39;m testing the app on a Nexus 7. </p>
<p>So far I have really basic animations were views slide in from the left or right when you touch a button. I can see it drawling the entire view as it slides in. </p>
<p>Does anyone have any performance tips or is this just how android with titanium is?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<div><p>Can you please provide much more information, as so far you have only posted a small amount of code that simply shows a basic animation.  </p>
<p>So please provide some code that also includes any other views that are related, for example - whatever <strong>viewSpeedtest</strong> is and how big is it and are there any other animations.</p>
<p>Please also provide your Titanium SDK version, your experience of how it works in the emulator (I know you have not tested it there - not sure why).</p>
<p>How much free memory does the Nexus 7 have, how much free storage is left.</p>
<p>Why does your animation start at a left position of 2500, the nexus screen resolution is good - but not that good.</p>

							<div><p>Malcolm,</p>
<p>It starts at left:2500 so that its also off the screen of the nexus 10. The Nexus 7 I&#39;m testing on has 500+ MB of ram free and over 10GB of free storage. I have tested with Titanium 2.1.3 - 2.1.4 and the latest of 3.0. Version 3 is the smoothest so far. I have tried it in the emulator but don&#39;t anymore because it is even slower. </p>
<p>For the bit of code I posted that pretty much it. There are 2 more views viewSpeedtest and viewStats and all the views are blank right now and are the size of the screen, only a background color. there are 3 buttons to cycle through them. It&#39;s pretty basic.</p>

							<div><p>@donovan, i would say to use the comment section now for your points in any answer you fell to discuss rather than putting you comments in a separate answer.</p>
<p>that will help other to explain you better.</p>

							<div><p>From my experience Android is no where near as smooth with animations on Android as it is with iOS. I have taken to minimising animations from my Android builds to help mitigate this.</p>

										<p><p>Not sure why this needed to be <strong>-1</strong>&#39;ed, a bit generic but on the nose.</p>
<p>I am going to <strong>+1</strong> this to bring it back to <strong>0</strong> as the author of the question should have provided much more information.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Malcolm, i don&#39;t know why it has been voted -1 earlier, but any way thanks to consider the reason for generic answer…</p>
<p>Now @donovan: you are doing lot of animation parallel, so that might be a case.. though i also checked that animation in iOS is more smother than android.<br>but yes in android also, can you make them serialize… one after another or at least some milliseconds delay.<br>if this idea works.. then fine. else once i get time i will try some thing new.</p>

							<p>An example of what I have is this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">buttonHistory</span><span class="hljs-class">.addEventListener</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>,<span class="hljs-function">function</span>(e){
    <span class="hljs-tag">viewSpeedtest</span><span class="hljs-class">.animate</span>({<span class="hljs-tag">left</span><span class="hljs-pseudo">:2500</span>,<span class="hljs-tag">curve</span><span class="hljs-pseudo">:Ti</span><span class="hljs-class">.UI</span><span class="hljs-class">.ANIMATION_CURVE_EASE_IN_OUT</span>,<span class="hljs-tag">duration</span><span class="hljs-pseudo">:250</span>},<span class="hljs-tag">function</span>(r){
    <span class="hljs-tag">viewStats</span><span class="hljs-class">.animate</span>({<span class="hljs-attribute">left</span>:<span class="hljs-number">2500</span>,<span class="hljs-attribute">curve</span>:Ti.UI.ANIMATION_CURVE_EASE_IN_OUT,<span class="hljs-attribute">duration</span>:<span class="hljs-number">250</span>});
    <span class="hljs-tag">viewHistory</span><span class="hljs-class">.animate</span>({<span class="hljs-attribute">left</span>:<span class="hljs-string">'auto'</span>,<span class="hljs-attribute">curve</span>:Ti.UI.ANIMATION_CURVE_EASE_IN_OUT,<span class="hljs-attribute">duration</span>:<span class="hljs-number">250</span>}); });
});
</code></pre><p>That slides out a few and slides in another view. But when I touch the button and it does it, the animation is very laggy, its not smooth. </p>
<p>I have another animation were the image is sliding across the background and I can see it going pixel by pixel. Nothing is very smooth.</p>

							<p>@Ashish</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. Putting them one after another didn&#39;t make a difference it was still just as slow. </p>
<p>All the code I have used so far is used in my iOS app and it works beautiful there. I had a friend try it on a Galaxy S3 and it was about the same performance wise. Nothing is really smooth.</p>

							<p>Have you tried using the Traceview tool from Google to identify where the slow down is occurring? It would also be good to know if Traceview works well with Titanium http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;tools&#x2F;help&#x2F;traceview.html</p>

							<p>Anyone has a solution for this? Seeing awful performance on Samsung Galaxy Mega. 3.4.0  Android 4.4.2<br>Do I have to do anything to do hardware accelleration? I think it might be that? I am reading up on it and trying to enable it but no luck so far. Or at least it doesn&#39;t seem so.</p>

							<p>Hello. I have the same issue. In Android the animations are very slow. :(</p>
<p>A full screen view with top:&#39;100%&#39;, then I execute:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">w</span><span class="hljs-class">.animate</span>(<span class="hljs-rules">{<span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">top</span>:<span class="hljs-value"> <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, duration : <span class="hljs-number">500</span></span></span></span>});
</code></pre><p>The animation works but very bad, discontinued…</p>
<p>Is there any way to do this?</p>
<p>Tested in a Galaxy S3.</p>

										<p><p>Actually, I&#39;m having exactly the same problem with a Asus Nexus 7. Simple animations, slides left to right or form top to bottom and performance if far from acceptable for a device with such specifications</p>
<p>Can&#39;t be the code because same app on a Samsun Express (like S3) works very well (as expected) and smooth as butter. So it must be something from the device.</p>
<p>Anyone using Asus Nexus 7 with animations? Any ideas??</p>
<p>The only way I have Asus Nexus 7 to have those smooth animation we&#39;re looking for, is to force 2D acceleration under developer settings, but this is not the solution.</p>
