			<h1>how to handle to much information (database) in titanium alloy?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m trying to make an app that conciste in displaying a parts catalog, the problem that i don&#39;t know which is the best way to handle as much information since there are many items in my catalog.</p>
<p>i had thought of placing a EmbbebedWebView pointing to my url where I already have the information but is not the style i desire, plus I would like it could be works Offline and refresh it when Online.</p>
<p>the other way i thought is to create a new model with an sql adapter but with this my app is too heavy.</p>
<p>i&#39;m using Titanium alloy 3.3. </p>
<p>There is another way ???</p>
<p>From already thank you very much.</p>

							<p>This is an architectural problem at its root.</p>
<p><strong>Who</strong> needs the data?</p>
<p><strong>When</strong> do they need the data?</p>
<p>Do they need <strong>all</strong> the data at the same time?</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Does a user in the backwoods of West Virginia, without any network connection need to be able to lookup 100% of the records?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Does a user on a slow network connection need 100% of the records, or, can he possibly be served a subset of the data?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are business use questions that govern how you look at the architecture of your app.</p>

</code></pre><p>Agreed thats kind of a funky look-and-feel. </p>
<p>You could expose the raw data, same data used to build out your webview, via an api, have native elements in your app for the look and feel, query against that api. </p>
<p>Refer back to your business use questions to be sure this matches.</p>

										<p><p>If your app simply refers to a webview, Apple may not see the &#39;value&#39; in that and ask whats different from that and just opening up Safari and visiting the website.</p>

							<p>First of all, Thank you<br>let me use your example to replay:<br>yes, the user in the backwoods of West Virginia need to be able to lookup 100% of the &quot;records&quot;.<br>the above answer, answer the second one, if there is someone who have a slow connection has the chance to view all the &quot;records&quot; offline, at least all loaded at the last &quot;good&quot; connection.</p>
<p>BUT… yes, is a business question.</p>
<p>I know how to put the records in the ways i told you, just asked if there are a best way.</p>
<p>anyway i think i&#39;ll try to re do my question.</p>
<p>i&#39;ll be back.</p>

										<p><p>Quick tip; next time - please do not create a new answer when your contribution is actually a comment - it confuses things in the future when trying to work out relevance, simply add a comment to the answer it is related to, or if the additional information is a follow up to the question or general information then add it as a comment to your own question at the top.  You are NOT being told off.</p>
