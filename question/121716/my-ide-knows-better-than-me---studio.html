			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me how to turn off the infuriating habit of Studio to put double quotes every time i type just one? (same applies to braces, brackets etc)</p>
<p>There are more times when i want to type just one than 2 and this feature is endlessly making typos for me to debug when i run the code.</p>
<p>This site springs to mind….<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;damnyouautocorrect.com&#x2F;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jez</p>

							<p>Go into preferences =&gt; select &quot;java&quot; from the sidebar =&gt; select &quot;editor&quot; from the sub category =&gt; select &quot;typing&quot; from that sub category</p>
<p>You will now see checkboxes for auto closing element, just uncheck the ones you dont want and click apply</p>

										<p><p>Wait… no it isn&#39;t, that has had no effect.</p>
<p>I do not have a java option on the left hand side, so i choose PyDev, then the rest was the same… however the items are still auto corrected even after a restart of studio.</p>
<p>The place to actually set it, is under Titanium Studio then on the main Editors page under a check box called; &quot;Auto close matching character pairs&quot; (not very obviously ?!?!).</p>
<p>Please Titanium people, don&#39;t make us only use studio, keeping it simple with a text editor and a compiler suits alot of people more than an IDE - I personally don&#39;t like IDEs but i am trying to like Titanium Studio, this is just one of several issues i am running into with it and i have gone back to Titanium Developer on a couple of projects to get them built and in the app store.</p>

										<p><p>Eclipse is punishment for whatever a programmer has done in a past life.  The sheer number of <em>different</em> &quot;Editor[s]&quot; entries on the left hand side is just the tip of the iceberg, and in itself proof that Eclipse was designed deep within the boiling bowels of hell.  Even bring a copy of Eclipse <em>near</em> a UI designer and they will burst, screaming, into flames.</p>
<p>All of which is another way of saying, for the love of all that&#39;s holy, please rethink discontinuing Titanium Developer.  Programmers who still have souls need an option where they can use their own, decent tools, and just hit compile.  Please.  Think of the children.</p>
