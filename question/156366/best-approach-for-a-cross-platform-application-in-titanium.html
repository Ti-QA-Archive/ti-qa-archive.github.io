			<h1>Best Approach for a Cross Platform Application in Titanium</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi Guys, I have developed 1 application in titanium before Alloy was introduced, and now I am about to develop an other one and I am confused to go with Classic or Alloy approach. Kindly let me know the best approach to be taken which is easy to develop and also should help me in performance enhancement, APK or IPA file sizes and also Native UI. Also give me a clarity on differences between Classic and Alloy Development?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>You have asked two main questions and statement;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Native UI</strong> everything you create inside Titanium will be a native UI component, does not matter if it is classic or Alloy</li>
<li><strong>APK&#x2F;IPA</strong> size, easy big apps have lots of code, so bigger files, smaller apps have smaller code so smaller files.  If your app includes lots of images, and other assets the files are bigger, if you provide less the files are smaller.  So the answer is it depends, you should make sure all images are optimised, you should provide as many images as your app needs and not any more.  </li>
<li><strong>Alloy or Classic</strong>, really hard question, made harder by you having already created an app without Alloy, this answer to this is dependant on YOU.<ul>
<li>Alloy makes you think about HOW you plan your app and how you create the UI, code and layout elements in more defined re-usable way.  For example if you create a lot of labels and they are usually black in colour, sized to Ti.UI.SIZE then you can add this information into a single app wide stylesheet and only ever need to set those parameters if you want something slightly different.  So if you later choose to make the labels dark grey, the ONE change updates them all - very powerful</li>
<li>Alloy focuses re-use on code, you can create re-usable widgets that are sets of code that are run more than once, but have their own style sheets, views and controllers.  This means if you use something more than once you should be doing it once but referencing it twice.</li>
<li>Alloy is a different way of doing things, all the same things are available but you place things in different places and reference things in different ways.</li>
<li>Alloy IS classic it just manages the app separation for you, it compiles to classic code that is actually run.</li>
<li>Classic can seem easier to write in the short term, you only have to edit one block of code to add a label with some presentation and an event listener.  With Alloy you have to edit three files to achieve this.  Which appears harder, but in reality it is not as much of what you create has the same UI, for example you have three labels that all look the same you only define the look ONCE, each of the three inherit that look.</li>
<li>It you had NEVER done a project before then I would say Alloy, it helps you define better practises.</li>
<li>As you have already created an app before without Alloy you will find it harder to start an Alloy project as you are used to how it was before.  However the time used learning the basics of the Alloy structure (remember the code part is the same, the properties are the same, the methods are the same) may be worth spending as your app development will improve in speed and always the need to track done bugs should be less if you take advantage of the re-use options.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In short unless you have to deliver a project in a very short time frame, I would suggest your next project be Alloy, the trade off for the learning curve should be repaid by the improvements to your coding style.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you so much Malcolm actually now the time frame is very short so will prefer the classic approach, but since Alloy seems to be worth for rapid development before I start  the next after this I shall simultaneously get familiar to Alloy.</p>

							<p>Alloy is the way to go.  There is really no difference between the two but Model View Controller structure of Alloy versus Classic that does not have this structure.  Having the styles separated out in .tss files means that you can just simply copy the .tss into other widgets and&#x2F;or controllers.  This means that your app will easily have the same look and feel with minimal effort.  Also, probably the best feature of Alloy is backbone&#39;s Model integration.  Finally you can easily segment parts of your app into widgets and you can easily instantiate whenever you need in your application.  Alloy has a learning curve though so be prepared but you will find it so much easier maintaining your code and making stylistic changes.</p>
