			<h1>inappbilling : How to restart launchPurchaseFlow?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m working with inappbilling module. Everything went smooth except one case not covered by the sample code:</p>
<p>When a user initiate any purchase action, the Play Store purchase view will pops up, since there&#39;s no cancel button in that view, so if a user decide to cancel, he naturally clicks anywhere outside the Play Store View and the View disappears. However this event is not caught by the &#39;purchasecomplete&#39; event listener, which results in a background launchPurchaseFlow. As a result, when user initiate purchase action again. An uncaught error will occure: &quot;Can&#39;t start async operation (launchPurchaseFlow) because another async operation(launchPurchaseFlow) is in progress.&quot;</p>
<p>My question is: Is there anyway to catch this implicit cancel action? If not possible, how do I terminate the background operation when user wants to make purchase again?</p>
<p>Currently I need to kill the app for being able to make purchase again.</p>

							<p>I figured it out.<br>Seems I lost focus on the object that has the eventlistener &#39;purchasecomplete&#39;.</p>
<p>I had a window with all the in app billing code. The window has a &#39;buy&#39; button. After clicking that button I did a window.close() right after the call InAppBilling.purchase({….});</p>
<p>Closing the window made the cancelling of the user disappear in thin air ;-)<br>The cancel wasn&#39;t handled and that is why the Purchase Flow wasn&#39;t ended correctly.<br>A new purchase call ended up in the exception about an async operation that is in progress.</p>
<p>Be sure the purchase flow can return to the eventlistener &#39;purchasecomplete&#39; and you will be fine.</p>
<p>Hope this will help</p>
