		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have been playing with Titanium Developer for a few days…</p>
<p>I see the great effort and when it works it looks good - but the problem is it does not work for the most part :(</p>
<p>I have installed Titanium on the Mac and Windows XP and I have not been able to get the KitchenSInk app to load and work properly! And I know it is not just me - just searching thru these blogs shows that there are a number of people struggling with the same issues as I (e.g KS not loading, Android Emulator not loading&#x2F;working)</p>
<p>I have posted several times in the Q&amp;A - but have received no responses :(</p>
<p>Unless these issues are fixed (and copying over android.py is NOT a solution) - I simply cant see myself signing up for the $200&#x2F;month&#x2F;user plan or any plan for that matter.</p>
<p>A very disappointed developer :|</p>
<p>Srini</p>

							<p>I can certainly appreciate your frustration when stuff isn&#39;t working.  KS is sort of the goto app for answering a lot of developer questions. This Q&amp;A blog-forum is primarily for User-to-User.  The Appcelerator team will randomly pop in to reply to something, but in the current incarnation of their business plan, Premium or Enterprise Support is the defacto way to get guaranteed 24-48 hour customer support.</p>
<p>One&#39;s feeling about if that is cool or not aside, I can tell you that Premium support has been a Godsend for me.   While I was freaking out two weeks ago to get my first iPad app up on the store, the guys were elbow deep in helping me with code and keeping me from jumping out a window.  The few issues that remain, they work through to get to usable solutions. And often it was more like a few hours than 48.  If you have a project that &#39;needs&#39; to get out, Premium support is well worth the monthly or annual fee that you will pay.  Beats the hell out of hitting your head on the desk wondering why something isn&#39;t doing what it is supposed to.</p>
<p>B.</p>

							<p>Brendan,</p>
<p>Thanks for your response and perhaps Premium support is the way to go.</p>
<p>I am just frustrated with companies&#x2F;products that put out more hype than product. Why put out obviously broken code &amp; sample and tout &quot;free&quot; and open source when even the sample apps dont work as advertised? Unless, of course, premium subscribers get to download a different version of the IDE or sample code…</p>
<p>Oh Well!</p>

							<p>I absolutely agree with Brendan about Premium support. VERY well worth the money. Quick responses, even to completely knucklehead questions.</p>

							<p>yeah i agree to your point that the new appcelerator has some issues with the KS import but other than that i cant go with your point as the emulator works fine and the android.py replacement did work for me after all… and the android loading and emulator working issues has been fixed as far as windows is concerned as i had the same problems earlier .i was able to fix th &quot;loading&quot; and emulator not working issues with the formus help..</p>

							<p>Ravi,</p>
<p>Thanks for your comments and I am glad it is working for you.</p>
<p>I <strong>did</strong> copy over the android.py file and recreated the project - but the emulator for Android is <strong>still blank</strong>. I have only tried this on Snow Leopard. On Windows XP, I am not able to find the Android.py file and I have searched the entire drive! </p>
<p>Update: I did find the android.py file on XP (the directory is hidden by default *&amp;^%%$#)</p>

							<p>Just something to try, to resolve the blank &quot;Test &amp; Package&quot; screen..</p>
<ul>
<li>close TiDev</li>
<li>delete everything inside your ~&#x2F;.android&#x2F;avd&#x2F; directory</li>
<li>start TiDev</li>
<li>go to your project&#39;s Edit page and simply &quot;save changes&quot;</li>
<li>launch your app. It took 3 attempts to launch, but then it worked fine</li>
</ul>
