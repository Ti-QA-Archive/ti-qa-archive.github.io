							<p>Same problem, the first time app was launched it worked fine, now without any code change it doesn&#39;t work anymore, even with a rebuild to my iPad. </p>
<p>Sometimes the main window is loaded after waiting 2-3 minutes with the splash screen showed. After this the app is not responding anymore.</p>
<p>Any help?</p>

							<p>I&#39;m unable to release my app for ipad.. I spent several days to optimize to new sdk 2.0 and now I can&#39;t release due to this critical bug.. Please Appcelerator team take a look to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-8516">this bug tracker</a>, it is opened since Apr 04 and not yet fixed..</p>

										<p><p>@Stefano di luca Are you launching your iPad app in iOS 4.3? I ask because the target environment described in that Jira ticket is limited according to your issue.</p>
<p>When I sent https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-8516 I meant to explain that this issue its reproduced only at certain scenarios. Otherwise you will need to create a jira ticket around your problem.</p>

										<p><p>No, I&#39;m launching on 5.1 but I tried with 4.3 and others too.<br>The problem is the same and I think is related to some change in new Titanium sdk independently from the iOS version.</p>

							<p>@Eduardo Gomez I distribute app to Apple App Store  and receive this :</p>
<p>&#x2F;&#x2F;——</p>
<p>We found that your app exhibited one or more bugs, when reviewed on iPhone 4 running iOS 5.1, on both Wi-Fi and cellular networks, which is not in compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines.</p>
<p>When the app was launched, the splash page was displayed indefinitely. Please see the attached screenshot for your reference.</p>
<p>The steps to reproduce are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch the app.</li>
<li>The splash page is displayed indefinitely.</li>
</ol>
<p>For discrete code-level questions, you may wish to consult with Apple Developer Technical Support. Please be sure to:</p>
<ul>
<li>include the complete details of your rejection issues</li>
<li>prepare any symbolicated crash logs, screenshots, and steps to reproduce the issues for when the DTS engineer follows up.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#x2F;&#x2F;——</p>
<p>I think it&#39;s related to this issue, please resolve it. Thank you</p>

										<p><p>@Tong Qingfeng Thanks for bringing it to our attention.</p>
<p>We created <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-9090">TIMOB-9090</a> as a part around this issue. However it still requires a full reproduction case to address this ticket. The warning is being taken care of as part of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-9002">TIMOB-9002</a>. </p>
<p>Would be very useful having a reliable reproduction to dig into this. Feel free to email me any comments, concerns  you may have or any other outstanding issues. </p>
<p>My mail is: egomez@appcelerator.com</p>

							<p>Bump this issue, every new application I start to build is returning this warning.</p>
<p><code>[WARN] Timing out waiting on main thread. Possibly a deadlock?  in TiThreadPerformOnMainThread (TiBase.m:238)</code></p>
<p>However I am not getting the stuck splash screen as some are suggesting they are getting, the app always launches, but this warning also always shows.</p>
