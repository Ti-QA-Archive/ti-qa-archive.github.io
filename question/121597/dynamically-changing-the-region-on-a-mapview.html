			<h1>dynamically changing the region on a mapView</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a mapView that centers to the users current view. There is a slider that can be used to zoom in or out from 5-50 miles radius of the users current location. I am using setLocation instead of zoom because I want the screen to only show the radius in miles around the user.</p>
<p>The problem is the slider changes the map region for only 5, 10, 15, and 30 miles.  For some reason the mapView does not update for 20, 25, 35, 40, 45, or 50 miles.  I&#39;m thinking it is a problem with the math logic, but I have been racking my brain for days on this to no avail.</p>
<p>If someone has any idea or suggestions on how to get this working or even a better way to do it, I&#39;d be very grateful!</p>
<p>BTW - I have tried toggling regionFit on the mapView and it doesn&#39;t seem to make a difference.</p>
<p>You can put this code in an empty Titanium project to see the issue.</p>

							<p>David,</p>
<p>I build your project and I see what you&#39;re talking about, but it doesn&#39;t have anything to do with your code. This is a map restriction. You can see this by visiting google maps using the zoom function on the map controls. You will notice that each zoom out matches the zoom outs that are available within your control. So your map will only zoom to positions where you meet your own requirements as well as the map restrictions. Does that make sense?</p>

										<p><p>Anthony,<br>First of all, thanks for your response! I understand what you mean about Google having pre-defined zoom levels. They can only provide a certain number of tile images - that makes sense.  </p>
<p>So, if I changed my code to use the mapView.zoom method, how could I determine how many &quot;miles&quot; spanned the screen bounds each time I clicked a zoom in&#x2F;out button, ie the miles from left side of the screen to the right side; and the miles from the top of the screen to the bottom?</p>

										<p><p>Unfortunately you&#39;re kind of bound by Google on that one. They have a matrix somewhere in the Maps API Docs that tells you what the zoom levels equal. Armed with that knowledge, you&#39;d have to make sure that you zoom out accordingly based on the radius that needs to be displayed within your map view.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ve been doing a lot of research and dug up a great post about the different zoom levels (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;troybrant.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2010&#x2F;01&#x2F;mkmapview-and-zoom-levels-a-visual-guide&#x2F;).  However, knowing the pixel positions for each zoom level is only useful if you know what zoom level you are at. </p>
<p>Can the zoom level can be determined by the latitudeDelta&#x2F;longitudeDelta?</p>

										<p><p>Not offhand, no. You&#39;d have to re-engineer some of that pixel math in order to get that figure. That might be quite an exercise, or at least it would be for my 10 year old calculus skills.</p>
