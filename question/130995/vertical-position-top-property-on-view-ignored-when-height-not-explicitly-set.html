			<h1>Vertical position &#39;top&#39; property on view ignored when height not explicitly set</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m new to Titanium and noticed that adding an image view to the window results in a vertical center position even if the &#39;top&#39; property is set to a value not being the center. So for example top: 10, results in the view being positioned at the vertical center of the window. Finally I found the reason to be the absence of a value for the &#39;height&#39; property of the image view. Only setting the height property to an explicit value resulted in a correct vertical position. Why is the height property mandatory on an image view in order to have the top (or bottom for that matter) property to work as expected. Can&#39;t the image view determine its own dimensions based on the actual image file which it represents.<br>Just curious why.</p>

							<p>The image view can determine its own dimensions. You don&#39;t have to set the height property to a point value, but if you want it to determine its own height, you do have to set the height value to &#39;auto&#39;. Doing this will ensure that no matter what layout system you are using in your parent view, layout properties like top and left will calculate properly.</p>

							<p>Anthony thank you for your answer. Can you explain why an image is centered (vertically) if the height property is absent. The image is displayed with the correct dimensions so the ImageView must have a notion of its dimensions even without the &#39;auto&#39; qualifier. I would prefer the width and height to be &#39;auto&#39; all the time unless explicitly specified. I know I have to understand Titanium a bit more but since I have developed applications in Flex an Objective-C, I find it a bit odd. Anyway thanks for the answer.</p>
<p>Brgds,<br>Eduard</p>
