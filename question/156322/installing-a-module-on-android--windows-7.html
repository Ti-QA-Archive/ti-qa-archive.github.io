			<h1>Installing a Module on Android / Windows 7</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Greetings Ya&#39;ll,</p>
<p>Love titanium on both my MAC and my windows 7 machine.<br>Currently working with 3.1.2 and the latest Android SDKs.<br>I am having a stupid time trying to get the Ti.Android.sms module to install on my windows machine. </p>
<p>I have tried to find where to put it both globally as well as per app and everything I have done is completely wrong. I have tried C:\programdata\titanium but there is no titanium directory in that directory. I have tried to place the files from the zip directly into the app but that doesn&#39;t seem to work either. </p>
<p>I have looked at walk through after walk through and just can&#39;t get it .</p>
<p>Anyone got any ideas on what I am doing wrong? This is maddening and I have been trying to get this module installed on my win 7 machine. I have a default installation of titanium because I don&#39;t like to move things so I can get help from you guys …</p>

							<div><p>John. Did the suggestion from Kosso work for you? I have tried this before and it didn&#39;t work for me. My basic problem is that I get a &quot;module not found&quot; message when I attempt to run my mobile project.  I&#39;ve been dealing with this issue for months off and on. I&#39;ve tried most of the suggestions that I&#39;ve gotten from here and none seems to work. There is a wealth of documentation on the subject but some is contradictory. Much of it is out of date (if you want some links I can forward them to you). For example, a suggestion may say to click on a tab, but that specific tab is no longer part of Studio but rather some ancient version like 1.1. The bulk of the newer documentation says to create a  &#39;classpathentry&#39;  in the module folder to indicate where any module .jar files you&#39;ve included are located. No included .jar files, no entry in .classpath.  The only other thing to do, according to docs, is to create a module node in tiapp.xml indicating the presence of the module to the mobile project. That is:<br>&lt;modules&gt;<br>    &lt;module version=&quot;(version #)&quot; platform=&quot;android&quot;&gt;com.example.modname&lt;&#x2F;module&gt;<br>&lt;&#x2F;modules&gt;<br>One comment posted here suggests that this node should be placed outside the &quot;android&quot; node in the tiapp.xml file.  If you find a solution I would really appreciate hearing about it. </p>
<p>By the way, if you are contemplating obtaining more consistent tech support,  Appcelerator has two options, 1) apply for a &#39;partner&#39; relationhip but not everyone is accepted! and 2) Get a support contract for $15000 per year! Clearly Appcelerator doesn&#39;t want to be obligated to supporting customers.</p>

							<div><p>FYI. I tried this suggestion and it worked! That is, I no longer get the build error &#39;com.example.modname not found. &#39;However, I still get when running app on phone. One point of confusion regarding the module id is that in the module folder it is under &#39;…..\com\example\modname&#39; not &#39;…..\com.example.modname&#39;. I found no documentation explaining this.John, hopefully this one step will work for you as well. regards</p>

							<p>One way of doing it (just for this app) is to create a folder in your project root folder called &#39;modules&#39;, then another within that called &#39;android&#39;, then copy the actual module folder (&#39;com.what.ever&#39;) in there. </p>
<p>Empty the the build&#x2F;android folder to force a clean build and give that a try. </p>
<p>(You did try a clean build, right?) </p>
<p>Also, have you defined it in the tiapp.xml file in the &lt;modules&gt; section?</p>

							<p>Everyone,</p>
<p>thanks for the help. We managed to get it working with Kosso suggestion.</p>
<p>What a pain though. </p>
<p>There are some serious contradictory stuff on the documentation when it comes to modules etc. </p>
<p>My partner is the one that figured it out so I will talk to him and see what he did and hopefully be able to post the results. </p>
<p>Thanks<br>john</p>
