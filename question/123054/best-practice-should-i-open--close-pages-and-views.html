			<h1>Best Practice: Should I open / close pages and views?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi All,<br>Bit of a newbie code structure question but I hope you can help.<br>When moving between .js pages&#x2F;windows, should I close one before opening the next?</p>
<p>Example: I have 3 pages&#x2F;windows in my app:<br>Home (app.js)<br>About (info.js)<br>Game (play.js)</p>
<p>Imagine that the user is on the Game page (play.js) and in that page they click on the About button (which loads info.js). Should I first try close Game.js then open About.js or the otherway around, or do I even need to do that? </p>
<p>I&#39;m assuming I need to do something to stop the views &amp; windows piling up and draining memory? </p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Lee</p>

							<p>I assume that your are using a TabGroup with child windows defined in separate js files, as in the Kitchensink app. If that is the case, just three root windows as you describe should not pose a memory management issue that Titanium cannot handle automatically.</p>
<p>The memory management stuff becomes more crucial when you have, lets say, a window, with controls which open another window, and perhaps you are updating and loading new views, or tableViews. All of this UI objects consume memory, and they need to be closed to release that memory at some point. In any case, when you close a window, all views in the window are released from memory.</p>
<p>There are UI objects, such as Tabs or Navigation groups, which do some window management for you. When you open new windows in a Tab or Navigation group, you have the &#39;back&#39; button displaying automatically. When you click on the button, the window is closed for you, releasing its memory footprint.</p>
<p>But if you open windows and views manually, not using navigation groups or tabs, you have to be more careful and close them when no longer needed. Specially Tableviews can take a lot of memory…</p>

							<p>Wow, thanks for the indepth response, that is really helpful.</p>
<p>Yes, I figured that when using tabs, the memory is released automagically.</p>
<p>As you mentioned, I am also opening new windows manually and will now close them when they are no longer required. </p>
<p>1 final question if you don&#39;t mind (more for curiosity than anything else!).</p>
<p>Assume that I have 3 pages&#x2F;views: 1.js, 2.js and 3.js. Now assume that each page has a button to each of the 3 pages and I manually open 1, then 2, then 3, at this point all 3 views&#x2F;pages are open in the stack. </p>
<p>If, in 3.js, I press the button to open 2.js again, does that reshuffle the stack i.e. it pulls 2.js to the foreground, or does it open a new instance of 2.js, so in effect now we have 4 views in the stack?</p>
<p>Hope that makes sense!?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Lee</p>

							<p>Every time you are using:<br>For win0</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var win1=<span class="hljs-type">Ti</span>.<span class="hljs-type">UI</span>.createWindow({url:<span class="hljs-symbol">'win1</span>.js'};
win.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span><span class="hljs-literal">()</span>;
</code></pre><p>You are opening a window in its own execution context. This means that the &#39;originating&#39; and &#39;created&#39; windows do not share namespace and do not have access to each other. And , in your example, you&#39;ll have 4 windows in the stack.</p>
<p>So a a button opening win0 from win1, is creating a win0 in a new execution context, different from the original win0, even if both &#39;win0&#39; would share a &#39;win0.js&#39;. This is not very advisable anyway, and you definitely would have to handle the closing of this windows, but it would probably become very messy. </p>
<p>If you wouldn&#39;t be creating windows with a file.js url (which creates a new execution context), then the approach would be more sound. I am not sure about this, but I think you still need to close the previous instance of win0, because I think it doesn&#39;t get garbage collected. </p>
<p>Anyway, if you are accessing the same windows, within the same execution context you could always show them and hide them instead of creating them, while keeping object references.</p>
<p>Glad to help.</p>
