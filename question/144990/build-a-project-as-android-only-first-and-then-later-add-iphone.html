							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The short answer is yes.</p>
<p>The slightly longer answer is yes - but you will need to tweak your code to deal with any Android specific functions that Titanium offers so they will work on iOS.  Also you would then make some functional and visual changes to take advantage of the way iOS works or just simply differs from the way Android does things.  In practice these are generally a small proportion of your app and careful planning at the original design phase will let you understand how you will deal with divergence when you eventually have to code for it.</p>
<p>Titanium is cross platform by design, so the core code you create will will work on both platforms.</p>

										<p><p>Supplemental yes - when a project is created some magic occurs in the .settings. In the setup of the project on the mac, you may have to create an empty project, matching the appid and guid, ticking android and ios support, then copy your source files into the project. Its no big deal.</p>

							<p>As Malcom said the answer in yes, but here you have some advices:</p>
<p>As a good practice… if while developing only for android you take a look at the methods you use and you see they are both for iPhone and Android, then you won&#39;t have a big problem when adding iPhone support. Another basic advice is for file paths… there are ways to do &quot;require&quot; paths and &quot;image&quot; paths etc. that work both for android and for iPhone. Do requires from the resource folder and they will work for both.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> myFarmConstructor = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'mylibrary/buildings/farm'</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">//mylibrary folder is in the resources folder</span>
</code></pre><p>Relative paths work for android, but not for iphone if i don&#39;t remember badly. For the images and files use the resources dir from the Titanium library and then add the absoulte path from it:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">
<span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> resDir</span> = Titanium.Filesystem.resourcesDirectory;
<span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> myIconPath</span> = resDir+ 'images/icon.png';
</code></pre><p>If you do these 3 basic things, you&#39;ll only have platform specific problems…</p>
<p>Ah… there is another thing left. Watch out for events. Some of them have different structure when they come  from android or iphone.</p>
<p>Use JSON.stringify to take a look at them:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">         alert<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">JSON</span>.stringify<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">event</span>)</span>)</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>For example… the height and width of a photo taken from the mobile camera are stored in event.media.height in iPhone but they are stored in event.height in android.</p>
<p>Good luck. I went from android only to iPhone too so i&#39;ve got some basic experience about this ^^</p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>

							<p>Why do you even want this? If i were you i should develop an android application without titanium.<br>simple just looks at the popular tags at the home page of Q&amp;A. The most problems are on the android platform.</p>

										<p><p>Whilst you are very welcome to your opinion your argument is outdated, it is true that the Android side took some time to catch up to level of iOS support in Titanium, that has not been true for some time.</p>
<p>The question specifically relates to creating an app that will end up on both platforms and I can think of no better system.</p>
