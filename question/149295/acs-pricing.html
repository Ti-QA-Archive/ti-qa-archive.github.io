			<p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve just registered, looked at the API doc, downloaded&amp;installed TI, played around with a few apps. appcelerator seems to provide great features, the REST API is crystal clear and well documented, cloud services seem great too. </p>
<p>However, I think that I&#39;ve spent more time digging deep into this web site and google, to find clear and simple pricing information. How come is it more complicated to get basic pricing info than it is to parse a Yahoo weather REST response ?</p>
<p>Has anyone gotten his hands onto the details behind  &quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;plans-pricing&#x2F;&quot; ? what exactly is shipped with the free tier, standard, enterprise extensions, etc… ? what modules are delivered for free, are some meant to be used for dev, and billable for live apps ? Where does the B2C&#x2F;paypal module come in and at what price ?</p>
<p>Why in the whole world do I have to ask such a basic question about pricing on a dev forum ?</p>
<p>-A</p>

							<p>@Nick: Confusion arises from the fact that there&#39;s a page called pricing, and there is no pricing whatsoever. If you go to a grocery shop, and there&#39;s no price tag on goods, then you&#39;re confused. And even more so when the store manager asks you &quot;Why are you confused ?&quot;. Just like he expects you to pack stuff, and figure it out on check out …</p>
<p>If you do know the answer, please feel free to add urls:<br>Do you know where I can find a module break down for the price plans offered ?<br>What is covered exactly under &quot;Appcelerator Enterprise Extensions&quot; ?<br>On the Cloud service here http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;cloud&#x2F;key-features&#x2F; which are part of tier 1 package and can be used in production apps under the same tier agreement.</p>
<p>thanks !<br>-A</p>

							<p>Where is your confusion if I may ask ?  Free tier gives a huge amount of storage, api calls, push notifications etc as described.  There are further FAQ about overages at the bottom of that page. Additionally most Ti supplied modules were recently open-sourced. Checkout the Appcelerator blog for more details. 3rd party modules are available from the marketplace (link at top), these are priced by the third-parties themselves.</p>
