			<h1>Mobilesdk install under /Library or ~/Library on OS X?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I inherited a coworker&#39;s Mac running an old beta (0.8) of the mobilesdk. So several weeks ago I downloaded and installed a fresh copy of Titanium Developer 1.2.1 (plus SDK 1.4).</p>
<p>I had many problems building and running, and finally figured out that there was still an old copy of the 0.8 beta mobilesdk in &#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx, even though my new sdk&#39;s were installed in ~&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx (i.e., the beta was installed in the Library at root [&#x2F;] but my new ones were installed in the Library in my user directory [~&#x2F;]). After clearing out the mobilesdk directory on the root Library, everything was fine.</p>
<p>When Titanium SDK was upgraded to 1.4.1 and 1.4.1.1, it auto installed correctly to my user directory&#39;s Library.</p>
<p>Today, when 1.4.2 auto installed, it installed back in the root Library.</p>
<p>Can someone tell me which is correct? Should the mobilesdk be installing at &#x2F;Library or ~&#x2F;Library? Does it matter if some sdk&#39;s are in one and some in the other? In both cases, my account has read&#x2F;write permissions but the admin account has read-only access. That doesn&#39;t sound right for something in &#x2F;Library.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>Hi Lou,</p>
<p>As far as I know the correct path for all of the different mobilesdk versions should be &#x2F;Library. That&#39;s where they&#39;ve always been on my Mac&#39;s anyway.</p>

										<p><p>If you select Get Info on the folder in the Finder, are you the only one that has read&#x2F;write permissions? That&#39;s what I see, and it&#39;s a problem when 2 different developers log onto the same machine on different days and try to update the SDK.</p>
