			<p>I&#39;m trying to get an app installed on a client&#39;s iphone.<br>I read somewhere the ad hoc isn&#39;t currently supported. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve created a development provisioning profile with mine and my client&#39;s device&#39;s added to it. I&#39;ve taken the app from the &#39;Debug-iphoneos&#39; folder and the .mobileprovision file, zipped them and sent them to my client.</p>
<p>He has installed the profile fine and it says it is verified on his device (settings&gt;general&gt;profiles), the app is in the applications section of itunes but when he syncs it says: &quot;the entitlements are not valid&quot;.</p>
<p>any ideas? its quite frustrating not being able to have him look at the app.<br>cheers guys, loving the 1.0 :)</p>

							<p>Two things to make sure of:</p>
<p>1) that the provisioning profile was in fact dragged on to iTunes </p>
<p>2) that his device id matches what is in the provisioning profile</p>
<p>we do this all the time, so i know it works.  it&#39;s just a question of making sure that everything is correct and is performed correctly.</p>

							<p>Both of those points have been verified. I also tried making a new profile from scratch but that hasn&#39;t helped either.</p>
<p>Any other ideas? </p>

							<p>Instead of using the .app file try using the .ipa file that is created when you use the run on device tab. Have your client drag both the profile and the .ipa to his itunes and sync again. The ipa files are located at &#x2F;Users&#x2F;&lt;yourname&gt;&#x2F;Music&#x2F;iTunes&#x2F;iTunes Music&#x2F;Mobile Applications.</p>
<p>Thanks<br>Todd</p>

							<p>Shot in the dark, but is it possible that his device has an OS older than the one you built your app for?</p>
<p>I&#39;d be surprised if the message showed &quot;the entitlements are not valid&quot; in such a situation, but worth a shot.</p>
<p>I had one user that just couldn&#39;t get my app installed via adhoc and what fixed it was having her iPhone connected to iTunes, double clicking on the provisioning profile, then trying to sync the app again.  Not sure why that gave different results than dragging and dropping the provisioning profile to iTunes but it worked.  Sorry, don&#39;t recall the exact error message she was seeing.</p>
