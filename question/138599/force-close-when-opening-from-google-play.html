			<h1>Force Close when opening from Google Play</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have an Android app that, when opened directly from the store, force closes every single time. When opening through the usual means, it opens just fine. There were some old bugs related to this, but they were supposed to have been fixed in 1.6.x. I&#39;m running 1.8.2.</p>
<p>Is anyone else seeing this? My Google Fu hasn&#39;t turned up much which leads me to believe that I may be doing something wrong, but I can&#39;t imagine what. Any idea what might be going on?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>When you say &quot;force close&quot;, do you mean you&#39;re seeing the message &quot;restart required&quot;?  </p>
<p>If so, see below.  If that&#39;s not the issue, I apologize.</p>
<p>On Android, if a user installs your application and clicks the &quot;open&quot; button on the install dialog, your app will launch, and an alert dialog will pop up, saying &quot;An application restart is required&quot;.</p>
<p>The android market app doesn&#39;t launch applications the same way as the home screen (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.google.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;android&#x2F;issues&#x2F;detail?id=5277">Android bug 5277</a>). Therefore, Android sees it as two different invocations of the app and you&#39;ll have multiple copies of your app running if you open it right after install, press home, and then launch the app again from the home screen.</p>
<p>Titanium&#39;s developers built in the restart dialog to guard against this possibility. But to the user, it does look like an error has occurred in your app, and this is the user&#39;s first experience with your app. Not good. In Titanium 2.0 you have some <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-4941">tools to deal with it</a>.</p>

										<p><p>This is great information, Jason. Thanks. What I actually see, though, is a dialog indicating that my app is not responding with options to Force Close or Wait. That said, I have a sense that some of this might still apply (although I&#39;m not sure why I have that sense).</p>
<p>What you&#39;re describing, if I remember correctly, is what I used to see when I installed the APK from a source other than the market.</p>

										<p><p>Gotcha.  I hoped it would be the easier case.  </p>
<p>I think you&#39;re going to have to strip down your app to isolate the offending code.  It can be a very time-consuming process, I know.  </p>
<p>I had to spend 6 hours once to find that you can&#39;t add a &#39;close&#39; event listener during a window&#39;s &#39;open&#39; event listener (on android – of course, it works on iOS).  D&#39;oh.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

										<p><p>I guess the thing that is hanging me up is that it <em>only</em> happens when launching from the market screen. Everything is peachy when launching from a home screen or the all apps drawer. To me, that screams, &quot;not a code problem&quot;. Or maybe it is and I don&#39;t have a deep enough understanding of the differences in how Android launches app from one place vs. another.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

										<p><p>Ugh.  That sucks.  I did a search of the premium support tickets, and the only things I could find dated back about a year ago around the time of 1.6.  None of them mentioned the underlying cause, just stating that &quot;we have a fix&quot;.  That isn&#39;t very helpful for you.</p>
<p>I hope that I don&#39;t run into this issue myself when we launch in a couple of weeks.  I don&#39;t suppose there&#39;s a way to test a full market install before you make the app public, is there?</p>

										<p><p>I wouldn&#39;t think there&#39;s a way of testing this specifically. The only way to test the market is to enter the market, I suspect. :-) From the fact that I don&#39;t see anyone else complaining about it, maybe it&#39;s isolated to something I&#39;m doing on my home screen. The fact that Android sees that as a separate app could mean that the opening context is different and it doesn&#39;t like something (e.g. my xhr or something like that).</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t going to be fun.</p>
