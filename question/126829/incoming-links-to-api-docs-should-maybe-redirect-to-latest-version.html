			<p>Several times, I&#39;ve found that Googling for something gives you a link to an outdated version of the API. Not a big deal if you notice, of course, but it would make more sense to just redirect the user to the latest version (maybe with a notice at the top similar to &quot;The link you followed goes to an outdated version of the documentation. This is the current version; if you really wanted the old version, click here.&quot;)</p>

							<p>I don&#39;t think that would be good thing, because in newer version problem may be solved, API could be changed, etc.</p>

										<p><p>Actually, that&#39;s exactly why I think it would be a good thing. Here&#39;s a real-world example:</p>
<p>The Titanium.Facebook module for 1.3 has an &quot;isLoggedIn()&quot; method. This method no longer exists in the latest version (the loggedIn property is still there, though).</p>
<p>Unfortunately Googling for Titanium Facebook stuff turns up links to the 1.3 docs. Even worse, calling isLoggedIn() in the current SDK causes a hard crash. I lost some time because of this, actually, since I hadn&#39;t noticed the 1.3 in the browser&#39;s title bar (it&#39;s very easy to overlook).</p>
<p>Sure, having the older docs around would be useful under occasional  circumstances, but the overwhelming majority of people who are searching for stuff are going to want the current API, or so I see it.</p>
