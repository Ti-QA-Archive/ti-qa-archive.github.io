							<p>Hello Lin,</p>
<p>Thanks for your inquiry. If you want to buy a module from Appcelerator marketplace after trial period, Go to &quot;Appcelerator marketplace&#x2F;Purchased products&quot; In your product list you will see your module is showing &quot;free trial expires&quot;. Pointing there will display &quot;Activate Subscription&quot; option. From there activate your product and then rebuild your project with active internet connection. It will verify your module as paid and you are good to go. Don&#39;t follow any guide on &quot;changing the module&#39;s GUID in the manifest file&quot;. That is piracy.</p>
<p>Hope this helps you. Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your answer . I still have a question that when I check my products I found my free trail period has ended serveral days ago. But I can still use it now unexpectly. Is there something wrong ? Because I ever modified guid once for some other reasons . What I worry about is my license will not be verified correctly.</p>

										<p><p>If you want to publish your app, it&#39;s better to use licenced modules. Or you might get &quot;Unlicensed module(s) detected. You must be a subscriber to use one or more of the modules included with this project.&quot; sort of error after some time.</p>
