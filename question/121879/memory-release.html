			<h1>Memory release</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Been around a month since I am struggling to get answers on how the memory release works in appcelerator &#x2F; android. So here are simple questions:</p>
<p>Is Ti.Platform.availableMemory a good way to judge a memory leak? In my application I keep opening and closing windows but ensure all views, images are removed and nulled. I have added a label showing Ti.Platform.availableMemory but get random results both with lower and higher values. It never goes really low but can range between 40,000 and 150,000 and is not moving one way to a lower value.</p>
<p>Fortunately I have not bumped into any force closes &#x2F; out of memory issues just yet.</p>
<p>DDMS on the other hand shows the applicaton PSS starting from 10MB and constantly going up, 300 - 500kb at a time.</p>
<p>Wonder if I am just paranoid about memory not being released or if its the real case? Can some1 throw light on how the android GC works, if it kicks in later or immediately?</p>

							<p>Hi Emrah,</p>
<p>I struggled with the application further, switched all my windows to views. Now my app is a single heavy weight window which calls views as and when neccessary. This reduced the memory footprint of the application significantly. While opening and closing windows, I see a constant rise of memory, the use of views has ensured the application stops taking in more memory after a certain amount of usage. This has been a big relief!! </p>
<p>Just leaving you a message so you may want to consider views in the future…. its totally WORTH it!</p>
