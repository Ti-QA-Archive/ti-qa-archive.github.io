			<h1>Feature request - &#39;Force Rebuild&#39; button and key commands</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Not sure if this is the proper place to make feature requests (feel free to delete if not), but I would love to see 2 features in Titanium Developer:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A button to force delete and recompile the build folder (so rather than having to manually go move the files to the trash and delete them and then come back and build, just hit &#39;Force Rebuild&#39; and it does it).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Key commands for the &#39;Stop&#39; and &#39;Launch&#39; buttons. Being able to launch&#x2F;relaunch via keyboard rather than having to physically click a button would be nice.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Great program, keep up the good work!</p>

							<p>Force Rebuild button would be <em>amazing</em>. Being the fickle little fooker I am, everytime I add new pages&#x2F;content&#x2F;module to my project I full re-build it and doing all that deleting is quite annoying. And with Android it&#39;s just annoying have to save the tiapp.xml file and having it do it itself. A &quot;Force Rebuild&quot; button would just make it much simpler.</p>

							<p>In theory, all you need to do to force a full rebuild is to switch to the Edit tab and click &quot;Save Changes&quot; even if you don&#39;t change any values like the version number.  This will &quot;touch&quot; the tiapp.xml file and update its last modified timestamp.  The build scripts sees this as needing a full rebuild.</p>
<p>In practice, while that is generally good enough, I have seen rare instances where things still did not work right until I cleared out the build directory as well.  But typically this is all you need to do.</p>
<p>Regarding the Stop and Launch keyboard accelerators, I am hoping the forthcoming IDE integration with Aptana will make things easier.</p>

										<p><p>@Doug - Thanks for the tab-switching tip! That definitely saves a little time. I too am optimistic about the new Aptana IDE, but am fairly comfortable working in Coda (as that is where I do most of my web development), so being able to command-tab over to Titanium and hit a key command to build without ever taking my hands off the keyboard would be convenient (and I assume a fairly easy thing to add in a future release).</p>
