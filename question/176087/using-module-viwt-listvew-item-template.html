<p>I have tried to implement instructions on this link <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;noodlecode.net&#x2F;tag&#x2F;titanium-module&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;noodlecode.net&#x2F;tag&#x2F;titanium-module&#x2F; </a> </p>
<p><strong>But i did not get any results.</strong></p>
<p>I am using admob module which is on this link <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_modules&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;admob">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_modules&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;admob</a></p>
<p>Also, you can suggest different approach or any other admob module which is better than current.</p>
<p><strong>Please somebody help me.</strong> Thank you in advance.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>This is a community of people who ask questions and who give answers.  Those who ask questions need help - that is obvious and are likely frustrated as well.</p>
<p>However those who offer assistance;</p>
<ul>
<li>do so for free</li>
<li>do so on their own time</li>
<li>have their own lives</li>
<li>choose the questions they wish to help answer</li>
</ul>
<p>You have asked the same basic question 3 times in 24 hours, that is not something we consider polite.  Ask your question and then wait for any assistance offered.  As your 24 spans both a Saturday and a Sunday it is very likely there is less support out there as many people will be enjoying the day.  In England right now it is a very sunny weekend and so offers many people the opportunity to enjoy some well earned rest from their busy full time jobs.  Providing assistance here is of course in addition to those jobs.</p>
<p>The reason I am annoyed with you is two fold;</p>
<ul>
<li>You asked the same question 3 times in 24 hours.</li>
<li>You just group tweeted to the top 6 experts 6 minutes after asking this question and then merely 4 minutes later sent a series of tweets to each of those people again.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are demanding someone assist you answering your question, you expect an immediate answer, you leave insufficient time for offers of assistance to be given.  Was there really nothing left on your app to complete except this issue?  You are wasting your own time right now.</p>
<p><strong>You were being given assistance</strong> on one of those other two questions before you asked this for a third tine.  Again you are too impatient for an answer.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Because this <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">my</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">third</span> questions <span class="hljs-keyword">about</span> this issue.
</code></pre><p>As if this means you should get more or less assistance than anybody else any faster or slower than anybody else. Having answered 2,643 questions myself I can assure you that nothing gets me more annoyed than an ungrateful, expectant person who whilst is understandable frustrated, cares more about themselves than others.</p>
<p>BTW I read your first question yesterday and <strong>I purposely chose not to answer it</strong>.  I have a problem with an app that needs to push adverts so much in a single app, there are conventions follow them.  In understand the need to make money - but your solution will only annoy those who use your app.</p>
<p>I hope next time;</p>
<ul>
<li>you will be patient</li>
<li>you are grateful</li>
</ul>
<p>I have answered your questions in the past and will do again in the future if this behaviour is stopped.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you for your answer.</p>
<p>I would like firstly to specify my english is not enough to explain myself  so clearly.</p>
<p>You are right but i think <strong>Q&amp;A and DOCS of Appcelerator system</strong> is not enough. </p>
<p>Because of my poor english  i feel bad &quot;that question was not clear enough for answering from anybody &quot; after post to question. If system has got <strong>Edit</strong> or <strong>Delete</strong> sections maybe this problem can be avoided. </p>
<p>IT expenses are quite expensive  in my Country. Despite this my app is free on Android Market but i need to earn money for long use that. I have earned only 3 dolars from last April.</p>
<p>Anyway my ads method is so bored now.  I would like to change that if i find usefull answer.</p>
<p>If you answered to my first question and you could write as below</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">BTW I <span class="hljs-built_in">read</span> your <span class="hljs-keyword">first</span> question yesterday <span class="hljs-operator">and</span> I purposely chose <span class="hljs-operator">not</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> answer <span class="hljs-keyword">it</span>.

</code></pre><p>I could understand and i didn&#39;t ask any more question.</p>
<p>Even so thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>PS:</strong> Be sure that. I spend much more time to solve my question myself before asking question. Because i don&#39;t like ask question for</p>
