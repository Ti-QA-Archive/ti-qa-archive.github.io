			<h1>Application Error (red screen) shows up in distributed app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>The headline says it all, an app we put in the App Store today sometimes show the red Application Error screen to some users, an issue we haven&#39;t been able to reproduce, probably related to trying to access data that hasn&#39;t been downloaded yet.</p>
<p>This is a soft fail, because the app will try to download the data again.</p>
<p>But my problem is that the red Application Error screen show, even though the error message says &quot;Error messages will only appear during development. When your app is packaged for final distribution, no error screen will appear&quot;</p>
<p>So why does it show in our distributed app? Have I done something wrong in the distribution?</p>

							<div><p>Something is definitely wrong if you can&#39;t distribute from within Ti Studio.  Make sure your deployment provisioning profile is visible to Ti Studio first (double-click on it again and make sure it shows up in XCode correctly).</p>

							<div><p>It happened to me as well today. It happened in an app that was downloaded from the APPSTORE, heck. And the red window still comes up. Why in the world????? I used Distribution Provisioning for the AppStore. Should I file a ticket to Jira???</p>

							<div><p>I get this reported with one of my apps from time to time. The final build has to be done in Xcode after initially being built with Titanium Studio as I have to edit a line of an Objective C file which is generated by Ti and would otherwise be overwritten. What can be done to suppress these messages?</p>

							<p>The TI_APPLICATION_DEPLOYTIPE changes to &quot;production&quot; when you distribute it through Titanium Studio. I don&#39;t know why, but it doesn&#39;t change automatically with xcode. It used to (as far as I remember), but you would get those errors even on the appstore if you don&#39;t package it with Studio.</p>

							<p>go to alloy.js file in plugin-&gt;ti.alloy-&gt;hooks folder</p>
<p>in that you will find the following code</p>
<p>deploytype: deployType || cli.argv[&#39;deploy-type&#39;] || &#39;development&#39;,</p>
<p>this will be inside run function</p>
<p>replace it with the following</p>
<p>deploytype: &#39;production&#39;</p>
<p>and bamm you are good to go (P.S you will need to keep switching between the lines when you want to test your build on device and this file refreshes on each build so just keep an eye out).</p>
<p>Happy coding</p>
