		<section>
			<p>My app was built with sdk 1.3.2 several months ago. It works okay as it is. I wanted to use sdk 1.4 when it came out but table views were extremely slow for me. Unfortunately nobody really cared.</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32238&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;1431-tableview-extremely-slow-with-sdk-140#ticket-1431-11</p>
<p>Then version 1.5 came out and the table views seem to be working again for me. Unfortunately the events of the audio player seem to be broken. Looking at the ticket, again nobody really seems to care.</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32238-titanium-mobile&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;2135</p>
<p>I followed the advice, fetched the latest sources from github, compiled the sdk and installed it. Just to find out that now calling AudioPlayer.start() starts playback but freezes the complete app. I wonder if this is a new bug or something in the threading code changed or whatever.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I cannot even stay with sdk 1.3.2 since - at least for me - the app crashes right after the start when using sdk 1.3.2 with iOS SDK 4.2.</p>
<p>Bottom line: I have not only been stuck with an old version for several months now but I cannot work at all anymore.</p>
<p>Any advice?</p>
<p>Michael</p>

<p>I can certainly understand your concern regarding the tableview issue - I think this needs to be chased. By your own admission, though, far fewer people seem to &quot;care&quot; about the audio issue, judging from the number of watchers.</p>

							<p>It is just a little frustrating to wait for new releases, hoping for bugs being fixed and no release really satisfies me. As a developer I know that you easily get bugs into your software. On the other hand we are talking about a company charging quite a lot for professional support. I would expect that features offered in the SDK (i.e. table views, audio player, video player, etc.) all work and that bugs that completely break functionality get fixed in time. I would not care about small glitches or things you can work around. What I do care about is complete loss of functionality.</p>

										<p><p>You shouldn&#39;t answer your own question. Instead, use the comment facility. Doing so makes it easier for others to follow the conversation and also means that you can close the question when it is resolved.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t realize you were a paying customer. In that case, you can simply log the issues with the support helpdesk and they will take priority.</p>

										<p><p>Sorry if this was misleading. I am not a paying customer. All I wanted to say is that even all the paying customers have to live with a software where show-stopper bugs do not get fixed at all. Bugs should get fixed not matter whether or not you are a paying customer. Instead of ignoring non-paying customers they should be happy to have people report bugs and problems helping them to make their software better. I cannot afford paying that much money for developing a free app of course. But even if I was in the position to pay for their support I doubt I would do it since I would not expect too much from it haven been disappointed by software and support for so long now.</p>

<p>Note the quote from <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;plans-pricing&#x2F;">this</a> and <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;titanium-support&#x2F;">this</a> page, &quot;Appcelerator will support installation and configuration issues, and provide priority platform fixes including hot patches and&#x2F;or workarounds to keep your application running everywhere they are deployed&quot;.</p>
<p>Regarding bug reporting, if the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;contribute.html">Contribute</a> guide is anything to go by, it seems that Appcelerator does value the community&#39;s input.</p>
