			<h1>Why are the size of Titanium Showcase apps so small?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>All the apps we develop using Titanium are at least 5.5MB in size.  I understand this is because of the Ti SDK.  However, if I take a look at the size of these Showcase Apps in their market&#x2F;store they are so small.  For example, dialfaster (1.2MB), Oil Reporter (1.64MB), Tradui (1.52MB) on the Android Market.</p>
<p>Does this mean they have abandoned Titanium and gone native development environment?</p>

							<p>I believe it is because they manually remove the libraries not needed.<br>e.g. when you build with xcode, you could look into all the frameworks added and the third party libraries in the resource folder.<br>Removing all that will reduce the app size quite drastic.</p>

										<p><p>If that&#39;s the case how can you exclude libraries using Titanium Studio when compiling for Android for example?</p>

										<p><p>I have only done this with xCode, but I could imagine that you would take a duplicate of your current SDK folder (1.8.2), and stripping the android side down. And clean build with that.<br>When you do a clean build, Titanium uses a python script to include a bunch of .jar files:<br>Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx&#x2F;1.8.2&#x2F;android&#x2F;modules&#x2F;</p>
<p>Titanium is working on their API will be manually required by javascript in the future, but for now everything is included.</p>

										<p><p>sure thing!<br>Please report back.. :)</p>
<p>As said, I have only tried with succes on iOS build. But from my understanding of the build process, this should work.</p>

										<p><p>Yes for now everything is included.. which includes rhino and v8. If rhino is removed from the final apk&#x2F;ipa, the file size can go down to 3.7MB (from 5+). And that is for the start.</p>

										<p><p>Would we need both Rhino and v8?  I guess v8 is dependent on Rhino. I&#39;m still struggling to find a proper way to remove these libraries.  Just trial and error for now…</p>
