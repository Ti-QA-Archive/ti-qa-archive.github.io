							<p>Hi</p>
<p>A hanging splash screen simply means that something in your code that occurs during the start up is broken.  Do not go off and try and remove things before you have performed sufficient tests.</p>
<p>Create a brand new default app and compile this - does that work on your device?  If yes then it is neither the SDK setup or your device.  So it is going to be the code.</p>
<p>If it is the code you need to work out what you added since it last started on the device and comment out that code until it starts again correctly.  When it does then review your code and add back in small section at a time until it no longer works - that section will be the issue.  Either fix it or post it back here as a comment on your own question.  NOT the whole app the bit that causes the error.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Malcolm Hollingsworth,</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion. I tried with a brand new Application just now. It worked well first 2 times . i dint even modify a single line of code. Wheni run it third time it hangs up again.<br>I studied few discussions and followed this link  before i could post here.</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;151737&#x2F;freezes-on-splash-screen-this-is-horrible</p>

										<p><p>Gururaj, mark the answer as correct as it seems it helped you to find the issue.<br>This way you will help other users too -  to take a second look at their code - when they will search for the same problem.</p>
