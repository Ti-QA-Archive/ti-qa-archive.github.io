			<h1>Alloy Migrations - When are they necessary?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>According to the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Alloy_Sync_Adapters_and_Migrations">guides</a>, it is possible to write migrations for the local sqllite database. However, when developing, it doesn&#39;t seem to be necessary. When are the migration files necessary? Should I be specifying them straight from a fresh app? Are they only necessary when doing something custom that alloy doesn&#39;t give you?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>Migrations allow you to update the database in a staged fashion, usually applied to applications that have already been released. For example, you might release version 1 of an application, then ver 2 and 3 are released, each with a migration to the database. However, users might never have loaded version 2, and upgrade right to version 3 of the app. The migrations provide a staged, known path from one version of a database to another. </p>
<p>So you are right, usually might not apply while developing, until after you release something into the wild.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Ray. Would you say it might be best practice to have them there from the beginning before shipping the app into production?</p>

										<p><p>Not really required at all, before shipping. You can add migrations at a later date. Really, if your data schema never changes, you&#39;ll never need a migration anyway… so, just add when required. If you want to remember that migrations should be part of your project, in the future, you can always add the &#x2F;migrations&#x2F; path to your project…</p>
