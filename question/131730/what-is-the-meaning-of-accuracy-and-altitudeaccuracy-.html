		<section>
			<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>The Mobile API Reference for Titanium.Geolocation.location event doesn&#39;t specify what the accuracy and altitudeAccuracy sub properties actually measure… it it meters, feet, or something else?</p>
<p>Thanks  :)</p>

							<p>Sorry for the delay on the doc updates. I had to wait for some pending location changes.</p>
<p>The updated documentation is checked in for the 2.0 release, along with some significant enhancements to GPS on Android.</p>
<p>To avoid confusion, there are several kinds of accuracy values:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Ti.Geolocation.accuracy property is used to specify the level of accuracy you<br>require. This is set to one of the Ti.Geolocation.ACCURACY_ constants. In iOS, this<br>is passed more or less directly to the OS, which tries to satisfy your accuracy<br>requirements. On Android, this is mapped to the distance you need to <em>move</em> between<br>updates (a.k.a. distanceFilter on iOS) rather than accuracy per se, which leads to<br>some confusion in the current implementation.</p>
<p>2.0 will introduce two new accuracy constants, ACCURACY_HIGH and ACCURACY_LOW, which<br>can be used for Android and Mobile Web. On Android, this gives a simple way to<br>configure location updates. Under the hood, the logic is a bit more sophisticated<br>and should yield better results.</p>
<p>2.0 also exposes a set of manual controls for location updates on Android, for more<br>demanding applications where ACCURACY_HIGH and ACCURACY_LOW don&#39;t cut it.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re using the CI builds, you can play with these new modes now. Look at the<br>docs for Ti.Geolocation and Ti.Geolocation.Android for details.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The location event includes accuracy and altitudeAccuracy properties, which as Ivan     said, are in meters. Altitude is also in meters.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There is also a heading accuracy, if you&#39;re using the compass. On iOS and Mobile<br>web, this is the maxiumum deviation, in degrees. Android doesn&#39;t give us this<br>granularity; instead, the values basically correspond to constants indicating<br>high, medium, or low accuracy.</p>
</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>Interesting… right now on my iPod touch, I have accuracies between 80 and 150. It it were degrees, how could I convert that into distance? At first glance, it seems way out… Thanks!</p>

										<p><p>Ah, I made a mistake. I thought that error in measurement is given in same unit as measured thing (altitude unit is degree). I did some search and it seems unit should be meter, but I&#39;ll check that to be sure.</p>

										<p><p>The way I understand this, the Ti.API.ACCURACY_* constants are used to specify what the distanceFilter should be, meaning how often should Location events be generated, based on distance. However, the accuracy number that is returned by the location event specifies how precise the returned location data is. The question is, is that precision a distance or just an &#39;appreciation figure&#39;. </p>
<p>I ask this because in other environments (ex. palm os) the precision number returned by the GPS is an an &#39;appreciation figure&#39; of how precise the data is, based on the number of satellites available, etc.</p>
