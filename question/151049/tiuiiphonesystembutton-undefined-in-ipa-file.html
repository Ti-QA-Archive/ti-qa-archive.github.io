			<h1>Ti.UI.iPhone.systemButton undefined in IPA file</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>When ever I build my IPA file I get errors that the Ti.UI.iPhone.systemButton is undefined. I clean my project and then build the IPA it still happens.</p>
<p>When I run it in the simulator it&#39;s fine.<br>Is there any way to force this package into the build?</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure whats going on here.</p>

							<div><p>Missing from your question are a number of important pieces of information. I suggest you take a look at the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Using+Questions+and+Answers">Using Questions and Answers</a> article, specifically the Q&amp;A Question Checklist.  The missing information is critical to reproducing problems in a test environment and often indicates other factors that cause the undesirable outcome you are experiencing.</p>

							<div><p>stephen, I&#39;m not sure how else to ask the question, the building process of an IPA file does not include the necessary packages, and I get undefined for using iPhone namespaces.</p>
<p>I can post some code, for using Ti.UI.iPhone.systemButton if you like</p>
<p>this will run in the simulator (sometimes)</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> b = Titanium.UI.createButton({
        systemButton:Titanium.UI.iPhone.SystemButton.CAMERA            
    });

    b.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>,<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{

            <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> photo = APP.SUi.SelectPhoto(c,params.itemId);
            photo.open({modal:<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>});

    });
    container.setRightNavButton(b);
</code></pre><p>I routinely am getting messages like this:</p>
<p>Titanium.UI.iPhone.SystemButton&#39; [undefined] is not an object</p>
<p>I clean my project, and a few builds later I get it again.</p>

							<div><p>since you cant seem to be bothered to read the link I posted above, that has a BULLETED list of information types necessary to help you, I am, thus, unable, and honestly, unwilling to help you.  Good luck.</p>

							<div><p>Actually I did read it.  And I&#39;ll point out they are Tips:</p>
<p>Tip: Grab attention, by creating a question title that directly relates to your core issue</p>
<p> English was not my strongest subject and attention grabbing headlines are somewhat subjective</p>
<p>Tip: Stay on topic - explain your problem concisely, but in full.</p>
<p>pretty self explanatory, the crap works when I do a clean build or delete my build directory, but doesnt work when I do an ipa build… that is on topic</p>
<p>Tip: Include all the relevant information in your original post</p>
<p>I thought I did give enough relevant information.  Ti.UI.iPHone.systemButton should never be undefined, its built in</p>
<p>Tip: include a test case; see Creating a Test Case for guidelines. It&#39;s important to wrap it in a markdown code delimiter, &quot;~~~&quot;, to create a code block, otherwise your post will be very difficult to read.</p>
<p>initially I didnt include code, but I did in the second version.</p>
<p>Tip: always include any error or exception messages by copying and pasting rather than explaining it.</p>
<p>I did I said getting routine messages such as Titanium.UI.iPhone.SystemButton&#39; [undefined] is not an object</p>
<p>Tip: always include the trace log for the emulator or device.</p>
<p>ok I didnt do this ,because the only thing that comes back is the exception, I&#39;m not capturing any other info</p>
<p>Tip: reach a wider audience by setting some relevant question tags.</p>
<p>I tagged it iPhone because it&#39;s the most relevant.</p>
<p>Stephan -<br>this is the way I interpreted the rules, in my opinion there is no clear and concise way and everyone has different abilities at writing and communicating. I just want to know why Appcelerator doesn&#39;t build my projects correctly including all the namespaces. </p>
<p>its really a simple question. If the framework has Ti.UI.iPHone, then why the hell cant I rely on it working, why am I getting undefined not an object? What is the work around? I&#39;ve built about 15 ipa files to test and find out that the namespace isnt included, so I clean and rebuild and it still doesn&#39;t work. I&#39;ve spent several hours trying to clean rebuild &#x2F; distribute to find out that it&#39;s inconsistant.</p>
<p>it works in the simulator 90% of the time but when I build a distro file it doesnt. I dont know how I can explain that any clearer. </p>
