			<h1>Where is the ipa file inside project build folder?</h1>

		<section>
			<p>I have been reading other QAs (that are a few years old) and I still cannot find the IPA file.</p>
<p>Can someone give me a step by step guide of how to get this file from my project without dealing with Apple&#39;s Developer thing? I read I can put the IPA on testflight, which should avoid all of that,</p>

<p>Untrue.  Testflight does not magically remove provisioning profiles, signing certs and device registration from the mix. It merely makes it easier to distribute binaries and collect&#x2F;manage device ids.</p>
<p>In a simulator build, an ipa isn&#39;t actually created. The yourApp.app is created and placed into the simulators working structure.</p>
<p>To generate an ipa from studio, you would work through the &#39;packaging&#39; build flow.</p>
<p>From the cli <code>ti build -p iphone -T dist-adhoc -O &amp;#x2F;directory&amp;#x2F;where&amp;#x2F;you&amp;#x2F;want&amp;#x2F;the&amp;#x2F;app.ipa</code> and on newer cli builds that will try to match your signing cert and appropriate provisioning profile with your app&#39;s id</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the quick reply. </p>
<p>I didn&#39;t know that. Much of working with Apple for the first time isn&#39;t made very clear imo.<br>My campus has a developer account that I will be able to use.</p>
<p>Is there anything new I should know about for Ti Studio to iPhone?</p>

										<p><p>The appc tooling has gotten much better at detecting profiles that will match your app.id.  Just be sure to check the correct one (as sometimes multiples may match).</p>
<p>The new xcode (5.x) is terrible about downloading profiles from the developer site.  I download them manually, double click to install.</p>
