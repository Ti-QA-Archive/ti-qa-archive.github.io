							<div><p>Some thoughts:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Congrats to Boydlee on being published.  For those that have never been through the ringer that is publishing, let me tell you, editors and publishers are the most passive-aggressive collection of folks you will ever meet.  Pat you on the back with one hand while slapping you around with the other.  And most of the acquisition folks are technologically clueless.  So, again, great job on getting through and your name on a spine.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Books on shelves mean eyeballs introduced to technology.  Whether thats on a physical bookshelf or on a virtual one.  This puts pressure on Appecelerator to get their crap together.  That is GOOD for those of us already in and headed down this road.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Regarding Brian&#39;s comment, on the surface I&#39;d say the same thing.  But, if you are an intro level Jscript programmer, both Kitchen Sink and Tweetanium, while functional, are not designed for learning.  These are merely the examples to go with (what I think we can agree is incomplete api documentation).  By breaking the dev process down as they do for a book, enables the beginner to start slow, see quick results with proven code.  Open up kitchen sink, and where do you begin?  Got to make a tab group.  Well, where is that?  Now what?  You and I are NOT the market for this book.  However, with it in the wild, it IS something we can point new users to (and we should to encourage further pubs)</p>

							<p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>I have to totally agree with what Stephen says - if you&#39;re already a pretty proficient Titanium developer, I am not sure how much you&#39;ll get out of this book. Yes, many of the sample recipes in the book are similar to the kind of thing you could pull out of the KitchenSink, but they are all broken down into steps and explained fully, and most of the chapters the reader can build a small but useful application from start to finish.</p>
<p>Ideally, the book is aimed at people that can already program to some extent and want to learn how to make mobile apps, particularly web developers and beginners to mobile. It&#39;s not a book on advanced patterns or anything of that sort however I am considering writing something along those lines next year if this book goes down well.</p>
<p>Thanks for your input as always</p>
<p>Boydlee</p>
