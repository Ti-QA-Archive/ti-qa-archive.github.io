			<h1>migrate from navigationGroup to NavigationWindow - can&#39;t add object to a window anymore?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>We&#39;re using the dk.napp.slidemenu addon, which requires a main window object that acts as a the center window. Currently we&#39;re using a navigationGroup for this window, so users can browse through our content.</p>
<p>Apparently, the navagiationGroup will be depricated soon, and replaced with Titanium.UI.iOS.NavigationWindow, but:</p>
<p><em>However please note that this object is a window and is supposed to be used as a top level container. This can not be added to other windows</em></p>
<p>How can we fix this if this object can&#39;t be added to a window?</p>

							<div><p>I am also experiencing this problem.  If we cannot find a solution I will have to redesign the whole structure of my app.  I am also using the dk.napp.slidemenu, but I am facing the same problem with splitViews where I add a navigationGroup to a detail window in splitView.  I know that this problem has only just arisen, but if anyone has any suggestions that would be great.  </p>
<p>Arjan, have you contacted Mads Møller, the developer of the module yet?</p>

							<div><p>Hi Matthew,</p>
<p>We&#39;re dealing with the same problem. We&#39;re using the navigationGroup object as a child object on multiple spots in our app. So if we can&#39;t add it to another window anymore, we have to redesign our app. Very frustrating, because it&#39;s working perfectly at the moment.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t contacted Mads Moller yet, but I was planning to. But I don&#39;t think he can do anything as long the navigationWindow can&#39;t be added to another window.</p>
<p>The main question I got is: why on earth are they deprecating the possibility to add a navigationWindow to another object (view or window) ?</p>

							<div><p>Hi Arjan,</p>
<p>Thanks for using the module. Hope you like it.<br>So appc changed the way they deal with windows. So that does not mean that NappSlideMenu or NappDrawer have to become unsupported. </p>
<p>I know its going to be alot more difficult, but it should be possible change the way the module work, so I do not extend the TiUIWindow, but instead build up my own &quot;window&quot; ViewController. That way, we should be able to continue.</p>
<p>There are of course downsides to this approach. Inheritance. I loose all the benefits of extending the regular window class, which has stuff like open&#x2F;close, animation &amp; properties etc.. </p>
<p>So from my point of view: We need a base class (like TiUIView) in order to create a new type of NavigationDrawerWindow extending the basic functions of the regular window.</p>
<p>just my 2 cents.. </p>

										<p><p>this does not answer the original question. It&#39;s clear how to migrate from the old code to the newer one, the example in the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.UI.iOS.NavigationWindow">documentation</a> is very easy to read. The problem pointed here (and that I point in my new <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;161487&#x2F;migrating-from-navigationgroup-to-navigationwindow#comment-199997">question</a> ) is that the new navigationWindow has to be a top level container. So you can&#39;t put it inside other views&#x2F;popovers&#x2F;containers of any kind.</p>

							<p>Regarding why the navigationWindow is a top level object and NavigationGroup is not, that is due to the fact that they represent different UI Objects. The NavigationWindow is a Window while the Navigation Group is a View (which can be added to other Views&#x2F;Windows). Maintaining the NavigationGroup has become increasingly difficult since we can not reliably focus&#x2F;blur windows (and as such maintain accessibility elements) and can not guarantee that rotation and appearance methods will be forwarded to managed ViewControllers (and you really need this for some ViewControllers to behave correctly). </p>
<p>Regarding why the ability to add Windows as subviews of other objects was removed, it was a conscious design decision. One it lets us support iOS7 and future versions more easily, two we really did not want Windows behaving as Views since Windows do a lot more than displaying content on screen (Status bar appearance, orientation, accessibility features to name a few)</p>
<p>We have notified our module developers of the architecture change in base Titanium Windows and hope they will update their modules as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Please note that while the NavigationGroup class is deprecated in 3.1.3 GA, it is still a supported API on this release (though we do not plan to add any new features to it). The API will be dropped in 3.2.0 GA release. That should give you sufficient time to migrate your applications.</p>
<p>As always, your feedback is appreciated.</p>

							<p>Arjan, I made a new project and then used the app.js example file from v1.3.2 of the module.  In this example I simply changed the navController from create NavigationGroup to createNavigationWindow on line 135 in the example.</p>
<p><strong>Before</strong></p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> navController = Ti.UI.iPhone.createNavigationGroup({
        <span class="hljs-keyword">window</span> : <span class="hljs-keyword">win</span>
    });
</code></pre><p><strong>After</strong></p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> navController = Titanium.UI.iOS.createNavigationWindow({
        <span class="hljs-keyword">window</span> : <span class="hljs-keyword">win</span>
    });
</code></pre><p>Everything seems to be working as normal.  </p>
<p>I hope that this helps.</p>
