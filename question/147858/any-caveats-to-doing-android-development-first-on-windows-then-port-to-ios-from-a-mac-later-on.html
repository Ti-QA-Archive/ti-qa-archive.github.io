			<h1>Any caveats to doing Android development first on Windows, then port to iOS from a Mac later on?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I don&#39;t have a Mac right now, but want to target iOS in the future.  I&#39;m focusing on Android first, and am doing my initial development on my Windows machine.  My question is; will it be difficult to have developed an Android version of my app and then transfer the project over the the Mac to target iOS, at a later date?  Are there any caveats to doing it this way?  Once I have a Mac I plan to do ALL future platform development on that but wanted to make sure that I won&#39;t be going down a difficult path by developing for Android on the PC, first.  Thanks.</p>

							<p>If you know for certain that you want to build for iOS, do both platforms from the very beginning.  If you are building a moderately complex application, you will find that the differences between iOS and android will pile up.  You may find the job of &quot;porting&quot; your app to iOS very frustrating.</p>
<p>In fact, many people who speak poorly of Titanium have done what you are proposing in reverse – they build for iPhone, and then they find that porting to android is extremely painful.</p>
<p>I find that it&#39;s easier to build for both and test daily on both platforms (even better, test multiple times a day on both platforms).  This way, you can tackle the API inconsistencies&#x2F;bad documentation&#x2F;weird behavior problems one at a time.</p>
<p>Believe me, there are some problems that are so mysterious, you may find yourself spending 6-8 hours ripping your code apart to isolate the issue.  Imagine trying to deal with 4 or 5 of those types of issues simultaneously.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re trying to save money by not buying a Mac right away, you may find that this approach is penny-wise and pound foolish.  If you have to, find a used Mac (any MBP released in the past 4 years will be fine for this sort of work).</p>

										<p><p>Thanks.  This is exactly the issue that I am afraid of.  I don&#39;t want to start going down a path I&#39;ll regret later.  Yes I am concerned about the cost of a Mac but the Mac Mini can be had for $545 which is quite reasonable.  It is not an overly complex application but it will use many of the device hardware such as the GPS for location tracking, SMS broadcasting, contact management, etc.  I wasn&#39;t sure how difficult it would be to move to a Mac and target both Android and iOS at a later day - perhaps 1&#x2F;2 way through the initial Android development.  It does sound like a time-consuming prospect based on your response. It is very obvious now why all the demo vids are done on a Mac!  :)</p>

										<p><p>So I went out and bought a Mac Mini last night.  Upgraded it to 16GB for plenty of flexibility for running the emulators.  Installed the iOS SDK w&#x2F; Xcode, and Android SDK last night.  All ready to finally get started.</p>

										<p><p>Rock on!  Just make sure you build with multiple screen densities and sizes from the very beginning; don&#39;t be tempted by the siren song of iphones with their &quot;single&quot; density (not really, but it&#39;s almost like that), and two screen sizes.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve got a series of articles and a full-featured tutorial app <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;smorgasbork.com&#x2F;component&#x2F;content&#x2F;article&#x2F;38-titanium-mobile&#x2F;135-titanium-mobile-beyond-the-prototype">here</a> that might be useful to you.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

							<p>No Problem would happen but just try to remember the point that before starting this on Windows</p>
<p>1)Their are different screen size for android and IPhone so always try to give the size of buttons,text and labels in percentage(Relative) form.</p>
<p>2)There are certain points where coding for the android and IPhone differs so always try to remember that points and apply a condition on it like this</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">if</span><span class="hljs-params">(Titanium.Platform.osname == <span class="hljs-string">"iphone"</span>)</span></span>
</code></pre><p>Hope these tips would help</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>For iOS, you need to deal with private keys, certificates, integration with xcode and SDKs.<br>My opinion is that if you eventually want to support iOS, why not start with Mac too, and coding to support both.</p>
