							<p>I have found the SOLUTION.</p>
<p>Just go to SDCARD&#x2F;appID</p>
<p>Ex: sdcard&#x2F;com.app.mrt</p>
<p>And delete this file &quot;DEPLOY.JSON&quot;</p>
<p>Run again and ENJOY!!!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

										<p><p>Hmmmm. This wasn&#39;t applicable to my case. I had wiped the app completely from my devices. For the AVD, I even create a new one that didn&#39;t have any trace of the app and was even missing the SD card. I had to edit it and add a 512MB SD card.</p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t have much of a solution, but after downgrading. I was still having the same issue. So I have selectively remove codes until it started working. It reveal several small errors that where collectively preventing the App from booting. Not sure why it didn&#39;t happen before that particular moment.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have seen in the JIRA issue tracker that this was supposed to be fixed. Not  sure anymore. Now I am running the latest version and everything is ok.</p>

							<p>There are people around offering different solutions, but I found out that when I upgraded to 3.2.0 it got rid of my older versions of Android; namely Android 2.3. I noticed that when I cleaned and tried to recompile in 3.1.3 it said it required Android version 2.3 so I ok&#39;d and the project compiled and ran fine as it did. Then when I went back and compiled in 3.2.0 it worked perfectly. So I&#39;m assuming it has something to do with needing an older version of Android included during compilation.</p>

										<p><p>I have all (and I mean ALL) the Android SDKs downloaded and maintained in my home directory in ~&#x2F;android-skd-macosx&#x2F;. But to my surprise, even after letting Titanium know that I had an Andrioid SDK in that folder, it went ahead and tried to download them again. So I have checked all the possible Android AIPs offered and it downloaded them all over again and after the download was completed, it (Titanium) won&#39;t recognized what it has just downloaded. This is on Mountain Lion.</p>

										<p><p>Correction. I didn&#39;t have the Android SDK API Level 5. It is marked as obsolete, therefore it is not displayed in the list by default. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;imagebin.org&#x2F;288878">Check this picture to see how to make it show in the list</a> so that you can install.</p>

							<p>You can easily download in your smartphone android an app for manage file and folders on you devide (for example ES file explorer) and delete the file deploy.json in the app folder. This worked for me.</p>
