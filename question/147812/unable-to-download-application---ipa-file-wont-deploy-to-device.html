			<h1>Unable to Download Application - ipa file won&#39;t deploy to device</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am on the 3rd iteration of my in-house iPad app. After upgrading to TI 3.x, having not touched the code for awhile since releasing version 2, I can no longer deploy&#x2F;install my app. I have an Enterprise distribution license (the $299 per year one). For previous versions I always went through hell trying to get the keys, dev profiles, and provisioning profiles all correct and aligned so that I could install my app on physical iPads. I had it all correct 6 months ago and deployed my app out to many devices, but now apparently I&#39;m back to square one. I&#39;m not sure what changed or could have caused this.</p>
<p>I was able to compile my app to an ipa file and I believe I have the manifest all correct, etc. When I try to download my app onto my ipad from a web page (this is allowed in Enterprise apple licensing), it starts downloading and installing. And the little progress bar inside the app icon makes it 95% across, then halts with the error &quot;Unable to Download Appliation - &#39;Daily Report&#39; could not be installed at this time&quot;. My app&#39;s name is &#39;Daily Report&#39;.</p>
<p>When I try to install it through iTunes (from macbook air to ipad) I get a slightly different error message: &quot;iTunes Sync - &#39;Daily Report&#39; failed to install&quot;. </p>
<p>My best guess is that something&#39;s tangled with my development profile and&#x2F;or distribution profile. Yet it all compiles fine and gives me what appears to be a valid ipa file.</p>
<p>Here is my pre-compile window:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zerogravpro.com&#x2F;temp&#x2F;precompile.png</p>
<p>I&#39;m wondering if I was supposed to use my Distribution Profile for Provisioning Profile rather than my Development Profile. Even if that&#39;s it, I can&#39;t find any way to change my selected profile in that pulldown. When I click on it, I see no way to edit or select something different. And I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s even it but I can&#39;t figure what else it could be. Also, Titanium seems to look in my keychain rather than filesystem for the profile – in my keychain I have both a dev profile and a dist profile.</p>
<p>Please help.</p>

							<p>I figured it out! In Titanium 3.0 there&#39;s a new little icon (looks like a brown box or folder) I didn&#39;t notice before for &quot;Distribute - Ad Hoc&#x2F;Enterprise&quot;. I went through the wizard, chose all the defaults, and it published. I was able to download and install the ipa on my first try. Sorry to bother everyone, but maybe this will help someone else.</p>
