			<h1>Unlicensed module</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Since this morning, I am getting a big red window with written &quot;Unlicensed module(s) detected. You must be a subscriber to use one or more of the module included in the project.&quot;.</p>
<p>But:</p>
<ul>
<li>I do have an Indie account</li>
<li>I don&#39;t use any Ti+ Modules !</li>
<li>I have tried to recreate the project a lot of times, to logout &#x2F; login, to use another Titanium account…</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems like if I remove the keychain module, it&#39;s working back. But I bought this module (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinypay.me&#x2F;~dFAy9Rg) and it has nothing to do with Ti+ Modules.</p>
<p>Would someone have a solution for this issue ?</p>
<p>Regards</p>

							<p>Hello. I had no idea that Appcelerator verified the module GUID against their central service. That caught me by surprise. Since the module I was selling has the same GUID than the module on the Appcelerator Marketplace, the serves thinks you never bought the module. I&#39;m in the middle of vacations so I can&#39;t solve the problem right now, but tomorrow I will release new versions of all my modules with a different GUID. Very sorry about all this mess.</p>

							<p>Ok guys, good to hear !</p>
<p>I have also emailed him on his personal email but he is in Holidays…</p>
<p>If one of you has a Titanium Pro account, it may be good to open a ticket too - as I think that these blocking issues come from the Appcelerator backend (one of my dev blocks all the incoming packets on his laptop and is still able to use the module..).</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

							<p>Hi I just bought the keychain module via appcelerator marketplace, and I get an &quot;Unlicensed module&quot; error even thought I paid for it. I can see in this thread that some people had the same issues and got them resolved.<br>There is however no usable explanation on how the issue can be resolved.</p>
<p>What should I do to use the module that I paid for?</p>
