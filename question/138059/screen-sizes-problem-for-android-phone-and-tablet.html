		<section>
			<p>Hi guys!</p>
<p>I&#39;m porting an app from iOS to Android phone Samsung Galaxy S2 and it worked nicely after resizing but now I need to make the app available to various Android device with the various screen sizes. I&#39;ve followed the instructions from <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;06&#x2F;new-defaults-for-android-layouts-in-1-7.html">here</a> and it works in Samsung Galaxy S2. </p>
<p>However, it seems Samsung Galaxy Tab doesn&#39;t take the &quot;dp&quot; measurement into account because the pictures in Galaxy Tab are not resized properly. They appear smaller than the pictures in Galaxy S2 and based on the instructions on the link above, the images should appear with the same size. I&#39;ve searched for answers and tried some possible solutions but none of them worked. I think I can use any hints or pointers from here since I&#39;m totally lost where to search now. Thanks in advance! =)</p>

							<p>the only one things that change between the two platforms is the device high and device width the dp is only to prevent resolution (density) in the platforms</p>

							<p>have you thought about trying to display the image based on percentage resolution? Should scale well across devices that way.</p>

										<p><p>Yes and I tested it. The solution of using percentage of the resolution doesn&#39;t work well because the layout which looks perfectly fit and nice in small device could be too big for bigger device, for example the font size. I think it&#39;s feasible to use the percentage for margin and positioning but for font size, image size, row height, or any other UI related size, it&#39;s just not the solution =(</p>
