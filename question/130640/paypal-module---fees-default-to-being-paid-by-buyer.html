			<h1>Paypal Module - fees default to being paid by buyer</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>iOS SDK 5.0, Titanium 1.8.0.1 SDK Ti.Paypal 1.4</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to implement a ecommerce app using the Paypal module however it&#39;s not possible for the recipient (seller of goods) to pay the Paypal fee!</p>
<p>Using sandbox and testing on simulator the buyer is informed on the screen of fees they are paying!  Only parameter to control this seems to be feePaidByReceiver however this is only applicable for PERSONAL payments.  If however this is set to TRUE then the error &#39;An invalid parameter was entered:feesPayer, PRIMARYRECEIVER&#39;</p>
<p>Surely this is a bug, the recipient should pay the fees on all but personal payments, however this is reversed in the module, this is making the Module of no use.</p>
<p>This is now urgent as we are hoping to release the app very soon.</p>

							<p>I have just started evaluating the PayPal module for an eCommerce app myself. Are you using the code sample simple.js that came with the module? The same happenend to me when I tried it for the first time. The documentation could do to be a little clearer I think. </p>
<p>What I did was remove the feePaidByReceiver parameter and also the paymentType parameter because the default behaviour is that the merchant pays the fee and the transaction type gets set to hard goods (rather than personal) if you don&#39;t explicitly set them. Then it seemed to behave the way I wanted.</p>

							<p>Got an email that the Paypal module has been updated, but no change to version number.</p>
<p>Updated anyway and bug still there.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t feel that they Appcelerator can advertise as having a Paypal module with such a glaring error.  Has anyone out there used it and have it working to pay for goods?</p>
