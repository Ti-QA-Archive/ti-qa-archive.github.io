			<h1>contenteditable behaviour on Android vs. iOS</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>This is more of a platform question than a Titanium API question.  I&#39;m trying to figure out if contenteditable is broken on Android vs. iOS.  (Or, maybe, just broken for me, for some reason.)</p>
<p>I&#39;m using it in a webview.  On iOS the functionality can be tested in Safari, while on Android it has to use the built-in Browser (as opposed to Chrome or another third-party browser).  That way you should, as I understand it, be seeing the same behaviour as a Ti.UI.WebView on the relevant platform.</p>
<p>The test is <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jsfiddle.net&#x2F;q7RE8&#x2F;6&#x2F;">here</a>.</p>
<p>(I figured a JSFiddle was easier than sample Titanium code which you&#39;d have to pop into a test app yourself to accomplish, essentially, the same thing.)</p>
<p>Basically, tap the HTML Results pane to activate the contenteditable.  Then select a word in the second line, and tap Backspace on the keyboard to delete it.</p>
<p>Doing the selection on Android can be tricky enough, but in my testing (on a Nexus S running 4.1.2), deleting something from the <em>second</em> line will delete the range from the <em>first</em> line, starting at the same character offset and for the same length as the intended second-line word.  Basically, trying to delete from any line deletes from the first line in the contenteditable instead.</p>
<p>Does anyone else see this same behaviour?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Good news; you are right.</p>
<p>Bad news; you are right.</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS (safari) works perfectly</li>
<li>Android (default browser) fails and removes things from the first line no matter which line you actually edit</li>
<li>Android (Chrome) works perfectly.</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>No — Android&#39;s contenteditable is so broken as to be unusable.  4.4 KitKat is the first semi-usable implementation (probably not unrelated to the fact that the default Browser is gone, and maybe the WebView guts are more Chrome now — I don&#39;t know), but on prior versions, no.  At least not that I&#39;m aware of.</p>
