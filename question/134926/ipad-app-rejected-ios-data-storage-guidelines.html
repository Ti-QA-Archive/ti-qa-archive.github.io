			<h1>[iPad] app rejected &#34;iOS Data Storage Guidelines&#34;</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi… I have a problem.</p>
<p>I develop a iPad App with Titanium SDK 1.8.2.</p>
<p>I talk something about the app.<br>This App connect with webservices to get all available magazines… each magazine have thumbnails, pdfs and videos.</p>
<p>If the user open first time the App, the App download thumbnails of magazine (stored in applicationDataDirectory).</p>
<p>Ok..</p>
<p>If the user want to buy any magazine… (in-app purchase)… click on buy… and the magazine download videos and pdf (stored in applicationDataDirectory).</p>
<p>It&#39;s all… if the user not want more the magazine (maybe not have available space)… can click on &quot;archive&quot; and all pdfs and videos of that magazine deleted from the device… this user can download again in the future.</p>
<p>Then… I send the app to apple… but apple rejected my app.</p>
<h1 id="here-is-the-reason-">Here is the reason:</h1>
<p>2.23</p>
<p>We found that your app does not follow the iOS Data Storage Guidelines, which is required per the App Store Review Guidelines.</p>
<p>In particular, we found that on launch and&#x2F;or content download, your app stores 2.67 MB. To check how much data your app is storing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install and launch your app</li>
<li>Go to Settings &gt; iCloud &gt; Storage &amp; Backup &gt; Manage Storage </li>
<li>If necessary, tap &quot;Show all apps&quot; </li>
<li>Check your app&#39;s storage</li>
</ul>
<p>The iOS Data Storage Guidelines indicate that only content that the user creates using your app, e.g., documents, new files, edits, etc., may be stored in the &#x2F;Documents directory - and backed up by iCloud. </p>
<p>Temporary files used by your app should only be stored in the &#x2F;tmp directory; please remember to delete the files stored in this location when the user exits the app.</p>
<p>Data that can be recreated but must persist for proper functioning of your app - or because customers expect it to be available for offline use - should be marked with the &quot;do not back up&quot; attribute. For NSURL objects, add the NSURLIsExcludedFromBackupKey attribute to prevent the corresponding file from being backed up. For CFURLRef objects, use the corresponding kCFURLIsExcludedFromBackupKey attribute. </p>
<p>For more information, please see Technical Q&amp;A 1719: How do I prevent files from being backed up to iCloud and iTunes?.</p>
<p>It is necessary to revise your app to meet the requirements of the iOS Data Storage Guidelines.<br>For discrete code-level questions, you may wish to consult with Apple Developer Technical Support. Please be sure to:</p>
<ul>
<li>include the complete details of your rejection issues</li>
<li>prepare any symbolicated crash logs, screenshots, or steps to reproduce the issues for when the DTS engineer follows up. </li>
</ul>
<h1 id="for-information-on-how-to-symbolicate-and-read-a-crash-log-please-see-tech-note-tn2151-understanding-and-analyzing-iphone-os-application-crash-reports-">For information on how to symbolicate and read a crash log, please see Tech Note TN2151 Understanding and Analyzing iPhone OS Application Crash Reports.</h1>
<p>But I dont understand what is the problem… the first time the app download that files… initial content :S</p>
<p>Somebody can help me please</p>

							<p>I think you have two different problems here:</p>
<p>1 large initial download of data on first launch.  Ask yourself just how much data you HAVE to download at launch at what can be lazy loaded in the background.</p>
<p>2 you need to set the new backup flag on the files you write to the device. For every file you write on iOS you need to decide if this file should be backed up to iCloud or not.  You need to be setting the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;1.8.2&#x2F;Titanium.Filesystem.File.remoteBackup-property.html">Ti.Filesystem.File.remoteBackup</a> flag for every file.</p>

										<p><p>Please understand that I&#39;m not yelling with this statement or singling you out, but as an iOS developer, it is your responsibility to keep up with the Apple specs. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;icloud&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;data-storage&#x2F;">iCloud Data Storage Guidelines</a></p>

										<p><p>Since code is always helpful:</p>
<p>This lets you write to a cache folder inside <code>Private Documents</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> fDir = Titanium.Filesystem.getFile(Titanium.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory+<span class="hljs-string">'../Library/Private%20Documents/'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"cache"</span>);
</code></pre><p>You could just as easily match the specs and write to the <code>Caches</code> directory:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> fDir = Titanium.Filesystem.getFile(Titanium.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory+<span class="hljs-string">'../Library/Caches/'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"yourDir"</span>);
</code></pre><p>You can set the backup flag on your directory:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">fDir.remoteBackup = <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>;
</code></pre><p>Or on individual files:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> f = Titanium.Filesystem.getFile(fDir.nativePath, <span class="hljs-string">'myfile.txt'</span>);
f.remoteBackup = <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>;
</code></pre><p>Be sure you are using the flag correctly.  Be considerate of the devices storage space.  Don&#39;t lock files that can be deleted and re-downloaded.  Don&#39;t arrogantly believe your data is God&#39;s gift to the user and ought to persist in every situation. (I use that line to yell at my devs <em>grin</em>)</p>

										<p><p>My guess is that #1 is unavoidable: The thumbnails are dynamic as they change with each new magazine release, and the pdfs are downloaded as needed.</p>
<p>But #2 is exactly the issue. With iOS 5.0, Apple allows people to back up their application data to Apple&#39;s servers, so Apple only wants to back up that which can&#39;t be recomputed or redownloaded.</p>
<p>Files stored in the Ti.Filesystem.tempDirectory path will not be backed up, but can be deleted at any time, so you don&#39;t want that. Storing the file in the caches folder is also valid. And, as Stephen Feather mentions, set the remoteBackup property on all files to false. This will set the &#39;com.apple.MobileBackup&#39; flag (what the rejection referred to by NSURLIsExcludedFromBackupKey and kCFURLIsExcludedFromBackupKey) to the appropriate value, and all will be well.</p>

										<p><p>We had one app that already had data in the applicationDataDirectory.<br>When we submitted the last version, we left a nice little note for the reviewer saying we would eventually move all the data to Private Documents.  We did set the no backup flag and it was accepted.</p>
<p>Often it depends on the grace of the reviewer.  If this is your initial submission, I&#39;d suggest you take the little bit of time to place the files properly to start with. Should save some headaches down the line.</p>
<p>Regarding <code>&amp;#x2F;Library&amp;#x2F;Cache</code>s vs <code>&amp;#x2F;Library&amp;#x2F;Private Documents&amp;#x2F;Caches</code> it comes down to your data type.</p>
<p>###Cached Data<br><em>This is data that can be downloaded again or regenerated, and the absence of this data will not prevent your app from functioning as the user expects in offline situations. Cached data should be put in the &lt;Application_Home&gt;&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Caches directory. Cached data may be purged in low storage situations, and is not backed up by iTunes or iCloud.</em></p>
<p>###Offline Data<br><em>This is data that can be downloaded or otherwise recreated, but that the user expects to be reliably available when offline. Offline data should be put in the &lt;Application_Home&gt;&#x2F;Documents directory or in the &lt;Application_Home&gt;&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Private Documents directory (see QA1699 for details) and marked with the &quot;do not backup&quot; attribute. Data stored in either location will persist in low-storage situations and the &quot;do not backup&quot; attribute will prevent iTunes or iCloud backing up the data. Offline data files should be removed as soon as they are no longer needed to avoid using unnecessary storage space on the user&#39;s device.</em></p>
<p>(From <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;ios&#x2F;#qa&#x2F;qa1719&#x2F;_index.html">Technical Q&amp;A QA1719</a>)</p>
<p>While our data is re-downloadable, it needs to be available at application start as the user expects it to be there.  The `&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Caches&#39; folder may be purged by the OS in a low storage situation.</p>

										<p><p><strong>Thank you Stephen!</strong> this was very helpful!</p>
<p>Now i have another problem i cant locate the <code>&amp;#x2F;Library&amp;#x2F;Private Documents&amp;#x2F;Caches</code> folder,<br>I searched it in:</p>
<p><code>file:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;localhost&amp;#x2F;Users&amp;#x2F;[user_name]&amp;#x2F;Library&amp;#x2F;Application%20Support&amp;#x2F;iPhone%20Simulator&amp;#x2F;5.0&amp;#x2F;Applications&amp;#x2F;[app_guid]&amp;#x2F;Library&amp;#x2F;Private%20Documents&amp;#x2F;cache&amp;#x2F;</code></p>
<p>but it dosen&#39;t exist, </p>
<p>I try to create the folder from the code without any luck so i create the folder my self but i cant do anything inside this folder (de-compress).</p>
<p>It&#39;s important that my files will be available for offline use so i cant put them inside <code>&amp;#x2F;Library&amp;#x2F;Cache</code></p>
<p>I tested only on simulator 5.0 and titanium sdk 1.7.5 (try it also in 2.0.2.GA but still no luck)</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>I think that 1.7.5 sdk doesn&#39;t support <code>fDir.remoteBackup = false;</code></p>
<p>it&#39;s appears as one of the new features in 1.8 version, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;12&#x2F;titanium-mobile-sdk-1-8-release-candidate-available.html">here</a>.</p>

							<p>Hi, any news on that issue. When I update my application all images in applicationDataDirectory are disappeared. The suggested &#39;..&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Private%20Documents&#39; does not work, I can not write. I&#39;m using titanium 2.0.1 iOS 5.1.<br>I&#39;m still looking for a solution addressing the right path in iOs for application created documents….</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

										<p><p>Hi,<br>I&#39;ve checked with the phone explorer and all files are there!<br>Still when I want to show it in the GUI they are gone after installing new compiled App.<br>My first thought was that I may have the wrong filename in my stored JSON Object. So I did debug output if file not exists and the filename fits to the EXISTING image, the JSON file remains in the same directory and it can be found. Everything works fine (loading JSON list and images to display at startup) until I update to a new version of my App. Here is the path I got in my JSON Array using Ti.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory:<br>&quot;imageNames&quot;:[&quot;file:&#x2F;&#x2F;localhost&#x2F;var&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;Applications&#x2F;577FE0B2-BBE4-45E8-A62A-92C943727153&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;1339941297109.jpg&quot;]</p>
<p>What could be wrong?What is different AFTER the update of the App?<br>By the way I do set the Backup flag for all created files (JSON.txt and images).Does the PATH changes after updating the App? But in this case it would also not find the JSON.txt … really strange.</p>
<p>Logical thinking would claim that &quot;File.exists()&quot; has a BUG, if ImageView uses File.exists() as well - at least this would explain why the file is not displayed - but phoneExplorer shows it and I can view it.</p>
<p>At the begin I thought the &quot;Private Documents&quot; folder would solve the issue. I still don&#39;t know how to address it. Tomorrow I will try to use relative Path names (e.g. ..&#x2F;..&#x2F;Documents). Good night, got too confused about it…</p>

										<p><p>I use relative path and it&#39;s work</p>
<p>maybe that will help you:<br><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;ios&#x2F;#documentation&#x2F;iPhone&#x2F;Conceptual&#x2F;iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide&#x2F;PerformanceTuning&#x2F;PerformanceTuning.html#&#x2F;&#x2F;apple_ref&#x2F;doc&#x2F;uid&#x2F;TP40007072-CH8-SW8">LINK</a></p>
<p>Here is the relavent part:</p>
<p><strong>Files Saved During App Updates</strong></p>
<p>When a user downloads an app update, iTunes installs the update in a new app directory. It then moves the user’s data files from the old installation over to the new app directory before deleting the old installation. Files in the following directories are guaranteed to be preserved during the update process:</p>
<p>&lt;Application_Home&gt;&#x2F;Documents</p>
<p>&lt;Application_Home&gt;&#x2F;Library</p>
<p>Although files in <strong>other</strong> user directories may also be moved over, you should not rely on them being present after an update.</p>

										<p><p>OK, now it is clear what happened. The stored image path includes the &quot;App-Dir&quot; (which is changd by iTunes) - I changed the PATH to &quot;..&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;&quot; and now my images do survive the update procedure! </p>

							<p>Hi, everyone, here is what I did and after few applications who has been rejected, I did that:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> iconStore</span> = Ti.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory +<span class="hljs-string">"../Library/Caches/"</span>;

iconStore.setRemoteBackup = <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>;
</code></pre><p>It worked for me. I hope that&#39;s gonna help.</p>
<p>And it&#39;s just starting to work with the 1.8 version</p>
