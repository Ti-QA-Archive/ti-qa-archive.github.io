			<h1>ACS Architecture Design - Custom Object with multiple Photos</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;d like to create a custom Object on ACS with multiple Photos.</p>
<p>One way I figured is to have the Photos uploaded first, then the Custom Object Created with the <code>custom_fields</code> and the URLs of the Photos as properties of the <code>custom_fields</code> (needed to be called after an interval as the Photos would not be processed as the Photos get uploaded).</p>
<p>Another way, is to create a PhotoCollections with <code>custom_fields</code>, and then upload the photos with the PhotoCollection id as Photo&#39;s <code>collections</code> property.</p>
<p>Anybody experienced anything similar or has any input?</p>

							<p>I&#39;m not 100% sure on your approach, but you can use relational fields to link custom object to multiple photos.<br>For more detail, look on docs.<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;cloud&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;relationalfields</p>

							<p>Thanks Nadeem,</p>
<p>That&#39;s precisely what I did, the firstOption was pretty much my only choice. Additionally, the photos that I create need the added property:<br>&quot;photo_sync_sizes[]=preview&quot;</p>
<p>This is crucial, as the return call would provide the URL instantly to be added to the Custom Object.</p>

										<p><p>Yeah you are right the return call instantly returns url and in succes of the call whatever you will do would be done instantly. That is correct. No other way I could find. If i did will tell you</p>

										<p><p>That is correct and would be iritating.. Uploader won&#39;t believe it naturally that he uploaded a bunch of photos instantly.. -:) And secondly you can&#39;t upload photo using custom object it hasn&#39;t the field of photo to create. So if it knows you are passing a blob data it wont upload it.</p>

							<p>HI Joseph,<br>I am not very much sure what&#39;s your requirement. As much as I understood you want to upload multiple  photos and then access them. First I tried to upload with <code>Cloud.create.photo</code> </p>
<p>In this way only one photo is uploaded and when i used the for loop to do this i get into bunch of  prblem which I couldn&#39;t handle.So, i figured other way to do this which using custom object. I can create multiple  objects with for loop and in that I give url of the image and other required fields . </p>
<p>And then I query the custom objects to get the images back and show where I want to..</p>
<p>If you have a better way . I would like to know …</p>
