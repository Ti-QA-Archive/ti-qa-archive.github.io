			<h1>IOS stopped building: SystemExit: 65</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Yesterday my project was working perfectly on both iOS and Android. Today I refactored a couple of methods and tried to build and suddenly my IOS build is no longer working. The weird thing is that Android still builds perfectly and runs perfectly - no issues. Only the IOS building process seems to have been affected.</p>
<p>The error I get when trying to build is :</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[INFO] iPhone simulated device: iphone
[INFO] Performing full rebuild. This will take a little bit. Hold tight...
[INFO] Performing clean build
[INFO] Compiling localization files

</code></pre><p>Does anyone have any idea what I could have done that would suddenly cause this error? I&#39;ve already tried cleaning and rebuilding, closing the project and restarting my machine and Titanium studio.</p>
<p>I&#39;m developing on OSX Lion, with Titanium 1.8.2 and XCode 4.2.1.</p>

										<p><p>No luck :-(. I Tried SDK versions 1.7.6, 1.8.3 and 2.0.0 and all of them produce the same error as in 1.8.2, except with different line numbers in their respective builder.py and run.py scripts.</p>

										<p><p>It is really weird, but I&#39;ve struggling with the same problem for a while now until I found your post - and it works! I simply added a space to my project&#39;s name and the error was gone. Thank you so much!</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I hope that this issue will be fixed asap with a next version of the SDK. Such an error is not only weird but also very time-consuming.</p>

							<p>Try This!</p>
<ol>
<li>1) First, backup Resource fold of  your project</li>
<li>2) Remove  the project in Titanium Studio (make sure delete project contents on disk)</li>
<li>3) Create new Mobile Project as a sample.</li>
<li>4) Important!! You must build the Sample Project  immediately.</li>
<li>5) Confirm the Sample Project has build without an error.</li>
<li>6) Now, copy origin resources to the Project  and Rebuild!</li>
</ol>

							<p>Finally found what the issue was for those that have this problem in the future. The issue was that inside my resource folder, I had a folder with the same name as my project name (project called Pashash, folder resources&#x2F;pashash). This caused the xCode project to fail. The error the xCode process cited was :</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">ld: can<span class="hljs-attribute">'t</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">open</span> output <span class="hljs-keyword">file</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> writing: /Users/lawrencewebley/<span class="hljs-keyword">Library</span>/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Pashash-fzgpnmlmabcarfgpjjxuvtvwygaw/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/Pashash.app/Pashash, errno=<span class="hljs-number">21</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">architecture</span> i386
</code></pre><p>Some googling on this error finally led me to find that if their is a folder in your resource folder of the same name as your project, this error occurs.</p>
