			<h1>AudioPlayer Volume</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have created a nice audio player. Generally, everything works nice. However, whenever I build with the Target being my iPhone, there is no voice. I have added debugging so I can see that the iPhone is indeed receiving and buffering the audio file, but there is no sound.</p>
<p>Whenever I build on the iPhone simulator, it works very well with sound. </p>
<p>What am I doing wrong? Has anyone had this experience before?</p>
<p>As I mentioned, I created volume buttons even to ensure that that this wasn&#39;t an obstacle.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any support you can provide.</p>

							<p>Guys,</p>
<p>I found out what the problem was! </p>
<p>My iPhone was on mute. THere&#39;s this button on the side of the 4S that stops the sound. I had to push it up. </p>
<p>What&#39;s weired is that the Apple Audio Player still played when I had the mute button down.. so I was debugging like crazy thinking that my app wasn&#39;t working. </p>
<p>I guess you all want to know if I feel embarrassed about this ? no. its just another day at the office.</p>
