							<div><p>@Nick I think he should clarify that not one has help him in the 30 minutes between posting this question:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;174663&#x2F;titanium-studio-wont-create-a-new-project">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;174663&#x2F;titanium-studio-wont-create-a-new-project</a></p>
<p>and this current thread.</p>
<p>In NONE of his three questions in the last 24 hours has Mr Lukwesa posted a complete question, so is it really any wonder that he hasn&#39;t received a solution?</p>
<p>Missing from your question are a number of important pieces of information. I suggest you take a look at the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Using+Questions+and+Answers">Using Questions and Answers</a> article, specifically the Q&amp;A Question Checklist.  The missing information is critical to reproducing problems in a test environment and often indicates other factors that cause the undesirable outcome you are experiencing.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I have read the comments fro Stephen and Nick and the are both on the money.</p>
<p>The problem we have here is that your failure to gain assistance and your anger towards everyone who has yet to provide you that assistance is very misplaced.</p>
<p>You asked the first question 17 hours ago, you duplicated the question an less than two hours ago and then again with this one an hour ago.</p>
<p>A few things to note;</p>
<ul>
<li>The people here are providing assistance free of charge</li>
<li>They are doing it out of their spare time</li>
<li>Some issues require people with similar setups to be around that have also experienced the problem</li>
<li>Installation issues are not easy to replicate as many times it is the setup and not the software</li>
<li>There is an expectation that  any question - let alone three would provide additional information beyond demands for free help instantly</li>
<li>Whilst you are running Windows 7 - that has been the limit of your specification details, very difficult to work from that</li>
<li>Your account was created almost 2 years ago, but you have not mentioned is this is the first time you have installed the software</li>
<li>You have not said if this was an upgrade or if you have performed a clean install</li>
<li>You have not said what steps you have followed for the documentation to help determine the issue and what results came back from those tests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly you are frustrated, very clearly it is everyone else&#39;s fault but yours.</p>
<p>Why not try again and provide some of the information asked of you and try and respect those around you.  Otherwise no-one will help you.</p>
