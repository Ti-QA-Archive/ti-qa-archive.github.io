			<p>I&#39;m sure everyone knows the wiki-article about localization:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Internationalizing+your+Application">Internationalizing your Application
</a></p>
<p>But that&#39;s only the technical part. With that knowledge you can provide (at least) two languages: your mother language and english. But what about all the other languages? Would&#39;nt it be nice to have your app translated to those, too?</p>
<p>One of my followers on twitter mentioned <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getlocalization.com&#x2F;">getLocalization</a> some day ago. The idea of this page is, that you upload your strings and texts and other people are doing the translation for you. This can be done crowd driven, which is free, or you request a professional localization from getLocalization.com, which you have to pay for.</p>
<p>Here is what you have to do:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Register</p>
</li>
<li><p>Start a new project. It will be helpful for the translator, if you provide a link to some screenshots of your app. I setup a simple facebook page for that reason.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go to &#39;Files&#39;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Upload a new file. Select your strings.xml from the i18n&#x2F;en directory. Set Format to &#39;Android&#39;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Wait a moment, then click &#39;Files&#39; to refresh the list.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Click on the file &#39;strings.xml&#39; to view it. Now you get a table with all your strings.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fill the Context row for all strings to provide the translator with an idea, what this special string is used for. Hit enter to save each string.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Upload additional files, for example desciption or promo text for the Android market or the AppStore.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now all you have to do is to find people who can do the localization for you. You can ask your twitter followers, on facebook or in forums. Or just ask the community here at appcelerator? What do you think? I think our community is really global so it should be possible to translate every app into a bunch of languages. What does the Appcelertor teams thinks about this? Would it be ok, to ask for a localization here in the Q&amp;A? Tagged with [Localization]? This could be a great deal for all developers.</p>
<p>And last, but not least, I&#39;d like to ask you, if you can help me to localise my first app. It is a simple scoresheet done with Titanium and it will appear in the Android market and the AppStore soon. Here is the link:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getlocalization.com&#x2F;Scorsheasy&#x2F;">Scorsheasy at getLocalization.com</a></p>
<p>ps: there&#39;s no need to provide a german localization, since german is my mother language. :)</p>
