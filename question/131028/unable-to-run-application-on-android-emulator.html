			<h1>Unable to run application on Android Emulator</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am new to Titanium and studied the documentation aswell. My Android and iPhone Emulator were working fine but when I reinstall macOS X Lion and reinstall Eclipse and successfully configured Android Emulator with Titanium studio so I am unable to install application on Android Emulator. I have gone through Q&amp;A section and people also recommended an almost similar question to reinstall the Titanium studio. I even did that aswell. My application is running fine on iPhone simulator but when I am trying to run on Android Emulator so it only launches Emulator and doesnt install the application neither run nor I can debug for Android. I am pretty much annoyed that why am I not be able to go through and run application successfully on Android emulator on which it was working fine before.</p>

							<p>You tried doing a clean, touch tiapp.xml, and rebuild? A bit of advice, the Android emulator is annoying, just deploy to an Android phone and test on there, I find it to be faster and I run into less errors.</p>

							<p>Now Finally after a day and understanding and playing with Titanium Sdk I successfully installed it on Emulator. What I did is to click tiapp.xml in project and make Android Runtime as V8 instead of Rhino which is very slow, and upgrade the sdk from Help –&gt; check for Update and then clean the project and change the device to Google API 2.3.3 on WVGA854 and then run it on Emulator and it works like a charm.</p>
