			<h1>Invalid binary - 1.7.5 app submission not working</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have created an app on ti 1.7.5, when I package the same for distribution, it shows up on the xcode organizer. The app passes validation in xcode organizer and submits successfully as well. But post submission, the app shows &quot;Invalid binary&quot; on iTunes connect. </p>
<p>Can somebody help?</p>

							<div><p>Tried on all 1.7.x builds (does not submit), Tried on several 1.8.x CI builds, does not work.</p>
<p>Only submits to the store on 1.8.0.1 which is very limiting.</p>
<p>Hoping to hear from appcelerator on this one.</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve had that problem in two different scenarios;</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I had added a entitlement to my distribution profile that wasnt being used.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There was a problem with armv6&#x2F;armv7 settings being built into the app for distribution (circa v 1.7.x) due to the change in minimum IOS version support.  I had to manually patch the XCode project to get it to submit.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope that helps…</p>

										<p><p>That does actually. Manually patching the xcode project is a work around and I am happy as long as we have one. </p>
<p>However, my app is tested rigorously on 1.7.5 and now I may need to submit using another ti version which implies a couple of days of regression testing and bug solving and with the client on my back.</p>
<p>I do wish the appcelerator team however wouldve announced this issue and solved it with some more transparency.</p>
<p>Nick, for now I assume you when you say manual patch, all we need to do is fix the errors being reported by the apple itunes connect portal right?</p>

										<p><p>Hi Rahul,</p>
<p>I cant guarantee that you are having exactly the same issue. But in my case I changed the xCode project that is generated and set the architecture to armv7. I also had to set the minimum IOS version to 4.01 for it to then compile and validate ok</p>

										<p><p>My issue got fixed, it was missing the appicon@2x.png file. My apologies to appcelerator.</p>
<p>Did you submit with 1.7.5 and get an approval? Very important for me to know so I can go into the submission phase tonight.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the help Nick!!</p>

										<p><p>Just thought I will close this thread, we are able to submit with 1.7.5 but finally decided to submit with 1.8.0.1 to be safe.</p>
<p>1.8.0.1 had broken 2 - 3 items in our regression testing but all of them were code changes which helped make the application better.</p>
<p>Nick, thanks for all the help.</p>
