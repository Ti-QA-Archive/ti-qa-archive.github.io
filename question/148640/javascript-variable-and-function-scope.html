		<section>
			<p>win 7 android 4.2 Titanium 3.0. I was sure that this question would have been asked&#x2F;answered before but couldn&#39;t find it. On the other hand, it is strictly a very basic javascript question. If inappropriate for this forum, I&#39;m sure someone will tell me! Anyway, I&#39;m writing an android app for a galaxy s3 using appcelerator. I&#39;ve read all the information on scope that I&#39;ve been able to find online, but my question is still not answered. I&#39;ve read that a global variable (on defined outside of a function with the var keyword) can be accessed from anywhere in the current file and that a local variable (one defined in a function without the var) can only be accessed from within the function. I&#39;ve also read that it is next to horrific to use globals. I understand the reasons but I&#39;ve always found the need for them in C. My program uses multiple .js files, one of which houses the globals I use. I want to access those globals in another .js file. But it doesn&#39;t work even though defined with &#39;var&#39;. So, how do I access variables defined in one .js file, in other files, all local? Also, how do I do the same with functions? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.</p>

							<p>@ Doc here is your solution</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Ti.App.myvar=<span class="hljs-string">"This is my global var"</span>;
Ti.App.myArray=<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">Array</span>();
</code></pre><p>But these are app level variables the better would be to to make a common js module and pass the variable function as parameter as app level variables cause memory leakage</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>Here is the better method to do this suppose it is the function in one js file  which require name to display.Suppose the js file name is ShowMyName.js</p>

exports.exports = ShowMyName;

<span class="hljs-built_in">var</span> ShowMyName=<span class="hljs-keyword">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">''</span>ShowMyName<span class="hljs-string">");

ShowMyName.ShowMyName(name);</span>

										<p><p>Thanks Muhammed. I don&#39;t know what exports and require do, but I&#39;ll check them out and give it a try. There is so much erroneous information on the net and many answers to global type questions that are immediately followed by a rebuttal! thanks again.</p>

							<p>If you&#39;re searching the web for the answer you&#39;re going to get alot of different and aging answers. For your specific needs, you&#39;ll need to be searching for commonjs modules. commonjs is a way of modularizing your javascript code and the module spec is built into Titanium. The basic idea is this:</p>
<p>app.js</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var globals = require('globals')<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
Ti.API.info(globals.foo)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
globals.bar()<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>globals.js</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">exports.foo = <span class="hljs-string">"Bar"</span>;

exports.bar = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
    alert(<span class="hljs-string">"Foo"</span>);
};
</code></pre><p>No matter which file you require globals.js in, the variables within will always maintain their value. It may really be a bad idea to call or even consider these as globals, but its the way you get around using actual global variables using commonjs.</p>
