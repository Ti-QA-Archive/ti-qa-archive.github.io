			<p>Tried Titanium on Win XP, installed, checked documentation, reinstaleld, read posts on this error, tried every (I think) suggestions but this error still pops up and no app i emulator. Checked missing files with Filemon, no clue. Titanium seems very fragile, and when (if) it works it does it very slow.<br>Is anyone using it on XP?</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve used Titanium on XP just fine. In fact, for Android development I find it more reliable than using Titanium on my Mac. I can&#39;t hardly ever get the emulator to load on the Mac!</p>
<p>Sometimes adb hangs and you have to kill it. You could restart. But instead, press Ctrl + Shift + Esc. Go to the Processes tab. Find adb.exe and click End Process. Go back to Developer and try again. It will start a new instance of adb.</p>
<p>I read somewhere a suggestion that when you upgrade the Android SDK or any of its components (SDKs for example), you should delete all your virtual devices. Open android-sdk&#x2F;tools&#x2F;android.bat and use it to delete all the virtual devices. Titanium will re-create them. Maybe that would help you here, too?</p>
<p>Also, keep in mind that the emulator, adb, etc. are Google&#39;s tools. Ti is simply calling out to them to compile, install, and run your app. Slowness in the emulator, it hanging, etc. aren&#39;t Appcelerator&#39;s fault. The iOS emulator is significantly faster. But again, that&#39;s not Appcelerator&#39;s doing but Apple&#39;s.</p>

							<p>thanks Tim, it gave me new hope. I reexamined everything and used another screen. At first I got HVGA as standard and this doesn&#39;t work but WVGA800 does :)</p>
