			<h1>barImage intermittently not loading</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve got an app that uses a tab controller and a custom navBar image that a couple of the tabs have graphics butted to the bottom of it to appear larger. Very intermittently on the device the navBar barImage isn&#39;t loading and while the bar color is set very close to the image color it presents itself as a black line (the native shadow) inbetween the navBar and the graphic butted up to it. Switching tabs back and forth both causes and remedies the issue. I&#39;m not sure how to chase this bug at all, and I can&#39;t reliably reproduce it on demand but it happens often enough to notice it. I confirmed that it&#39;s the image not loading by setting the bar color to some disparate color and testing on device.</p>

										<p><p>Image path is fine, it works like 90% of the time. But just sometimes when you switch to the view it isn&#39;t displayed.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure what code would give an example, other than make an image for the navbar of one color and set the bar color to something completely different. But as I said it doesn&#39;t happen all the time and I don&#39;t have conditions that will with any certainty reproduce it.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll try and write a use case that might do it, if i can get it to replicate I&#39;ll post that code.</p>

										<p><p>I should also add, and this might be another question entirely, but when ever I open a modal window, as the modal is sliding up the custom bar image for the window behind goes away. This only happens as the modal is animating in, it&#39;s fine as it animates out. Seems like it might be related but i could be mistaken.</p>

										<p><p>stupid thought give the image a index of 99 just to make sure it is always on top. It maybe that the other components are hiding it…</p>
