			<h1>No iOS item found after installing Titanium Studio on Windows 7</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve just downloaded ans installed Appcelerator for Windows (win 7), I&#39;m going to start iOS development. After installing several prerequisites, finally the main Studio was installed, also the initial update process was performed, but surprisingly there is no iOS in the studios section, there are only items for Android &amp; Blackberry, and also another named as Mobile Web. Where is actually the iOS? should I download anything else? What is missing?</p>

										<p><p>@Ali Hosseini I will be moderating this question</p>
<p>As much as you want the answer to be different; Shannon is correct, no Mac no iOS development.</p>
<p>This will not change so I am marking the question as answered.</p>

							<p>Can I install XCode on windows? I&#39;ve seen iOS in Appcelerator install guide images, where is it coming from? I think XCode can be installed only on Mac, so how can Appcelerator be used for iOS development on Windows?</p>

										<p><p>Conversely, you need Windows to do Windows Mobile development (when Titanium adds support). It&#39;s not a Titanium thing, it&#39;s a &quot;company that controls how you can build stuff for their platform&quot; thing.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks my friends, but I had searched a lot in last few days and I was told that Appcelerator is an environment for developing iOS in Windows!!! So you mean that I should totally forget it?</p>
