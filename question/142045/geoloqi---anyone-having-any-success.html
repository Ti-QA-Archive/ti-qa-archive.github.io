			<h1>Geoloqi - Anyone Having any Success?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Application type: mobile<br>Titanium SDK: 2.1.2 GA<br>Platform &amp; version: iOS 5.0<br>Device: iOS simulator, iPhone 4s<br>Host Operating System: OSX 10.6.8<br>Titanium Studio: 2.1.2.201208301612<br>Geoloqi: 1.0</p>
<p>All,</p>
<p>I have been trying to use Geoloqi in conjunction with ACS and am not having much success. I was wondering if anyone else is having better luck than I am. </p>
<p>Here is what I am trying to accomplish:</p>
<p> 1.Application logs into Geoloqi using geoloqi.init</p>
<p> 2.Create a geoloqi default layer</p>
<p> 3.Log into ACS</p>
<p> 4.Create a geoloqi anonymous user using my current ACS user</p>
<p> 5.Subscribe my geoloqi anonymous user to my default layer.</p>
<p>I can see steps 1-4 being successful, but registering my new anon user to the default layer that was just successfully created results in a 404 or 403 depending on how I do it. </p>
<p>I am absolutely pulling my hair out on this. If anyone can help, I would appreciate it. If I can&#39;t get this to run, I may just have to bail on the geofencing for the time being, although that is the real selling point of the app.</p>

							<div><p>I just came here to get help with the module. But I am unable to get the module to import into Ti Studio.</p>
<p>I put the zip file in ~&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium and can&#39;t get Ti Studio to import it.</p>
<p>Once I can figure out how to get the module loaded, I will be attempting to use it and I&#39;ll let you know what I see.</p>

							<p>Apologies if it&#39;s not obvious, but users are already subscribed to the &quot;default&quot; layer when they are created. You shouldn&#39;t need to subscribe again, which may be the reason you&#39;re seeing the &quot;403&quot; error.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Aaron, and thanks for the reply. Unfortunately I didn&#39;t pick that up.  I am going to change my code to see if that works. Fingers are crossed…</p>

										<p><p>Aaron, help me understand this correctly. When I create my app on Geoloqi&#39;s website, a default layer is created specific to the app? If that is correct, are there dimensions to this layer?</p>

										<p><p>Hi Aaron, </p>
<p>I went on the above assumption. I created my anon user, then tried to send a broadcast message using my default layer, my current coordinates, and a radius of 500m. I keep getting a 403 access denied error every time.  I am now assuming the anonymous user is trying to send the message instead of the app but I just don&#39;t know. Is there a parameter missing? Perhaps my keys or apn token?</p>
<p>Is there any way I can talk or chat with you or someone else at Geoloqi to straighten this out? I really think it will take all of 10-15 minutes to go over my app flow if we can just do a continuous dialog. I don&#39;t need code help, just clarification on my concept.</p>
<p>Much appreciated,<br>Bruce</p>

										<p><p>Sure thing, hop into the #geoloqi IRC channel on freenode. If you don&#39;t already have an IRC client, you can join from a web client by following the link at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;community.geoloqi.com&#x2F;irc&#x2F;">community.geoloqi.com&#x2F;irc</a></p>
