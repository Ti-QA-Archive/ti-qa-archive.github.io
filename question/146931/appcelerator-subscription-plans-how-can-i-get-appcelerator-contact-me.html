			<h1>Appcelerator subscription plans. How can I get Appcelerator contact me???</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I have requested a sales contact through the &quot;Plans &amp; Pricing&quot; area of the site with no luck at all. I am sure I have requested this contact at least 5 times and nobody contacted me, not even a miserable template email.</p>
<p>What is up with you Appcelerator sales team? You don&#39;t want to sell or what?</p>
<p>Hope this triggers that someone contacts me and provide me pricing details on the Standard package.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>Mario</p>

							<div><p>@Mario well this kind of question is replied usually by the sales team but if they are not contacting you as you said this is really a genuine issue.</p>

							<div><p>Hi Mario, I am getting or rather not getting the same silent treatment. I don&#39;t get it, don&#39;t these guys want our business?<br>If by some godly luck you hear from them, can you PLEASE find out what the overage charges are? No where to be found and no one from Appcelerator is responding to the forum question.</p>
<p>Time to maybe look for another solution….any suggestions?</p>

							<div><p>Hi John. Thanks for your answer, at least I am not the only one with this lack of contact from Appcelerator.</p>
<p>I will let you know whatever I get from them. </p>
<p>Regarding alternatives. I am seriously looking at other things, I want a clear pricing plan. Take a look at the following list:</p>

							<div><p>@Christian. I already contacted Coreen Head, just to clarify that I contacted her and no one from Appcelerator had the initiative to contact me. Thanks for your offering anyway!</p>
<p>@John. According to the email disclaimer on appcelerator, I cannot forward you the information, however, I can advice you to contact Coreen Head (chead@appcelerator.com), she was absolutely helpful and provided me some interesting details.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>Mario</p>

							<div><p>Hi Mario - I apologize for the mixup.  I&#39;m on the sales team here.  We&#39;re definitely invested in your success, and I&#39;ll be happy to personally make sure that someone reaches out to you.  Where are you located?  I&#39;d be more than happy to ask the appropriate territory manager to give you a call.</p>

							<p>Hi Mario, from the dev link or expert point link on the right side of this question window, pick up a guy from appcelerator with appcelerator logo and use dev mail to mail them about it.</p>
<p>this way you may get response much early, as expected.</p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t think this is serious. Why I should be begging Appcelerator to contact me? I have sent several contact requests, more oever I have emailed a couple of appcelerator emails I found. This should be it.</p>
<p>If not, I&#39;ll have to consider changing platform.</p>
