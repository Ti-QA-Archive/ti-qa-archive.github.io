			<h1>Application Loader: What Do I Upload? - OR - How to Make a Production Release with Titanium Studio</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Ok, so I have everything ready to submit with my first app to the iTunes store.  I have my Distribution Profile in place, I have the app created in iTunes Connect and it&#39;s listed as &quot;Waiting for Upload&quot;.  I am in the Application Loader, and I am looking for something to actually upload.</p>
<p>What, exactly, am I looking for?  </p>
<p>Or, another way (maybe?) of asking the same question might be:  Is it possible to create something like a Production or Distribution build within Titanium Studio?  Or is this something I need to do in xCode?  Either way, how do I create and then find the file (or files?) that I upload with Application Loader?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p><em>Application type: mobile. Titanium SDK: 2.0.2. Platform &amp; version: iOS 5.x. Device: iOS simulator. Host Operating System: OSX 10.7.3. Titanium Studio: 2.0.2</em></p>

							<p>In TitaniumStudio, near where you click run&#x2F;debug, there is a little brown box&#x2F;trunk&#x2F;chest icon. It opens and there is an option Distribute - Apple Itunes Store. It runs you through a wizard of about 3 pages, asks for permission to access the keychain, then after a while launches xcode and you should be at the Organizer.  Select your app on the left if it isn&#39;t already, select the archive you want to submit from (newest at the top).  You can validate the package to ensure no glaring errors (missing icons: did you put your 72x72 one in for ipad? Yes, even if its not an ipad app)  If all is good, Click distribute and Submit to iOS App Store.</p>
<p>This assumes latest released version of xCode 4.3.x or higher, some of the buttons moved around from 4.2</p>

										<p><p>And ALWAYS perform a project clean before package.  I dont&#39; care what anyone else tells you, just do it.  They swear the scripts will always perform a clean on their own, but don&#39;t trust them.  Your app has to wait 7-10 days for an audience with the app reviewer.  If something is amiss, you get thrown back into the queue.</p>

										<p><p>Ok, I get to the Organizer, select the most recent archive, and click Validate.  I&#39;m told &quot;No identities are available for signing.&quot;</p>
<p>Not sure what step I skipped, or did wrong.  Just a quick check list:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the Provisioning Portal, I have a Distribution Certificate with a Provisioning Profile for the app.</li>
<li>In iTunes Connect, the app has been created and is &quot;Waiting for Upload&quot;.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Question: Does the App ID in iTunes connect need to match the App ID in the iOS Provisioning portal?  &#39;Cause they are not even close.  In the Prov. Portal the App ID looks like this:</p>
<p>V997SNXXXX.com.mydomain.myappname</p>
<p>And in iTunes Connect it looks like this:</p>
<p>53781XXXX</p>
<p>Also, when I go into xCode and look at the Build Settings under Code Signing &gt; Code Signing Identity, the Release option is set to &quot;iPhone Developer (currently matched iPhone Developer Casey Crookston&quot;.  I assume this should be &quot;iPhone Distribution&quot;?  But, no option with &quot;iPhone Distribution&quot; is also says &quot;matches Casey Crookston&quot;.</p>
<p>Any advice would be awesome!  Thanks!</p>

										<p><p>Sorry, was on client premise today. <em>sigh</em></p>
<p>I hope I didn&#39;t sound nasty about the testing on hardware.  I firmly believe that about 80% of the &quot;my app got reject, titanium&#x2F;phonegap&#x2F;xcode&#x2F;eclipse sucks&quot; threads on the internet come from folks who build, test only on simulators and then submit.  Any time low bidders with shoddy testing habits&#x2F;budgets enter a market, it damages the overall reputation of the industry.  Saw it with graphics, web, pc repair, you name it.</p>
