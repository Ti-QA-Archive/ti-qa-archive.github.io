							<div><p>I figured out why the phone pad disappears: for some reason the focus is lost for the text field. When I click back in the text field the phone pad re-appears. Now I just need to figure out why the focus drops.<br>Thanks Anthony.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Quick tip; if you have focus&#x2F;blur issues, add an event listener for each input to debug to console for both blur and focus events, include the name of each input in the console line.  This way you can see the sequence and track down the errant input that is not working as you thought it would.</p>

							<p>Ok, I thought I would add my discoveries in case it helps another.</p>
<p>I am running 2.1.4.GA, Android 4.1.2 API 16. My emulator is a custom creation for the Nexus 7, 1280X800 with 1024MB for RAM (quick aside, you must have the &quot;MB&quot; at the end of 1024 in the emulator specs or it will crash). I am running Windows 7 with 8GB of RAM (I know, shameful for a developer). Anyways, when I fire up the debug it takes a while to install the app, which makes me impatient. When I get to the page with the phone pad text field, I want to test it. I was immediately clicking in the field and experiencing the loss of focus when the phone pad appeared. I decided to try some patience, thanks to both Malcolm and Anthony. I found, if I gave my emulator a few seconds after showing the page, to fully load the page, then click in the text field, the loss of focus did not occur. I think my issue might be the light system on which I am developing.<br>So, patience fixed the issue (I have not experienced it since).</p>
<p>Thank you Malcolm and Anthony for the patience to respond to a question with little information behind it.</p>
