			<h1>How to deploy my app to my client via TestFlight?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I installed TestFlight and registered it on my iPad. My client did the the same. I see him in my Team on TestFlight. So now we&#39;re stuck…I don&#39;t know how to actually get the app to him. I saw some reference about uploading something to Apple, but I already registered his UDID on developer.apple.com. Not sure if I did that right. I can Export his Device, and I get a little text file with his UDID in it. I have no idea what to do with it. TestFlight does not explain this part at all. My app appears in MY TestFlight on MY iPad – but doesn&#39;t show up for him. Help.</p>

							<div><p>Note: This support page on TestFlight omits the key piece of info I need:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.testflightapp.com&#x2F;kb&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;becoming-a-tester</p>
<p>They say &quot;the developer still needs to create the build with your device included&quot;. But I can&#39;t find anywhere on their support site HOW to create a build with their device included.</p>

							<div><p>I think I figured this out halfway. I added another person&#39;s iPad (my tester&#x2F;client) to the Distribution Profile on apple developer site and was able to create a new distribution profile. I downloaded it and installed it in Xcode. But Xcode doesn&#39;t like it: &quot;Valid signing identity not found&quot;. Back to this again. I fought with these types of problems for 6 hours over the past 2 days and finally somehow got through it. Now I&#39;m back and have no idea how to solve this problem. Help.</p>

							<p>Download the Provision Profile from Apple, follow the instructions in [https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Deploying+to+iOS+devices] - the &#39;Build your app, embedding the profile within the app&#39;s bundle&#39; section.  Once you do this, the App will be installed into your iTunes.  Go to the project\build\iphone\build\Debug-iphoneos directory and you&#39;ll find an .ipa you upload to testflight.</p>

							<p>Add their deviceid to our Team Profile on the Apple Dev website</p>
<p>redownload the profile (or refresh in Xcode Organizer)</p>
<p>under your build settings, change the &#39;release&#39; setting to use the Team profile</p>
<p>edit your build&#x2F;run, so that Archive runs the &#39;release&#39; setting</p>
<p>archive your project</p>
<p>when it finishes building and opens Organizer, click the &#39;share&#39;, and upload that file to testflight</p>
<p>Send other person the link generated at the end of the Testflight</p>
<p>The end</p>
