			<h1>iOS7 distribution&#39;s window backgroundImage is plain black</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,<br>Apple just approved my latest app update and on installing, it seems all the background images for the windows are simply plain black, however in the simulators and debugging on the device the background showed up fine.<br>The image file for the background image is bgimage.jpg, so there are no case-sensitive issues. (located in the <code>images</code> folder)</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var win1 = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
    <span class="hljs-string">title :</span> <span class="hljs-string">'Home'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-string">backgroundImage :</span> <span class="hljs-string">'/images/bgimage.jpg'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-string">barColor :</span> <span class="hljs-string">'#369'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-string">navTintColor :</span> <span class="hljs-string">'#fff'</span>
});
</code></pre><p>I have not set the backgroundColor.<br>Please advise.</p>

							<div><p>I checked the built IPA file and it did not even include the bgimage.jpg file (or the images folder for that matter). Does having a <code>&amp;#x2F;</code> in the front of the file path make a difference, or does the distro just not support jpg images? I know this is a strange issue, so I really appreciate all the help!</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>This is not meant as a solution but a potential way to test your tests as if it was a store delivered app.</p>
<p>Create an adhoc certificate and compile for adhoc (rather than app store).  The resulting app &quot;should&quot; be the same as one that goes through the app store compile process.</p>

										<p><p>I will try that, but I will only have access to the machine that those certificates are installed on tomorrow. Is there any way to get it to compile (all I need is the .ipa&#x2F;.app just to see if the files are included)</p>

										<p><p>As the file that is created is actually a zip file by another name - you should be able to rename the file extension to .zip and then open it up as if it was any other zip file.  The file will then not be suitable for submission - you will need to create another when you are ready.  But it should let you go and take a look around.</p>

										<p><p>I can easily do this with any of the simulator or device debug builds. However, I cannot compile any distrobution builds on my machine due to not having the needed certificates. Do you know of a way to get around this? The app obviously doesn&#39;t need to be submitted to Apple, just unzipped and inspected.</p>

										<p><p>I am assuming you can at least compile for iTunes - if not then you this will not help you.</p>
<p>If you can compile to iTunes then do so and then;</p>
<ul>
<li>Locate the app in iTunes</li>
<li>Right click the app and choose <strong>Show in Finder</strong></li>
<li>Click the filename so you can edit it</li>
<li>Rename <strong>ipa</strong> to <strong>zip</strong></li>
<li>Agree to the confirmation for this action</li>
<li>Double click the newly typed zip file (or choose open)</li>
<li>A single file will be displayed, right click this</li>
<li>Select <strong>Show Package Contents</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This will show you everything inside the ipa file that has been compiled.</p>
<p>The problem is however that this shows you the development version and not the app store version - there may be some differences.</p>
<p>It would be worth starting the simulator and using the <strong>Reset Content and Settings…</strong> option from the <strong>iOS Simulator</strong> menu.  Keep in mind this will RESET all properties, remove apps and wipe the simulator back to empty - only do this if you are happy that nothing will be there afterwards.</p>
<p>Once you have rest the simulator run the app again - this will now have no previous installs in the simulator that may previously have pushed files or settings that right now may be causing false positives on file and setting entries.</p>
<p>Obviously if you have no access to the certificates for distribution - you cannot compile for distribution - there is no real way around that.</p>

										<p><p>Did it get included in the iTunes file?  If it did not, try creating a brand new blank app and add that single image and a reference to it in the app.  The compile for Itunes and check again.  Any difference?</p>

										<p><p>Yes, it is included and the background displays fine in the Simulator and the iTunes file (iPhone debug) contains the image, as expected, and displays it fine in the app.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks everybody for all the great tips and ideas, much appreciated! It turned out the person compiling the app ended up deleting the folder that the image was located in, causing this whole dilemma. I just recreated the folder and copied the images, and it all compiles with the folder located inside the IPA, so I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll work.</p>

							<p>I had an issue like this once with a .png file that was not really a .png (just named as one).  Is it possible your .jpeg is not a real jpeg ?</p>
