			<h1>HttpClient JSON post fails with large data</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am uploading an image (as base64encode) to a Json webservice. This works fine for Android for any image size, and works fine for iOS for smaller images (&lt; 200k). But when I try to send an image over 200k on iOS I never get a response from the web service, in fact the web service never even seems to receive the post, and the httpclient eventually hits the 60 second timeout (which is way more time than is actually required). After timeout the httpclient status is returned as &#39;0&#39;, and with a null ResponseText.</p>
<p>Has anyone else had this problem posting larger amounts of data to a Json web service from iOS? Is there a setting for iOS required to allow larger data, or a restriction with the httpclient in iOS?</p>

							<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>it seems unusual to send binaries as base64 in JSON. Normally you use standard procedure described <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;File_Uploads_and_Downloads">here</a>.</p>
<p>To analyze your problem you can use a web proxy (i.e. Burb Suite). with this proxyyou can sniff&#x2F;track the traffic between your device and the server.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Rainer,</p>
<p>Thanks for the tips. I have also tried using the standard procedure by sending the image binary, but the problem still exists. It seems as soon as the post goes over a certain size the post never gets sent. I have installed HTTPScoop on my mac and I see other web service calls from my app, and also see this call when the image size is small, but I never see a post get registered in HTTPScoop once the size goes beyond approx 200k.</p>
