			<h1>App crashes are back</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a one-tab app that manages several windows, opened by a simple Ti.UI.currentTab.open(win).<br>There are modals and popovers that occasionally can be opened on top of them.<br>I had customers complaining a few months bac, reporting crashes (back in TiSDK 1.7.2). After updating to TiSDK 1.8 they magically disappeared and they were all happy with that.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been working on a major update now for a couple of months, that includes upgrading my app to TiSDK 2.1.3 ( tried all of the 2.x ), and the crashes are back.<br>If I open and close windows too fast, the app will crash. If I show&#x2F;hide popovers too fast, the app will crash. It&#39;s not even a random thing, it will happen quite systematically.</p>
<p>the info I can give so far is:<br>Multi-context app - TiSDK 2.1.3 - iOS 5.x &#x2F; 6.x</p>

							<div><p>Thats not nearly enough info. If you need help with apps crashing, you&#39;re going to need to provide your FULL environment, along with crash logs, error output, and probably some sample code the reproduces your issue. If you have any questions on how to provide any of that, please refer to the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.1&#x2F;index.html#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Using_Questions_and_Answers">Using QA</a> page and pay special attention to the QA Checklist.</p>

							<div><p>I think it would take more time to try reproduce the crashes (create the same structure) than finding a solution to it. I&#39;m just asking if I&#39;m the only one reporting this or it&#39;s happened to someone else since upgrading. I know how to use the Q&amp;A, and I knew that someone would&#39;ve pointed that it&#39;s not enough info.<br>I&#39;ll try to make a dummy app and see if anyone will take time to download the source code, compile it and then confirming the crashes.</p>

							<p>Well, you didn&#39;t provide nearly enough info to give you an exact answer, but I have one possible suggestion…</p>
<p>&quot;If I open and close windows too fast, the app will crash. If I show&#x2F;hide popovers too fast, the app will crash.&quot; &lt;&lt; I remember I had problems when animations weren&#39;t finished, if I tried another animation apps would crash. The solution is probably going to not animate the &quot;fast&quot; closings.</p>

										<p><p>thank you Shannon. That fixed <em>most</em> of the crashes. I will probably prepare a dummy example before I publish my app, but I guess what Titanium still suffers is animating windows from one side to the other of the screen. I have this window closing (moving from left to right). If before the window has finished the animation (like 200ms before) I click on the button to open a modal, the app will systematically crash. I had to remove all the animations that made look cool my app, but at least now it works. Thank you for your help!</p>
