			<h1>Working with Databases</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>We are working on starting a new iPhone app and I just wanted to get some thoughts on the process and best practices.</p>
<p>We have an existing website, that runs off of a MySQL database and how thousands of records (mostly general contact information). On the website, those files are constantly updated with new records and editing the existing.</p>
<p>We want to create an iPhone app that merely looks at those records and pulls the data. We have no intent on having anything be updated from the iPhone.</p>
<p>So, is it recommended to access the external database to pull those records? Is that done with JSON? And could that cause security issues?</p>
<p>Or, should we duplicate the database and run it locally? But if we do that, what is a good method to update?</p>
<p>I just want to make sure that I provide the correct experience because we are concerned about the speed of the application &amp; how to update.</p>
<p>Thank you for all of your help!</p>

							<p>For something that is constantly updating, I would suggest creating a simple API layer to your database. Basically some interface on your servers that turns the database info into JSON and transports that to the device. The downside of this is, of course, if there is no network connection, then there is no way to access the data. But it allows you to keep real time data in your app.</p>
<p>The problem with storing the database on the device is that you have to transfer between databases. MySQL to sqlite each time you want to store or update the database. </p>
<p>If you don&#39;t have to run queries on the data, then it would be possible to pull the data in JSON as above and store the json on the device. That way, if there is no network connection, you at least have the latest database information that can be displayed.</p>
<p>As for security, just make sure that you are transferring your JSON data via HTTPS and you should be good to go.</p>
