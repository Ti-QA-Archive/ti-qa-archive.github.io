							<div><p>Great suggestion, Gagan! Thank you for making it! :)</p>
<p>It would be great if people would go through their <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;myqa">My Q&amp;A</a> page to review their past questions. For each one, even if no-one provided a <em>perfect</em> suggestion, simply add the actual solution as a comment under the <strong>answer that helped you most</strong> and mark it best.</p>
<p>That said, thanks to everyone for making the community the helpful and amiable one that it generally is. :D</p>

							<p>This would be great if marking the &quot;best answer&quot; didn&#39;t lock the thread.  Just because you received a &quot;best answer&quot; doesn&#39;t mean there won&#39;t be a better one later.  Also, it prevents future visitors to that question from asking for additional info.</p>

										<p><p>^^ You can&#39;t comment on a thread&#x2F;answer after the OP has marked a &quot;best answer&quot;.  My point was that it would be nice if <strong>additional answers or comments</strong> were allowed after a &quot;best answer&quot; had been marked.</p>
<p>Also, it would be nice if you could edit your answers or comments after you&#39;ve posted them.</p>

										<p><p>Actually, while at one time it was true that a question was locked after an answer was marked &quot;best&quot;, that is no longer true.  Now both answers and comments are allowed unless the question has been explicitly locked by Appcelerator staff (typically for topics such as bringing up something in Apple beta under NDA etc).</p>
<p>Ironically, that is when we also lost the ability to edit as well.</p>
<p>Two steps forward, one step back…</p>

										<p><p>yes i also believe that by making lock on the question will not allow to get the best solution for that in the later stage.</p>
