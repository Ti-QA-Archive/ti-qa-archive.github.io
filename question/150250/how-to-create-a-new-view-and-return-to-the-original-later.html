		<section>
			<p>Hi all,</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// creating a main window, adding a view, opening it</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">win</span> =  Ti.UI.createWindow();
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> view1 = Ti.UI.createWebView( { url: url } );
<span class="hljs-keyword">win</span>.add( view1 );
<span class="hljs-keyword">win</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>();

<span class="hljs-comment">// display a new view using a third-party module</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> view2 = thirdPartyModule.createView();
<span class="hljs-keyword">win</span>.add( view2 );
</code></pre><p>I&#39;m using a third-party module as above. It displays the second view correctly and all UI on it work, but when I close the second view, the app returns to the first view but it no longer responds to any touch. </p>
<p>It seems that the app is still running (not crashed) because on Android the hardware-buttons respond correctly as I coded.</p>
<p>My question is, what is the right way to switch the view so that I can return to the first view without losing control of it?</p>
<p>This may be a basic question, but somehow I couldn&#39;t solve it. Any advice will be greatly appreciated…</p>

<p>Initially, the app opens the first window. This is the main view of the app.</p>
<p>If the user touches a button, the second view opens. This is another view created by the third-party module.</p>
<p>The user can close the second view by touching a close button on the second view. The second view closes, and the app returns to the first view.</p>
<p>Currently, the first view becomes uncontrollable (no response to any touch) after returning from the second view.</p>
<p>I&#39;d like to fix that.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Muhammad, thank you for answering.</p>
<p>I tried view2.show() but it didn&#39;t work. The second view did not appear.<br>Looks like I have to add view2 to the window to see it. </p>
<p>And in this case, I don&#39;t know how to catch the event that the second view is closed, because the view comes from a third-party module which I have no access to its buttons. Is there any way to know when it is closed?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot.</p>

							<p>very possible that the the second view is still &quot;there&quot; just hidden, blocking any events to the main view behind it. This could be because the view is not closed properly.</p>
<p>you should be able to test this by assigning a z-index to the windows - the higher the number the higher the view is on the stack - so for example, if you were to swap the main view z-index with the second view after you close it you could see if this is the case.</p>
<p>Addtiionally - you can cleanup the view by doing the following:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">win.remove(view2)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
view2 = null<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>as for capturing an on close event for your modules view&#x2F;window - i&#39;d love to help out, but not knowing what 3rd party module your using, i can&#39;t check out the documentation to help :)</p>

										<p><p>Hello Bert, thank you for answering.</p>
<p>I have made several experiments like your code, but got no luck. This may be the third-party module&#39;s problem, so I&#39;ll contact to tech support.  It&#39;s a kind of ad modules.</p>
