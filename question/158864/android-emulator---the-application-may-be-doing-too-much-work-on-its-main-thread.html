			<h1>Android Emulator - The application may be doing too much work on its main thread.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am using Titanium Studio 3.1.3 and for some reason I keep getting the error, &quot;The application may be doing too much work on its main thread.&quot;  I thought I was doing something wrong but even a opening just a basic window with a background color won&#39;t even work.  Any ideas???</p>

							<div><p>It does it no matter what code I have.  I thought maybe I was doing something wrong so I started new project and all I did was create a window.  I&#39;m not really sure what to do with this, I must have some setting wrong or something.  Everything works fine for iPhone&#x2F;ipad</p>

							<div><p>Okay, don&#39;t know what happened but the emulator is working fine now.  It has been messed up all day today and yesterday.  The message that I kept getting was, The application may be doing too much work on its main thread.  it also was saying that the choreographer skipped 37 processes.  Oh well it works now.</p>
