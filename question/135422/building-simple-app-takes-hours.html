			<p>After updating Snow Leopard to 10.6.8, XCode to 4.2 and Titanium Studio to 1.0.9 with MobileSDK 1.8.2 a clean build of a simple iPhone universal app with Appcelerator takes several hours (before it was updated it built clean within 2-3 minutes)! Even when compiling with XCode directly. It doesn&#39;t matter whether it&#39;s a clean simulator or release build.</p>
<p>A switch of used Mobile SDK in project settings hasn&#39;t changed anything. Also cleaning build folder, moving files to new project and so on.</p>
<p>The Titanium Console Window shows &quot;[Info] Compiling localization files&quot; during this time. Alternatively in XCode it shows preheader files compilation. The CPU consumption of the xcodebuild process (when using Appcelerator) is about 65%.</p>
<p>The build.log tail looks like the following without change for hours:</p>
<p>Starting Xcode compile with the following arguments:</p>

<p>xCode 4.2 was a memory hog. Tell us a little bit more about the hardware you are running.</p>
<p>I&#39;m curious if a regular Xcode project compiles ok.</p>

							<div><p>After last nights experience please let me describe it a bit more in detail…</p>
<p>1) Using Appcelerator for building fails (I killed the xcodebuild process after 12 hours). There is no error message during the build process.</p>
<p>2) Using XCode itself for building runs fine but needs a long time (several hours instead of minutes)</p>
<p>The machine used is a 64bit VMWare with 1,5GB memory and a 2,33GHz CPU core with the described software running on a 64bit CentOS host.</p>
<p>The xcodebuild process never took more than 75MB memory (although there is about 400MB still free available) and 65% CPU power with 5 to 6 threads.</p>
<p>Downgrading to XCode 4.1 shows the same behavior.</p>

							<div><p>Hi Oliver</p>
<p>You are using VMWare based MAc OS? well then might its the main problem why you getting such problem. Well i believe you rather try on the MAC pc as its have a very good performance on it.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

							<div><p>Nikunj is right, besides, MAC OS is not built for VMWare and is not recommended using on it.</p>

							<div><p>Unfortunately this will not solve the problem! Everything else is running fine. Additionally it worked like a charm before updating all the tools. So there must be real solution. Any ideas are welcome…</p>

							<div><p>The solution is to use a Mac.  Also, I dont believe Apple allows for virtualizing their OSX unless its within another OSX as the main OS…</p>

							<div><p>I have exactly the same problem, and I am using a real mac.  It is an old core2duo mac mini, I first encountered this when upgrading xcode from 3.2.6. to 4.2 so I have just done a clean install of Snow Leopard, applied all updates then installed xcode and titanium, so this is a software problem, not a vm issue.</p>
<p>It is interesting to see that xcode is still running, I assumed that it had died but I also get very heavy cpu usage.</p>

							<p>Unfortunately, I haven&#39;t. Changed to a MacBook, performance was very well for the same project, but the design coordinates were interpreted in another way than on the VM. I don&#39;t know why. The project finalization is on ice because of this.</p>
<p>One possible solution is a reinstall of the VMs content, I think. However, this is a very high efford.</p>
