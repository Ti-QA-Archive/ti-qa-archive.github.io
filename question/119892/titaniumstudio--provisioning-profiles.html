			<h1>TitaniumStudio &amp; Provisioning Profiles</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have been trying out TitaniumStudio, and in general I am very pleased that we are now getting a dedicated IDE.</p>
<p>Apart from the widely reported issue of not seeing debug messages, I have found that as soon as I add a provisioning profile to my project in order to test on a device (iPad 1 in this case), the app ceases to work in the simulator and hangs on startup screen on the device.</p>
<p>I can then no longer even work on the simulator.</p>
<p>Having completely removed and reinstalled Titanium SDKs etc. my app will start working again in the simulator. Adding the profile again has the same affect … therefore this si a repeatable issue that I am having.</p>
<p>I have tried using 1.6.2 and 1.7 SDKs and the same thing occurs in both.</p>
<p>I appreciate this is still a RC build but wonder if other have had the same issue.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Mark</p>

							<p>When you build for a device Titanium works out what modules you need and only includes them. Whereas simulator builds include all modules.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve found that Ti Studio is very bad at detecting required modules - namely for the UI.<br>To beat it I&#39;ve had to write to write in some &#39;pre app&#39; objects.</p>
<p>eg: at the top of my app.js I have</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">preWin = Ti.UI.createWindow({})
preView = Ti.UI.createView({})
preWin.<span class="hljs-built_in">add</span>(preView)

preLabel = Ti.UI.createLabel({})
preView.<span class="hljs-built_in">add</span>(preLabel)
<span class="hljs-comment">
//etc etc etc</span>
</code></pre><p>After building for device I find it&#39;s more efficient to delete the contents of the &#x2F;build&#x2F;iphone directory to force a full rebuild before trying to run in the simulator again.</p>
<p>Debug Issue:<br>Ti Studio is pointing to the 4.3 sdk folder<br>You need to create a symbolic link from there to the 4.3.X sdk folder.<br>There is a great post on this somewhere in the Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>The debug will reveal that it can&#39;t find a module if it hasn&#39;t been included with the build.</p>
