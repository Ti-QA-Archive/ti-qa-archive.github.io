			<h1>Unique Device Identifier allowed by Apple</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>I happen to develop an aplication for iOS that might restrict the number of devices on wich you can use it.<br>I&#39;m wondering if there is a clean and legal solution to do so… Somehow I should keep track of the devices that the user has logged in by collecting the unique device identifier.<br>I know that Apple had some issues with that in the past, when uploading the app to their store…</p>
<p>thanks in advance,</p>

							<p>UDID tracking is no longer allowed by Apple.  If you need to build the App for a specific range of users identified by their device then you can develop it as an <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;programs&#x2F;ios&#x2F;enterprise&#x2F;">Enterprise App</a></p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the your answer Nick, but that doesn&#39;t really fits my needs…<br>Maybe I didn&#39;t make my self clear before, but what I meant was limiting the number of devices per user. The app will be available for public in general is just that when you subscribe to the system only two devices of your property will be allowed to login…<br>I think that dropbox is using a similar business model, you subscribe to their service and you get to use it in several devices but not in an unlimited number.<br>For that purpose I wanted to keep the device id some how. Any alternative to UDID?</p>
<p>I found that <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;10&#x2F;the-new-way-we-udid&#x2F;">entry</a> at Appcelerator&#39;s blog, but didn&#39;t put much light on my doubt… </p>
<p>Is ti.platform.id persistent across app launches and app removal and reinstallation?? is it real transparent equivalent to the UDID??</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

										<p><p>No it&#39;s not.</p>
<p>However you can use a module that saves the udid in the keychain, that doesn&#39;t get deleted if the app is uninstalled.</p>
<p>Read more <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;benbahrenburg&#x2F;Securely&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;Documentation&#x2F;properties.md">here</a></p>
<p>I suggest you to check the Apple&#39;s TOS to see if they allow you to limit the number of devices a user can use the app on.</p>

										<p><p>I dont think <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dropbox.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;215&#x2F;en">DropBox</a> limit your device usage btw</p>
