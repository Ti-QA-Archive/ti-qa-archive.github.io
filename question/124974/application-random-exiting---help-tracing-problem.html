			<h1>Application random exiting - help tracing problem</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a pretty much complete application using a tab bar with two of the tabs having navigation controllers in them.</p>
<p>The application is heavy reliant on XML SOAP data.</p>
<p>The biggest issue that we are facing is random crashing - whereby the console does not log any errors - just that the application has exited.</p>
<p>Could anyone give some help with how I can gather a more detailed view of what is causing the random crashes? I&#39;m presuming they are due to memory problems - but I don&#39;t really know</p>

										<p><p>As you said, it could be a memory issue. Perhaps due to a memory leak in parsing the XML. Is there any chance of trying a JSON alternative for the data?</p>

										<p><p>This what I&#39;ve thought, I&#39;ve moved away from using getElementsByTagName in loops as I found this caused problems. Unfortunately not, asking for JSON was one of my first requests!</p>

										<p><p>If it would be feasible, you may be able to get around this by setting a proxy web server that converts the XML into JSON. Just as a last resort.</p>
<p>Are you using your own code to parse the XML or using an existing library? Maybe you can find something that&#39;s well optimized. I&#39;m not sure about this, maybe also  one of those jQuery <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jparse.kylerush.net&#x2F;">plugins</a> to be run inside of a webview or something (I have not tried anything close to that myself, just thinking out loud).</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m stripping off some crap with the js replace method (using regular expressons) then using Ti.XML.parseString to parse the xml.</p>
<p>I did this when I first started the app but was told that I wasn&#39;t able to host a proxy that converted it for me ;)</p>
<p>All the problems seems to resolve around parsing the XML and then putting it into table views</p>

										<p><p>I see.</p>
<p>If the XML is simple and predictable enough, you might be able to use regular expression matching. Other than that, I hope someone with more experience in XML than myself would step in and help out.</p>

										<p><p>It&#39;s reasonable simple, but not very predictable.</p>
<p>Most annoying thing is that try {} catch(){} statements don&#39;t catch this problem :s</p>
