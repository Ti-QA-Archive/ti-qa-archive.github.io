			<h1>App Memory Usage on 4th Gen (Low Memory crash)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a completed application that runs great on 2nd Gen iPods, as well as iPhone 3GS and 4.  However, when running the app on a 4th Gen iPod, low memory crashes are not uncommon at all.</p>
<p>When I run the app through XCode using the &quot;Activity Monitor&quot; performance tool, I noticed that the application requires roughly 2 to 3 times as much &quot;Real Memory&quot;.  For example, while the app is consistently between 30-35 MB on the 2nd Gen iPod, on the 4th Gen it fluctuates between 70 to 100 MB (hence the low memory crash).</p>
<p>Has anyone else run into this?  Is this drastic increase in memory usage on the 4th Gen to be expected?  It&#39;s kind of ridiculous to get frequent crashes on the new device that has twice as much memory, when I&#39;ve never had any problems with memory on the older 2nd Gen.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, I can. Mike, does this problem still occur after switching the mobile sdk to v1.5? Also. I just created a premium support ticket on this. I&#39;ll keep you posted.</p>

							<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>I apologize that this isn&#39;t an answer to your question, but I&#39;m really interested to learn more about what you&#39;re doing here. I have built two distinct apps, and they both have performance issues. Lots of crashing on the iPhone 3G, and even some sluggish performance on the 3GS and iPhone 4.</p>
<p>According to Instruments, both apps are using about 35MB of real memory and 314MB of virtual memory.</p>
<p>How did you determine that your crashes were low memory crashes? Is that indicated somewhere?</p>
<p>Is it possible to change the iPhone simulator hardware profile so that you can test on older devices? I know you can switch between iPhone and iPhone 4, but that seems to just be for screen size.</p>
<p>Anyway, maybe we can work on this together to figure out how to diagnose and resolve these performance issues.</p>

										<p><p>If you open up XCode Organizer (under the &quot;Window&quot; toolbar option), select your device on the left toolbar, then select the &quot;Device Logs&quot; tab, it should pull a list of crashes that have occurred on the device.</p>
<p>As for changing the simulator hardware profile, I haven&#39;t experimented with that myself.  I don&#39;t think you can depend on the simulator to faithfully mimic hardware limitations related to memory, though.</p>
<p>Your real memory and virtual memory sound pretty reasonable, not high enough to cause a crash on an iPhone 3GS or 4 (from my limited experience).</p>
<p>Are you able to run with the &quot;Leaks&quot; performance tool?  The application frequently closes when I try, so I&#39;ve had to rely on the Activity Monitor.</p>
<p>Is your application very table-heavy?  Mine basically consists of grouped table views, a moderately sized SQLite database, and a few scattered icons.  Nothing out of the ordinary.</p>

							<p>Thanks for your response, Mike.</p>
<p>Yes, I can get the Leaks tool to work. I always have to build the app in Xcode first, then run it with the Leaks tool. The iPhone app closes then reopens with the Leaks data collecting. I haven&#39;t seen anything other than <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;64651&#x2F;memory-leaks">this leak</a> on my app, though.</p>
<p>My app only has one table. It does have about 1MB worth of images (which doesn&#39;t seem heavy to me, but you never know). I also have an SQLite DB that&#39;s about 2.4MB.</p>
<p>Overall, I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m doing anything crazy, but I&#39;m still plagued with crashes and slowness on 3G and 3GS. I wish Appcelerator could offer some performance tips.</p>

										<p><p>I just tried again and got the &quot;Low Memory&quot; symptoms where the app goes black and I can&#39;t do anything but quit. There wasn&#39;t a low memory report in Organizer, so I suppose that it means memory wasn&#39;t an issue. I was only around 25MB of real memory at the time, too. </p>
<p>I wish I knew what reasonable memory tolerances were for an app. For example, if you&#39;re using more than 40MB, you&#39;ll have trouble on devices X, Y, Z, and so on. Some kind of performance guide from Appcelerator would be great.</p>
