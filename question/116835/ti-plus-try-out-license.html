							<p>Hear you all loud and clear.  Please see my response on the blog.  We went out with an initial offering that was similar to our Pro offering but with a lot more value and a free module SDK with sample modules to roll your own.  We&#39;re collecting feedback over the next couple weeks to make sure we&#39;re looking at all the entire picture from everyone&#39;s perspective.  Feel free to drop me a line with any thoughts (sschwarzhoff at appcelerator dot com)</p>

							<p>There are definitely some cool modules in the Plus package, but $2500 per year is bit steep for even a small business such as us.  </p>
<p>Given some of the &quot;buggyness&quot; I&#39;ve run into while developing our first app, I&#39;m not confident enough to throw down that much cash.</p>
<p>The whole mobile market is in such demand and you know that old adage about price and demand.  :-)</p>

							<p>In my opinion, $2,500 is asking <em>way</em> too much for about 8 or so modules that we can barely even try out, and only (For me, anyways) 1 or 2 that I would actually use (SMS and In-App Purchase).</p>
<p>I was hoping for a &quot;Module Package&quot;, something like a couple bucks a month and get access to all (Or some? You get to choose?) of the Modules for as long as you pay. I wouldn&#39;t mind doing that. But $2,500&#x2F;year for a couple modules… Asking WAY too much for small developers like myself.</p>

							<p>Same here: I&#39;m also interested in the Plus modules and I&#39;am also interested in supporting appceleretor - as they are doing a great job and offering a great SDK for free.</p>
<p>But 2.500 $ is a lot too much to afford for me.</p>
<p>I personaly don&#39;t need standard or premium support and early product access - so why do you not think about an extra model like a &quot;module package&quot; and&#x2F;or a &quot;pay per module&quot; plan? This would be a great way for appcelerator to earn extra revenue without extra work (no support).</p>
<p>And I&#39;m shure that (if the price is right) you will reach many more developers that are willing to pay a small fee than to focus to the &quot;big&quot; developers only.</p>
<p>In my opinion a good price would be about 500$&#x2F;Year for all Plus modules or 100$&#x2F;year per single Plus modul. </p>
<p>keep up the good work and give &quot;smaller&quot; developers the change to support appcelerator!</p>
<p>Just my 2 cent :)</p>

							<p>Agree. To me, this is crazy. I only need one module, I might as well go hire an actual app developer to do what I need to do rather than pay $2500 and it would still cost me 1&#x2F;4 of the cost. You might want to consider selling single modules.</p>
<p>Originally I was evaluating the module, now I will likely scrap Titanium because it doesn&#39;t really fit into the small business way. Especially when you are a single developer with one idea that you want to create.</p>
<p>Looks to me it&#39;s back to the drawing board and using XCode.</p>

										<p><p>I agree, and I&#39;m diving into native Android development as well.<br>I think the major mis-thought on the current policy is, that only big companies need the &quot;big&quot; features. I hope that there will be some insight. I really like the Appcelerator platform</p>

										<p><p>magtek. i could always figure out how to use the external accessory feature in xcode, but like most, i&#39;m no objc programmer so starting over will cost alot of time. unfortunately the cost is a huge thing. be nice to get single module purchases.</p>
