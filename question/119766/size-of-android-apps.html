			<h1>Size of Android apps</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I created an app that is a 1,5MB apk and it&#39;s installed size is 4,2MB. I understand the runtime needs to be compiled with the app but I have read several threads about the size of apps being reduced in 1.6?</p>
<p>I read about apps with 700Kb apk&#39;s but I just created a test app with only a window and a tabgroup that was already 1.8MB which is also weird since my functional app with images is 1,5MB…? I would be really happy if the installed size could be under 1MB but I think this is not possible using Appcelerator?</p>
<p>Sorry if this question has been answered before but I searched for this and just couldn&#39;t find a good answer…</p>

							<p>Nobody with any insight on this? I would also appreciate it if regular users with simple apps would post their app size here so I can compare them!</p>
