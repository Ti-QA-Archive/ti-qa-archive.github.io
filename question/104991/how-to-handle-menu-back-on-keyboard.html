			<h1>how to handle menu back on keyboard</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>hi,</p>
<p>how can i detect a click on the hardware back button while a keyboard is visible?<br>i want to know, when the user hides the keyboard using the back button.</p>
<p>the textfield is in a modal window…</p>
<p>edit: but it&#39;s the same for heavyweight windows</p>
<p>edit2:<br>after finished typing i have 2 ways to close the keyboard. </p>
<ol>
<li>make the TextField loose focus with TextField.blur();</li>
<li>using the hardware back button.</li>
</ol>
<p>i need to detect the second case to programmatically make the textfield loose focus. catching the &quot;blur&quot; event i initiate various things that can not be done using the &quot;change&quot; event.</p>

<p>Try this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">win.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'android:back'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span></span>{
  textField.blur();  
});
</code></pre><p>If this is not what you want, please would you mind clarifying your question and I, or someone, will try again?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>unfrotunatly, it doesn&#39;t work. i don&#39;t even recieve the event.<br>i made a use case: (link to code)[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;q9kxLyLZ]</p>
<p>when clicking back while keyboard open, nothing happens. but when clicking back without keyboard, i get the property: e.source correct as Ti.UI.Window</p>

										<p><p>I think it would be better if you explain what you are trying to achieve. What information do you want e.source to return and what will you do with it? What functionality are you aiming for, from a user perspective?</p>
<p>By the way, although your use-cases are nice and simple, they aren&#39;t really use-cases because they need to be modified in order for them to work. Remember to include the createWindow() parts to make it easier for those helping you to test your code.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>When you click the back button while the keyboard is visible, the keyboard will be closed. I don&#39;t think there is a way to customize this behavior.</p>
<p>If you click the back button once more after you have closed the keyboard, you can customize the result because the event is now attached to the window.</p>
<p>Note that closing the keyboard using the back button works fine on my system.</p>

										<p><p>hi hal, lots of thanks for your patience!<br>:) closing the keyboard works with me too. but i can&#39;t figure out WHEN the keyboard&#39;s gone.</p>
<p>i try to get a workaround (catching the focus event on my window) and see if that works.</p>
<p>thanks a lot for your help!</p>
