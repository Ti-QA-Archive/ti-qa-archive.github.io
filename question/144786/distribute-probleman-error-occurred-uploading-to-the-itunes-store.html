		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am struggling about uploading apple app store. When i try to upload it says : &quot;An error occurred uploading to the iTunes Store&quot;. I got hint from google it is about JAVA version problem so it says change Java version but in my OS(OX10.8.2)installed JAVA1.7 automatically. And doesn&#39;t have JAVA preference too. So I lost way. I don&#39;t know how to upload my app clearly.  </p>

							<p>Hey Prashish,</p>
<p>When you get the error, what does the application loader say? If anything at all.</p>

										<p><p>Sweet.  Okay so the file you&#39;re uploading is the .zip version of your .app file right?  If not, just create a .zip archive file of just the .app file then upload.  If you&#39;ve already done that, next thing to check is your internet connection.  Sometimes the App Loader will fail because of slow or inconsistent connectivity.</p>

							<p>I think these tips here will help:</p>
<p>Start by visiting the program portal and make sure that your developer certificate is up to date. It expires every six months and, if you haven&#39;t requested that a new one be issued, you cannot submit software to App Store. For most people experiencing the &quot;pink upload of doom,&quot; though, their certificates are already valid. What next?</p>
<p>Open your Xcode project and check that you&#39;ve set the active SDK to one of the device choices, like Device - 2.2. Accidentally leaving the build settings to Simulator can be a big reason for the pink rejection. And that happens more often than many developers would care to admit.</p>
<p>Next, make sure that you&#39;ve chosen a build configuration that uses your distribution (not your developer) certificate. Check this by double-clicking on your target in the Groups &amp; Files column on the left of the project window. The Target Info window will open. Click the Build tab and review your Code Signing Identity. It should be iPhone Distribution: followed by your name or company name.</p>
<p>You may also want to confirm your application identifier in the Properties tab. Most likely, you&#39;ll have set the identifier properly when debugging with your developer certificate, but it never hurts to check.</p>
<p>The top-left of your project window also confirms your settings and configuration. It should read something like &quot;Device - 2.2 | Distribution&quot;. This shows you the active SDK and configuration.</p>
<p>If your settings are correct but you still aren&#39;t getting that upload finished properly, clean your builds. Choose Build &gt; Clean (Command-Shift-K) and click Clean. Alternatively, you can manually trash the build folder in your Project from Finder. Once you&#39;ve cleaned, build again fresh.</p>
<p>If this does not produce an app that when zipped properly loads to iTunes Connect, quit and relaunch Xcode. I&#39;m not kidding. This one simple trick solves more signing problems and &quot;pink rejections of doom&quot; than any other solution already mentioned.</p>

<p>Did you try refreshing your project on the left panel under <strong>Project Explorer</strong>? This sometime helps.</p>

							<p>My mistake, I did not see you were using JAVA1.7, I had the same problem with this and solved it by installing JAVA1.6 and add it to the PATH.</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback Prashish. Many people will have the same problem and as far as I remember, it was a long solution. Although, I really think they should support JAVA1.7 some time in the future.</p>
