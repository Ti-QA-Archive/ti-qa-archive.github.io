		<section>
			<p>I am looking for help in integrating Linea Pro SDK within appcelerator. The Linea SDK comes with the Linea Pro scanner&#x2F;msr for iphone.</p>
<p>I am trying to use Linea SDK in a custom module and call it in the main app. My issue is in establishing basic connection with the Linea SDK and thus the hardware</p>
<p>I am using the following code in the custom module startup method linea=[Linea sharedDevice]; [linea addDelegate:self]; [linea connect];</p>
<p>When I try to get connection status through method -connectionState, the state is alwaysdisconnected.</p>
<p>Any clues???</p>

							<div><p>It looks like there hasn&#39;t been any change to this Module in 2 years.  The Github repository does not have the code needed to make changes to the module.  Is there a way to get access or to write in other methods like triggering the scanner, custom sounds, etc?  Or has anyone else heard of someone that has written another module for this scanner?</p>

										<p><p>Paul, what methods does your module support?  The demo.js code only shows the use of the barcodeData event.  Can you configure the scanner to set allowed barcode types?  Configure or disable the beep (I find the IP4 sled&#39;s beep obnoxiously loud compared to the original sled for the 3rd generation units)?  Use the mag strip reader?</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t find the source to the module on github either, but maybe you don&#39;t intend to release that.</p>

										<p><p>I am working on a full write up of use cases for the module. This was just a &quot;get it out&quot; so people can start playing around with it. The use cases should be released soon.</p>

										<p><p>Also, the barcodeData event is my custom event from the OBJ-C side, similar events will be available for mag strip, beep sound, etc.</p>

										<p><p>Very, very solid.  IMHO, laser scanning is well justified over camera scanning when it comes to high volume production environments.  You can point a laser towards a barcode and scan in a fraction of the time of using a camera.  My environment mostly uses UPC and EAN barcodes, so I use the 1D models from Linea Pro.</p>
