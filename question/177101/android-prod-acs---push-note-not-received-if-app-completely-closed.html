			<h1>Android Prod ACS - Push note not received if app completely closed</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;m using TiSDK 3.3.0 and OSX 0.9.4.  I have observed the following on Android OS 4.0.4, 4.1.2 and 4.3 (so far).</p>
<p>I have setup my app to use ACS for Android Push notifications.  Using the development portal it was working fine. I decided that prior to going to the Play Store I would test out the push notifications via the production portal of the ACS and I have found a differences in operation.</p>
<p>When I send a notification via the portal (or my own php backend) to the device and my App is either open or listed in the &quot;Recent apps&quot; screen, the push notification is received flawlessly.  Even when the device is locked.  If I swipe the app out of recent apps, then the push notifications is no longer received.  I didn&#39;t have this behaviour when I was using the development portal.</p>
<p>I would really like to know why this is occuring in Prod and not Dev ACS portals and also will this operate like this when I submit to the Play Store.  It is rather annoying and sort of flys in the face of why you would enable push notifications in the first place,</p>
<p><strong>Key setup points:</strong></p>
<p>1) I changed the &quot;development&quot; keys to be the same as the productions keys as explained here - <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;158800&#x2F;acs-development-vs-production">ACS Dev vs Prod</a></p>
<p>After doing this I was able to see my device registered successfully within the Production portal of ACS</p>
<p>2) In order to be able to send push notifications to individual devices, for each device id, I’m generating a channel with the same name. So when I deliver a push notification all I have to do is target the channel and set the &quot;to-ids&quot; to &quot;eveyone&quot;.  I am also registering them using &quot;subscribeToken&quot; like so:….</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Cloud.PushNotifications.subscribeToken({
    device_token: deviceToken,
    channel: deviceToken,
    <span class="hljs-built_in">type</span>: Ti.Platform.name == <span class="hljs-string">'android'</span> ? <span class="hljs-string">'android'</span> : <span class="hljs-string">'ios'</span>
}, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">(e)</span></span> { .....success / failure tests .... });
</code></pre><p>3) I am actually sending push notifications via my php backend using this technique <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ricardoalcocer.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;05&#x2F;sending-acs-cross-platform-push-notifications-php&#x2F;">ricardoalcocer.com</a></p>
<p>As pointed out though, sending push notifications from php or from the console have the same effect.  If the app is not open, or doesn&#39;t appear in the recent apps list, the notification is not received.</p>
<p>So, any genius ideas out there?</p>
<p>Kind regards,<br>Brad.</p>
