			<h1>Titanium Studio can&#39;t be removed from the control panel</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>In August I downloaded the 3.3 version to prep for teaching a class with this framework in the spring. I have not be able to get it to connect to the android emulator so I decided to uninstall and do a fresh install with the latest version. BIG MISTAKE! I wouldn&#39;t removed from the standard control panel program removal (txtbox says The installation source for this product is not available. Verify that the source exists and that you can access it.). Couldn&#39;t find an uninstall. Removed all files and removed the registry keys related to the aptana, titanium and still it won&#39;t remove the program. So I tried doing a reinstall over the top - it tells me I have a current version of the software running - where? I&#39;m running Windows 7 and had checked all the other compatibility issues and didn&#39;t find anything. HELP it is driving me nuts….</p>

							<p>Hi Lori Baker-Eveleth,</p>
<p>Please follow the below steps and see if it helps you to solve your problem.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First check the C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Titanium Studio\full_uninstall.txt file for any new info (not all that helpful. Currently it points you to a website that tells you to delete a folder which no longer exists).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Delete the folder C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Titanium Studio</p>
</li>
<li><p>Delete the folder C:\Users\username.titanium</p>
</li>
<li><p>Delete the folder C:\Users\username\Aptana Rubles</p>
</li>
<li><p>Scan your registry for &quot;titanium&quot; and delete the registry folder that refers to the Titanium installation &#x2F; uninstallation. (You probably did that already)</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you fail to delete any of these folders, reboot and try again.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Check the doc link for details: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides2&#x2F;Uninstalling+Studio#UninstallingStudio-Windows">uninstalling studio from windows</a> </p>
<p>Hope this will help you to solve your problem.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>I had done all of those things - I ended up downloading a registry cleanup tool from Microsoft to find the hidden files in the registry. It finally removed the application and I was able to reinstall. I&#39;m still having the same problem I was having before of getting an error on the android emulator.<br>[ERROR] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 8<br>C:\Users...\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\titanium\node_modules\longjohn\dist\longjohn.js:185<br>        throw e;<br>I have seen others have this same error but the solution suggested was to do a reinstall. What else can I do?</p>
