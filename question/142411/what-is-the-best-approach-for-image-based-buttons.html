			<h1>What is the best approach for image-based buttons?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi. </p>
<p>I need to create some buttons which will use a background image and foreground image (this is so I can create a generic background and have more specific artwork for the foreground). This is for a iPhone and Android mobile app.</p>
<p>The background image should have a hover (touch) state.</p>
<p>I can see from the different ways of creating UI elements that I could do this several ways, so I want to ask what people think is the best approach - or their preferred approach?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>I have never used a button with both the foreground image and background image but here how I would try to do it - Create ImageView with the foreground image and add it to the button object that will have the background image. The event listener will be added to the button. </p>
<p>This is interesting so let us know what finally works for you.</p>

										<p><p>You can&#39;t add views to buttons anymore. You can, however, create a view that has touch&#x2F;click event listeners, and put whatever you want in there.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Shannon - I see that the latest doc still shows the add method for button -add( Titanium.UI.View view ) - So I am just curious if the inability to add the view to button being introduced with next planned release? Or is it just the documentation needing updates. I am using 2.1 and can still do it in my code.</p>

							<p>Thanks for comments guys. Perhaps I will try the view approach, with a child image element (the foreground). </p>
<p>I&#39;ve noticed Button supports backgroundImage AND image attributes, but there is no apparent way to position the image, which will cause an issue for me since the background is larger than the foreground.</p>

							<p>Hi Ben, my suggestions are using View Based approach when even you want some custom behavior. Button are also customized views, so better if you choose generic view and go ahead for any type of UI customization.</p>
