			<p>The UI approach used by Tweetanium seems to assume that users will not change orientation when using it.  If I change orientation from Portrait to Landscape I actually see a &quot;tab and a half&quot; at a time.  A similar issue is plaguing my app as I used some of the UI concepts of Tweetanium as a starting point.</p>
<p>Anyone have any ideas on how to make this work better?</p>

							<p>I should probably make Tweetanium smarter about orientation over time, but the short answer is to have all of your UI components listen for an orientation change event and redraw themselves based on the new layout.  It ends up being a great deal of work, unfortunately, since Titanium native layouts are not quite as robust as we might like them to be (we know this and are working on new features to address that).</p>
<p>Also, to the extent that you can avoid specifying heights&#x2F;widths&#x2F;absolute positions and rely on the default positioning behavior of views, that will help your cause for orientation changes.</p>
<p>Another thing you can do to &quot;cheat&quot; is to only allow orientation changes for certain windows in your application (I am going to pursue this for Tweetanium, since the only screen where supporting landscape really makes sense is on the &quot;New Tweet&quot; window).</p>

							<p>Understood - I understand that there are trade offs.</p>
<p>One outstanding question is that Tweetanium appears to try to limit the orientation:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> win = Ti.UI.createWindow(tt.combine($$.Window,{
    exitOnClose:<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>,
    orientationModes:[Ti.UI.PORTRAIT]
})),
</code></pre><p>I was trying the same thing, but it doesn&#39;t work for either apps.</p>

										<p><p>nitpick: that should have been a comment on my answer, not a new answer.</p>
<p>Yes, i realize that isn&#39;t working yet.  I know it&#39;s possible but I didn&#39;t take the time to explore what I was doing wrong for the initial source release.</p>
