			<h1>Can&#39;t deploy iPad app via Apple Enterprise program</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>My client has an Apple Enterprise license so they can deploy iOS apps in-house (wirelessly) and not through the App Store. Initially I configured the provisioning profiles linked to 2 specific UDIDs (device ID) so that me and my client could both deploy the app to our ipads for testing. Now we&#39;re done testing and ready to go live. I logged into developer.apple.com and redid the provisioning profiles so that unrestricted in-house deployments could be done, not tied to a specific device ID. But it just won&#39;t work. I can still deploy to these 2 same devices, but whenever we try to deploy to another device, it starts to install, then pops up the error &quot;Unable to Download Application. &#39;Daily Report&#39; could not be installed at this time.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>I have no idea what else to try. I deleted and re-created my App ID, provisoning profiles, and the other stuff, both on Apple site and locally. I don&#39;t know what else to try to open this up for general in-house distribution. Once again, we have an Apple Enterprise license. I tried uploading the ipa file to TestFlight, and it shows that only the 2 devices are allowed. But that shouldn&#39;t be the case.</p>
<p>Help.</p>

							<p>You are correct in that you need to use your distribution profile and not your development profile.</p>
<p>In titanium you can choose to distribute for apple app store. While this may be confusing as you do not intend to actually distribute to the app store, you should click this, select your distribution profile, and after compiling it should show up in Xcode archives for use</p>

										<p><p>Andrew,</p>
<p>Thank you, but I have no idea how to &quot;choose to distribute for apple app store&quot;. Can you please elaborate? When I choose to target &quot;iOS Device&quot;, a screen pops up titled &quot;Run on Device&quot;, and I can choose SDK Version, Dev Cert, and Provisioning Profile. I don&#39;t see the app store option on this screen. Where is it? Thanks again.</p>

										<p><p>I am going from memory at the moment, so hopefully it serves me correctly. There is a small square icon on a button directly about the list of projects. It will be to the right of a debug button and a &quot;play&quot; or &quot;&gt;&quot; button. If you don&#39;t see it, I&#39;ll have to check my machine in the morning for better direction!</p>

										<p><p>THANK YOU! It&#39;s a little &quot;angled cube&quot; icon to the right of the play button inside the rounded square. BUT after executing that, it built for awhile and then errored right at the end. The error message is very cryptic: &quot;Traceback (most recent call last).&quot; Then refs builder.py and run.py, with line numbers, and SystemExit: 65. I have no idea what this means or how to fix it.</p>

										<p><p>did you remember to double click to install the provisioning profile after download? (or I believe you can drag it to xcode)</p>
<p>Try deleting earlier profiles manually at:<br>Library&#x2F;MobileDevice&#x2F;Provisioning Profiles</p>
<p>Do you have a &quot;Distribution&quot; certificate? Make sure you have created a distribution certificate in the iOS provisioning portal at developer.apple.com</p>
<p>Confirm your certificate is downloaded and stored to keychain properly.</p>
<p>Make sure you are using a distribution provisioning profile, which has been downloaded and installed.</p>
<p>Hopefully checking&#x2F;redoing all of these things will atleast get you through compiling.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, I did all those things. Then I went back and deleted everything on apple, re-created everything, reinstalled everything in keychain and xcode. Same errors. I have this terrible nightmare feeling that no Ti app has ever been distributed via Enterprise program before, and maybe it&#39;s not supported, and nobody has figured out how to make it work.</p>

										<p><p>Searching around QA, it appears a few people have successfully distributed in different forms with an enterprise build. While their method of distribution is irrelevant, it is important to note that they could successfully compile using the proper certification and proper provisioning.</p>
<p>What error do you get in the console during compiling?</p>

										<p><p>In the console it tells me almost nothing, except to reference some .py files during build. I&#39;m not in front of my mac right now, or I&#39;d give you the exact message. It&#39;s odd to me that I have successfully built to device and deployed to specific devices using the developer provisioning profile. Yes it blows up when trying to compile to distribute to all in-house devices. If the keys&#x2F;certs&#x2F;profiles worked for the other, why won&#39;t it work for this?</p>

										<p><p>Andrew, the only thing with a space in it was the Ti project name (&quot;Daily Report&quot;). So I renamed that, taking the space out. It made no difference; same error. I drilled into the build folder and found instances of Daily Report with the space still in it. For example, &quot;Daily Report.xcodeproj&quot;. So then I found that in the tiapp.xml, the &lt;name&gt; element still had the name with the space. So I changed the space to an underscore and rebuilt. Same error. Even so, it&#39;s kind of absurd to say that the app name can&#39;t have a space in it, because millions of ios apps have spaces in the name, and they obviously built fine. Even Ti-made apps have spaces in the name I&#39;d venture. Same errors, referencing builder.py, run.py.</p>

										<p><p>I agree, but I have seen various issues running around with spaces and special character issues with app files. Here is one for example:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;117658&#x2F;problem-run-on-device-for-ipad">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;117658&#x2F;problem-run-on-device-for-ipad</a></p>
<p>and more info here:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;122962&#x2F;run-on-device-iphone">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;122962&#x2F;run-on-device-iphone</a></p>
<p>I am really trying to help you out here but I am running out of ideas… How about we try a test…</p>
<p>1)Create a NON-ENTERPRISE provisioning profile for ONLY your device. This must be a DISTRIBUTION profile, NOT a development profile. It must be created using your distribution certificate</p>
<p>2)Install this profile</p>
<p>3)Distribute for APP store from titanium, use your distribution certificate, AND your distribution profile.</p>
<p>Successfully compiled? Same errors? What happens?</p>

										<p><p>Andrew, thanks for all your help. It finally worked. It turns out my Keychain Access was jacked up and I had a duplicated entry. I had to clean that up and redo all the keys&#x2F;certs&#x2F;profiles, then it worked. It also helped to create a custom Keychain and move everything related to my app into that keychain. THEN I had to make that keychain my Default. It turns out that Titanium (or maybe Xcode) only looks at the default keychain, nothing else. This is in fact what Apple developer support suggested.</p>
<p>But now I don&#39;t know how to deploy the package that was created, because it&#39;s not an ipa file anymore, like the dev builds created. I entered a new forum item for this (all details are in there):</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;135303&#x2F;how-to-deploy-build-package-for-enterprise-distribution</p>
<p>I would love to get some advice on this. I&#39;m so close.</p>
