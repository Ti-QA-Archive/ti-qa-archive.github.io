			<h1>Android Performance</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am just getting started with Titanium after developing some native apps on both iPhone and Android platforms.  I wanted to what the performance was like to do some RegExp parsing of HTML.  The iPhone simulator works very well and to parse an example website took less than 1 second, but when I ran the code on Android (phone and simulator), it took a very long time.  I put together a little looping test to see if I could isolate the problem.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> start = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">Date</span>();
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> i= <span class="hljs-number">0</span>,j = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (i = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;i &lt; <span class="hljs-number">10000</span> ; i++)
{
    j += i;
}
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> end = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">Date</span>();
alert(<span class="hljs-string">"Total Time: "</span> + (end-start) + <span class="hljs-string">"  Count "</span> + j);
</code></pre><p>On iPhone simulator, this takes 0 time.  On Android phone or simulator it takes about 3 seconds.</p>
<p>Am I doing something wrong?</p>

							<p>The iphone simulator is NOT relevant for performance testing.  It runs circles around a real iphone as well.  In my experience, the android emulator is much closer to device performance, but probably much depends on the speed of your PC vs the speed of your device.</p>
<p>In my case I use droid x with 1GHz cpu, and in general it probably runs marginally faster than the emulator on my laptop.  YMMV.</p>
<p>On the iphone, devices running the a4 cpu (iphone4, ipad, 4th gen ipod touch) are pretty fast.  But nothing will compare to the iphone simulator which is superb for faster testing&#x2F;debug cycles but meaningless for performance testing.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the response.  I&#39;ll run some tests on my iPod touch.  What really concerns me is the difference that I see between parsing HTML using RegExp (I tried to simplify this real issue by just doing a simple loop).  The parsing code breaks the html into pieces that I can build objects from.  The code to parse an html page on the iPhone simulator took less than 1 second (just doing the regexp and not building any object arrays).  On the Android Simulator or Phone it took 10 to 20 minutes.  I will post back when I can get some more information on an actual device.</p>

										<p><p>Bruce: a difference of 1 sec vs 3 secs is one thing, but 10-20 minutes is quite another!  As you note, in your example loop you are not doing any regex tests so it won&#39;t be indicative of your actual workload anyway.</p>
<p>If you post your actual code we may be able to offer some optimizations.  One thing I will mention without seeing any code is to always pre-compile any regex expressions you will use repeatedly in a loop.  That is, replace:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> (<span class="hljs-built_in">variable</span>&lt;=endvalue)
  {
  <span class="hljs-attribute">...</span> /pattern/ <span class="hljs-attribute">...</span>
  }
</code></pre><p>with</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in">var</span> rg = /pattern/;
rg<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>compile(rg);
<span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> (<span class="hljs-built_in">variable</span>&lt;=endvalue)
  {
  <span class="hljs-attribute">...</span> rg <span class="hljs-attribute">...</span>
  }
</code></pre><p>This avoids the time to parse and compile the regex pattern with each loop iteration.  The difference can be significant.</p>
