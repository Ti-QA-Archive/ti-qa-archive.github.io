			<h1>Studio - where does it build to? Its no longer the build folder?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Maybe i am not used to the studio tool, but i have noticed an issue a few times in the last few weeks when using it.</p>
<p>When i build an APK file with studio, the apk file in the build folder does not get updated.</p>
<p>Previously with developer, i did a build of the app and then in there was an apk file ready to share for testing.<br>Now, i do the build in studio, see that my changes are shown in the app (they are) then i look in the build folder but the apk file still have an old timestamp.<br>It was first shown to be by a colleague who I sent the apk file to, only for them to say no changes were there, yet the build i looked at in the emulator was clearly showing the latest changes.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jez</p>

										<p><p>This also applies with the emulator, not only on device.</p>
<p>Is there a way to turn off fastdev selectively?</p>

										<p><p>Take a look at the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Fastdev+Reference+for+Android">wiki page for FastDev</a>. There used to be a tiapp.xml entry that would disable it per project.  But I thought that it had gone away in recent sdks.</p>
<p>Was something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">property</span> <span class="hljs-property">name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"ti.android.fastdev"</span>&gt;<span class="hljs-constant">false</span>&lt;/<span class="hljs-keyword">property</span>&gt;

										<p><p>Thanks for the link, it is interesting since i have never &#39;enabled&#39; fast dev. I think there needs to be some dedicated forum &#x2F; q &amp; a for studio and how it is different from developer.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

							<p>I think this is a real bug.<br>Here are some steps.</p>
<p>1) App is fully functional in emulator and on device<br>2) Perform clean from Studio<br>3) Check that build folder is empty of all APK files (well its empty of everything after a clean).<br>4) Rebuild<br>5) NO APK FILE!!!!!!!</p>
<p>There is definitely some confusion between Studio&#39;s workspace (which was defined as this folder) and the real world.</p>
<p>Does anyone else experience this? It is quite perplexing when there is clearly an app running but apparently no binary that it is running from.</p>

							<p>Forgive me for asking the obvious, but have you checked the <code>[project root]&amp;#x2F;build&amp;#x2F;android&amp;#x2F;bin&amp;#x2F;</code> directory? That is where I will strip out an apk if I ever need one under the table, so to speak :-)</p>
