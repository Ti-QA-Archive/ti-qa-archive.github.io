			<h1>TideSDK - Friday&#39;s Marshall Culpepper Session a Great Success</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Our Friday session with Marshall Culpepper was to say the least &#39;awesome&#39;. We are very grateful to have his support for the TideSDK project. As you may be aware, Marshall was TiDesktop&#39;s original developer and kroll was his &#39;baby&#39;. The session was well attended and our group benefitted immensely from Marshall&#39;s insights.</p>
<p>Guiding the session using an outline prepared in advance, we gained from his knowledge of the past, discussed our present challenges, and looked toward the future. The session which ran a marathon 3+ hours, documented important legacy information, offered clarity concerning details of our project&#39;s architecture, helped with issues around our drillbit testing framework, our development approach, library upgrades, packaging, distribution and much more. </p>
<p>The session ended with pledges to keep in touch along with a followup as we contemplate the challenges of Apple sandbox compliance. You will find a complete transcript of the session at:</p>

<p>A big thank you Marshall on behalf of all involved in the TideSDK project.</p>
