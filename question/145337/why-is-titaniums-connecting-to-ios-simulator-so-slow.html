			<p>MBP&#x2F;2.4Ghz-i7&#x2F;8Gb: </p>
<p>The simulator is open from a previous debugging session. I click to debug with Titanium iPhone Simulator and the build happens quickly up to the console message &quot;iPhone simulated device: iPhone&quot;. The old simulator closes. Then the progress bar hangs for more than three minutes with the label &quot;Launching: Waiting for debugger to connect.&quot; This is obviously unusable waiting three minutes to debug after each change. What&#39;s causing the three minute hang?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Mine takes 15 seconds from pressing the iPad simulator to displaying the iPad simulator and the same for the iPhone simulator - obviously they are the same - but wanted to check both.</p>
<p>My files are running on a drobo network drive hooked up to a windows server - so you can imagine slow downs here.</p>
<p>When running apps locally to the Mac everything runs much faster.</p>
<p>I am using a Mac Mini&#x2F;2.5Ghx&#x2F;i5&#x2F;4Gb - so it unlikely your Mac spec at fault.</p>

										<p><p>It&#39;s good to know the build can be that fast. Must be some configuration problem.</p>

										<p><p>Create a new blank project and DO NOT ADD ANY CODE.</p>
<p>Build the app for the first time.  Close the simulator.</p>
<p>Build for the second time and note the time it takes.  This will remove ANY code or modules you have added as part of any delays.  If this is still slow then something else is at fault, if not then it is likely the additional modules you have added.</p>
<p>If it appears to be one of the modules then make a choice, do you care - as you cannot remove one I am guessing.  If it is for scientific benefits then add one and re-time, remove that one and re-time - then finally add both and re-time.</p>
<p>At least you will know if it is the extra modules.</p>

										<p><p>Ok, more things to check.  How much free space do you have, how fast is your Internet connection.</p>
<p>When you have your app running in he sim, right click the sim in the dock and ask it to stay in the dock (useful anyway). Shut down the sim, what 60 seconds (giv it plenty of time to free any memory) then restart the sim by clicking in the dock, is this still very slow?</p>
<p>Have you tried running Xcode and compiling the code from your build folder - for a test, not required for any normal work.</p>
<p>Do you have your sdks (both) and code on local device? If not try that and report back.</p>
<p>Last test I can think of now, re-download the Titanium SDK and keep on the desktop DO NOT PUT IT IN YOUR APPLICATIONS FOLDER you have been warned :). Run the clean project test from here, this will rule out any old sdk conflicts (unlikely - but we have gone through the likely list)</p>
