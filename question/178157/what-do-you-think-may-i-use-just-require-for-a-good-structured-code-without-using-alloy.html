			<p>Hi,<br>I had to develop some complex apps that needed to be well structured. I know that Applcelerator is spending a lot to develop and to promote Alloy framewrok as a good way to create apps according to the MVC pattern but I found it complicated (introducing another level of difficulties) also because I was not able to find simple, good and cohomprensive guide to use it… just fragmented and unstructured docs and tutorials. To use it you need to know other stuff like underscoreJS and so on… So, if the goal is to separate ui from logic and get a manageble and structured code I thought to get it just using require() starting from a good design. At the moment I&#39;m getting good results: model, view and controller are separated and the managibility of the app is granted. What do you think? Thanks for the attention</p>

							<p>Hi Rossi,</p>
<p>Thanks for your concern.</p>
<p>Check the link: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;160427&#x2F;alloy-vs-classic">Alloy Vs Classic</a>, it&#39;ll help you understand what you should do. Alloy is preferable but it&#39;s completely your choice what you want to do :-)</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>Mario – I think you are fine building your app with the classic approach.  I have been building Titanium apps for about 2 1&#x2F;2 years, and I prefer the classic technique.  We are building our biggest app ever using classic, and I feel like the app is well structured, with many reusable components.  The resulting codebase should be quite easy to maintain.</p>
<p>I must admit that I am biased against frameworks like Alloy that make it look like you can build an entire GUI application with a few simple configuration directives.  My experience in 20 years of software development tells me that such tools might help you whip together an app that works 85% of the way you want, but finishing the last 15% will be a frustrating battle with the framework and its quirks.</p>
<p>Maybe Alloy would surprise me if I gave it a chance. :-)</p>

										<p><p>I think in same manner. Probably (I hope) for a long time (or forever) a developer can choose what kind of approach use in Titanium development: classic o Alloy also because the two ways are like two different philosophies not in contrast with each other. Thanks for your reply.</p>

							<p>I built this app using both:</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kgividen&#x2F;xControl</p>
<p>It was my first real Titanium app and I used the traditional approach first.  I then re-wrote it in Alloy a while later and was much happier with Alloy.  I&#39;m not saying my code is perfect but I would strongly recommend Alloy.  </p>
<p>It took me a while to understand models since I wasn&#39;t familiar with backbone but even if you don&#39;t use models it was much easier for me to work with and turned out to be cleaner code.   Once I did somewhat understand models though it also cleaned up my code.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t see any time I would not use Alloy over the traditional way in the future.  There might be times to use traditional code inside of an Alloy app but I have no plans on going back to a full traditional app.  Here are some reasons I liked Alloy:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Widgets.  They are great!  You can leverage a lot of reusable code from others or make your own.  This is a great resource: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitt.io&#x2F;</p>
</li>
<li><p>MVC.  It was hard for me to separate styling from code in the traditional model.  My code was all mixed together and even when I tried to modulize it became difficult to track through and messy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It was much easier to add a theming mechanism with Alloy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I got rid of most of my SQL statements with models and cleaned them up.  My tables and data driven objects are much easier to maintain and understand now.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I now have many less lines of code to maintain because Alloy handles a lot.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Coding up your views, controls, etc. over and over vs just adding an XML doc and style takes longer for me.  But I&#39;m also more comfortable in an MVC environment or in an HTML, CSS, Javascript environment which breaks things out.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are probably more reasons but there you go.  Just my opinion.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Kent, thanks for sharing your experience. For sure Alloy framework has its undoubted advantages but I think that it is possible to get a good, simple and clear structured code also using only classic approach if the desing phase is made in the best way. Probably if I find a real good guide about Alloy I&#39;ll give it a chance. By the way can you adiise me a good book for starting with? Congratulations for your app. Bye</p>
