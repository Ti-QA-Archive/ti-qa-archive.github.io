			<h1>All controller .js files contents deleted - how to recover?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have no idea what happened but I did a build of an Android Alloy app in Titanium Studio that I&#39;m working on for a client that&#39;s due tomorrow and after the build all the .js files&#39; contents were deleted so every single .js file in the project under controllers and lib folders are now 0 bytes. On top of that all the .tss files in the styles folder are also 0 bytes. Only the .xml view files are intact. Didn&#39;t realize this had happened and was wondering why the app just hung on the splash screen on the Android test device until after I rebuilt the app a few times and restarted my Macbook Pro and then saw that all the files were now empty! I&#39;m using Titanium Studio build: 3.4.1.201410281727 and Titanium SDK 3.4.1.GA and the Chariti framework. I of course had to forget to backup my code and &quot;lucky&quot; me this had to happen. Anyone experience this problem before or know of a way to recover the files? I&#39;ve tried deleting a file and then recovering it in Titanium Studio but it just recovers the same 0 byte file. Any help would be appreciated!</p>

							<div><p>Also when we right click on a file and do &quot;compare with local history&quot; there is no history for any of the files to go back to. We even tried adding a comment to one of the empty files and then saving it and then doing the &quot;compare with local history&quot; and that then does show 2 files in the &quot;history&quot; list but one is the blank 0 bytes file and the other is the new file where we added a comment line to for the test. Anyway to force Titanium to show more of the local history entries for a file? We&#39;re not sure why there is no history on any files.</p>

							<div><p>One final update…. some of the files did show local history and we were able to recover maybe 1&#x2F;3 of the files in the controller and lib folders but hardly any of the style folder&#39;s tss files were recovered.</p>

							<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>Sorry to say this but I think there is no way to recover it apart from local history option in titanium studio. I will suggest start using any of the source code management tool (Git, SVN, TFS, Bazar) available in market. If you have SCM tool in place you wont have to worry about losing of code in future.</p>
<p>I will recommend to use GIT as it is open source and its following distributed architecture.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
