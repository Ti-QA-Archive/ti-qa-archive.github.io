			<h1>Anddroid App crashing when installed through market app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>This is more for information and for asking if anyone else has encountered this problem..</p>
<p>We had submitted a beta version of our app in one Android market (SmartAppFinder). The app works fine on its own, but when downloaded through the Android application of that store the app crashes.</p>
<p>We found that the problem is, that the market application would copy the downloaded APK to the SD card giving it the name of the application id (the package name). </p>
<p>Now Titanium always creates a folder on the SD card which <strong>also</strong> has the name of the application id. Because now a file with the name already existed Titanium was not able to create it&#39;s folder which our application requires to store sounds and images and the application now crashes when it tries to access files that should exists in this place.</p>
<p>Has anyone encountered this problem with any store or otherwise? Does anyone know how to possibly get around this problem? I don&#39;t seem to have influence on the name of the Titanium folder, now does it seem possible to write to a different custom place on the SD card..</p>

							<p>I am having this same issue, yes. I hadn&#39;t gotten as far as you. I basically found though that my scripts that I referenced were being loaded. I saw hard crashes at launch about &quot;undefined&quot; functions that were defined when I built it, just not deployed.</p>
<p>Trying to find a good work around and will post a reply if I do.</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing.</p>
