							<p>Wittawoot gave me a strong clue about updating (thank you). You can read my comments, I initially did have a certificate problem. Here are some details for how I got my iOS dev and ad-hoc builds working: Downloaded latest Titanium Studio from main appcelerator site. Then on builds.appcelerator.com (which currently resolves to http:&#x2F;&#x2F;builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;index.html) chose the latest build under branch: master. By choose, I mean right click the OS X link (for me this was http:&#x2F;&#x2F;builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;master&#x2F;mobilesdk-3.1.0.v20130107133402-osx.zip) and copy its location, don&#39;t download and unzip anything. Then, in Titanium Studio go &quot;Help&quot; -&gt; &quot;Install Specific Titanium SDK&quot;. Then, in the field it offers, paste in the build url you copied from builds.appcelerator.com. Let it install. This will not change the version of Titanium Studio it will add an additional Titanium SDK version. Then, in your TiApp.xml (use GUI interface), change Titanium SDK to the version you downloaded. Mine now reads, &quot;3.1.0.v0130107104203&quot;. Doing that made my error, &quot;Unable to find any iOS Distribution Certificates&quot; go away. When doing an ad-hoc build, for &quot;specify location&quot; I specify my desktop folder, it doesn&#39;t have to be under your app&#39;s build folder, that&#39; folder seems to be used for temp files. Note that for me, using this process, Wittawoot&#39;s specific build version didn&#39;t work for me. Once I tried the latest version (at present, mobilesdk-3.1.0.v20130107133402-osx.zip), it worked.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Your question states &quot;…in iOS Platform config have Certificate as <strong>Apple Developer Cert…&quot;, if this means you have a </strong>Development<strong> certificate then you actually need a </strong>Distribution** for Distribution or Ad-hoc.</p>
<p>Your error message implies it is a lack of <strong>Distribution</strong> certificates so I would check that.</p>

										<p><p>Without being in front of your machine this is going to be very hard to solve.</p>
<p>Your logs indicate that you do in fact have a distribution and ad-hoc certificate - so rules out the lack of those as an issue.  You say is works in 2.x so again not that.</p>
<p>Long-shot; whenever I run into iOS certificates issues (happens more than you think and more than I want) I find the relevant ones and delete them, then I re-create and run them on the dev machine.  This fixes 99% of my certificate issue.  It may fix this one.</p>

							<p>OK ! I found solution for issue .It work for me ..   Thank you every body for answer.  ^__^</p>
<p>Go to<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2012&#x2F;12&#x2F;announcing-titanium-3-0.html</p>

<p>Roger says:<br>December 17, 2012 at 5:57 am<br>I had the same problem as Taruga. I got the same error on two different machines after installing 3.0 IDE and SDK updates:<br>“[ERROR] :  Unable to find an iOS Developer Certificate for “my name (certificate number)”<br>Available developer names:<br>(list of developer certificates installed, names only, no certificate number)”<br>I found the solution here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TISTUD-2969.<br>It basically says to download the latest build from build.appcelerator.net. I downloaded the latest build from the master branch (mobilesdk-3.1.0.v20121214142601-osx.zip) and that fixed the problem.</p>

										<p><p>I did find the update site for preview releases (is that the right one?) which let me search for updates within titanium studio which found version 3.1.0.201301031737. </p>
<p>I still get the error though – when I try to build an ad-hoc ipa I get the &quot;Unable to find any iOS Distribution Certificates&quot; error, even though my cert is presented to me and in the Apple developer area I can clearly see that the provisioning profile is associated with it and it is in my keychain (I even tried re-adding the cert to my keychain). I also tested taking it out of my keychain and doing a build to prove that the cert then disappears from the list so it is normally finding it. Also, build.appcelerator.net doesn&#39;t work for me, just redirects to appcelerator.com home page.</p>

										<p><p>OK, I checked the log and found that it was looking for my IPA file here:<br>build&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;build&#x2F;Release-iphoneos</p>
<p>whereas I was trying to save it somewhere else. I had &#x2F;build but not the rest of hte path so I created that full path and specified it as the location to save my IPA. Then I no longer got the pop-up error about Titanium not being able to move the IPA, in fact I got a pop-up that made it look like the build succeeded but it happened too fast for that to be the case. The pop-up told where the build was and offered to take me to that location. At that location, indeed there is an IPA file but it&#39;s zero bytes. I still get the same error in my console, &quot;Unable to find any iOS Distribution Certificates&quot;. Prior to the build I cleared my log. The latest failed build didn&#39;t add ANYTHING to the log, it&#39;s still empty. The OS X Console app doesn&#39;t show any messages either resulting from the operation. </p>
<p>This even after revoking my ad-hoc distribution certificate, recreating it, renewing my ad-hoc provisioning profiles again and replacing them all in keychain and xcode, and refreshing the titanium view of the profiles in the titanium studio preferences area. I&#39;m at a dead end apparently :(</p>

										<p><p>Dear Andrew Blair</p>
<p>Before . i have same your&#39;s error message And I solve this my issue by</p>
<p>1.Using Titanium SDK 3.1Up (Beta)</p>
<p>2.Delete Certificates in Keychain access and Create again from apple web.</p>
<p>3.Try build again</p>
<p>If still not work (Because this case can solve BB10 platform in can&#39;t build to Simulator&amp;Device)</p>
<p>Move path titanium sdk from default path to another path</p>
<p>Sample : I using -&gt; &#x2F;Applications&#x2F;ti-mobilesdk-3-3      </p>
<p>And In Preference&gt;Titanium&gt; set Titanium SDK Home point to here</p>
<p>**Try Again</p>
<p>I hope can help you</p>
<p>Best regards<br>Mr.Wittawoot</p>

										<p><p>Seems it was a problem with my cert not being signed with the correct private key. Even though the cert is found in xcode and titanium it was invalid but only xcode showed it as invalid and even at that it was very subtle. If I highlighted my team on the left in the xcode organizer, I could see my dev and distribution certificates. one had a tiny green checkmark, the other didn&#39;t. when I rolled over the one that didn&#39;t, my distribution one, it said something about not being able to find or not having a private key. So, I went into keychain, selected All Items, did a search in keychain for distribution, deleted both keys and certificates, then revoked the distribution cert in the developer portal. My first attempt at recreating the certificate was to issue a certificate signing request via keychain. This time, as the portal recommended, I did it through xcode which entails simply clicking refresh (you have to have devices-&gt;profiles selected in the Organizer AND have deleted the certs from keychain – i also deleted all my profiles that were associated with that cert before I revoked it. By letting XCode do everything I ended up with the little green checkbox on my distribution certificate and now my IPA builds and in fact, it seems to be preferred not to use &quot;build&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;build&#x2F;Release-iphoneos&quot; for the &quot;specify location&quot; field, I just specified my ~&#x2F;tmp folder. Lastly in testing all this, I used Titanium Studio 2.1.2 rather than 3 (downgraded). I&#39;ll check v3 again soon, maybe it&#39;ll work now too.</p>
