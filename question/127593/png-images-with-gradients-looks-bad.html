			<h1>PNG images with gradients looks bad.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have several images with gradients, both transparent and images with no transparency. All gradients looks bad in Android. I know Corona had the same issue but seems to have fixed it now.</p>
<p>Is Appcelerator having the same problem?</p>
<p>Here is an example how it looks: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.urme.com&#x2F;testpng.png</p>

							<div><p>It&#39;s a gray&#x2F;black gradient. Increase your gamma on the screen and you will see what I mean :) It looks perfect on iPhone, but in the simulator for Android it looks crap :( I had the exact same problem with Corona SDK 2 months ago, but they seem to have fixed the issue now in the latest build for Corona.</p>

							<p>I have images with gradients in my app and they look fine in Android, so could it possibly be how you&#39;re saving yours? Try &quot;save for web&quot; in Photoshop if you&#39;re not doing so already.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m saving them for web already. Maybe it has something to do with which version of the simulator you are running? I read that Corona discovered that they had to turn &quot;on&quot; 32-bit images with some version of Android now, otherwise it always used 16-bit. Anyone else heard that?</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ve never heard that in relation to Titanium, I do know though that there have been bugs in handling 24 bit pngs in Android.</p>
