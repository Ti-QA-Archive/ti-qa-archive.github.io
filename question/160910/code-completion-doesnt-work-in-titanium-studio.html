			<h1>Code completion doesn&#39;t work in titanium studio</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m using ti studio 3.2.1 on mac and code completion doesn&#39;t work at all. Neither on native javascript methods, nor titanium related. For example when I start typing Ti.Ui……. no suggestion is shown at all. Is this a problem with my editor or titanium studio doesn&#39;t have code completion support?</p>

							<p>Code assist stops working at &quot;Ti.UI.&quot; for me, so it partially works.  It doesn&#39;t work where I really need it and that is within the core Titanium elements.  It was very useful to have it since it would tell you if a parm fit a platform.  Now you have to dig through the documentation, which is slow.<br>Running Ti Studio 3.2.0<br>Installed latest upgrade yesterday.<br>Worked fine when I was on Ti Studio 3.1.3</p>

							<p>Hi. </p>
<p>I&#39;m not certain we&#39;re using the same terminology or not, but the code completion I&#39;m familiar with in Studio comes in the form of a small pop up list. The info below is related to that.</p>
<p>I have this problem off and on. What usually happens to me is that I type past the pause needed for the &quot;code completion&quot; to not be too intrusive. If I find I need the code completion then I have to backup and and stop after the last valid element that I know for certain is accurate and type a period (.) and wait about 1 or 1&#x2F;2 second. Then I get the list. So for your example above I might type out &quot;Ti.UI.createIm&quot; and get nothing. But then back up or do this from the start: Ti.UI.  and then a short pause gets me the list (about 95% of time- sometimes it just flat won&#39;t work).</p>

										<p><p>Under the Titanium Studio menu option, select Preferences and then in the search bar type Assist and it will come up with the option &quot;Content Assist.&quot; In the Project Nature field select Mobile and make sure Android and the Apple products are selected. If they ARE… then I would think you have a bug. BTW, I read about all the issues in Studio 3.2, updated anyway, had nothing but problems and went back to 3.1.3. Only saying this as it could be related to the new studio version I suppose.</p>

										<p><p>They are checked… </p>
<p>Does anyone else also experience the same problem on v3.2? If that&#39;s not a problem with my configuration than I too will have to switch back to v3.1. but that&#39;s the last thing I want to do since there are so many nice features in 3.2. I hope it&#39;s just my configuration issue. Waiting a response from v3.2 users.</p>

							<p>Hi Ben Scofield!!!</p>
<p>I have faced the same problem and I have also solved it by creating a new workspace.<br>So I will suggest you to please create an another working directory and trying Ti.UI………..</p>
<p>I hope, it will work for you.</p>
