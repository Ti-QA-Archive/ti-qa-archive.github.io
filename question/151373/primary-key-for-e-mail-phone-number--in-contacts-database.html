							<div><p>Hello,</p>
<p>in that case, you will need to save the current state of the phonebook and then sync them when the user requires it or every once in a while. There is no native API that will notify you about those changes, that&#39;s the reason there is none in Titanium.</p>
<p>Best,</p>

							<p>Another approach would be to create your own contact database (with your own unique identifier) that would <em>synchronize</em> data between the device&#39;s contacts and your application. So if there ever was an update where the email were to be changed, you could still have the old address stored in your own database. Allowing you to retrieve it and then update the information for the contact.</p>
<p>And for Android, the mechanism would be even simpler since all you would have to worry about id the ID property.</p>

										<p><p>I have testet following (please tell me if something not correct):</p>
<p>The single data (numbers, emails,…) are sorted by &quot;age&quot;, not alphabetical!<br>Thats good! Because now i can check in my app database if there are a new number or old number deleted.</p>
<p>Only problem i have, if the user change the label e.g. from &quot;home&quot; to &quot;work&quot;, it is possible that the entry now between two others… But i think there is (like you said) only the way to build a new database.</p>
<p>Thank you once more ;-)</p>

							<p>On Android, you can use the <strong><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Contacts.Person-property-id">id</a></strong> property in order to uniquely identify a contact.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, such a property is non-existent on iOS, so I guess you will have to rely on at least one mandatory criteria like email.</p>
<p>Hope this clears this out for you.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you for the fast answer.<br>My problem is not the contact id, i mean the id for one single value.<br>E.g. a phone number or an address.</p>
<p>If one or more values changes, how can i identify which one is the correct.</p>
<p>If there a possibility to access into database directly?<br>Not from my app, database from my iPhone.</p>
<p>Thanks for helping!</p>

										<p><p>In that case, the answer is <strong>no you cannot access the database directly</strong>. This is part of the operating system&#39;s security model. Otherwise, anyone could build apps that just gather every single contact from the device and sell those to any marketing company out there.</p>

										<p><p>Sure, but the user allow the access to phonebook (in many apps).</p>
<p>Maybe my start was wrong. I only want to sync the contact data. For this, i must know which one are changed.</p>
<p>Any idears? Tutorials or something like that?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot :)</p>
