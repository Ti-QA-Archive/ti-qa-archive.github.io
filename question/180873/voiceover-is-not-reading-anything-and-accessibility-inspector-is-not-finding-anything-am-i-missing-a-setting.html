			<h1>VoiceOver is not reading anything, and Accessibility Inspector is not finding anything. Am I missing a setting?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am trying to test the accessibility of my app, and when I turn on VoiceOver on iOS it just doesn&#39;t do anything at all. My understanding is that it should at least read the labels, buttons, and other standard UI elements in my app. At the very least it should let me cycle through elements that it does find, but is not even doing that.</p>
<p>When I run in the simulator with Accessibility Inspector, the inspector doesn&#39;t find anything. </p>
<p>I have other apps where everything works swimmingly and I can&#39;t figure out what&#39;s different. Is there a permission I need in tiapp.xml to enable accessibility? Is there some way I have some code&#x2F;module that is short-circuiting it? </p>
<p>This has been tested on iOS 8.1.3, built from Titanium SDK 3.5.0.GA.</p>

										<p><p>Yes I&#39;ve been through those docs quite a bit. It&#39;s how I updated prior apps to be more accessible. The issue is that I can give accessibilityLabels to all sorts of things and Voice Over doesn&#39;t recognize any of them. The behavior seems to be that VoiceOver just stops working once the app is launched. I haven&#39;t seen that behavior before, hence the question.</p>

										<p><p>Actually yes. We were using the dk.napp.drawer module with the nl.fokkezb.drawer, and were using windows in our xml. Changing to views fixed the accessibility issue. I&#39;m not sure, but my suspicion was that there was a window within a window and that was causing the issue.</p>
