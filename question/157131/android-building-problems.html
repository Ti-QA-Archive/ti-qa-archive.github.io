			<p>I have an app that works flawlessly on the iOS simulator, my iPhone 4S, and iPhone 5. I&#39;ve gone back and forth with the Android emulator, but it is currently working. I&#39;ve installed and tested it as working fine on my Droid X running Android 2.3.3, and my Samsung Galaxy S4 running Android 4.2.2.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tested it on the following other phones with the following issues:</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy Y, Android 2.3.6 - App installs and crashes immediately &quot;The application &lt;app&gt; has stopped unexpectedly. Please try again.&quot;</p>
<p>Google Nexus 4, Android 4.2.2 - App installs and crashes immediately &quot;Unfortunately, &lt;app&gt; has stopped.&quot;</p>

							<div><p>I don&#39;t have much to work with here. The error is not specific, and it has nothing to do with my code, does the same thing with the kitchen sink. I&#39;ve even tried to install a blank application and a hello world application on these phones and it crashes just the same. </p>
<p>It works on my oldest and newest phones, and not on the ones in between, meaning it shouldn&#39;t be the SDK or OS  versions. Maybe it&#39;s the phones themselves, but I can&#39;t publish something that won&#39;t work on 50% of the phones that try to use it. The platform should be better than that. Titanium has more problems than any development tool I&#39;ve used in my 14 years of development.</p>
<p>Already noted platform, version, devices, errors</p>
<p>OS: OSX 10.7.5<br>Ti Studio build 3.1.2.201308091617<br>Simple test case: kitchen sink demo, does the same as my code</p>
<p>I&#39;ll just be browsing the Unity documentation…</p>
