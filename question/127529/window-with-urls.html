							<p>Naming a URL when creating a new window makes that window open in a new &quot;context&quot; – basically a new execution thread.  The full implications of that are beyond the scope of a simple Q&amp;A answer, but short form is that in general most developers will suggest you don&#39;t do that in new work.</p>
<p>When you DON&#39;T use the URL argument you have a &quot;single context&quot; application, and variable are available globally as long as they are in scope.  When you DO use the URL argument you have a &quot;multi-context&quot; application.  Variables are only available within their own context (i.e. window), and passing data between windows must be done via custom events or a shared resource such as a database or app properties.</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t understand the difference, than stick to a single context and avoid the use of the URL argument.  It has nothing to do with animation transitions.</p>

										<p><p>So how would I open the contents of another file, say &quot;newWin.js&quot;, in a new window without using the URL argument?</p>

										<p><p>Just leave off the URL argument.  It creates a new window either way.  You must still issue the open() method on the window, whether or not you use the URL argument.</p>
<p>The difference is that using the URL argument makes it run in a new context, which in a nutshell means it is in its own execution thread and does not have access to the variables and objects in other threads&#x2F;contexts.</p>
<p>There are times that can be useful, but unless &#x2F; until you understand the consequences it is best to leave it off.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, Doug.  I understand (to an extent) the new context.  Part of my issue is that I&#39;m actually trying to access a variable in the parent window.  I guess what I&#39;m asking if I&#39;m currently opening with a URL like so:</p>
<p>btn1.addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;, function(e) {</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var newW<span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
    url:<span class="hljs-string">'new_win.js'</span>,
    backgroundColor:<span class="hljs-string">'#fff'</span>
    navBarHidden: <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
});


Titanium.UI.currentTab.open(newW<span class="hljs-keyword">in</span>,{animated:<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>});
</code></pre><p>});</p>
<p>How&#x2F; where am I specifying that the newWin window should contain the contents of new_win.js?</p>

										<p><p>When you name the url argument (new_win.js in your example), then that code is automagically run when the window is created.  In new_win.js, you would place the js to create all of its objects, etc.</p>
<p>What new_win.js CANNOT do is reference any variables from the parent, whether that is in app.js or some other location.  Because it is a new context, it has NO direct access to variables or objects in other threads.</p>
<p>There are various ways to get around that, such as firing events between the windows, or passing objects from the parent to the new window as custom properties when creating the new window.</p>
<p>But again, most Titanium developers would now say this is not &quot;best practices&quot; and should be avoided except in special circumstances – and even then only when you understand the implications of multiple contexts.</p>
<p>Instead, simply leave off the url argument when creating the new window.  This keeps in the new window in your current context, with full access to other objects and variables which are in scope.  </p>
<p>You appear to be developing a tabbed application.  I recommend you look at the Wiki page for <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Tabbed+Application+Template+%28Single+Context%29">Tabbed Application Template (Single Context)</a>.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>Have you got your issue sorted out? I used the same way of opening new windows with url like your above btn1.addEventListener above. But submission of binary to AppStore they rejected with comment I did a full-screen transition and this is not allowed in iPad.</p>
<p>Can you help to advise how to transit to next screen of .js if you have got the answer?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
