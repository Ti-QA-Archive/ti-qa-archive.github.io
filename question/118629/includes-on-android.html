			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Trying to include a file in Android.</p>
<p>So far to avoid pitfalls mentioned elsewhere i have put ALL my js files in the root of Resources with app.js</p>
<p>I am using the latest build (1.7) but it still fails.</p>
<p>It is a window opened from a table row.</p>
<p>Sample code:-</p>
<p>Titanium.include(&#39;common.js&#39;);</p>

							<p>The Ti.include has been refactored so the CI builds not still have a few issues.</p>
<p>You might want to try this</p>

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> rootDir = Titanium.Filesystem.resourcesDirectory;

							<p>Thanks although i tried various absolute paths, including the following;-</p>
<p>var path = Titanium.Filesystem.resourcesDirectory + Titanium.Filesystem.separator;</p>
<p>However none worked reliably, so i have put the common code in the file instead which is bad practise i know.</p>

										<p><p>Because the include fails. The app has a tableview which opens a window in which the include fails to work.<br>I have tested this in various ways and problems with includes are numerously posted on here.<br>The include contains standard functions which claim to be undefined when the include fails.<br>Your post amounts to &quot;it works for me&quot;, so I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s all that helpful.</p>

										<p><p>i did not know what errors you where getting and how, and i do have some errors with includes, but you need to know why they occur.</p>
<p>Try placing your include file at the top of the file, creating a function in the included file that you call when needed. Sometimes when you include a file when you need it, it doesnt work. IE, include in an event or button.</p>
<p>Creating a new project actually fixed a bug where i had to have some files in the Resources&#x2F;Android directory, where as i put them all in the resources without any problem.</p>

										<p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>The include file <em>is</em> at the top of the file never on an event.<br>Also the way i know it does not work is that when i call a function in the include, it fails to work and says undefined.<br>I have created new projects for this several times and tried the latest builds (which introduce other errors)….<br>This is <em>still</em> happening with all the files in Resources folder.<br>Basically includes on Android are broken, it was fixed but then unfixed in the latest builds according to the post further down which is quite a concern!!!</p>
<p>Sorry to sound so negative about this but the Titanium dev process seems a little ropey if previously closed tickets are un-fixed at will and there is no adherence to &#39;stable&#39; and &#39;unstable&#39; builds e.g. follow the linux build and versioning model.<br>Tricks like &#39;use the continuous builds&#39;, &#39;create a new project&#39; and &#39;it works for me&#39; seem to be the only answers on these forums. I have decided that this is the last app i am doing with Titanium as undocumented Android failures have taken a couple of weeks now and blown all possibility of meeting the deadline. I have lost confidence in the Titanium development… cannot be relied on.</p>
