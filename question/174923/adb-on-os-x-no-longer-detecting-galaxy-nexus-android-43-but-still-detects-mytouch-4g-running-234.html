			<h1>adb on os x no longer detecting galaxy nexus (android 4.3) but still detects myTouch 4g running 2.3.4</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m running Titanium Studio, build: 3.2.3.201404181442 on OS X 10.9.3 and for some reason adb no longer detects my galaxy nexus running Android 4.3, but it does detect my old myTouch 4G running Android 2.3.4.</p>
<p>I&#39;m guessing that this issue may have something to do with my Android SDK&#39;s being updated, but I can&#39;t say for sure. I just know that it worked one day and stopped the next. I&#39;ve toyed with the Galaxy Nexus, confirming that USB debugging is on and in MTP mode though I&#39;ve also tried it in PTP mode as well – again without success. I&#39;ve come to believe it is most likely an issue with updating Android SDK&#39;s on my macbook pro, rather than an issue with the galaxy nexus – but I&#39;m just nto sure where to look or what to do…</p>
<p>Any advise would be appreciated.  Thanks.</p>

							<p>Had this with an S3 mini. Had been working fine. Like, for months fine.<br>Swapped the USB cable to the one that came with it, and bang, it started to work.</p>
<p>All the other devices were fine, even newer S4s. Weird.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ve tried connecting it with three different cables connected to different computers and different ports.  Unfortunately, I&#39;m starting to think the usb port on my phone is broke … it does charge, but won&#39;t connect to anything…  hmmm… can I do adb debugging via wifi?</p>
