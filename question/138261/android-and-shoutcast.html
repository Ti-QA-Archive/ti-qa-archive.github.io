			<h1>Android and Shoutcast</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>As much as I&#39;ve tried to remain platform neutral my experience of building a streaming audio application for iOS and then for Android could not have been more different. On iOS the audio player works fine with Shoutcast (http progressive) streams and has done so on all iOS upgrades, including the latest. The app (for Radio Caroline) has sold well for iOS for the past year and the Android version followed in March 2012.</p>
<p>Since then I&#39;ve had a steady stream (no pun intended) of folks complaining that it won&#39;t play the streams on their particular device - usually a Samsung Galaxy model. I know about Shoutcast not working under 2.1 without a proxy, and have got round it by supplying a suitable proxy stream. The &#39;it won&#39;t play&#39; issue seems random but is affecting enough people on 2.2 right up to 4.0+ to make me try and pin down what is wrong.</p>
<p>I would just like some feedback from others using the Titanium AudioPlayer API under similar circumstances. Have you had similar issues and if so how did you get round them?</p>
<p>The latest from a customer is &#39;I am using Android 4.0.4 and it won&#39;t play&#39;………. to rub salt in the wound they usual tell me that &#39;I can play the streams using the TUNEIN app, but not yours&#39;!</p>
<p>My code is pretty standard for this API and works well on iOS and on other Android devices, so what can I possibly do?</p>

							<p>I have the same issue with android, app was built 6-10 month ago. I tested it on some devices including sgs 2 and even users with sgs 2 are complaining similar issues to yours.</p>
<p>Also I cant pause Playback when receiving a call and resume it after end of the call or at least silence the Playback.</p>
