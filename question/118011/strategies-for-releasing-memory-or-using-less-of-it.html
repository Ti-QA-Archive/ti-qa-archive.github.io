		<section>
			<p>Somehow I marked someone&#39;s answer best on my previous question and closed the comments section. Sorry for the double post.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>Long time reader first time poster. We are close to releasing an iPhone app to the world, but it seems to suck RAM like crazy.</p>
<p>Using various strategies we continue to chip away at it, but it seems like the big problem is one particular window.</p>
<p>When this window opens, it bumps up the memory usage quite a bit (it&#39;s a complex window). But then when the window closes, barely any of the memory it was using becomes available again.</p>
<p>So the more you open the window, the more memory the app uses, and eventually it dies on certain devices (namely the iPod touch).</p>
<p>It was suggested that we try the latest build of 1.7, but that didn&#39;t do much to help.</p>
<p>The issue seems to be that when closing windows of any kind, whether they are modal or part of a navigation group, no memory gets freed.</p>
<p>We are not making much use of contexts i.e. url: windows. Would this help? When is it best to use these contexts?</p>
<p>Any other suggestions? Thanks! Also general tips to reduce memory usage would be great.</p>
<p>iOS 4.3.1, SDK 1.6.1 (and now 1.7.0 continuous)</p>

							<p>Interesting issue.  Are you re-using window instances via lazy instantiation?  I&#39;m about to try this optimization (a standard one in fat-client apps) on a couple of windows. Something along these lines:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> sub_window</span> = <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>;

<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> event_has_happened {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> sub_window == <span class="hljs-literal">null</span> {
    sub_window = Ti.UI.createWindow(...);
  }

  current_tab.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>(sub_window);
}
</code></pre>

										<p><p>Hi Robb,</p>
<p>We did try that with what seemed to be our heaviest window and it didn&#39;t seem to do much good. What has had the most impact so far was putting that window in its own context using a url to a .js file. However, the rest of the app still consumes a ridiculous amount of memory so we are wondering if we should just put everything in a sub-context?</p>
<p>The core issue seems to be that whenever we close a window, it fails to free up about 3-5MB of memory, so on every load we are eating more and more memory without any obvious way to free it. Very frustrating.</p>
