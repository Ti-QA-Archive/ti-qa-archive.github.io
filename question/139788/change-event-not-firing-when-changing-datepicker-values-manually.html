			<h1>Change event not firing when changing Datepicker values manually</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>My client has come across a small problem with our app. We have some date&#x2F;time pickers on a form. These all work fine when using the spinners to select the date&#x2F;time. But if they click into the boxes and manually change the values then the &quot;change&quot; event is not being fired, so the date returned isn&#39;t changed. Small sample of code below:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> datepicker = Ti.UI.createPicker({
    type:Titanium.UI.PICKER_TYPE_DATE,
    useSpinner: <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>,
    value: d
});
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> dialog = Ti.UI.createAlertDialog({
        title: field.title,
        cancel:<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,
    androidView: datepicker,
    buttonNames: [<span class="hljs-string">'Set'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'Cancel'</span>]
});    
dialog.show();
datepicker.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'change'</span>,<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span></span>{
    <span class="hljs-comment">// this is not set when changing the value manually rather than with the spinner</span>
    datepicker.value = e.value;
});
</code></pre><p>Any ideas how to get the change event to trigger when changing the value manually?</p>
<p>Titanium SDK: 2.0.1<br>Android SDK: 13</p>

							<div><p>Hi Ivan,</p>
<p>The code above is pretty much it and should be enough for a test case. I&#39;ll try and explain what is happening in more detail though:</p>
<p>When the dialog comes up it has separate fields for Month, Day &amp; Year. If I use the +&#x2F;- symbols to change the date then the change event fires. However, if I actually click into one of the boxes the keyboard comes up and allows me to change the values using the keyboard. If I change on of the fields, then click on the &#39;Set&#39; button (part of the dialog) then the change event is never fired so the value remains the same as before I changed it. As I have said below I have discovered that if I change a value in one of the fields, the click into another one then the change event is fired.</p>
<p>So I guess the options I have are to either try and manually fire the blur event when clicking the &#39;Set&#39; button (not sure how I do that yet) or I try to stop allowing the values to be changed manually (is there a way to stop these fields being editable manually?</p>
<p>Hope this makes a bit more sense.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Ritesh,</p>
<p>Thanks, but that doesn&#39;t work. The change event is never being fired. What I have figured out is that if I change the value of one of the fields, then select another one then the change event is being fired. So I think it&#39;s something to do with the blur event, if I just change the value then click the &#39;Set&#39; button then the field is not being blurred.  I&#39;m going to look at manually firing the blur event when the &#39;Set&#39; button is clicked…</p>

							<p>OK, so I got this working by using showDatePickerDialog instead of a custom alert. Originally this is the way I did it but one of the API versions broke that functionality (can&#39;t remember now which one) so I had to do it another way. It seems to be fixed in 2.1.0 so I have reverted to the original way. Not sure why it didn&#39;t work with the custom alert but I guess it doesn&#39;t matter now.</p>

							<p>Hey folks,</p>
<p>I ran into this same problem for my app. While on iOS7 I found a solution which was removing the left and right value&#39;s I set which I was using to create a margin for the picker so it wasn&#39;t touching the sides of the screen. This seemed to work for whatever reason but since updating to iOS 8 the problem came back.</p>
<p>On iOS 8 one of the 3 pickers in my app was still working but the other 2 were not. The picker that was still working was included inside a function, the function being called at the end of the page. With that mind I add <code>mainWin.open();</code> to the end of the page of the other pickers (I don&#39;t usually do this) and this has solved the problem.<br>Hope this helps somebody.</p>
<p>Here is my code as well just in case other elements are coming into play as well.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> picker = Ti.UI.createPicker({
    type:Ti.UI.PICKER_TYPE_COUNT_DOWN_TIMER,
    countDownDuration:duration,    
    bottom: <span class="hljs-number">60</span>        
});
<span class="hljs-comment">// turn on the selection indicator (off by default)</span>
picker.selectionIndicator = <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>;
mainWin2.add(picker);

picker.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'change'</span>,<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Code stuff be here</span>
});
picker.setSelectedRow(<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-literal">false</span>);
</code></pre>
