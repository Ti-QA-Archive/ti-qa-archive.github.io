			<h1>iOS5 NavigationGroup &#39;back&#39; bug</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>This is really a response to Raul Riera&#39;s question &#39;Bug in iOS5 : Tab group windows&#39; asked on 14th October 2011 which appears to be &#39;locked and cannot accept new answers.&#39;</p>
<p>Anyway just to say I have also hit this one where on a device NavigationGroup windows animate nicely when they open but close with no animation when the &#39;back&#39; button is clicked. This appears to be a bug associated with iOS5 as animation works both ways in the Simulator.</p>
<p>I&#39;m also getting many warnings when building in Xcode including one in TiUIiPhoneNavigationGroup.m which flags up a wonderful comment in the code which states &quot;TODO: This is a hideous hack, but NavGroup needs rewriting anyways&quot;</p>
<p>Which just about says it all!</p>

							<div><p>Jannis: I&#39;ve been away and didn&#39;t see Tony&#39;s comment until now. But I seem to remember trying to create a new issue in the Tracker but getting very confused as it&#39;s yet another thing with a different log-in and pw! So gave up - to my shame.</p>

							<div><p>I am unable to replicate this issue testing with the current 1.8.0.1RC1 using the Kitchen Sink as an example. Both the 4.3 and 5.0 iPhone simulators work as expected, animating windows in and out. Can someone having this issue please post an executable app.js that exhibits the issue. Also, be sure to list your versions for Titanium Studio, the Titanium Mobile SDK, and the iOS version of the simulator&#x2F;device with which you are testing.</p>

							<div><p>Happily it does appear that re-building under iOS5 cures this for me, although I&#39;m 99% sure when I asked the question two months ago it was after I&#39;d just gone up to iOS5. Anyway at the moment we are nicely animating both ways on my iPod (it always worked find in the Simulator - but not on a device). So all I can offer in the way of advice is to &#39;clean&#39; your project in Xcode and re-build it.</p>
