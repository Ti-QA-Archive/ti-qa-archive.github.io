			<h1>Explanation about timeout behaviour in httpclients</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I created a communication cache to send my app coms in order with only one httpclient.</p>
<p>The issue that i was experiencing was that if i set the timeout to a big number (say 10 seconds only for sending a small text), the phone sometimes stayed a lot of time hanged in readystate 3 and it made the phone go slow.<br>After trying to solve this issue for a long time i just tried to set the timeout to just one second and &quot;success!&quot;, communications now work like a charm, fast and without problems. I&#39;ve noticed that i have more communication errors i guess due to the server not responding in time, but the app works flawlessly (when i see theres one error i inmediately resend the package).</p>
<p>This is why i ask, what does the timeout exactly mean?<br>Why if i set it to a high number just sending a small text message the app uses a lot of resources while in readystate 3? Does this mean a server problem?</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think its a server problem, because when i used no cache for communications and i used several httpclients, communications never failed and were solved really fast.</p>
<p>I would appreciate any information, because i really want to know how this works in case i&#39;m not using the httpclient as i should.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
