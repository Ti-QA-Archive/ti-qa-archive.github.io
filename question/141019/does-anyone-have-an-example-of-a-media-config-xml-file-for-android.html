			<h1>Does anyone have an example of a media config xml file for android?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am running:<br>Android 2.2<br>Titanium SK version 2.0.2.GA</p>
<p>I have this warning that appears when I build:</p>
<p>[WARN][MediaProfiles(   33)] could not find media config xml file</p>
<p>Can someone direct me to where this file is supposed to be? Also with an example of what the xml code is supposed to look like?</p>

							<div><p>The emulator runs fine. I just want to clear up any warnings before I publish my app. I tried to play youtube videos from a feed, but they wouldn&#39;t play in the native player. I had to open them up in the youtube app. As far as I know, that warning has always been there. Do you think that would affect playing youtube videos (It played all other videos fine, even .3gp)?</p>
