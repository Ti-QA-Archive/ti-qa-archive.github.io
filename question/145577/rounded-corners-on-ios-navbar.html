			<h1>Rounded Corners on iOS Navbar</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>This may be a simple answer, but just wanted to make sure that I had all of the ways figured out (or learn better ways if I don&#39;t).</p>
<p>My end goal is to have that really stylish looking &quot;rounded navbar&quot; that most apps have these days in a mobile iOS app. The goal is to have the top left and top right corners rounded while the bottom right and top right aren&#39;t. </p>
<p>The way I do it now is create a background image and set the navBar image to use that. Works great when you&#39;re keeping the device either horizontal or vertical (depending how the image is made) but for an app that allows you to rotate and switch orientation, <strong>does anyone know of a way to do it that allows a crisp rounded navbar to be used regardless of the orientation and&#x2F;or width of the device?</strong></p>
<p>It may just not be possible.</p>

							<p>You could try creating a simple UI View with the same background colour as your navbar and set the borderRadius property to get your rounded corners. </p>
<p>Should then be a simple case of setting the zIndex so it&#39;s stacked behind the navbar and dropping it down a little so just the top rounded corners of your View are visible above the navbar.</p>
<p>Not tried it but should work.</p>

										<p><p>Ugh, I just wrote a whole response then the backspace went back and erased it all. Damn&#39;t.</p>
<p>Regardless, thanks for this suggestion! I feel like it should be possible using just the standard navbar though, but I could be wrong.</p>

<p>That stack overflow seems to have found a way to do it natively, although I have no idea how to translate that into a module or implement it in appcelerator ha.</p>

										<p><p>HI Michael, you stack overflow solution will not work directly here, but yes module development guide is given in document and you can use that to create a module as per your need.</p>

							<p>Yeah it would be nice to be able to set borderRadius per corner as in CSS but not possible as far as I know. </p>
<p>If your navbar is always at the bottom of the window and you can set borderRadius on it should be fairly easy to just position it down a few pixels so the bottom rounded corners are always off screen. Easier that writing a module anyway!</p>
