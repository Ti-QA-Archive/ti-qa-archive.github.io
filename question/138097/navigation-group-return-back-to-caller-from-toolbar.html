			<h1>Navigation Group (return back to caller) from ToolBar</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,<br>I had to remove a NavBar from ONE Window of app and replace it with a toolBar (its a long story). </p>
<p>The removal meant that I have now to re-create the code to navigate back to the window that called it.</p>
<p>How could I do that?</p>
<p>If I had a NavBar (created with any createWindow method), it did this automatically. It had a small text box (with a left arrow) with the name of the window that called it pointing left. How do I recreate this? I really don&#39;t want to add a button; I prefer the logic of the left pointing button? </p>
<p>The calling window calls the called window using the navGroup.open() function. But how do I go back to the window that called it? </p>
<p>What can I do?</p>
<p>Thanks<br>Eb</p>

							<p>Hmm… do you have access to the NavGroup object that opens the called window (i.e. is the NavGroup object passed into module&#x2F;function that houses the window)? If so, you should be able to set the leftNavButton of the called window and close it on its &#39;click&#39; event (though I don&#39;t know if this would work with a toolbar):</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> backButton = Ti.UI.createButton({title: <span class="hljs-string">'Back'</span>});
<span class="hljs-keyword">self</span>.leftNavButton = backButton;

backButton.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span>{
    NavGroup.close(<span class="hljs-keyword">self</span>);

    <span class="hljs-comment">// or alternatively</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">self</span>.close();
};
</code></pre><p>Again, not sure if this will work in a toolbar, but if you don&#39;t have a navbar, you won&#39;t be able to avoid having to re-create the button. Best of luck! :)</p>

										<p><p>Hi Brady!</p>
<p>This is going to show my ignorance now in C++&#x2F;Javascript, but the compiler responded with:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">can<span class="hljs-operator">'</span>t <span class="hljs-built_in">find</span> variable self
</code></pre><p>These kinds of errors push me to improve my knowledge in JS - and I know the &quot;self&quot; is typical in most OO languages.. I just don&#39;t have the bandwidth to undertake this learning right now.</p>
<p>In any case, I already had the close working with the following method:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">navGroup</span><span class="hljs-class">.close</span>();
</code></pre><p>It closes. Sometimes, it doesn&#39;t close properly (i.e. it does&#39;t return back to the main screen but leaves a white screen which means I have to soft reset the app), so I would not mind looking at other methods to close this window.</p>
<p>Everyone told me : &quot;Hey Eb, why don&#39;t you replace your NavBar with a ToolBar… &quot;</p>
<p>I changed everything, and came to this point, and now I&#39;m stuck. </p>
<p>So there&#39;s no way to implement something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> backButton = [some <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">of</span> <span class="hljs-title">navGroup</span>]

<span class="hljs-title">var</span> <span class="hljs-title">myToolbar</span> = <span class="hljs-title">Ti</span>.<span class="hljs-title">UI</span>.<span class="hljs-title">iOS</span>.<span class="hljs-title">createToolBar</span><span class="hljs-params">({
items: [backButton, myButton1, myButton2]
})</span></span>;

backButton.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(takemeBackwhereIcameFromBaby)</span>
</span>{

<span class="hljs-comment">/// Some code that just takes me back to the screen that called this screen</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">/// and ideally has that awesome left pointing box with the window that it will goes to</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">/// when clicked</span>

}
</code></pre><p>The code that took me to this screen was as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">/// this was <span class="hljs-type">in</span> a <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span></span> that was <span class="hljs-type">in</span> another window:

OpenWindowButton.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span>
{
    navGroup.open(WindowToOpen);

});
</code></pre><p>Thanks Brady, </p>
<p>I really could do with the smallest help on this.</p>

										<p><p>No worries. That&#39;s my fault. The &#39;self&#39; variable isn&#39;t some kind of special variable; it&#39;s just what some people call the window that&#39;s created in a CommonJS module. Anyway, thanks for putting the code. Let&#39;s see. I need to know something:</p>
<p>On the line <code>navGroup.open(WindowToOpen)</code>, where in your code are you creating <strong>WindowToOpen</strong>?</p>
<p>Is it done in the same file by using <code>var WindowToOpen = Ti.UI.createWindow()</code>? Or is it required in from another file the CommonJS way:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> SecondWindow = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'ui/common/SecondWindow'</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> WindowToOpen = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> SecondWindow;
</code></pre><p>I&#39;ll need to know which it is to better help you. If it&#39;s all in one file, would you mind copy&#x2F;pasting the contents of that file that pertain to this (you can leave out or change anything you wouldn&#39;t want others to see)? I ask this to better understand where each object (WindowToOpen, the toolbar, the navGroup) is created, thus letting me know what needs to be passed where, blah, blah, blah. :)</p>

										<p><p>Oh, one thing I forgot to mention. The reason you&#39;re probably getting that white screen on <code>navGroup.close()</code> is that you&#39;re actually closing the entire navGroup object, which in turn closes <strong>ALL</strong> the windows attached to it. In doing so, you&#39;re actually  leaving open only a single window you created somewhere that&#39;s not a part of the navigation group (probably the main window or application window or something) that happens to have a white background. :)</p>
<p>What you want to do is pass in the window that you actually want to close:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">navGroup</span><span class="hljs-class">.close</span>(<span class="hljs-tag">WindowToClose</span>);
</code></pre><p>In this case, it would be the window you&#39;ve been talking about closing. And while Nitin offers a great suggestion, other threads regarding navigation have shown that <strong>Ti.UI.currentWindow</strong> isn&#39;t always the best to use when dealing with navigation groups. Sorry, Nitin; hope you don&#39;t think me a jerk. :)</p>

										<p><p>BRADY!! YOU DID IT!!<br>You da man.</p>
<p>Thanks a million. You fixed 3 problems:<br>a) The best way to close a window using the NavGroup<br>b) Your method takes me back to the screen that called it. WOW! HAHAH!<br>c) I was about to type the longest piece of code known to mankind to illustrate my problem, and then I got your post - so that saves me hours.</p>
<p>Phew!</p>
<p>Dude, you&#39;re on my buy a beer list. </p>
<p>And by the way, Nitin is also on my list. He&#39;s just awesome.</p>

							<p>Hi EB,</p>
<p>Have you tried this way?. Set this in your WindowToOpen window and pass navGroup with them and set this on click of your toolbar.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">
<span class="hljs-tag">win</span><span class="hljs-class">.navGroup</span><span class="hljs-class">.close</span>(<span class="hljs-tag">Ti</span><span class="hljs-class">.UI</span><span class="hljs-class">.currentWindow</span>);
