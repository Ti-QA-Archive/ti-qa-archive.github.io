			<h1>Memory management - Android</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Can some one help me understand where to check the memory consumption of the application being developed ie.</p>
<ol>
<li>Should we be looking at Ti.platform.availablememory?</li>
<li>Should we be looking at the RAM: value next to the app in the task manager?</li>
<li>Should we be looking at the total memory availability in the task manager?</li>
</ol>
<p>To add further, my application consists of a menu window (simple window with icons), a button on which opens 8 windows which open one after another as a part of a multi step form Each window closes the previous except for the menu window. My app starts at 8 - 10 mb and moves upto 18 mb over repeated iterations of using the 8 step form. </p>
<p>This has me concerned since closing the windows or some particular ones may not be releasing the memory.</p>
<p>Will really appreciate some assistance here…</p>
<p>Android 2.0 API, Titanium 1.62 SDK</p>

<p>It&#39;s very difficult for me to get a handle on what your objective is with your app, without fully working code. As yours was missing some parts that would allow it to run, I&#39;d assume that it isn&#39;t actually the code you are working with.</p>
<p>I have created a new version <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;fcb7b9819d49f892af5f">here</a> that does run successfully.  However, it does not really demonstrate what you are trying to achieve.</p>
<p>Would you update it, using the advice at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Contributing+to+Titanium#ContributingtoTitanium-CreatingGoodUsecases">Creating Good Use-cases</a>, and I will be more than happy to help you.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

							<p>I finally figured the memory allocation out. The following is an answer for future users stuck in similar situations:</p>
<p>Basically I was using a kitchensink like method, 1 window for each task, was a lot of memory consumption, switched to a single window, multiple view method and all is fixed.<br>Just need to make sure each view created is destroyed if not needed.</p>
<p>&#x2F;&#x2F;this releases the memory occupied by the view.<br>win.remove(viewname);<br>viewname = null;</p>
<p>For checking memory usage, recommend using DDMS for android. open cmd.exe and run &quot;ddms&quot;.</p>
<p>The application which opens (DDMS) showcases a memory graph (PSS usage) which shows the memory consumption in MB &#x2F; KB. If your application is constantly growing, you know you are in trouble. If it stays put or grows very very little (a few kb after viewing 5 - 10 screens), you know you are ok. Note that the app grows each time a new view &#x2F; data &#x2F; images is loaded and I noticed it becomes stable at a size after heavy usage, so dont worry too much when its growing, just make sure it stops growing after several rounds of usage.</p>
<p>Matt, Don, thanks for the inputs but you definitely have to find some1 to respond to community QnA. This question took me a month of sleepless nights to figure out. While I moved to the Indie plan, not sure this is a great sign for community, request for a response if not a speedy one…</p>
<p>The indie plan does help though, access to questions unanswered here are found in there…!!</p>

										<p><p>Rahul</p>
<p>Thanks for your feedback and tips. Just to let you know, we have not forgotten about this, and it is very much at the top of our priorities. I am going to go through the issue with the core team in July, to test some scenarios raised by the community, with the aim of improving the code to help mitigate these problems. Keep an eye out for related code commits during that time.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>Appreciate your response… keeps us believing in appcelerator. </p>
<p>All said and done we have some really complex projects going up on the stores this month so hopefully with this memory issue put aside, we look to create over 40 apps in 2012 for our customers just using appcelerator!!</p>
<p>Just to let you know, there is 1 core issue , opening heavyweight windows and closing them DOES NOT release all memory consumed so continues moving one way upwards..</p>

										<p><p>Memory Management Issue</p>
<p>Hello All</p>
<p>We are interested in building cross platform multi tab navigational mobile apps using Titanium.</p>
<p>But it is still not clear as to HOW THE MEMORY IS MANAGED for UI controls in a multi tab navigational app just like kitchen sink app.</p>
<p>I tried running the Kitchen sink ANDROID app built with titanium 1.8.0.1 sdk and checked the memory usage using DDMS as Rahul said.</p>
<p>The memory usage initially is 19706KB and as we go deeper into the options the memory usage increase to 43099KB.</p>
<p>But when we return back to the main screen the memory usage is not freed and remains the same.</p>
<p>It seems that if you keep on using the app at some point it would crash asmemory usage is not freed.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know how to build a multi tab navigational app using views.<br>How does Titanium manage memory for UI controls,allocation and freeing.<br>How do i begin to  build a multi tab navigational app,what architecture to follow.</p>
<p>I couldn&#39;t find a clear description for the above anywhere on the wiki.<br>Thanks for your reply..</p>

							<p>Without  seeing your apps code, it is hard to say what exactly is eating your memory, but as a note, doing things like removing an element from another does not free up memory, you need to set the variable to null.</p>
<p>a good way to see what is still using memory is the use of Ti.API.info();</p>
<p>for instance:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> win2 = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
    title:'<span class="hljs-keyword">Tab</span> 2'
});
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">tab2</span> = Titanium.UI.createTab({
    title:'<span class="hljs-keyword">Tab</span> 2',
    <span class="hljs-keyword">window</span>:win2
});

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> label2 = Titanium.UI.createLabel({
    text:'I am <span class="hljs-keyword">Window</span> 2'
});

win2.add(label2);
win2.remove(label2);

Ti.API.info(label2);
</code></pre><p>returns:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[INFO] [object TiUILabel]
</code></pre><p>in the console, but:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> win2 = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
    title:<span class="hljs-string">'Tab 2'</span>
});
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> tab2 = Titanium.UI.createTab({
    title:<span class="hljs-string">'Tab 2'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-built_in">window</span>:win2
});

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> label2 = Titanium.UI.createLabel({
    text:<span class="hljs-string">'I am Window 2'</span>
});

win2.add(label2);
win2.remove(label2);

label2 = <span class="hljs-keyword">null</span>;

Ti.API.info(label2);
</code></pre><p>returns in the console:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-string">[INFO]</span> &lt;null&gt;
</code></pre><p>The more objects that are set, the larger the amount of memory used in your app.</p>
<p>But again, without seeing code, it is hard to say what your exact issue is.</p>

</code></pre><p>In categories.js, I click on a tableview row to open a new window while closing itself but somehow I feel the win1.close() and win1 = null call does not release the window memory. </p>
<p>The problem is that subsequently, I open 6 - 7 windows with the same method ie. open a new window and close the current window only leaving the menu.js window alive. On the last step, I simply close the last window thus the app shows the menu.js window automatically and it seems to the user that the process is complete and one has returned to the menu.</p>
<p>So all in all my question is does a win.close() release all memory consumed by all variables, controls, etc initialized &#x2F; used by the window? Where can i verify if the memory is released?</p>
<p>My understanding is if the app is at 12 MB memory consumption at Menu.js window, after the 6 - 7 windows opening and closing and when the user returns to menu.js, the memory consumption should be at 12 MB rather than increasing with each iteration of the 6 - 7 steps.</p>

										<p><p>calling close removes native elements on Android, but it doesn&#39;t remove all of your listeners, etc. You can still &quot;leak&quot; memory by holding onto objects that are no longer needed. The DDMS tool is your best way to check memory and force a garbage collection. Since both JS and Java are garbage collected, there is no explicit delete for freeing memory.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Don,</p>
<p>Thanks for pointing me to the DDMS tool, I will give it a try shortly..</p>
<p>In the meantime, just for my reference, reading all of the above, can I make the following assumptions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>win.close() does not release all memory, it is essential for us to clear all variables, arrays, views, etc by setting them to null?</p>
</li>
<li><p>If i clear all variables, and even set the window to null, does the memory return to its original value ie. if i have an app which consumes say 10 mb on start and then i add a window which takes it to 11 mb, if i clear all values,close the window and set it to null, i should be able to see the app consuming 10 mb again in the task manager?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What is the best way on the phone to see how much memory is currently being consumed by the app?</p>
</li>
</ol>

							<p>Pawan,</p>
<p>Use single context instead of multiple context where possible. I use views instead of windows and things work fine ie. on closing views, the memory allocated is reduced correctly.</p>

										<p><p>Using DDMS i found that Memory allocated to application is get increases as i am navigating screen by screen and after some time it crash application with force close message&#x2F;Fail to load resources. Even i have remove all objects from window and after that assign null to it. i.e<br>window.remove(viewname);<br>viewname=null;<br>window.close();<br>window=null.<br>Please help Me OUT.</p>

										<p><p>Hey I&#39;m struggling with the same issue on Android. I&#39;ve tried all the known workarounds for tidying up memory in Appcelerator Views (including this one http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;116867&#x2F;this-is-a-solution-to-your-memory-woes#comment-114508).</p>
<p>Using the DDMS tool with the Android Emulator I see apps memory increase rapidly as viewed in the &#39;SysInfo&#39; tab. Interestingly that actual Java VM heap memory is not the problem as the stats from the &#39;VM Heap&#39; tab in DDMS show no real growth in the heap usage.</p>
<p>What I think is happening is that the native memory allocated to the view by Titanium is not being freed until the Java VM heap is garbage collected. It&#39;s only a theory but I did see an article stating that TI&#39;s proxy objects don&#39;t release all their native memory until the objects are GC&#39;ed. This would make perfect sense as if I use the DDMS tool to force a garbage collect the memory gets freed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately as yet I can&#39;t figure out an easy solution to this problem. There doesn&#39;t seem to be a way to force garbage collection from the Javascript code (and forcing a GC is not a very nice way to fix it anyway).</p>

										<p><p>OK, I&#39;ve narrowed the source of my issue down to the &#39;backgroundImage&#39; property. It seems if you use this on a view (any kind of view, plain, button, imageview, etc) and then you remove the view and null the reference you get a nice big leak in native memory. This leak does get freed when the GC runs, but because it leaks so much (nearly 1MB per view in my case), you can easily get the device to run out of memory and force close your app before the GC kicks in (NB: You don&#39;t always get killed, sometimes you just start getting OutOfMemory exceptions in the log).</p>
<p>Changing my app to use &#39;ImageView&#39; instead of a plain &#39;View&#39; AND using the &#39;image&#39; property instead of the &#39;backgroundImage&#39; property fixes the leak. However this doesn&#39;t entirely help me because I need my images stretched to fit the screen, but the ImageView always maintains aspect ratio if you specify the image via the &#39;image&#39; property. </p>
<p>So I&#39;m still a bit stuck, the investigation continues…</p>

<p>Please would you state the version of Titanium you are using?</p>
<p>This may have been resolved recently, under ticket <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-7051">TIMOB-7051</a>.</p>
<p>Try the latest continuous build, by following the instructions at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Installing+Titanium+SDK+Continuous+Builds">Installing Titanium SDK Continuous Builds</a>, and report back with how you get on.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

							<p>NB: SDK 1.7.5 on Android, haven&#39;t tried any other SDK versions and don&#39;t know if this affects iOS - This doesn&#39;t necessarily answer all memory leaks&#x2F;out of memory scenario&#39;s but certainly this one caused me a big headache and the workaround is NOT obvious at all. See my comments on &#39;Rahul Dhingra&#39; post above for the background but basically if you use the &#39;backgroundImage&#39; property of any type of view and you then &#39;remove&#39; that view from it&#39;s parent you will get a lot of native memory left unfreed until the next GC. This can result in you&#39;re app getting OutOfMemory errors in the log or even a &#39;Force Close&#39;.</p>
<p>Long story short to workaround this issue you can do one of two things:</p>
<p>1 - If you don&#39;t need your image stretched to fit the view then use an &#39;ImageView&#39; and set the &#39;image&#39; property instead of the &#39;backgroundImage&#39; property. Then when you want to remove your view and free the memory be sure to remove it from it&#39;s parent view, set the &#39;image&#39; property to empty string and then &#39;null&#39; your reference variable. e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">win.remove(imgView)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
imgView.image = ''<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
imgView = null<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>2 - If you do need your image stretched to fit then because &#39;ImageView&#39; maintains aspect ratio you have to use a bit of a hack. Basically you can use a &#39;Button&#39; view but make it disabled (i.e. enabled = false), set &#39;style = 0&#39;, and &#39;width&#39; and &#39;height&#39; to 100% otherwise it won&#39;t expand to fill the parent. Then use the &#39;backgroundDisabledImage&#39; property to set your desired image. Then you want to remove your view and free the memory it&#39;s the same as above but you set the &#39;backgroundDisabledImage&#39; to an empty string, e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">win.remove(<span class="hljs-keyword">button</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">button</span>.backgroundDisabledImage = <span class="hljs-string">''</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">button</span> = null;
</code></pre><p>NB: For tracking this problem down the DDMS tools was absolutely essential. Strongly recommend you know how to use this tool effectively for investigating memory leaks.</p>

										<p><p>Andy, this is great information, and well done for isolating the bug and finding a workaround.</p>
<p>There are two issues at play here:</p>
<p>One is the importance of following best practices where javascript is concerned, which is to clean up resources (remove children from parents objects and nullify them, to allow them to be garbage collected). Everyone should be doing this anyway.</p>
<p>The other is a possible bug in the SDK, relating to backgroundImage and views. This warrants a new question in the Q&amp;A, so that other developers may easily follow the thread to the conclusion. If no solution is found, and the bug is proven, then a ticket should be raised.</p>
<p>Please try my previous suggestion, which should resolve the backgroundImage issue. If not, please let me know.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>PS. Please resist the temptation to double post. Thank you.</p>

										<p><p>Point taken wrt double posting ;)</p>
<p>I shall raise a seperate Q&amp;A for this backgroundImage issue so we can get a ticket raised (if appropriate).</p>
<p>Just to clarify when you say &#39;Please try my previous suggest&#39; are you referring to trying an SDK which has TIMOB-7051 fixed?</p>

										<p><p>Paul,<br>Are you saying that with Titanium anytime you call add on a Titanuim object, you need to at some point call remove and nullify the added object or it won&#39;t get garbage collected?  Is this only when you have your code structured in a certain way?  Does this still apply when using CommonJS modules?  Thanks for the clarification!</p>

										<p><p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>See the following post about memory management with Android.</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;132357&#x2F;memory-leaks-on-android-but-not-on-ios—very-simple-test-case</p>
<p>Here is the link to the official ticket. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-7779</p>
<p>There are confirmed memory management issues with Titanium and V8 on Android.</p>
<p>Side note: if you run the example from the post or the ticket memory&#x2F;resources is cleaned up perfect on iOS</p>
