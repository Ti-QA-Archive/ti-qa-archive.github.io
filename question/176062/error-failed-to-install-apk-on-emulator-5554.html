			<h1>error: &#34;Failed to install apk on &#34;emulator-5554&#34;</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi everybody, I have a problem that I have seen in many users, but there are many opinions and no one actually explain what to do. First of all, i&#39;m a beginner, so maybe it&#39;s a simple question(i hope). Titanium launch the emulator, but when it install the apk, the console show me this error: &quot;Failed to install apk on &quot;emulator-5554&quot;. I  tried the solution, and i&#39;ìve seen that setting the android version to 2.3.3 of my emulator could resolve the problem. In fact it resolves, but now the console show me for a long time &quot;Installing apk: myApp.apk&quot;, and it doesn&#39;t happen anything on. If i run the application when the emulator is going, titanium launch another emulator instead of installing the application in the emulator already operating. The questions are two: why with a newest version of 2.3.3 there is the error(&quot;Failed to install apk on &quot;emulator-5554&quot;), and why titanium every time opens a different emulator? i&#39;m using the SDK rev 23.0.2 and Titanium SDK 3.2.3 GA.<br>In some reply i saw that is better to use genymotion, but even if I follow the directions of Appcelerator, I can&#39;t install it. If you do not mind would you be able to tell me briefly how to do that or guide to follow? </p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
