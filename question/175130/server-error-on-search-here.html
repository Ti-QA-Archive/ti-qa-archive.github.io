							<p>Hi</p>
<p>If you would like to create a <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org">jira ticket</a> that way Appcelerator will know there is a problem and then they could take a look.  This will be very helpful to the community.  As you know the jira ticket system is how problems are reported to Appcelerator (it says it in the console every time you build an app).</p>
<p>The order by date thing is a huge pain.  Given how long you have been using Appcelerator I would have thought you had done the same as many of the rest of us old guard; used Google.  Simply search with &quot;appcelerator&quot; as the prefix and then whatever you are after gives excellent results - this is what I do, then you can use the date filters in Google.  Worth a try I assure you.</p>

										<p><p>BTW this ugly forum that isn&#39;t usable is used by thousands of people with all manner of issues.  I have answered more than 2,500 questions to those who seek help.</p>
<p>The google search also brings up jira tickets, github code and other blogs full of answers - the Q&amp;A is only one part of the package.</p>
