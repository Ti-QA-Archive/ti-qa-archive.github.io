			<h1>Problem loading data over 3G not working but works over wifi</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, I have a simple twitter client that fetches a JSON request to twitter for either a hash or user name search. Over wifi this is working fine however when I switch over to 3G the user name search brings back no data e.g get @appcelerator. </p>
<p>What&#39;s even more strange is over 3G the hash tags GET works fine e.g #codestrong. I am stumped as to what is happening I setup an error catch and an info printout of the fetched array and from what I can see it isn&#39;t throwing an error but the print out of the array is empty.</p>
<p>If anyone would like to she&#39;d some light on this situation it would be much appreciated. For an example just download and install the codestrong app on the app store this replicates the same behavior I am having.</p>
<p>I am running titanium mobile 1.7.5 compiling in Xcode 4.2 and running the app on an iPhone 5 iOS 5.0.1</p>
<p>Adam</p>

							<div><p>Hi Trevor<br>Yeh I have played with the timeouts made sure it was above the url in my code and also tried the enableKeepAlive:false to no avail.</p>
<p>Would anybody be able to load up KS in their phone and test the twitter mashup on 3g to see if they have the same problem as me?</p>
<p>Oh and p.s it is on an iPhone 4 not 5 as i wrote in the original post…</p>
