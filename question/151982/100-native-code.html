							<div><p>It&#39;s not like PhoneGap since it really uses <strong>native</strong> functions (the only thing is that Titanium maps you JS on these functions) : thus, the rendering is really fast and use the real components. Moreover, Titanium optimises the may you use your memory, etc. That&#39;s why Titanium is nearly <em>truly</em> native thanks to an intermediate interpretor…</p>
<p>With PhoneGap, the views are built with HTML rendering, which doesn&#39;t use native functions. Thus, it&#39;s not as fast as Titanium and they have to use CSS to render buttons&#x2F;list&#x2F;… which don&#39;t seem like native ones.</p>
<p>Thus, a PhoneGap app will never seem like a native one whereas a Titanium one yes !</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The problem here is the wording of the question as it automatically brings with it ambiguity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Titanium create 100% native apps</li>
<li>It uses JavaScript as the common language to allow multiple platforms including; Android, iOS, BlackBerry, Tizen and more coming.</li>
<li>The JavaScript is intelligently interpreted as the app is running and uses Just In Time dependence loading of objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Strictly speaking it does not create &quot;100% native code&quot;, to do that it would need to compile the JavaScript and then convert it into ObjectiveC for iOS, Java for Android and so on.</p>
<p>However the app itself is a 100% native app using the native objects, views and hardware features.</p>
<p>As to your second question <em>&quot;Will Titanium use our HTML5 &#x2F; JavaScript source and create 100% native code for android and iOS&quot;</em> - short answer is no.  Longer answer below.</p>
<p>Titanium is a huge SDK with access to the vast majority of native everything.  It does use JavaScript as mentioned - but it does not translate code you have created for another platform (HTML5 in this case) and make that &quot;work&quot;.  You will have to re-write sections of your app, including much of the UI as although there is support for native <strong>webView</strong>s these are used to show HTML content and not run apps from directly.</p>
<p>You will also find problem when submitting apps to the iOS app store (Android will accept anything).  iOS has rules on what will be allowed in, and if the app is basically (or could have been) a HTML5 web app, it is unlikely to be accepted into the store.</p>
<p>If you are truly looking to take some pre-rolled HTML and JavaScript then PhoneGap is the better platform, you will not have to make as many changes but you will not end up with a native app (actually a hybrid web app)as the PhoneGap solutions is basically a web view that shows html content and has a very simple shell that makes it appear as an app.  Great coders can turn these into great apps, but most are simply not great apps and spend a lot of time trying to pretend to be a native app.</p>
<p>Remember that FaceBook recently abandoned &quot;hybrid web apps&quot; as the performance was very poor and they simply could not provide the experience they needed.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;12&#x2F;13&#x2F;facebook-android-faster&#x2F;">Facebook Speeds Up Android App By Ditching HTML5 And Rebuilding It Natively Just Like The iOS Version</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want native apps, then a solution like Appcelerator&#x2F;Titanium is the way to go, but you will need to put in effort as there is no simple import HTML5 and output native app.  And there shouldn&#39;t be as they are built for two different sets of platforms and goals if they are done correctly.</p>

										<p><p>To further explain as your question like many before it assumes there is a simple answer.</p>
<p>Appcelerator&#x2F;Titanium creates native apps, the language it uses to achieve this is not the same one used as the mobile platform themselves.</p>
<p>When writing desktop applications for Windows, should you use;</p>
<ul>
<li>C</li>
<li>C++</li>
<li>Pascal</li>
<li>Cobol</li>
<li>C#</li>
<li>VB</li>
<li>F#</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>many many others?</li>
</ul>
<p>Microsoft themselves have used each of the above to create apps and the underpinnings of Windows itself, yet none of these are native code - they all compile down to code that runs as required.</p>
<p>Also the following; are interpreted languages from that same list; C#, VB, F# &amp; Java - all of these are compiled to pcode - these require a run-time interpretor to actually run.  Yet these are still native code development SDKs.</p>
<p>This is where Titanium is - nice and squarely - it creates its own pcode which is interpreted on the fly in an efficient way so there is no real difference.</p>
<p>But you then have others like Flash and Silverlight, these are specific platforms that use there own ways of doing things and do not have any required relationship with the host operating system.</p>
<p>Finally you have webapps, this is code and ui elements from HTML and CSS that performs functions - but you must have a web browser that must sit on the operating system.  These are drawings on a web page to mimic an app.  These have their uses - and great coders can do great things - but the vast majority of people will get a web page in a browser with a workable UI.</p>

										<p><p><strong>For example, to say &quot;…Strictly speaking it does not create 100% native code….&quot; And then also say. &quot;…is a 100% native app using the native objects …&quot; Is confusing</strong></p>
<p>Confusing probably but still true;</p>
<ul>
<li>100% native code would be ObjectiveC or Java for their respective platforms</li>
<li>100% native app, means all UI and internal processes are performed natively using a JavaScript layer to each platforms OS</li>
</ul>
<p>or</p>

<p><strong>There is NO policy at Apple forbidding hybrid or even web apps. None of the hundreds of hybrids we have submitted were ever denied. And having a &quot;native&quot; App is NO guarantee you will be approved! That is all a whole different issue that has little to do with how an App is created.</strong></p>
<p>You took my specific example and made it general.</p>
<p>I made the comment <em>&quot;..a HTML5 web app, it is unlikely to be accepted into the store&quot;</em>, I did not suggest that an app made up predominately of HTML5 elements and not native UI - I in fact added the extra words <strong>web app</strong> as there is a specific clause that prohibits apps that could or should have been targeted as actual web apps from being an actual app.</p>
<p><strong>The Facebook issue is not a fault of HTML5, but of the way the Facebook code was written. And Facebook STILL performs poorly.</strong>  </p>
<p>According to Facebook and most commentators the old HTML5 hybrid app was a very poor performer compared to the now native version.  It may well still perform badly in your opinino - but it is strongly believed that it behaved even worse as a hybrid version and it was that single point that was sited by Mark Zuckerberg when making the native app announcement.</p>
<p>You are right though (as I said a couple of times myself) great coders can do great things with all platforms, bad coders - are well just bad coders.</p>
<p><strong>JavaScript was never developed as a standalone language - it was developed as an integral part of the HTML&#x2F;web browser system. In hybrids, HTML is used to create the UI which has advantages.</strong></p>
<p>It is true that originally <strong>JavaScript</strong> was designed for use with browsers - but that was years ago and ignores everything is is now used on that has nothing to do with browsers.  The language has evolved to suit its new usage - as many other things have since their creation.  Not sure judging something based on its birth when it is now a fully grown adult is fair to the adult.</p>
<p>The suggestion that because JavaScript was originally designed for browser usage does not mean that Hybrid apps have any advantage.  It is just a fact that JavaScript works with the HTML dom.</p>
<p><strong>So far, the best approach I have seen is the eqela language, which actually outputs complete 100% native code for whatever platform - java for android, objective C for IOS, etc. but it is its&#39; own language and has a small support base (if they don&#39;t like your question, they just ignore you)</strong></p>
<p>I have not heard of <strong>Egela</strong> but I will take a look.  On the surface the ability to create actual code in the native preferred language - would be the best plan.  But that only relies on the the code being perfectly optimised - for example which loops should be used in this circumstance and how and where should the variable scope be.</p>
<p>Further as you have already pointed out - there is more to the platform than a language - support for example is a requirement (unless you are a genius - I am allowing for that), documentation, updates, full platform feature support and so on.</p>
<p><strong>If the responses so far are correct, there is an immense amount of work required when using Titanium as opposed to hybrid native&#x2F;HTML-JavaScript model.</strong></p>
<p>Short answer - yes, you have to do some work, assuming your app is a HTML5 based one - there is likely a lot of work to do.  But you seem smart enough to realise that it is unlikely you can perform an import and 20 seconds later get a fully non HTML5 version of the app ready for submission.  If your UI is all HTML - then you will have to completely re-write your app inside Titanium, ObjectiveC, Java etc.</p>
<p><strong>I do not agree that hybrid apps, web apps and &quot;native&quot; apps have different &quot;goals&quot;</strong></p>
<p>This one is very subjective, and I know you are smart enough to realise that many developers see HTML5 apps as things that are not usually mass-marketed and are commonly designed to solve a specific purpose in association with a web site that would have promoted its use.</p>
<p>Native apps are aimed at mass market saturation and have an aim of being the number 1 something.</p>
<p>But again NOT ALWAYS - on any of this, it is correct that all things blur and all things have their benefits and negatives.</p>
<p>If you are moving a HTML5 app - I suspect Titanium is not going to be the easiest of routes.</p>

										<p><p><strong>Please don&#39;t let us get started on the monstrosity known as &quot;windows&quot; - in my 35 years as a software engineer, by far the worst OS.</strong></p>
<p>Not sure we have to start any slanging match over a OS, my usage was to point out that most modern languages themselves do not compile true machine code any more.</p>
<p><strong>I am old school, so an interpreted language(VB) s not truly native, a compiled language (C) is what I consider &quot;native&quot;. The information I have seen here most relevant to my question was: &quot;Titanium creates its own pcode which is interpreted on the fly …&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Your example of VB is out of date BTW or at least it works in the same way as C# does at compiler level and C# is used for most of the recent batch of applications from MS and others, although there is a move in different directions again - as all things should do.</p>
<p>The phrase <strong>pcode</strong> was used to normalise the conversation - this is not actually what happens but it is close enough for the purposes of this.</p>
<p><strong>So Titanium is not &quot;native&quot;. In a hybrid, the webview(browser) interprets the HTML-JavaScript. It may be slower now, but it will improve. But I wasn&#39;t trying to debate the 2 approaches, just understand what&#x2F;how Titanium works, because the hype is vague&#x2F;misleading.</strong></p>
<p>You still believe that <strong>not native</strong> means not compiled to machine code - if that premise is true - Android apps are also not native.  Titanium does create native apps as all code and UI are rendered using the OS at API level.  Hybrid apps&#x2F;HTML 5 apps are the furthest away from that as they require a web browser to run (even if it is hidden in the background).</p>
<p><strong>Eqela creates compilable code complete with hardware features etc. no interpreter, just native objective C, or Java, etc. But, as I said, they have very few programmers as yet and little support.</strong></p>
<p>Sounds like you have a favourite - not had a chance to try it myself.</p>
<p><strong>PhoneGap is not necessarily the best hybrid approach, though their rendering of the HTML5 canvas is very good. I suspect we will see use of HTML5 and the canvas grow quickly, because frankly, UI design is a pain in the arse and anything that simplifies that - anything that simplifies UI creation - will be welcome.</strong></p>
<p>There are certainly trade-offs, and HTML5 and Canvas may be easier for you than developing a true app (sorry but a HTML 5 is not a true app) but that is because you are drawing on a canvas not employing the actual native controls - you are hobbled before you start.  Depending on the application it does not matter.  But on the apps I build that require; large infrastructures, multiple device platforms, all native controls, fast memory efficient memory management access to all the hardware feature of each device - then you have to put in the time. This does not mean it takes a long time - but these are not things you can or should throw together.</p>
<p><strong>I was disappointed I could find no simple definitive guide on how titanium works, how it creates the Apps and how they actually work (I.e, pcode interpreted ).</strong></p>
<p>The reason is simple; there are no easy ways to define something that try as you might still get misunderstood.</p>
<p>100% native code !== 100% native app.</p>

										<p><p>Javascript has evolved, this is true. But it is still interpreted not compiled. As I said - I am a bit old school. If it is interpreted, its not truly native. There IS that extra &quot;layer&quot;. Which also means it is NOT an advantage to either approach, from that aspect.</p>
<p>Hybrids have an advantage only in that they can be designed quickly and easily, can still leverage all the things that JavaScript can do - even APIs to access native functions within the HTML environment - and have a huge existing codebase - and require less developer training. All without having to do a lot of per-platform UI mucking. And that does not mean they are &quot;thrown together&quot;.</p>
<p>But, they are not truly native. Titanium is obviously closer to what I personally consider true native, but is more work. Time costs money.</p>
<p>Just an FYI: you will find the eqela language - mostly a subset of C&#x2F;Java - produced VERY good source code for the target platform that is well optimized, and you only have to code the UI ONCE (thank God!). Doesn&#39;t mean you still shouldn&#39;t do some tweaking. :) But the lack of a user base and an unresponsive support staff is a true problem.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, we don&#39;t program game apps - they have far more strenuous requirements. And we are not working with &quot;large infrastructures&quot; either, or apps that &quot;require&quot; all native controls. But ours is a small shop, so the amount of time that has to be spent on UI is more critical.</p>
<p>I can not get a handle on just how much work Titanium would add, as opposed to designing a UI JUST once, in HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;Javascript and running it through one of the hybrid-creation frameworks like PhoneGap.</p>
<p>To a large degree, I have had the question answered though - Titanium is not what I call &quot;native code&quot;. It creates a layer that pcodes (close enough to whatever &quot;really happens&quot;) JavaScript and - much more critical - UI design is more work, and per platform. Not implying that is bad or good, just the information I was looking to obtain.</p>
<p>I have been a software engineer for 35 years, and I do disagree:<br>it IS possible to explain things simply, such as explaining that Titanium &quot;generates a sort of &#39;pcode&#39;  from your JavaScript that an interpreter… etc., etc.&quot; -<br>IF<br>you try to avoid couching the information within a context of whether that is a good or bad approach. It is what it is. :-)</p>
<p>The goal is: the right tool for the task - I just needed to know how the tool worked, how it could be used, how much effort it would be to use, so I could tell if it is right for OUR tasks.</p>
<p>It has been an interesting discussion. :-)</p>

							<p>With Titanium, you write your code in JavaScript.<br>This JavaScript code is embedded in your iOS&#x2F;android app.</p>
<p>Then, it is interpreted and map on native functions. Thus, it does not convert your code in native one, but it does use native functions. That&#39;s why you can see native UI&#x2F;animations. The bad thing is that you have to load the interpreters.</p>
<p>Am I clear or do you need more informations ?</p>
