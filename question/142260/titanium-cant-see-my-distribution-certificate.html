			<h1>Titanium can&#39;t see my distribution certificate</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to publish my app for enterprise distribution.  I get through the first step of choosing a location and SDK version, etc.  I&#39;m getting stuck on the second step.  I have a red X beside &quot;Obtain Distribution Certificate&quot;.  I do have a distribution certificate, but I don&#39;t know how to make Titanium see it.  I&#39;ve tried moving it into different folders, refreshing the window, clicking on the drop down menu beside &quot;Select Distribution Certificate&quot;, etc.  Nothing&#39;s working. </p>
<p>How can I make Titanium see my distribution certificate?</p>

							<p>There is no need to add folders. Just double click on distribution profile certificate and its private keys certificate, it will automatically store in keychain access.Now build app with distribution profile, in titanium you will be able to see the certificate.</p>

										<p><p>Sorry, I should have mentioned that was the first thing.  I believe that&#39;s what Apple says to do in their instructions.  Anyway, I tried it again, and it still isn&#39;t showing up.  Thanks for the suggestion though.</p>

							<p>Hi John, try deleting the certificate and profile from keychain and clean titanium studio including its hidden files in your Home directory, reinstall the your certificate and profile. then do a fresh install of titanium it will ask you for keyChain access. provide that and then check and let us know. it that worked. <strong>worked for me for developer profile, not sure for distribution.</strong></p>
