			<h1>Suggestion needed - Single Window App w/multiple view wizard</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>All,</p>
<p>I have a single window mobile app that uses a wizard approach for user registration. I have a login view with a button to take the user to register, followed by registration views 1, 2, and 3. On each of the registration views, I want a stand-alone back button, as I am not using a navigation bar. </p>
<p>I have tried numerous approaches, such as removing the current view to display the prior view on the stack, but this isn&#39;t working. I am also using the CommonJS approach to open each new view, and that is resulting in some weird actions as well, such as controls in the current view being visible in either the next view or prior view. </p>
<p>This really should not be rocket science. I am ready to punt on this approach altogether and just use windows as I know closing them and opening them works. I would prefer, however, to use views as they are supposedly lighter weight and easier on memory. That may be so, but so far the view approach is just hurting my brain. </p>
<p>Any an all help is greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>Thanks,<br>B</p>

							<p>Forget it. I am going with windows for now. And yes, I realize that code and platform etc. may have helped, although I think this was more a conceptual need than software specific.</p>

							<p>I would make an array of views, and put them in a scrollableview.   Have your back and next use the scrollTo method to go back and forth.</p>
