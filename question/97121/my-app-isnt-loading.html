			<h1>My App Isn&#39;t loading</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have an app on the market, but for some reason several people are unable to load the app (It just shows the loading screen). But for thousands of people it is working, so I know it is not a specific device or OS version. I have obtained a device where this is an issue. I have linked to the device log and Console log.</p>
<p>Device log: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;private&#x2F;lhwl2oskxyyptr83whlbg</p>
<p>Console log: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;private&#x2F;qovahuie2ryeji2otry8ha</p>
<p>This goes a bit over my head, but if any of you experts out there can spot what my issue is, it would be a huge relief. My app is free and I make no money for it, but this issue is bringing my rating down significantly. </p>
<p>I would be extremely grateful to any help, as I have not been able to figure this out. </p>

<p>iAd is only supported on iOS 3.2 and above, so anyone running your app on 3.1 will experience these problems.</p>
<p>The exception:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Script <span class="hljs-built_in">Error</span> = Result <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> expression <span class="hljs-string">'Ti.UI.iOS'</span> [<span class="hljs-literal">null</span>]
</code></pre><p>can be mitigated by checking that <code>Ti.UI.iOS</code> is not null before using it.</p>
<p>Thanks to Blain for clarifying this for me.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>Thank you so much Hal!</p>
<p>So would you recommend just checking the iOS version, before I declare any iAd parameters? How would this look?</p>
<p>Alternatively, I might just take out all iAd code for now, since for some reason Apple is not displaying any iAds for my app.</p>

<p>Well, you could do that, or simply follow my suggestion above (checking that Ti.UI.iOS is not null before using it).</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve now tried two itouchs that have OS 3.1.3 on them. Neither one will load the app. Is this an incompatibility? </p>
<p>This should be a much cleaner console log, it starts when I open the app:</p>

<p>I am curious about why this would happen, and would like to help. Would you be able to post a link to the app?</p>
