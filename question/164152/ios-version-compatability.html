<p>You mean you have a DEVICE with 7.0.4 and 6.0 on it and you can&#39;t run your project on it? No, I&#39;m betting you are being unclear, and you cant find the SIMULATOR for one of those versions because you didn&#39;t open your new xCode and go to downloads to download the simulator images available from Apple.</p>

<p>Ah, see, it took a comment to get out of you your environment.  You post around here enough, and have been told enough, what is expected in a question yet you keep ignoring important details.</p>

										<p><p>So now we know you are trying to install to a device, but no details about the device, no specific error message, because <code>on the device it is showing application wont support</code> sure doesnt look like an Apple error message.</p>
