			<h1>How to retrieve the actual screen resolution (not platformWidth/platformHeight)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>This may seem like an easy one.</p>
<p>I want to know the amount of pixels available in each orientationmode.<br>I want to know the available width in landscape, and the available height in portrait. First guess, of course is to think that you can get the width and the height and switch them to use as width = height and height = width on orientation switch.</p>
<p>Another option is to get the values after orientation change. But I want to do some precalculations before I build the UI, soo before the orientation has ever changed.</p>
<p><strong>DisplayCaps</strong></p>
<p>I noticed a difference in the <code>displayCaps.platformWidth</code> and <code>displayCaps.platformHeight</code> behaviour on iOS vs Android. An iPad gives me 768x1024 which is the resolution of the screen. Android however gives me the amount of pixels available in the current orientation. So with an Samsung Tab 2 in portrait the result is 800x1232 and in landscape 1280x752 (wxh). The resolution of the device is 1280x800. This makes sense, from this I can conclude that the height of the bar at the bottom is 48. On iOS I can safely asume that the available height is <code>displayCaps.platformHeight - 20</code>, but on Android I can not rely on a static value.</p>
<p>Any ideas on how to do this?</p>

<p>I allready created a webview, waited for it&#39;s load event and then do an evalJS and retrieve <code>screen.width</code> and <code>screen.height</code>. But I really don&#39;t want to do this.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>This is a simple way of checking the dimensions across Android &amp; iOS (iPhone and iPad).</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var <span class="hljs-built_in">scale</span> = <span class="hljs-number">1</span>;
var <span class="hljs-variable">width</span> = Ti.Platform.displayCaps.platformWidth;
var <span class="hljs-variable">height</span> = Ti.Platform.displayCaps.platformHeight;
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (Ti.Platform.osname !== <span class="hljs-string">'android '</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-built_in">scale</span> = (Ti.Platform.displayCaps.density === <span class="hljs-string">'high'</span>) ? <span class="hljs-number">2</span> : <span class="hljs-number">1</span>;
    <span class="hljs-variable">width</span> = <span class="hljs-variable">width</span> * <span class="hljs-built_in">scale</span>;
    <span class="hljs-variable">height</span> = <span class="hljs-variable">height</span> * <span class="hljs-built_in">scale</span>;
}
Ti.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">'dimensions: '</span> + <span class="hljs-variable">width</span> + <span class="hljs-string">'x'</span> + <span class="hljs-variable">height</span>);
</code></pre><p>One problem you will face is that you cannot assume Android devices are always portrait, so the response to an orientation check may not be the correct dimension depending on how the device reports that value back.</p>

										<p><p>My apologies, I read the question as you were trying to get the screen sizes and were merely discussing the bottom sections.</p>
<p>So you need the internal remaining dimensions after the main interface elements have been removed from the equation.</p>
<p>OK - that is harder, especially if you are taking Android into account and if you are dealing with Android 2.3 with tabs and Android 3.x&#x2F;4.x with ActionBars.  Also multiple Android density factors need to be taken into account.</p>
<p>iOS is mostly easy, see this guide on sizes; <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;titaniumtips.com&#x2F;files&#x2F;tag-dimensions.php">iOS sizes</a>, Android has many variables - but this is a starting point; <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.drdobbs.com&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;sizing-android-visual-elements-correctly&#x2F;230600075">Sizing Android Visual Elements Correctly</a>.</p>
<p>However, most of the time you do not need these values if your app is utilising scroll views (tableView or scrollView), sizing constants like <strong>Ti.UI.SIZE</strong> and <strong>Ti.UI.FILL</strong> (without offset margins at the same time, layout property (with <strong>horizontal</strong> and <strong>vertical</strong>).</p>
<p>Using the above means that your app will handle most of the layout you need with you providing minimal layout modifications on orientation changes.  Not always of course - depends on the type of app you are building.</p>
<p>But the golden rule here is use tried and tested UI and techniques and test, early and often.</p>
<p>Just sorry there is no specific answer I can give as you can tell from above.</p>
