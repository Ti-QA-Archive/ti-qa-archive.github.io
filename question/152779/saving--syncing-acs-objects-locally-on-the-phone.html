			<h1>Saving / Syncing ACS Objects locally on the phone</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am creating an app where I will be making full use of ACS, however, I need the app to be able to have some of my custom objects saved locally, so the user can still have functionality when it is off line.  The offline functioning of the app is quite important.  The best solution I have found so far was in this blog post:<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2010&#x2F;06&#x2F;how-to-persist-complex-javascript-objects.html</p>
<p>which is basically using JSON serialization and titanium properties.  The issue with I have with this is if I am saving an array of custom objects like this, it seems you have to retrieve the entire array of objects, as opposed to just one of the items.  </p>
<p>Essentially I want to have my custom objects available offline.  </p>
<p>Any help? Thanks!</p>

							<p>I use ACS and sync locally to an sqlite database. It isn&#39;t two way syncing (I basically update one way from ACS to the database) but it allows users to be offline and access their data. It works really well and because it is a database, it&#39;s fast and you can simply query what you want. You could try that approach.</p>
