		<section>
			<p>Hi Titanium Developers,</p>
<p>Titanium looked fine but I&#39;ve been fighting with the framework for 2 days and I&#39;m now a bit frustrated.</p>
<p>Why did Titanium behave DIFFERENT in the simulator and the device?</p>
<p>What the most get me down was that NO clue for such errors?</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">

<span class="dns">[WARN] Exception in event callback. {
    line = 15<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    message = "'undefined' is not an object (evaluating 'Ti.UI.iPhone.SystemButtonStyle')"<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    name = TypeError<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    sourceId = <span class="hljs-number">301374656</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
}</span>
</code></pre><pre><code class="hljs">

    line = 15<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

    message = "'undefined' is not an object (evaluating 'Ti.App.fireEvent')"<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

    name = TypeError<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

       sourceId = <span class="hljs-number">105929312</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

}
</code></pre><p>Why were the Titanium&#39;s own object such as Ti.App and Ti.UI.iPhone.SystemButtonStyle UNDEFINED?</p>
<p>Could anybody tell me how you figure out such errors?</p>

							<p>Hi Xiong,</p>
<p>I have had this error before when I tried to add Titanium activity indicator. Try the following as it worked for me. Go to Project &gt; Clean. Then select your current project and click okay. Run your app in the simulator again and see what happens.</p>

							<p>Well this happens sometimes because Ti loads needed libraries on demand, while Simulator gets all modules by default. In this case you got caching issues, removing the <code>build</code> folder will force a full rebuild. I agree this is anoying but it occurs more less than it did in the past and if you know that you can fix it fast.</p>

							<p>It turned to just as what you said that a full rebuild is required to avoid such odd errors.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I made typo of Ti.Api and Ti.APP.<br>After fixing the problem, I did not make clean the project before I encountered the problem.</p>
<p>I&#39;m feeling better today since I&#39;ve been getting support from the community.</p>
<p>thank you!</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to implement a feature of &#39;Scrollable View + Web View + Local HTML&#x2F;JS&#39;.<br>Though it&#39;s full of tricks to me, I&#39;m making progresses with the help of the posts here.<br>I would share my findings as well.</p>
