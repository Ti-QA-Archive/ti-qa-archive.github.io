							<div><p>Thanks Sarafaraz for your reply.<br>I found a workaround of this issue.</p>
<p>Previously I was adding delete functionality within the for loop which cause the all row deletion one by one.<br>Adding delete functionality outside for loop &amp; within &quot;onload : &quot; block solve the issue.</p>

							<div><p>@Moiz,</p>
<p>i know :).</p>
<p>I have just suggest the another solution for that…i didn&#39;t told that this is the best way.</p>
<p>and yes you are right that generally we don&#39;t need to use this for simply deletion but..if we are using data that we need to store in property for using later then we have to use this method..or if we are using table editing property then this solution is best.</p>
<p>Ya but in that case i have just suggest this for growing up knowledge of Sonu.</p>
<p>And thanks for guiding me and keep it continue, so it might be possible that i got some knowledge from you :)</p>

							<p>Hi,</p>
<p>deleteRow() function only delete one row at a time, I think you are doing something wrong, we need complete code to test. But this listener should  work correct, there is no problem within it.</p>
