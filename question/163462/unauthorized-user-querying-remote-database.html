			<h1>unauthorized user querying remote database</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I&#39;m creating an mobile app where people can share all kinds of things with each other. The shared data is stored in an external database which is queried by some php scripts on a web server. </p>
<p>The problem I&#39;m facing is that ANYone could query this database just by creating a simple http request to my web server. How can I (or actually the web server) be sure that the request comes from a verified user and not some random person on a computer trying to steal or corrupt data from the database? </p>
<p>Some things I was having in mind, but still sound like bad practice…</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Every time a user makes a request to the web server it has to pass a username and password to verify the user. </p>
</li>
<li><p>When a user logs in for the first time the web server creates a random &#39;key&#39; which is stored in the database together with the user info. The key will also be send to the user&#39;s device and stored locally. On any further requests from user to web server this key also needs to be send and verified with the user. An attacker would now need a &#39;key&#39; combined with a user id to break in the database.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A side note: I&#39;m making use of a SSL connection, so the data transferred should be secure.</p>
<p>Hope to hear from you!</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>This is a question with a million answers, from; do not worry everything will be fine (not recommend) to you can only access the data if you are connected to an approved IP address from an approved device and so on.</p>
<p>So for this I will assume the data is important and private in transit.</p>
<p>One very common technique is to use <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;OAuth">oauth</a>, twitter uses this for their apis for example.  However you may not want to go this far.</p>
<p>So you have to balance real security with level of protection.  By this I mean what is the best level of security you can provide for the type of security you actually need.  I worked with a company that had the equivalent of a big safe that contained a small safe that contained a lock box that contained padlock case that contained a url that was navigable without going through that process.  They spent time &quot;appearing&quot; to be secure.</p>
<p>So whilst I do not have your apps true security needs to hand this is what I would do to build on your own answers;</p>
<ul>
<li>Number 1; nope this is not good for the reasons you state, you never pass those details more than you have to</li>
<li>Number 2; better, here are some simple improvements;<ul>
<li>&#39;random&#39; key must be &#39;random unique key&#39;</li>
<li>key should have a &#39;lifetime&#39; attached (think time-out) that is reset on every successful api call made</li>
<li>that key is used with each api call requested</li>
<li>if the lifetime has expired either resend the username&#x2F;passowrd again - if this is fits with the apps security model to gain a new key and re-request the api call first made (2 calls to api).  Or require the user to log back in again and use those details for the request.  The second one is more likely to fail from the users perspective as the annoyance will override the increase in security</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ALL usernames and password should be encrypted, hashed in some way - ideally with a salt value, the salt value should not be in the same table and ideally not the same db or db location as the main data (the more you do the more you are protected but keep in mind the balance of enough and a little more over nothing is ever getting into to my read me file.</li>
<li>Consider using some element of the phones uniqueness (at least for the time the app is currently running) to help encrypt the key</li>
<li>Include a basic auth header to all api calls that has the key in it, do not send this by a parameter</li>
<li>Use your own encryption on the header value as well as base 64&#39;ing the value, this way when you decode on the server this is also your decryption check</li>
<li>As your connection will be based on the users entry logged against the traffic, consider logging usage and looking for excessive calls - you could rate limit these in code - anyone hacking the connection would have to do it on one account and repeat call - so frequency would indicate to you bad practise </li>
<li>I also include an element of the time to the encryption of the outbound data so the server uses the same element to reverse the passed data.  This way the value being passed actually changes as time goes on.  Harder to solve straight away - but nice additonal layer.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a reasonable article for an overview of API design considerations;</p>
