			<h1>A Serious Issue with Vertical Layout on iOS</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>After finding out view.layout = &#39;vertical&#39; we&#39;ve used it extensively to all pages. Rather than guessing absolute positions, we laid out all elements in relative terms. So far we thought it was great.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a serious issue arose and it made us horrified: when you show() and hide() a view, it shows a ugly repositioning of elements. We&#39;ve found that this problem occurs all the views with its vertical layout option. It&#39;s so distasteful to see how elements are getting arranged. If a view is already rendered, that&#39;s no problem. But it occurs whenever we call show() and hide(). In short, the layout feature sucks beyond one&#39;s imagination. It happens both on device and emulator.</p>
<p>Did anyone resolve this annoying issue? The API documentation must add a warning against layout property, if this &quot;outrageous feature&quot; is the default behavior of all views with that property.</p>

							<div><p>That flickering is exactly what I meant by &quot;serious issue.&quot; Your gist contains too small elements. Let&#39;s magnify it and see how that flickering can be so annoying. I forked your gist and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;1211717">made them bigger</a>. If the elements are image views, the flickering effect gets far blatant and almost renders vertical layout option unusable. I don&#39;t get why it needs to be repositioned every time whenever a hidden view gets back. Why is that flickering necessary? Seriously.</p>

							<div><p>In contrast to the above gist, try <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;1211742">this one</a> with absolute positioning with vertical layout option. It works damn fine of course! I can&#39;t understand the way layout vertical option is implemented. It&#39;s just horrible.</p>

							<div><p>I only tried the enlarged element gist in a simulator, but IMHO you are being way too overdramatic saying it &quot;almost renders vertical layout option unusable&quot;.  Maybe it is more pronounced on a device or with image views but I personally don&#39;t find the flicker more than a minor artifact.</p>
<p>Regarding &quot;the way layout vertical option is implemented&quot; being &quot;just horrible&quot; or an &quot;outrageous feature&quot;, I thought that Titanium just passed these as properties to native UI objects and iOS itself is doing virtually all the layout and rendering of these.</p>
<p>If I&#39;m right, then it is iOS which has the &quot;just horrible&quot; implementation and your rant at Appcelerator is misplaced at best.</p>

							<div><p>@Doug Sorry for my poor choice of words. But see a worse case like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;1211828">this one</a>. This is no longer a mere &quot;flickering&quot; anymore. It&#39;s more like a &quot;glitch.&quot; In the gist, I&#39;ve placed more irregular views than what Kevin put in his original example. Just imagine a vertical layout view with images and labels and other components gets back from a hidden state. It really looks ugly, even though it&#39;s just two or three frames.</p>

							<p>I have tested this in both 1.7.3 and a continuous build for 1.8.x and believe this to be a platform issue that needs resolution - <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-5268">track the JIRA ticket here</a>.  A watch on a JIRA ticket is seen as a &quot;vote up&quot;, so watch the ticket as desired.</p>
<p>The best path forward in this case would be to use absolute positioning for views that must be hidden&#x2F;shown.  Or, alternately, one could use z-indexing of view elements to first show a view which was z-indexed behind a currently visible view, and after a short period of time, change the z-index of the view to make it visible to the user.  The latter is sub-optimal, but perhaps necessary if your view is dynamically created.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, Kevin. IMHO, it would forward the quality of Titanium platform by miles, if not lightyears.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;d have to agree with this, it is really distracting having views flicker as elements get calculated and re-rendered in the correct locations. Considering all native apps are generally visual wonders it&#39;s quite a deterrent.</p>
<p>Not sure how this is related to Ti and iOS and its rendering, but considering I&#39;ve never seen such problems on pure native apps it can prob be improved.</p>
<p>One possibility could be a layout manager&#x2F;render engine.. it actually plays into why working with Ti is a bit of a nightmare at times, no Interface Builder. </p>
<p>What would be great is if there was some form of XIB&#x2F;NIB that can be structured correctly, passed down to Obj-C land which builds up the view&#x2F;all elements and then passes back some formatted JS obj which has all handlers to the created objects. </p>
<p>Far better than looping up in JS land adding individual rows, labels, images etc… would be nicer to fill in a layout manager structure and ask Ti to setup the view..</p>
