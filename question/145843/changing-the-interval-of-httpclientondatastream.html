			<h1>Changing the interval of HTTPClient.ondatastream</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Anyone knows how to set the interval, or how the built-in interval works, for <code>HTTPClient.ondatastream</code>?</p>
<p>I&#39;m downloading a file and for this example, I&#39;d like to get a progress update (to set a ProgressBar) every 1 second.</p>
<p>Anyone knows how to do it?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>It is automatic, it fires when it is ready as it works out the best throughput of data and then updates you on the current progress.  You are not able to change it.</p>
<p>Trying to get it update every second is counter productive even if you could get it to work as you would have situations where it would fire back the same value for several fires as nothing new was ready to report.</p>

										<p><p>Yeah, but &quot;trusting&quot; HTTPClient to know what&#39;s the best progress interval for me, is not the thing I&#39;d want to do.</p>

										<p><p>Not sure why you do not trust httpClient.  I am guessing it does return the data you ask of it?</p>
<p>As the intervals are determined based on a multitude if factors, including connection type, connection speed, errors in transmission count, total amount of data being transmitted, available resources on the device, local storage for any caching and more - it then works out the best times to throw out a progress update.  The intervals can increase and decrease during a single request as these factors change during a single request.</p>
<p>I would and do trust it, if I did not then I would have to consider all the other parts of Titanium suspect and at that point give up coding altogether.</p>
<p>I have have created many successful apps (slap on own back) and all use httpClient in some way, all work as expected and user feedback is handled using the progress callback.</p>
