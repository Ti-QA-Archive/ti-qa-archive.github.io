			<h1>Location-reading iOS app that runs in background indefinitely</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>App type: mobile<br>Ti SDK: 3.0.0<br>Platform: iOS 5.x, 6.x + various iPhones and iPads</p>
<p>I&#39;d like to ask a question about running in the background on iOS.  This app is an enterprise app and need not pass certification by Apple (installed via email link).  It can be as obnoxious as it wants about battery use also, as the expectation is the device will be plugged in at all times (in the user&#39;s car).</p>
<p>What I want is very simple: I&#39;d like the app to just keep running, without even getting suspended, ever – even if user background the app.  It does need to know about every location update (not just &quot;large change&quot;), and it needs to send this location update to our server each time.  We have this app now: It registers with Ti.Geolocation; when a location events comes in it logs it and sends it to server; and has a GUI as well.  It also beeps when certain events come in through network.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve done my homework and gotten some results.  Firstly I added </p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">iphone</span>&gt;</span> 
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">backgroundModes</span>&gt;</span> 
        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">mode</span>&gt;</span>audio<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">mode</span>&gt;</span> 
        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">mode</span>&gt;</span>location<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">mode</span>&gt;</span> 
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">backgroundModes</span>&gt;</span> 
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">iphone</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>to tiapp.xml as documented, but this had no effect, I think due to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-12576.  So I used the workaround in tiapp.xml as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">ios</span>&gt;</span>
        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">min-ios-ver</span>&gt;</span>5.0<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">min-ios-ver</span>&gt;</span>
        <span class="hljs-comment">&lt;!-- Add things into iOS Info.plist. --&gt;</span>
        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">plist</span>&gt;</span>
            <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">dict</span>&gt;</span>
                <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">key</span>&gt;</span>UIBackgroundModes<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">key</span>&gt;</span>
                <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">array</span>&gt;</span>
                    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">string</span>&gt;</span>location<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">string</span>&gt;</span>
                    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">string</span>&gt;</span>audio<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">string</span>&gt;</span>
                <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">array</span>&gt;</span>
            <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">dict</span>&gt;</span>
        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">plist</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">ios</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>This added the right stuff to the generated Info.plist; so that&#39;s one hurdle cleared.  AND when the app is tested in simulator (iOS6) and devices running iOS 5, iOS 6, backgrounding the app indeed keeps it running (without UI showing of course)!  The location reading icon is on, and I can tell by network logs on server that it&#39;s sending updates.  Battery is being drained – just what we want.  Great.  </p>
<p>I then tested what happens on iOS 5 and iOS 6 as the app continues to run in the background indefinitely (plugged in to power).  On iOS 5 it keeps running for at least a couple of hours (I think indefinitely, but I obviously cannot prove that).  </p>
<p>Unfortunately on iOS 6 that is NOT the case – the app does get suspended.  Through repeated experiments, I determined that the app is suspended (not terminated) about 16-17 minutes after entering background.  iOS 5: no problem.  iOS 6: gets suspended.</p>
<p>So now the question: how can I make it not do that?  How can I make it just keep running in background (ignore any battery concerns)?  I&#39;ve really tried to get the answer in other questions, but it&#39;s just not clear to me.</p>
<ul>
<li>Am I doing something wrong?</li>
<li>Do I have to use a http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.App.iOS.BackgroundService instead of just having everything in the app proper?<ul>
<li>If so, won&#39;t it also just get killed in 10 minutes (&quot;The OS limits the total amount of time a background service can run for after the application is paused, typically to no more than 10 minutes.&quot;)?</li>
<li>Or is there some way to prevent it from getting killed?  Maybe it will stay alive if it (the BackgroundService JS file) registers with Ti.Geolocation, because I have the tiapp.xml addition above?</li>
<li>Doing anything special in a separate JS file (required with the BackgroundService approach) is undesirable, because it increases complexity, but I&#39;ll do it if I have to.  Do I have to?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I would LOVE an answer and be very grateful, because this stuff seems so opaque.  An answer would probably be very helpful to future readers too, as this seems like a frequently mysterious topic.</p>

							<div><p>I have nearly the exact same question.  Our app requirements are to track user&#39;s location every 5 minutes and send coords to our servers.  I have spotty results.  Sometimes, when the app goes into the background, it will send updates all day long.  Other times, it will stop after 15-20 minutes (similar timing to yours).  My app is registering a background service, as I assumed that was needed.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s my background JS file for posterity:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;8361033">gpsBackgroundService.js</a></p>
<p>And I call it on the &#39;paused&#39; event:</p>
<hr>
<p>gpsBackgroundService = Ti.App.iOS.registerBackgroundService({<br>    url: &#39;&#x2F;utils&#x2F;gpsBackgroundService.js&#39;</p>
<h2 id="-">});</h2>
<p>If you&#39;ve found out more info about any of this, I would be very grateful.</p>
<p>Thanks!<br>-Mark</p>

							<div><p>I also am running into related issues.  However, in my case I am using an iOS SDK to handle the background location tracking.  I&#39;ve created a module to access this SDK in the Titanium app&#39;s JS and do the SDK&#39;s required initializations to start location tracking.  I&#39;ve done the same steps mentioned above to setup UIBackgroundModes and am also not using a Ti BackgroundService (as the iOS SDK is handling this), but have not had any luck.</p>
