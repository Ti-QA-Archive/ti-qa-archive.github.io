			<h1>Alloy - GPS proximity</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I have been googling my backside off, trying to find some script or an idea on how to implement GPS proximity between two or more devices. I have already got on my way with an Ti Alloy app, and it is reading GPS data and displaying it on a test window I created. The App will be primarily for the Android platform (for starters).</p>
<p>Basically what I need is something similar to an android app called Grindr, where two or more people in a close vicinity (within a few kilometer radius) run the same app and each of their apps shows a person(s) nearby and what distance away (if possible), and lists them in a listview getting the user profile data from the remote database. The database side I think I can accomplish, it&#39;s mainly the GPS handling and getting the proximity that I am battling with. Mapping is NOT necessary though.</p>
<p>I have a general idea of what it takes but don&#39;t have enough experience with coding something like this myself and wouldn&#39;t want o reinvent the wheel when it may be out there.</p>
<p>I know this is a Ti Q&amp;A, but thought I&#39;d post this anyway. I hope that&#39;s ok?</p>
<p>Any feedback or a resource I can refer to would be greatly appreciated.<br>Thanks, Mario.<br>BTW Titanium Studio is awesome!</p>

							<p>Basically what you need to do is to get the current position of the user,and send it to the server.<br>Then the server should compile a list of &quot;close to you&quot; users, and send it back to the user.</p>
<p>Makes sense?</p>

										<p><p>Hi Dan, thanks. Definitely makes sense and I&#39;ve gathered it would be something like that.</p>
<p>The issue I&#39;m battling with mostly is, how would the processing on the server determine the distance? In other words, is there an algorithm to triangulate or how to calculate if the other GPS point is within the specified radius. Would that be mathematically done in code or is there something out there, like an API, that can achieve this?</p>
<p>Is it a mathematical problem? I&#39;m not sure which approach to take.</p>

										<p><p>I find things close to a user and display the distance to that item using Ti, PHP and mySQL. I figured it all out using this mySQL presentation. I&#39;ve used this calculation for both mySQL and SQL Server. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scribd.com&#x2F;doc&#x2F;2569355&#x2F;Geo-Distance-Search-with-MySQL">geo spatial distance</a><br>but honestly, I&#39;ve recently gone to MongoDB and it does circles around sql with this type of calculation.</p>

										<p><p>Matt&#39;s right, I&#39;d go mongo to do this stuff.</p>

										<p><p>Well, all depends on what you need. Mongo is a nosql db document oriented, mysql is RDB.<br>Depending on your needs you might be able or not to use mongo.</p>
<p>However mongodb has native support for <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.mongodb.org&#x2F;manual&#x2F;reference&#x2F;command&#x2F;geoSearch&#x2F;">geospatial searches</a></p>
<p>Now if I started telling you about mongo, maybe it&#39;s time to have a look at nodejs too :P</p>
