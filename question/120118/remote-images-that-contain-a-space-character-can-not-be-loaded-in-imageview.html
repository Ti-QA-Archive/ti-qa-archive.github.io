			<h1>Remote images that contain a space character can not be loaded in ImageView</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Testing on 1.7.0 RC1, though I suspect this bug may be in other versions as well. </p>
<p>On the iPhone, when trying to load a remote image into an ImageView, if that remote image url contains a space the image will not load and will fail with a warning the image is null. It works fine on Android.</p>
<p>Removing space characters from the remote filename or performing a string replace using the escape code (%20) in Titanium also works. </p>
<p>Suggest that URL escaping should be part of the call to the remote file by default?</p>

							<p>Not really sure what you&#39;re asking for here, since it seems you already found the solution for this (replacing with %20)?</p>
<p>If you&#39;re saying this SHOULD be built in with remote calls such as xhr, imageview sources etc, I guess you have a point there.</p>

							<p>That&#39;s exactly what I meant.  Remote call urls should be.escaped in the framework to ensure consistency in behaviour across different platforms.</p>

							<p>&quot;if that … url contains a space …&quot;</p>
<p>Hmm. You&#39;re forming URLs (URIs) with spaces. I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s allowed by the spec. In that case, I think the library shouldn&#39;t change. </p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc3986">RFC 3986:</a></p>
<p>  <em>For example, consider an information service that provides data,<br>   stored locally using an EBCDIC-based file system, to clients on the<br>   Internet through an HTTP server.  When an author creates a file with<br>   the name &quot;Laguna Beach&quot; on that file system, the &quot;http&quot; URI<br>   corresponding to that resource is expected to contain the meaningful<br>   string &quot;Laguna%20Beach&quot;</em></p>
<p>Now, if the Titanium API, instead of a <em>url</em> parameter, had a <em>filename</em> parameter for the remote resource, then yes, it should escape it.</p>
<p>Consider what would happen if Appcelerator adopted your suggestion: Programmers who <em>did</em> properly form their URLs (or used properly formed URLs from another source like RSS feeds) would get mangled results: the &quot;%&quot; character of &quot;%20&quot; would itself get escaped. Anyone who&#39;s done programming between different web systems has seen this kind of &quot;double escaping&quot; problem.</p>

							<p>Maybe it is, maybe it isn&#39;t, but basically in my example I am retrieving back images that are uploaded from an external website and have no control over the URL&#39;s and the image filenames.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t read RFC 3986 as an indication that spaces in URL&#39;s shouldn&#39;t be allowed, but rather that calls to them should be encoded with %20 instead of the space character. A browser does this by default, I should think that Titanium XHR &#x2F; remote image calls should do the same?</p>
<p>I&#39;m not condoning putting space characters in URL&#39;s either by the way, but I don&#39;t have any control over the end URI in this case and it seems to me that if Android can automatically escape the URI so that it works in Titanium then the same behaviour should be applied to the iPhone and all other platforms?</p>
