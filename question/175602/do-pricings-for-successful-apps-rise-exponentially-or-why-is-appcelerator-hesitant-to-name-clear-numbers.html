			<h1>Do pricings for successful apps rise exponentially, or why Is Appcelerator hesitant to name clear numbers?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I installed Titanium Studio because I like Appcelerator’s approach to apps.</p>
<p>However - when surfing for weeks now I could never find any definite answer as to how pricing goes.<br>My question was asked 2 years ago already here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;136803&#x2F;pricing<br>and all I always see at the end is &quot;If you have any questions around pricing, please email me directly on chead@appcelerator.com”, yet further avoiding to name any numbers.<br>The worst is the “plans and pricing” page, which tells me actually no price whatsoever !</p>
<p> This leaves me under the impression that Appcelerator draws developers into their world to make them dependent on their elaborate cloud-service so that they can charge horrendous sums of money once the app becomes successful. I already saw that happening in a threat about support only.<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;135661&#x2F;plans–pricing</p>
<p>I am aware and read long discussions that the philosophy seems to be if some app gets successful it should pay - and yes, I understand and aprecciate it - yet a definite clarification </p>
<ul>
<li>with concrete numbers from Appcelerator - not just nice talks or an invite to mail Coreen -<br>would be greatly appreciated so that a developer like me knows what will get into in the future.</li>
</ul>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>There is NO philosophy  that says if an app becomes successful then you should pay for anything.</p>
<p>In short; for users of Titanium Studio (free branch) - you are NOT charged to create apps, you are not charged to put apps in the store, you are not charged at some point in the future because your app became successful. So in answer to this part of your question &quot;..why Is Appcelerator hesitant to name clear numbers?&quot; - they are not hesitant - there is no number - gain 10 billion downloads and they will pat you on the back not take from your wallet.  They will however want to see if you would like more publicity as you would be a massive success story.</p>
<p>I have answered this question so many times it is easier just to link to it yet again;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;162147&#x2F;what-is-the-pricing-agreemeant-for-appcelerator">What is the pricing agreement for appcelerator?</a> (not my spelling)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is designed to be as perfectly clear as it could be so you are not left with any unanswered questions.  Now you might be thinking &quot;who is the is this guy &#39;Malcolm&#39; and why should I believe him?&quot; - makes sense.  I am NOT an Appcelerator employee but I am one of the earliest adopters and highest Q&amp;A expert, so you know you can trust what I have said;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;top-100-experts">Q&amp;A Top 100 Experts</a></li>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;500k&#x2F;">To all 500,000 Appcelerator developers: Thanks a million</a> (see if you can spot the oracle)</li>
</ul>
<p>I have been with this platform for so </p>
<p>You are reading two year old questions - with two year old answers.  Aim for something newer. I can only assume Coreen has left.</p>
<p>You appear to be in an aggressive mood towards a platform you have yet to use, I hope I am reading that incorrectly.  You are concerned that Appcelerator is somehow the pied piper of developers, I can only assume based on this old information that is outdated, was not clear at the time and had an email address that appears to no longer work.  Lets be honest, it is never smart to leave an email address in a comment - spammer love that stuff.</p>
<p>If you have more questions please ask.  But if you were angry when you asked the question - I can only hope this has cleared things up.</p>

										<p><p>Just to add to Malcolm&#39;s excellent answer, we provide no specific prices because what we do charge for is very tailored to the specific customer. Our business model is based on selling services to Enterprise customers (Fortune 500) who need specific levels of support, CLAs, Enterprise-grade backend solutions, consulting, etc. None of that is off-the-shelf stuff for which we can list a stock price. </p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s an upper limit to the cloud resources you can use before we ask for money. (I&#39;m not on the Sales side of the house.) Reasonably, if your app is so successful to be using gobs of resources, you really should have a sound business model that supports paying for that service. </p>
<p>I don&#39;t recall that chead@ address ever being a valid address, but maybe it was.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks to the both of you. You did help a lot in calming my worries,<br>only the cloud service still worries me for 3 reasons:<br>1 If I exceed the free limits I have no idea how huge the cost for additional units cost. For Webhosting you have clear lists of how much additional GB etc cost. Is that not possible for API Calls?</p>

<li>Would I depend on the Appcelerator cloud service or could I change it later to some own system?<br>3 is the Data in the Cloudhttp:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;175602&#x2F;do-pricings-for-successful-apps-rise-exponentially-or-why-is-appcelerator-hesitant-to-name-clear-numbers# Service handled with confidentiality so that I can promise my users that it is safe?</li>

							<p>Btw: Don&#39;t bother to mail chead@appcelerator.com, because that address couldn&#39;t be found anymore or is invalid. Likely it got spammed having been put up on the website itself.</p>

										<p><p>Quick tip; next time - please do not create a new answer when your contribution is actually a comment - it confuses things in the future when trying to work out relevance, simply add a comment to the answer it is related to, or if the additional information is a follow up to the question or general information then add it as a comment to your own question at the top.  You are NOT being told off.</p>

										<p><p>This comment is for Malcolm Hollingsworth:<br>1.)<br>First of all thank you very much for your elaborate and fast answers the both of you,<br>and before I get into detail about the question itself I want to answer here only the personal issues (so that this &quot;answer&quot; of mine serves at least the purpose of separating the technical issues from the formalities).<br>2.)<br>I did not know that you did answer already, because I assumed that I would get a mail if someone responded, which is why I just visit this question 2 days later.<br>Good point you educated me in not answering my own questions. Plus I did not know the structure properly yet, because I come totally new here. Next time I will know and comment on my own question.<br>3.)<br>It is nice that you tell me that I was not told of and I appreciate it - yet someone did tell me of by downvoting my answer which was in a way only meant to protect readers from the frustration of mailing to an obsolete mailadress. This is no problem, I just let people know not to down vote to harshly.<br>4.)<br>Important to me is that you do understand that I was not in an aggressive mood- yes I was frustrated because it takes very long until I post a question for exactly that reason you stated above - that you answered this question so often already. I really read through a lot of pages and searched also externally for answers to my questions but was weary as to the costs of the cloud servers once many customers would come. Just to explain to you the reverse case: The first impression I got from your answer was the capital &quot;NOT&quot; which gave of a slightly aggressive impression - however I instantly learned about your supportive effort and changed my mind. I just tell you this to demonstrate that letters without faces are reduced to plain facts which can be misunderstood. So vice versa: I actually admire Appcelerator and am totally keen on it because it looks really well setup. This is why I ask now because once I dedicate myself to a project I will be totally committed to the Appcelerator Platform for a long time.<br>5.)<br>Just to explain to you my personal worries: I want to develop one app for longtime usage including contacts and statistics - not many apps - so all depends on that app. And if I would later find out that the amount of cloud server requests exceed the free limit I don&#39;t know if the follow up costs are huge because I now depend on the appcelerator cloud servers or if they are reasonable. However - I will read your answer later again thoroughly and your other answers you and Nick linked  to as well before troubling you again. </p>
<p>Finally I am glad that people like you are out there providing such a tremendous support and will get back to you soon and of course vote your answer after having read and understood your informations clearly.</p>

										<p><p>You are welcome.  BTW you did just comment on your own accidentally placed previous comment (as an answer) rather than one of the two answers or the the question.  Do not worry it will get easier.  I try to keep some organisation here so it is easier for everyone going forwards - ideally making it easier to find answers.</p>
<p>The reason for the NO and the NOT is to emphasis the important response elements to your main points - no and not do not stand out helping you to focus.</p>
<p>As you say a lot here and a lot if the previous answer I gave that you can read through.  Hopefully all very clear though.</p>
