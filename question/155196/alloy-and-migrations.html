			<h1>Alloy and Migrations</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>In the progress of updating an app we have the following situation: </p>
<ul>
<li>We have a lot of old rows in the original database that will not be necessary anymore</li>
<li>We have to add a lot of rows</li>
</ul>
<p>To save time and space we would like to ship the new version without the old rows on the database and the migration would take care to insert the new rows only if the user has already installed the app</p>
<p>Is this possible with alloy migration tool? I&#39;ve read the documentation but the process that the migrations get executed its not quite clear.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

							<div><p>Just to clarify: the new version would come with the new database finished (new rows inserted and old rows removed) and the migrations would not have to execute. The migration would only add the new rows on the databases of already installed apps</p>

							<p>Migrations should support the situation you describe, provided the model file includes the code to install your custom database and that database includes the structure and rows you want for new installations. For those upgrading, the migration would modify the existing database. You should be able to use a custom migration to accomplish your goal for that:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">migration.up = function(migrator) {
   <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">db</span> = migrator.<span class="hljs-keyword">db</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// the database connection object</span>
   <span class="hljs-keyword">db</span>.execute('BEGIN TRANSACTION);
   <span class="hljs-keyword">db</span>.execute('DELETE FROM &lt;tablename&gt;'); <span class="hljs-comment">// assuming you want this??</span>
   <span class="hljs-keyword">db</span>.execute('INSERT INTO &lt;tablename&gt; ...'); <span class="hljs-comment">// repeat your sql inserts as necessary</span>
   <span class="hljs-keyword">db</span>.execute('COMMIT);
};

migration.down = function(migrator) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">// you could delete the new records and restore the old ones</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// here if you want to support users down-grading</span>
}
</code></pre>

										<p><p>Hi Tim, thanks for the answer. The problem is I dont want the migrations to execute if the user is doing a fresh install, the database should ship already at the lastest version to save time.</p>

										<p><p>The migration won&#39;t run with a new install, only for upgrades. Hence the need to supply a database with the structure and data to be installed via the model as Tim describes.</p>

							<p>Hi David, </p>
<p>The native of migrations is to tell the app what to do in each version. Hence, the very first version of your app should contain a migration file with the original rows.<br>then version 2 migration file have new rows, and delete the old rows, etc…</p>
<p>The idea is that if user A downloads the app from version 2, he will still need to go through all the migration files, thereby ensuring that the old rows are deleted and new rows are added. </p>
<p>That said, if your app has a very simple database structure, you could wipe the database on the migration file and just add new rows. That really depends on your app structure. </p>

										<p><p>Hi Mads, thanks for the answer. The problem is, imagine months from now that we had added a lot more modifications to the database, the user doing a fresh install will have to go through all the migration files even inserting things that would not be necessary anymore just to be delete in further migrations. This makes no sense, IMO the migration files should be intended to be used only to upgrade the database from A to B and the fresh install comes with the database ready to use. Isn&#39;t this possible by setting the config.adapter.migration field on the new version to one datetime after the last migration date prefix?</p>

										<p><p>Yes, that is possible.<br>If you take the default adapter and copy it to <em>&#x2F;lib&#x2F;Alloy&#x2F;sync</em> folder, then you are able to override the way migration works.</p>

							<p>Solution was to create and deploy the database with the table alloy use to control the migrations:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">CREATE</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">TABLE</span> migrations (latest <span class="hljs-built_in">TEXT</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">model</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">TEXT</span>);</span>
<span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">INSERT</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">INTO</span> <span class="hljs-string">"migrations"</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">VALUES</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'timestamp'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'table_name'</span>);</span>
</code></pre><p>So it wont execute the migration if this line exists</p>
