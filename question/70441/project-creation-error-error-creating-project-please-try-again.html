			<h1>Project creation error: Error creating project. Please try again.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Clearly this is a major problem as tonnes of people are having the same issue (perhaps a clue to the administrators?)</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#39;m running Titanium Dev on my Mac and I&#39;m getting this incredibly helpful message whenever I try to create a new project.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve read the other threads that deal with the same problem and tried all their suggestions, but to no avail.</p>
<p>I&#39;m getting pretty sick of this saga- I don&#39;t even want to develop for Android damn it! I&#39;m developing for iPhone.<br>I&#39;ve got every single Android API installed, all their samples, Google API etc. but nothing changes.</p>
<p>Any help would be massively appreciated. Ahhhh!</p>

							<div><p>I deleted and re-installed Titanium and the Android SDK (and additional tools per the instructions). I found that I could still not create new projects. However, I was lucky to have some projects working from previous versions of Titanium. I ran a existing project in the iPhone Simulator and the Android emulator. When I tried to create a new project, it worked. My guess is that there is some kind of path issue (even though I told Titanium where to look for the Android SDK, I think it was still using an old path).</p>

										<p><p>Yes- the prompt did come up and I thought I had the SDK installed properly so I clicked that I did want to develop for Android. Since then, the alert has never come up again so I can&#39;t choose not to develop with it, hence my problem.</p>

										<p><p>Buddy go to the profile tab on titanium developer and delete the path for android sdk.Close and reopen the developer and try creating a new project… it should prompt for the android sdk path…</p>
<p>and i installed the android sdk to check for the problem that you had but it works as a cake for me…</p>

							<p>I just had this problem. This was the solution for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>ensure that the user running TiDev has permission to access the Titanium SDK (group has r-x for directories and r– for files, and the user is a member of that group). In my case, my continuous builds folders in &#x2F;opt&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;linux (named after the version number of the build) only had root access</li>
<li>ensure that the same permissions as above are set on the android sdk, which for me is &#x2F;opt&#x2F;android-sdk-linux_86, although I have a symlink called &#x2F;opt&#x2F;android-sdk that points to it, and I use this in android tools and the TiDev profile.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that I don&#39;t believe that the user needs write permissions to the TiDev install folder (in my case &#x2F;opt&#x2F;Titanium Developer-1.2.1) although it must do when there is a new version of the software or official Titanium SDK and it updates. In these cases, I just run TiDev as root to perform the update.</p>

										<p><p>The issue I had next was on the &quot;Test &amp; Package&quot; screen where the bottom text fields (SDK and Screen) constantly had a &quot;loading…&quot; message. I worked out that it was caused by the files in android&#39;s tools directory not having execute permissions. Hence, on my system they are located in:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-regexp">/opt/</span>android-sdk<span class="hljs-regexp">/tools/</span>
</code></pre><p>and changing to that directory and running:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">chmod <span class="hljs-number">755</span> *
</code></pre><p>resolved it, giving the user running TiDev execute permissions on those files.</p>

							<p>Ah, RTFM moment for me. The SDK Readme that comes with the Android SDK Starter Package clearly states:</p>
<p>&quot;The Android SDK archive now only contains the tools. It no longer comes<br>populated with a specific Android platform or Google add-on. Instead you<br>use the SDK Manager to install or update SDK components such as platforms,<br>tools, add-ons, and documentation.&quot;</p>
<p>So, I had to run the SDK Manager (tools&#x2F;android) and install the necessary platforms and Google APIs.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure how&#x2F;why Titanium passes the SDK check for Android without any platforms installed.</p>
