			<h1>Way to Force Migrations</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,<br>In the current Alloy framework, Migrations seems to be the common source from where data are being managed. Addition of any models or changes to models manually does not prompt Kroll to update the same to the Migrations. Is there any way to force migrations?</p>
<p>The only workaround currently seems to be go back and create stuff from command line which fixes stuff but it would be nice to have it as an inbuilt function.</p>
<p>Thanks &amp; Regards,<br>Sid</p>

							<div><p>I create models a,b,c to start with from command line and generate controllers. due to changes in architecture,I want to now break model b in to sub-models b1,b2,b3 with their respective controller, xml files etc. The only way to do it right now is delete &#39;b&#39; and create new models from command line: b1,b2,b3. If I create these by replicating it in the studio, the migrations do not get generated. The changes required to migrations files to match the models is an additional overhead. I was hoping Migrations would be auto-generated for respective models irrespective of whether they are generated from command line - also if there are any changes to the existing models it should get reflected to the models completely rather than picking a few fields from the model. This causes the relationship between migrations &amp; models to break and these discrepancies can get a little frustrating with bigger &amp; scalable applications.</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;m still not sure I understand completely what you are hoping for here. If you created model &quot;b&quot;, then wanted to break it into 3 submodel &quot;b1&quot;, &quot;b2&quot;, and &quot;b3&quot;, how would expect to do this other than replacing model &quot;b&quot; with new submodels? Are you just saying that migrations aren&#39;t aut-created when you create models in TiStudio? </p>
<p>I also don&#39;t know what you mean by this: &quot;if there are any changes to the existing models it should get reflected to the models completely rather than picking a few fields from the model&quot;</p>

							<div><p>Hi Tony,<br>Migrations are not auto-created if not from command-line, is that understanding correct?<br>Migrations even though created from command-line may capture data from models.attrs partially  some times, is that understanding correct?<br>If I want to extend the current model b, add b1 &amp; b2 which are logically separate to other models but related to model b, it would be possible to relate them through a Foreign Key,Composite key, is that understanding correct?<br>Thanks a ton,<br>Sid</p>

							<p>There&#39;s no builtin relational connection between models in Alloy &#x2F; Backbone. There&#39;s an external project that attempts to bring that to models in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PaulUithol&#x2F;Backbone-relational">backbone-relational</a>, but this isn&#39;t something built in to Alloy.</p>
<p>In short, though, the migrations provide a standard way to move data in a model from one state to another elegantly in your app. Alloy is never going to try and be too smart and do too much automatically with them as there are millions of possible use cases. You have the freedom to use and Javascript and Titanium APIs in the migrations, so you are able to achieve anything you ned for your own custom solution.</p>
