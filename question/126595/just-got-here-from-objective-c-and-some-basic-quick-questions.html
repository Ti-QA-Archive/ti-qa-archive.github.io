		<section>
			<p>Hi. I&#39;m a newbie here that came frustrated from Objective-C. I&#39;m still within my frustration and so far Titanium looks ABSOLUTELY promising. I tried to start a test project in Objective-C &#x2F; XCode and it just frustrated me to death how difficult it is to do a simple thing. :P I&#39;m not new to HTML and JavaScript or CSS for that matter and I just want to ask a few quick questions below.</p>
<p>1) I have read on these Q&amp;A answers something about referencing to Ti.something but when I try it, the auto-suggest doesn&#39;t seem to show me any of the API content. Do I need to initialize it first? If so, how do I go about doing that?</p>
<p>2) I&#39;m a bit annoyed that when I hover my cursor over the text, it turns to an &quot;I&quot; sign. Pretty much like how it does when I&#39;m viewing a webpage. Since I&#39;m developing a desktop application, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d want that behavior on non-editable text. Is there a setting anywhere to handle this? Or do I have to use JavaScript or CSS to deal with it?</p>
<p>I&#39;m here mainly to develop desktop applications and not mobile ones (at least for the time being). Thank you and more power!</p>

							<div><p>Shedo,</p>
<p>There is no Ti alias for Desktop, so use the Titanium prefix for anything on desktop, unless you alias Ti yourself in your javascript.</p>
<p>There is probably a way to remove the cursor but might present other problems. I&#39;d need to look at that, I&#39;m honestly not sure.</p>

							<div><p>I did but apparently I can&#39;t seem to find any way to initialize the API. I&#39;m just searching for a way to incorporate the API into my app. I don&#39;t tink it&#39;s documented anywhere or at least I keep missing where it is located.</p>
<p>For example, just tell me how to make it so that code hinting shows the API. What code do I put to do that?</p>
<p>I really can&#39;t elaborate much because what I want to do is fairly simple and that is, what I stated above. :(</p>

							<p>Have you looked at the kitchen-sink demo to get an idea how to create basic UI stuff?  I found looking at the wiki it helps get going. http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;dashboard.action</p>

										<p><p>Shedo,</p>
<p>Yeah, the desktop Kitchen Sink is lacking almost all the functionality of the mobile app, and pretty much just has text stubs include, so it really doesn&#39;t do much.</p>
