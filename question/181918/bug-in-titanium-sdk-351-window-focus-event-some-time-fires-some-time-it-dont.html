			<h1>Bug in Titanium SDK 3.5.1: Window focus event some time fires some time it don&#39;t</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>My application was working perfectly fine with titanium SDK version 3.4.0. But when I update the Titanium SDK version to 3.5.1 (for 64 bit architecture support in iOS) it started giving lot of trouble.</p>
<p>In iOS I am using navigation object for opening and closing windows. But some times window focus event triggers and some time it doesn&#39;t fire. I use to refresh my window data on the windows focus event.</p>
<p>This problem is very annoying, due to this bug my application started giving lot of bugs.</p>
<p>Did anybody else also faced this type of problem, if then whats solutions to this.</p>
<p>Waiting for the reply form the appcelerator team too.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance !</p>
<p>Regards,<br>Moiz</p>
