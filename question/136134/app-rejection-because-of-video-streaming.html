			<h1>App rejection because of video streaming</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>This is what Apple said:</p>
<p>Reasons for Rejection:<br>•       9.4: Video streaming content over a cellular network longer than 10 minutes must use HTTP Live and include a baseline 64 kbps audio-only HTTP Live stream<br>Apr 25, 2012 10:06 AM. From Apple.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure our stream is ok, since it&#39;s been validated with Apple mediastreamvalidator. It&#39;s also used on another native app, and it&#39;s been accepted.</p>
<p>So my fear is that Titanium is not switching correctly between streams, and i haven&#39;t found any method or property in Ti.Media.Videoplayer to explicitly deal with this.</p>

							<p>As far as i understood your problem,<br>if you are on cellular network then no download should take more than 10 minutes. the  download limit on cellular network  is 20Mb(not sure) by apple.<br>It is actually done to reduce the network load.</p>
<p>so if you are downloading anything in your app which is more than 20 mb of data or would take more than 10 min, then make sure that your app  is connected to wifi(you can apply that logic to your application). Then Apple wont be having any problem with you app.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your feedback, but i don&#39;t think it&#39;s the center of the problem.<br>I&#39;m playing a live stream (in fact it&#39;s a web tv, so the stream is continuous), so the data downloaded will always exceed 20Mb if played for long enough.</p>

							<p>So respond back to Apple saying exactly what you said here:  That you have a validated stream.  That the stream is in use in another app and there was no problem.  It IS possible that the Apple guy made a mistake.</p>
