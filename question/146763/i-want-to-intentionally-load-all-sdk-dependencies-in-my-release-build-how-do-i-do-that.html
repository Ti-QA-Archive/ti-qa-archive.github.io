			<h1>I want to intentionally load all SDK dependencies in my release build. How do I do that?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>So my app does some dynamic-ish things with loading UI. It works fine in the simulator, but in the release, it crashes due to &quot;invalid method passed&quot; errors. I know what I&#39;m doing (realize it&#39;s bloated, yada, yada), and I want to intentionally load the entire SDK into the release version of my app. </p>
<p>I do not want Titanium to create a &quot;symbol dependency matrix that maps to the underlying Titanium library symbols to understand which APIs (and related dependencies, frameworks, etc) specifically your app needs.&quot; </p>
<p>How do I ensure that the entire SDK is built into the release binary without any trimming or optimization?</p>
<p>Thanks a bunch!</p>

							<p>You dont mention your platform, but if this was on iOS then you may well fall foul of the Apple requirement to only link in SDK API&#39;s that are actually called so unless your App consumed <em>every</em> API function it would not get into the App Store</p>

										<p><p>Hmm… Thanks. Yes, iOS. I know of some tricks to sort of make &quot;dummy&quot; calls to force the calls into the build, such as tzmartin&#39;s http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;44d84Zfj. I was hoping for a more comprehensive solution though. How does Apple verify whether the SDK is used and to what granularity? It can&#39;t be to the method-level, right? For example user input might determine whether some methods or SDK&#39;s are called… </p>
<p>Well, let&#39;s pretend my application does use the entire SDK, but every method call is dynamic. Is there a way to force everything into the build, just for the sake of interest?</p>

										<p><p>Well, you will need your Python hat on to mess with the iPhone specific build scripts. Look in the sdk &#x2F;iPhone folder . From memory I think its called compiler.py (this may have changed in v3.0.0.GA because of the move to node.js tooling).</p>
