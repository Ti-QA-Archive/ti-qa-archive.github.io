			<h1>Will MBA 2011 work fine with Ti Studio?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am developing iOS apps on my current Macbook pro 2009 and it works great with the simple Titanium developer but the Titanium studio is super slow.</p>
<p>I am now looking into buying a new MacBook Air 11&quot; (i5). Will the Air work fast with the Ti Studio (and Photoshop) or do I need to buy another Macbook pro?</p>
<p>Thankful for all input!</p>

							<p>studio is based on the eclipse ide which is java based. This is a reasonably resource heavy ide.</p>
<p>Saying that it works very well on my new mac book pro but I put 8gb ram in it. It might be cheaper to add more ram to your MacBook. Although air does have a solid state hard drive. Which will run it ok.</p>
<p>Basically before you make your decision look at the requirements and recommendations for the eclipse IDE which should have at least 4gb ram and a nice fast hard drive.</p>
<p>hope this help.</p>

							<p>I have the previous generation 13&quot; MBA with 2GB of RAM. Ti Studio works well enough for me with some occasional light Photoshop editing. The SSD makes a lot of difference.</p>
<p>The only reason I chose the 13&quot; over the 11&quot; was the screen size.</p>

							<p>I build Ti apps on my  2.13 GHz 2gb 128gb mid 2009 MBA and it works fine. I think it works faster than my last model mac mini with the same amount of RAM because of the SSD.</p>
<p>In other words, you&#39;re going to be fine on the new MBA.</p>
