							<div><p>@Nick That&#39;s not entirely true. I asked the same question over a year ago and got no response. IMO, nothing&#39;s changed. But, it&#39;s about the only forum available. So, I use it despite my frustrations with it.</p>

							<div><p>@Michael I only speak personally, it had been just about bearable until then (for me) but <em>has</em> shown a distinct downturn more recently. I try to mitigate it by using google &#39;site:&#39; syntax for searching the forum instead of using it directly as well</p>

							<div><p>Thanks for the replies, at least it&#39;s not just me. What are they waiting for ? They probably do not use the forums themselves. Sucks because this forum is the only source of examples and common help. Fixing the speed issues would encourage others to submit more answers imo.</p>

							<p>You think it is slow? LOL. Try loading the docs pages from an iPad. It won&#39;t even load. They are using ExtJs for the docs. Anyway, at least if it was slow, that would have been okay. It&#39;s not functional sometimes.</p>
<p>Using the Builtwith browser extension, you can see that they are using 3 different tools for collecting analytics: Marketo, Quantcast and Google Analytics. At need we know what&#39;s keeping the pages busy.</p>
