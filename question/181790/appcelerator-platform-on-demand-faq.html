			<h1>Appcelerator Platform On-Demand FAQ</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p><em>This FAQ refers to <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;appcelerator-platform-is-coming-to-you&#x2F;">this</a> announcement</em></p>
<p><strong>Who qualifies for the offer of a free Indie seat on the Platform?</strong></p>
<p>Anyone who downloaded Titanium on or before March 31, 2015.</p>
<p><strong>How do I claim my free Indie seat?</strong></p>
<p>You can sign up to claim your seat via the new website launching on April 2nd. After signing up through the new website, you’ll receive an activation link for the Platform. (Since we’ll be running the latest Platform release in public beta for a number of weeks, you’ll initially be put on a waitlist for access; we’ll move people from the waitlist to active on a steady basis.) </p>
<p>Once your activation link arrives, you’ll have full access to the Platform in its “developer trial” mode, which lets new users take advantage of most of the Platform’s capabilities before making a purchase decision. You’ll notice that when you go to the Platform’s billing page, the Indie plan will be marked “Free” – only for Titanium community members, of course!</p>
<p><strong>Is the offer to a free Indie seat open only for a certain time?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. While the free Indie seat license is good forever, those interested must sign up to claim their seat by June 1, 2015. Don’t worry – we’ll remind you!</p>
<p><strong>What does this mean for Titanium?</strong></p>
<p>The open source project will continue in GitHub as it always has. The Titanium SDK will continue to be available here and licensed under the Apache Public License. The open source project will continue to provide the Titanium CLI for working with the open source Titanium SDK. </p>
<p>Going forward, certified releases of the SDK and Studio will be available only to Appcelerator Platform users – which of course will include anyone who was a member of our Titanium community as of March 31, 2015. If you want to use the open source Titanium SDK, you will need to build your own version of the SDK from GitHub.</p>
<p><strong>Can I continue using the open source version of Titanium with my existing apps?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>What happens to Titanium Studio, ACS, Node.ACS and analytics?</strong></p>
<p>On June 1st, 2015, Titanium Studio will be discontinued in favor of Appcelerator Studio, which offers more advanced capabilities. For our Titanium community, this means more for free.</p>
<p>Your existing ACS and Node.ACS applications will continue to run as part of the Platform. The current ACS website (cloud.appcelerator.com) will be discontinued in favor of the Platform’s integrated dashboard.</p>
<p>The current analytics site (my.appcelerator.com) will be discontinued in favor of the Platform’s integrated dashboard. You will need to migrate any analytics data to the new dashboard site prior to June 1, 2015. </p>
<p><strong>How do I move my existing app(s) onto the Platform?</strong></p>
<p>Just import your Titanium app(s) into Appcelerator Studio and click Enable Platform Services. This will make the power of the Platform available to your app.</p>
<p><strong>I’m happy with Titanium. Why would I move to the Appcelerator Platform?</strong></p>
<p>Put simply, because you’ll get more for the same price – that is, free! Richer analytics capabilities including an integrated dashboard, 2x the cloud API usage allotments, ongoing certified releases, as well as all the advanced capabilities of Appcelerator Studio. </p>
<p><strong>What will people not already in the Titanium community pay for the Appcelerator Platform?</strong></p>
<p>Prices will start at $39&#x2F;month for the Indie plan. We will also offer Team and Enterprise plans with additional capabilities and options for premium support.</p>

							<div><p>@Ricardo, that&#39;s naughty… if a 3rd party starts building and hosting their own builds without any equivalence to Appcelerator&#39;s official builds it may fracture the community into 2. Which I believe it&#39;s bad for everyone, including Appcelerator.</p>

							<p>Aren&#39;t you afraid that imposing a price ($39&#x2F;month) to access Titanium official builds will result in a decline in popularity and consequently to a smaller community of Titanium&#x2F;Appcelerator users?</p>

										<p><p>@Michael, I know the github project will remain, my question was about the builds. Is the expectation that free users will do their own builds of Titanium SDK? If that&#39;s the case you are raising the bar to access Titanium. Not only that, I can already imagine what will happen when a free user reports a bug: the answer will likely be &quot;sorry but you are not using an official build…&quot;.</p>

										<p><p>In short: enterprise plans benefit from everything described in the announcement, as well as additional capabilities (such as crash detection) and powerful new capabilities that will be announced on April 2nd, custom usage limits (e.g. for API calls and analytic events), higher storage limits, premium support, flexible deployment options and more. (The plans and their capabilities will be available on the new website launch April 2nd.)</p>

										<p><p>Can any one let me know If the last date to claim indie seat is Jun1st or Jun 30 ?</p>
<p>What will happen if I am not migrating? Some old applications that are using ACS push notification ,<br>does it continue as same as now? Or do we need to migrate all previous apps using community version of push notification?</p>

										<p><p>The deadline is June 30th 2015.  I suggest you go ahead and claim it.  As far as ACS goes, as you can see <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;arrowdb&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;PushNotifications">here</a>, the code remains essentially the same.</p>
<p>Also for those falling in this thread, the please post questions on the New Q&amp;A at http:&#x2F;&#x2F;community.appcelerator.com.</p>

										<p><p>I should also mention that the deadline is for claiming your free seat, and NOT for migrating.  You&#39;ll still have time to migrate everything.</p>

										<p><p>Specifically, it&#39;s being blocked by the Disconnect plugin in Chrome. Developers, ALWAYS CODE A FALLBACK when using third party services. You can&#39;t rely on third parties like Marketo always working.</p>
