							<p>Yes.  I use a customized version of Wordpress MU.  With it, you can easily create an api that efficiently taps into the core and performs CRUD tasks via XML-RPC or restful.  </p>
<p>In some situations, I map various calls directly through mod_rewrite to an existing WP plugin, bypassing the stack altogether.  This allows for highly optimized routines while still having the resources available from WP.</p>

										<p><p>Terry,<br>I am trying to use an install of WPMU I have as the backend base CMS that use could update and would then dynamically feed into the the Titanium iPhone app. Would also like the ability to have users post comments in the iPhone app and have them pushed and moderated frmo WPMU.</p>
<p>Have you (or could you :-) ) post some specific codes snippets &#x2F; examples of the specific WPMU XML-RPC &#x2F; Restful code where&#x2F;how in WPMU and how it was pulled into Titanium and displayed. </p>
<p>I would really love to get this app going using WPMU in the back-end but I am not seeing how to do it.</p>
<p>THanks in advance,<br>Sway</p>

										<p><p>I am interested in a very similar solution. I have a wordpress site working as a photo sharing site. The goal for the app would be to create a post that has an image attachement from the device (gallery or camera). There should be a login screen as well. Think something like this is possible with titanium?</p>
