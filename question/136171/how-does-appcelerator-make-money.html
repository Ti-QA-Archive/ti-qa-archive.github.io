			<p>I love titanium! It is a great platform that offers a lot of functionality, it has a great community and the learning curve is better than I would have imagined. Though I have one question: How does it make money? Because making money is the certification it will stay with us forever!</p>

							<p>Now I&#39;m not associated with Ti &#x2F; AppC in anyway. So I don&#39;t know their exact revenue sources, etc.</p>
<p>But from looking around the site, articles, etc these are &#x2F; probably are some of their revenue sources…</p>
<ul>
<li>Investors</li>
<li>Classes</li>
<li>Marketplace</li>
<li>Their help services (they don&#39;t have pricing but I&#39;d say it&#39;s safe to assume that any company working with Ti somewhat regularly would probably purchase a package, and since it&#39;s not exactly public, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not the cheapest).</li>
</ul>
<p>As far as how much revenue they&#39;re bringing in? Who knows…but they&#39;ve been around 4 years and it&#39;s only gotten better and grown into what it is now. A lot of the industry (at least those who are regularly on blogs, etc) knows about Ti and it&#39;s a great tool…so I doubt it will be going away anytime soon. A merge with a company? Maybe, but that&#39;d (hopefully) only bring more good stuff and less bad lol.</p>

							<p>If you start using Appcelerator for a while and begin to see any kind of success in the app store, you will probably sign up for a support plan. I see that they&#39;ve changed their support options as of the 2.0 update. The &#39;indie&#39; option used to be priced at $49 per month. I&#39;ve inquired to see what the pricing is now. It seems to be dependent upon how big of an operation you are running.</p>
