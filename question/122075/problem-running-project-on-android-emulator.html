			<h1>Problem Running Project on Android Emulator</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>In need of a little assistance with Titanium Studio 1.0.1.</p>
<p>I&#39;m attempting to create and run a simple Titanium Mobile Project on the Android Emulator.  The project that I am trying to run is the generated project when selecting &quot;New -&gt; Project -&gt; Titanium Mobile Project&quot; with &quot;Android&quot; set as the deployment target.  I am currently able to start the Android emulator with out problem by highlighting the project and selecting &quot;Run -&gt; Android Emulator&quot; however, the emulator does not display the application that I am attempting to run.  I&#39;m sure that I&#39;ve missed something basic but have no idea what.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s my current configuration:</p>
<p>Titanium SDK 1.7.1<br>Default Android SDK: Google APIs Android 3.1<br>I&#39;ve also attmepted using: Android SDK 2.1 and 2.2</p>
<p>Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>

										<p><p>In order for me to help you with this, qlease follow the instructions at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Installing+on+Windows+7#InstallingonWindows7-InstallDiagnosticsforWindows">Install Diagnostics for Windows</a>. Copy the output and paste it to your preferred <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;">pastebin</a> service, and paste the link to it here. It&#39;s important that you do not modify it <strong>in any way</strong>, as this could mask problems with your configuration. Do <strong>NOT</strong> paste the actual code here! This is because the system will change the formatting.</p>
<p>Also, please create and share a screenshot of your android installed packages, using something like <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;imageshack.us&#x2F;">ImageShack</a></p>
<p>State the processor and RAM installed to your system.</p>
<p>Lastly, run the command <code>systeminfo</code> at the commandline and share it in a pastebin.</p>
<p>Then I will help you further.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Paul, I&#39;ve found the problem.  It turns out that Titanium Studio MUST have the path to &lt;JDK_Home&gt;\bin specified in the environment PATH variable.  Without it, the javac command is not found and the build of the project fails.  I noticed this by looking through the various consoles that are created when attempting to run the project.</p>
<p>Question for you… I&#39;ve not had to add &lt;JDK_Home&gt;\bin path to my environment PATH in the past when working in the Eclipse IDE.  Is there a particular reason why this would be the case with Titanium Studio?</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s OK, Ken. I am glad you could interpret what was required from the Diagnostics script. Well done for getting it working, without any further help from me, although I am sorry that I have only been able to respond until this late stage.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
