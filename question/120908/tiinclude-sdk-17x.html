			<h1>Ti.include SDK 1.7.x</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Did something change on the include function?</p>
<p>With SDK 1.6.2 I could successfully include a file xyz.js located in Resources&#x2F;android and Resource&#x2F;iphone by the following statement:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-type">Ti</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">include</span>(<span class="hljs-symbol">'xyz</span>.js');
</code></pre><p>Then, based on the used OS it was including either the file from Resources&#x2F;android or Resources&#x2F;iphone</p>
<p>Since SDK 1.7.x this does not work anymore for me. It says &quot;File does not exists&quot;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

										<p><p>Hmm, no, sorry. It does not work for me. I even created a brand new project for testing this. Basically the absolute path seems to work for iOS now, but not for the folder iphone. Every file within this folder can not be found. The console says:</p>

										<p><p>did you look at the link I posted above? Also we need a more thorough example. Are you calling include from an included file? are you calling it from the Resources directory? Get the idea??</p>

										<p><p>Ok, it is pretty simple to reconstuct. Create a new mobile project (the standard on, with the two tabs). I just added two files:</p>
<ol>
<li>Resources&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;xyz.js</li>
<li>Resources&#x2F;android&#x2F;xyz.js</li>
</ol>
<p>Both of these have the same content:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-type">Ti</span>.<span class="hljs-type">API</span>.info(<span class="hljs-symbol">'Hello</span> from xyz');
</code></pre><p>In app.js I added a single line at the top:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Ti.<span class="hljs-keyword">include</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'/xyz.js'</span>);
</code></pre><p>That&#39;s it.<br>On Android it prints the text to the console.<br>On iPhone it displays the error, mentioned before.</p>

										<p><p>you see that is a completely different question because the &quot;iphone&quot; and &quot;android&quot; folders are special folders in the whole scheme of things; I doubt anyone was testing you question that way!</p>

										<p><p>But have a look at my first post. I wrote about the two folders and the scenario. But maybe I did not make it clear enough, sorry for that and by the way, thanks for your help so far.</p>
