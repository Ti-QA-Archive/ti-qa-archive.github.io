			<h1>android:back conundrum. How to do scene management?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>The back button on the android device is device control. As a developer I would like to know when this button is pressed regardless of what my application is doing or how it&#39;s built. If a user presses this button from anywhere in my app I want to know about it and react accordingly using one piece of code. Does titanium provide a way to do this?</p>
<p>So far All I&#39;ve found is that you need to add a listener for the android:back event on a heavyweight window. I immediately see a huge problem with this because I&#39;ve been told to create my app with a single execution context. But okay if that&#39;s the way it works then I want to have one main root window that is heavyweight in order to deal with this button being pressed. So the first thing I do is create one of these and display it. Any window I create after this that is NOT heavyweight is NOT displayed… it seems the heavyweight window always stays on the top.</p>
<p>So that rules out having a root window….<br>heavyweight windows stay on top and are the only way to catch an android:back event<br>lightweight windows always exit the app when you press back and do not receive an android:back event ever.<br>What&#39;s the way to work android:back into any scene management system when any windows you make either stay in front of everything or are unable to prevent back button from exiting the application? I want my lightweight windows to be shown on the screen and I want the android back button to act exactly the same as the back button I&#39;ve put in my navbar instead of exiting the application.</p>
<p>Am I wrong in thinking that my app should have only one heavyweight window? How do I tie my android:back event handler into whatever execution context or window is created at the beginning by titanium?</p>

							<p>Figured out my issue. It turns out that in appcelerator if you add an eventlistener to a window it is actually stored in the window&#39;s view&#39;s _event property so when I was going back to remove my android:back listener it wasn&#39;t on the window.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Sam,</p>
<p>Can you please elaborate more on your solution. I am having the same problem. I have a heavy weight main window, from which I can navigate to different windows which are all light weight. </p>
<p>So when I click the Back button on Android test device on any of the light weight windows the application exits which should not be the case. Thanks for any help or suggestions.</p>

										<p><p>HEy there</p>
<p>It&#39;s been quite some time but I remember the key to my problem was removing the back event listener from windows that are no longer visible. I&#39;m pretty sure my strategy was to intercept the event before it got to the heavy window and stop it from proppogating. Simply removing the event listener wasn&#39;t working for this particular event because the listener wasn&#39;t in the right place after you set it. I&#39;ll see if I can dig up my code and get you a better answer.</p>

										<p><p>Ok I found my code. What I did was my original idea of having the root heavyweight window. We used a coffeescript adaptation of the Spine.js library and used routing to get around the program. After constructing the root window I bind the android:back to a function and simply have that fire an app:back event and that&#39;s the only place in the code that bind&#39;s the android:back. When the navigator (who controls the routing) received the app:back it would deduce what to do and fire an app:close if there&#39;s no windows left.</p>
<p>I guess the heavy window will always get the android:back first and forward it to the lightweight ones if it&#39;s not dealt with. The important thing is to stop it from propagating there and turn it into an app:back as soon as possible. I Highly recommend using an mvc system like spine that has routing for cross-platform apps. With it I was able to have a navbar (with the back button) on both iOS and android and have the android back act like pressing the iOS back button.</p>
