			<h1>how to build a hashtag picker view?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>I am trying to build an application using titanium that part of its functionalities is being able to search for hashtags entered by other users of the application.</p>
<p>I have seen other applications on android and ios(EyeEm for example) where the user starts typing on the keyboard and then he gets suggestions of hashtags that other users have entered…i understand that there is a server being queried on each key press to fetch the suggestions but my question is more focused about how to build the UI(created a small list popup that has the suggestions and being able to select a suggestion)</p>
<p>I am wondering if there is exists something similar already done i can use to build on top of it</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

							<div><p>Very simple, but I&#39;m not going to write the app for you. Create a ListView and a SearchBar. Add them to the window. Listen to the SearchBar &quot;change&quot; event and there create some logic to look for results and populate the ListView accordingly. With the &quot;change&quot; event you can get the text that was entered. It&#39;s that easy.</p>
