			<h1>Borken Mobile Installation on Ubuntu</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>This is a  first time 12.04 Ubuntu installation. All the pieces are installed for an initial installation, including Sun Java 1.6. But, TS cannot find, and wont install the Titanium Mobile SDK. Its unclear to me from the docs exactly where these are downloaded during an initial install, or if they might be actually dl&#39;d and installed during the first launch and set up. Or perhaps there is a separate installation just for the sdk.</p>
<p>The error is:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Titanium SDK Home: Could <span class="hljs-operator">not</span> locate <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> Titanium SDK <span class="hljs-keyword">at</span> <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> given path.
</code></pre><p>Titanium is installed in app&#x2F;Titanium_Studio, and the binary launches fine from there. But setting that is the SDK path is no good. And there is nothing in there that looks like a SDK (to me). TS seems to want to use .titanium as the default location, which does exist, but there is nothing there (empty folder). I have another Ubuntu installation and .titanium seems to be the correct location.</p>
<p>Android SDK is configured, and found OK. Going to help and select &#39;Check for Updates&#39; says &#39;No updates found&#39;. Then click on &#39;Check for Titanium updates&#39;, and absolutely nothing happens. No popups, no error messages (that I can find) at all. It seems like chicken and egg … no sdk, everything seems fubar. I&#39;ve looked at every configuration option I can find.</p>
<p>I am probably missing a step, but how to install the mobile sdk?</p>

							<div><p>Yes, java commands work fine. In fact, it was an adventure getting 1.6 installed (no longer in any Ubuntu repo I could find). But with the initial problems, it was successfully downgraded from 1.7 to 1.6, and set as the system default.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I prefix this with the statement &quot;I know VERY little of Linux and Ubuntu&quot; but this may be path related, have you check out?</p>
<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Configuring+Environment+Variables#ConfiguringEnvironmentVariables-Ubuntu">Configuring Environment Variables Ubuntu</a></p>
<p>I am sorry if you have already but just in case my limited knowledge&#x2F;suggestion could help I thought I would try.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks. Out of all that Ubuntu config stuff, the only real problem was the Ti SDK location. The installation created ~&#x2F;.titanium (default location) just fine. Its just empty, and there does not seem to be a means of populating it with sdk&#39;s short of manually copying them from another system. Explicitly designating that folder as the SDK location does nothing useful (stays empty).</p>
