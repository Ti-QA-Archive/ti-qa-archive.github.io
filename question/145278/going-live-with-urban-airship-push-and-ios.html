		<section>
			<p>Hi there<br>My app is now ready for the app store. I use Urban Airship for push messages. With the test-profile, this works very well. What do I have to take care about when switching to &quot;production&quot; mode?</p>
<p>Do I need to just create a new App in UA with the production-certificate by Apple and update the UA AppKey and SecretKey in my App?</p>
<p>Thanks for any hints…</p>
<p>Jonas</p>

							<p>Yes I would definitely create a separate app in UA for your production app. I would also test your production setup by installing your app with a distribution Ad Hoc provisioning profile so you can test that everything with the production cert is working. And after you have all of that working, re-download your App Store provisioning profile and use that when submitting. I made the mistake before of using an App Store provisioning profile that was created before setting up my Push notification keys and registration of Push just wouldn&#39;t happen. Also very hard to debug those type of issues.</p>

										<p><p>Ok… I now did the ad-hoc provisioning profile and installed with that the app on my phone. I also uploaded the new live push certificate to UA and everything seams to work fine (devices is registred with UA and I already could receive messages). I will now test with my test-buddies&#39; phones and if this all works well, I then only have to change the distribution profile from Ad-Hoc to App Store and use this for submitting? Did I got you right?</p>
<p>Thanks anyway for your fast and clear response!!!</p>

										<p><p>Correct, Ad-Hoc and App Store are both Distribution provisioning profiles so they will use the live Push cert. Just make sure to get a fresh download of your App Store provisioning profile down to your machine before submitting.</p>
