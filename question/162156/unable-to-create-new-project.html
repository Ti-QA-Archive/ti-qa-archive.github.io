							<p>Hi</p>
<p>On the basis this is a new installation and you have yet to create your very first app using this computer with this installation then it is likely an Android configuration issue or the Android SDKs have yet to be installed as required.</p>

										<p><p>I am going to assume you are using Ti SDK 3.2 GA - if you are not - start there and install that from the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;my.appcelerator.com&#x2F;resources">downloads page</a>.</p>
<p>If you are using Ti SDK 3.2 GA then check that you have the correct SDKs for Android installed - there are many - one for each version of Android that should be supported (Even if you are not directly supporting them).  Keep in mind you are required to have Android 2.3.3 even if you are only targeting Android 4.x devices.  This is because it is a current requirement.</p>
<p>Steps to check;</p>
<ul>
<li>From Titanium Studio</li>
<li>Locate the Dashboard Tab</li>
<li>If you cannot find it press the red &quot;house&quot; with the letter &quot;a&quot; that should appear on the toolbar</li>
<li>In Dashboard press the &quot;Get Started&quot; button under your name and icon</li>
<li>Scroll down to SDKs</li>
<li>If this is red, you have not configured at least the basics</li>
<li>Press the &quot;Android SDK&quot; entry</li>
<li>Press the &quot;Update Android Button&quot; that appeared to the right side</li>
<li>Press the &quot;Settings&quot; link on the right side of &quot;Android&quot;</li>
<li>This will show you all the SDKs that can be installed</li>
<li>Select them all and press the &quot;Configure&quot; button</li>
<li>This may take some time</li>
</ul>
<p>Once complete reboot even if not asked - a reboot is always a good idea.</p>
<p>Try again.</p>

										<p><p>Chatting with Trevor Ward (another expert), he is wondering if this is a windows permission issue.</p>
<p>Close down Titanium and then find the icon, right click it and choose &quot;Run as Administrator&quot;.  Does this improve anything?</p>
<p>If you are using CLI instead of the Studio - open terminal in the same way.</p>

										<p><p>Sorry using mac phrases;</p>
<p>If you are using CLI instead of the Studio - open cmd (dos prompt, command line) in the same way.</p>

										<p><p>Another thought. As I read the thread. Have you installed 2.3 and 4 of the Android SDK a basic install does not automatically do this and 2.3 is a Titanium requirement.</p>

										<p><p>Yea i have installed the 2.3 and 4!</p>
<p>But i have solved the problem i think. I do no longer get the error and it seems that it runs smooth.</p>
<p>I basicly installed the SDK bounded with eclipse that i downloaded separate and then do some fixing in the interface in titanium. So now its runs! But i now get a new error message when a compile but that is another question.</p>
<p> It says &quot;[ERROR] :  Failed to compile Java source files:&quot;<br>[ERROR] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 1</p>
<p>Must have been a curropt verison of Andriod SDK…</p>
