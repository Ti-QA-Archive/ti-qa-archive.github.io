			<h1>Map Crashes Android on create</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Map consistently crashes Android emulator and device on creation of MapView. SDKs 2-3, Google APIs 4.0.3 and up. Scaled down to basics as well as kitchensink example placed in FirstView.js of new Single View template. First noticed after yesterdays updates but may be a coincidence.<br>Wrecks any hope of my building commercial product for Android.</p>
<p>Anyone else getting this recently?</p>

<p>Looking at problems more than a year old I can see trying APIs earlier than 2.2 being solutions, which do work but is utilizing an API 2 versions old efficient and if that is the only answer what is the latest version known to work? The map is intended to be used with scrollables and tables which already slow the android version of my project so I&#39;d like to be as current as possible.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help.</p>

							<p>OK, so had I gone one more build back it would have launched. </p>
<p>I&#39;m guessing that only some builds are able to create maps in Android? I would expect that all Google APIs would work but apparently.. not? I hadn&#39;t found a shortlist anywhere so maybe this is helpful to someone else in my predicament rather than deleting AVDs, changing configurations and relaunching emulators over and over again to make sure you weren&#39;t nuts.<br>Having tested all of the Google APIs back to 2.2, which also worked, these were the latest.</p>
<ul>
<li>Google APIs Android 2.3.3 [armeabi] = API Level 10 - WVGA800</li>
<li>Google APIs Android 3.0.0 [armeabi] = API Level 11 - WVGA854</li>
<li>Google APIs Android 4.0 [armeabi] = API Level 14 - WVGA854</li>
</ul>
<p>Still I&#39;d appreciate confirmation that I&#39;m not missing something as I&#39;d assume the latest builds would be most efficient, or is that an incorrect assumption?  Eventually I&#39;m cacheing 5 tables in a scrollable and dropping a map into the same view. As it already stutters ever so slightly when I scroll a table I&#39;d like the smoothest ride I can get out of the droid. Though iOS, no problem with any of this. Smooth.</p>
<p>Thanks, and Cheers.</p>

										<p><p>Update : Having tested from latest to oldest build I hadn&#39;t considered going backwards again. This time 4.0.3 works, 4.1.2 works, and the computer starts sounding like a jet warming up from an hour of DDMS spinning through init code, 4.2 works. No code changes other than originally testing multiple skins within the API 4s. Sounds wacky that a skin file might change the outcome, though these emulators are sometimes temperamental.</p>
<p>t&#39;s as though you have to warm it up with on old model before you can convince the new models to accept it.</p>
