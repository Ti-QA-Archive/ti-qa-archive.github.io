			<h1>Move Andoird Tabgroup to The Bottom</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi guys, I am trying to move the tabgroup to the bottom just like what iPhone looks like. I&#39;ve seen several similar posts and one of them(see this link: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;83661&#x2F;android-tabgroup-placement) is answered by a Titanium staff who said it&#39;s not possible to do this with Ti.UI.tabgroup and gave a link of the workaround by Chris(see this link:http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;46801&#x2F;giving-to-the-community-custom-tabgroup-class-working-on-android-and-iphone). I tried the workaround but the problem is that this method doesn&#39;t allow the usage of the back button on the phone; instead, you will need to manually add back buttons inside the app. Since Titanium staff answered that question 9 months ago I wonder it&#39;s possible to do this now????(not that likely) Or is there any other way to do this at the same time enabling the usage of phone back button???</p>

							<div><p>Just out of curiosity, why do you want to move the tabgroup to the bottom on Android? Android users have an expectation of the tabgroup being navigable from the top of the app.</p>

							<p>As Paul said in the first Q&amp;A you linked, the Android SDK native tab control always appears at the top (whereas the iOS native tab control always appears at the bottom).  Neither SDK lets you easily change that – it is just the native &quot;look and feel&quot; for each platform.</p>
<p>That said, people have come up with some inventive ways to coerce android tabs to the bottom of the screen when programming native apps in Java but they aren&#39;t perfect either.  For example, the gray line at the base of the tabs which normally divides the tabs from the views is still at the base of the tabs (i.e. bottom of window) instead of above the tabs to separate from the views above the tabs.  <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;2395661&#x2F;android-tabs-at-the-bottom&#x2F;2710404#2710404">Here</a> is one way of doing it in a native Java project.</p>
<p>But I wouldn&#39;t really expect Appcelerator to implement something like that hack as a standard feature of Titanium.</p>
<p>Aside from the workaround you mentioned, another alternative is how the sample app <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;01&#x2F;tweetanium-source-code-release.html">Tweetanium</a> provides its own pseudo tabgroup which looks the same on both platforms.</p>

										<p><p>Doug, thanks for your replay. I run the code and somehow ran into an error–I cannot log myself in. I tried several different accounts and it all failed. It&#39;s an error that hasn&#39;t been fixed. My question is that: does tweetanium allow the usage of back button on the android phone???(back button can take you to the previous level instead of taking you out of the app whenever you click it). Since I am not able to log in, I cannot test this. If you have ever used this on android, please tell me.</p>

										<p><p>I have never run tweetanium on any platform, so I can&#39;t tell you how the back button behaves.  Did you check the source to see if it does anything with the android:back event?  You may also want to search the Q&amp;A for android:back and look at threads such as <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;58951&#x2F;app-closes-when-you-tap-the-back-button-it-should-go-back">this</a> one.</p>

										<p><p>Doug, thank you for your answer. I got it. I downloaded the source yesterday afternoon and by now I kind of figure out how it works and the back button works perfectly.</p>

							<p>Hello,<br>I know that the link posted by Nikunj might not work for some people or is a little complicated so I created a simple example which is a custom tabgroup of 4 tabs, located at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;4658846">Here it is!!</a></p>
<p>Let me know if this helps you out :D</p>

							<p>You can catch the <strong>android:back</strong> event and use it to go back just like you have been using a back button inside the app.</p>
