										<p><p>This is where Appcelerator sucks. They offer free tools and then when they get to offering something priced they go WAY overboard. $9.99 per month is a RIDICULOUS price for any developer excluding someone like NBC or MTV, why not just price it at a fair price maybe a one off price $39.99 lets say, then your still getting some cash but at least its still in the grasps of the other devs. They make me so angry when they do this. Same happened when they had the old subscriptions, they had no middle ground, its either free or over priced. They need to wise up and UNDERSTAND what they are offering to the masses, right now, they don&#39;t.</p>

										<p><p>I should add I don&#39;t hate Appcelerator, I love it but the people who work out the pricing have now got it wrong on at least two occasions I can think of, and that upsets me. They should be pricing things for all levels and seriously considering the small guy but of course pricing things accordingly for the big guys too.</p>

										<p><p>The best thing about appcelerator&#39;s pricing, is that its so high it makes me want to learn native Objective-C and Java so I don&#39;t have to use Titanium at all, which in the end will probably be better for me!</p>

							<p>UP !</p>
<p>i work on a free project too and it seems that i have to pay in order to continue developing on it. I&#39;m shocked. Game Kit is a Core Library of Apple SDK.</p>
<p>I used to develop with Apple SDK, then i found Appcelerator and had an paid accound with them, Now i doubt on it.</p>

							<p>Sure!</p>
<p>Look this module: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;4100?1890434653</p>
<p>It&#39;s not free, but this module doesn&#39;t need a subscription, you pay just one time.</p>
