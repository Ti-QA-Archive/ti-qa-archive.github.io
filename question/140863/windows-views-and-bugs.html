			<p>I was told to use one window with one view per screen to avoid crashes and memory leaks. </p>
<p>So does that mean, I can not have one window with many (3-4) views in Titanium, it will crash. true or false? </p>
<p>This is now different to how you would build an ios application. An ios app, you would have one window with many views, and use a nav controller to manage your group of views. </p>
<p>Titanium you don&#39;t build app this way? </p>

							<p>You can add as many views as you want to your windows. Obviously, the more you add, the more memory you&#39;ll eat up, but that doesn&#39;t mean you need to restrict yourself to one. I&#39;m thinking what was meant by one view per screen was to add a main view to your window then add all of your other views to that main view, that way you could easily clean up the entire window if you needed to. Of course, this isn&#39;t really necessary. Keep your code structured commonjs style and when you close any window, all its children will clean up properly.</p>

										<p><p>If you have one window with 3 views, and show only one view at a time. Will it use up more memory than say 3 windows with one view per window? </p>
<p>Does it make a difference?</p>

										<p><p>Its going to depend on what is in those views and windows. They each use up a different amount of memory. But in the end, as long as you write good code, then it won&#39;t make a bit of difference.</p>

										<p><p>@Anthony, Actually he said when you design a screen, use one window per screen, rather than use one main window per related screens (views).</p>
<p>That means dont do this, mainwindow plus masterview and detailview. &lt;– this is bad because it will cause your app to crash, Instead in this case you would create 3 windows one window for each screen. </p>
<p>What are your thoughts about this?</p>

							<p>Hi Robert</p>
<p>In answer to your question - I have created some extremely complicated layouts compared to the 3 or 4 you mention, with deep nested navigation with many tables, images etc.</p>
<p>I have NEVER had a memory issue or app crash that was not related to poor code (happens to the best of us) or a known bug (that is usually fixed within a few short weeks).</p>
<p>The Appcelerator platform is very stable and provides for a very rapid application development solution.</p>
<p>If you are new to the platform, have a play - use the KitchenSink app to see how many of the things work.  If you are already using the platform - play more, expand your scope and see how easy it can be.</p>
<p>BTW using <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;CommonJS+Modules+in+Titanium">CommonJS</a> is a great way to structure your code and will make extending and re-using your own code much easier.</p>
