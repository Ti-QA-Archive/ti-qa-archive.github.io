			<h1>Help me understand views in Alloy</h1>

		<section>
			<p>I have read as much of the documentation on controllers and views in Alloy and I am still very perplexed at the behavior of these components.</p>
<p>For instance, if view2 is created from view1 without closing view 1, using:</p>
<p><code>createController(&amp;quot;view2&amp;quot;).getView().open()</code></p>
<p> Will I be returned to view1 once view 2 is closed?</p>
<p><code>view2.close()</code></p>
<p>Is view1 essentially view2 parent? Or is view1 a sibling of view2?</p>
<p>Am I creating a memory leak by calling <code>createController(&amp;quot;view2&amp;quot;).getView().open()</code> without first closing it?</p>
<p>If I am going to be flipping between several views, is it best to create a controller and save it to Globals<br><code>Alloy.Globals.myController = Alloy.createController(&amp;quot;mycontroler&amp;quot;);</code></p>
<p>Then every time I want to use this controller, I just get the view and open it?<br>Alloy.Globals.myController.getView().open();</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>OK your are confused, I ill try and make it a little clearer.</p>
<p>Calling <strong>createController</strong> does not in anyway affect any navigation or parent&#x2F;child relationship.  All you are actually doing is to bring that controller into memory so that it will be ready to be used for whatever you choose it achieve.</p>
<p>So if your app has a single window being displayed with a single button (so we can use it to trigger an event), we can then follow through the process.</p>
<p><strong>index.xml</strong></p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">Alloy</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">Window</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">id</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"win"</span>&gt;</span>
        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">Button</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">id</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"btnopen"</span>&gt;</span>
            Open
        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">Button</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">Window</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">Alloy</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p><strong>index.js</strong></p>
<pre><code class="hljs">$.btn.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">e</span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> win = Alloy.createController(<span class="hljs-string">'testwin'</span>).getView();
    win.open();
});
</code></pre><p><strong>testwin.xml</strong></p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">Alloy</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">Window</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">id</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"testwin"</span>&gt;</span>
        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">Button</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">id</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"btnclose"</span>&gt;</span>
            Close
        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">Button</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">Window</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">Alloy</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p><strong>testwin.js</strong></p>
<pre><code class="hljs">$.btn.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">e</span>) </span>{
    $.testwin.open();
});
</code></pre><p>This will create an initial window with a single button, press the button and the <strong>testwin</strong> controller is loaded and the resulting window is opened.  This second window is opened over the top of the original window.  The first window is not the parent and the second window is not the child.</p>
<p>Why is this not a parent and child situation?</p>
<p>As there is not a navigation controller or tabgroup involved and thus the new window is not open as a child of either of those then there is no direct link between either of the two windows.  Whilst the UI hides the original window it is simply because the second covered the first.</p>
<p>Android is also a bit different; it does not have a navigation controller and the tab group tabs also do not have navigation controllers.  So whatever happens Android windows do not have direct relationships to those who call them.</p>
<p>On iOS you can have a tab group or a navigation controller.  You can then choose to open up the new window as either a simple new window or as a child of a tab group tab or as a navigation window.  If you do either of these things then the new window is a child of the parent window it was opened from.</p>
<p>As to memory and more importantly garbage collection - you are correct you need to perform proactive handling of some clean ups (although not always).  A good idea is to create a function in each controller to dispose of any timeouts, intervals, event handlers and null any objects used.  This however is performed when the window is being closed by you or by an action of the user.</p>
<p>Globals should be used sparingly and rarely.  In Alloy there is an option to attach references to the global object, there are few good uses of this ability - but one would be a reference to a tabgroup or a navigation window - so it can easily be accessed later to allow the new window to be distinctly as a child of either.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you so much. That makes sense.</p>
<p>So in your example above, if created another controller for index.js using createController() from $.testWin and opened it, I would now have two instances of the index.js controller and two $.win windows open?</p>
<p>As well I would still have the $.testWin open unless I closed it and destroyed the controller?</p>
<p>So after I opened the second instance of $.win from $.testWin, how would I reopen $.testWin without creating another window and controller instance?</p>

										<p><p>It is easier if you stop thinking of controller as something and remember in this context it is simple returning something.  That something is what we are playing with.</p>
<p>Keep in mind you would NOT use createController to reference <strong>index.js</strong>, but you can use it inside inside the index.js controller to start things off.  The index.js is simply the start point for the app in this discussion.</p>
<p>So example time;</p>
<ul>
<li>Your app contains the default index.js, in this you have a single window and inside a single button - like the above example.</li>
<li>In that button event you use createController to return the window from <em>list.js</em> (assume js&#x2F;tss&#x2F;xml for all of these).</li>
<li>List.js contains a table with rows inside it</li>
<li>In that table event you use createController to return the window from <em>detail.js</em> </li>
<li>Detail.js contains a few labels about the item you clicked a few minutes ago.</li>
</ul>
<p>So right now you have the <em>detail</em> window above the <em>list</em> window which is above the <em>startup</em> window.  The normal process for the user is to dismiss the <em>detail</em> window using a close (back or up [assume these for all close references]) button.  This unloads the <em>detail</em> from memory.  They can then choose to either click another row and get a new version of the <em>detail</em> window or click choose the close button and the the <em>list</em> window closes.  The user is now back to the first window defined in <em>index</em>.</p>
<p>In this example you would NOT unload any window that was below the topmost window.  As this is a navigation structure presented to the user and the expectation is they will return back through those previously navigated windows.</p>
<p>Note that on iOS if this process was inside a navigation window or a tab navigation controller and opened as a child of either then the <em>close</em> button would be a back button and automatically appear.</p>
<p>If this was on Android and on Android 4.x then you would include an ActionBar and set the <em>displayhomeasup</em> option to show an <em>up</em> button.  This would then act the exact same way as I explained above for the close button.</p>
<p>If your app requires a user to navigate through windows and at any point all of those windows are closed by the app and not the user - then we need to achieve this a different way as traditional window navigation is not suited to this.  This is often called a wizard or step by step UI.</p>
<p>To achieve this you only create one window and add a scrollableView.  For each of the <em>windows</em> you would have created you now create views and add them to the views array of the scrollableView.  You would normally disable the user interaction for paging and hide any paging indicators.  You would handle the progression through each page yourself in code.  Once the user has completed the task or simply has finished and want to close they press a close button (or up or back) to return.  In this case there was only one window but the UI has sliding pages to give the user a great experience but the ability to stop at any point or close the entire process at the end.  Which depends on your apps needs.</p>
<p>So just to confirm - you would NOT use createController to return index.js under any circumstances.  index.js is your initial window and would NEVER be re-used in this nature.  There are however things you can do in the xml to include the same templated xml, so more than one controller could share some or all elements but that is a conversation for another day.  If you are interested use the docs for <strong>REQUIRE</strong>.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks again. That clears things up tremendously. So when you open windows, there isn&#39;t always a need to close them if you expect the user or the app will return to them. </p>
<p>I know I would never use createController on index.js, I was just using it as an example since you only had two windows in your above example.</p>
<p>So one last thing, how would I get a reference to all open windows? Is there some kind object that has a reference to open windows that you can iterate through?</p>

										<p><p>There is no way to determine all windows currently running.  But then there shouldn&#39;t need to be.  As your code is in charge of creating a new window and that new window should have a means either by user choice or your internal logic to close it - then the association is always with the window that opens a window and that windows ability to be closed.</p>
<p>It is highly unlikely that you would ever open many windows at the same time that were unrelated to a navigational pattern even if it was not automated by the iOS tab or nav solutions.  Your app will allow the user to move from choice to choice to choice, with you choosing when&#x2F;if those choices require a new window.  As the topmost window sits over the one that created it, once returned that once is now in focus for the user and all the way back if needed.</p>
<p>Think of this logic like a family tree (and assume your most distant relatives were one person (sorry nothing personal), to get down to you you move from that first family member, through the generational choices all the way to you.  But in the process the steps were clear and the return path obvious as you return back through if the new need was to then find your cousin.</p>
<p>You can of course have other windows that are &quot;hanging around&quot;, but those situations are rare and only really done by those who (I hate to say this) know what they are doing.  Mostly because those windows are outside any logical flow so displaying them is harder.</p>
<p>Now there are always exceptions to the above and one example would be a facebook style menu with a mcdonalds app style side panel.  This is very much an iOS exception as the Android way would not do this at all.  This is actually built up of three windows, each sitting on top of the other with the main one at the top.  To see either side window the other side hides and the top one slides almost out of view - thus revealing the side window.  The same in reverse.  So in this case we have three windows, the user does not navigate into or out of any of them - except to slide.  So this is a time when having other windows around outside of the nav stacks I mentioned actually is a good idea.  But again they are not disconnected from the process as in order to show them the <em>index.js</em> has some cool logic to spawn those three and then control the placement and display of each.  So these are not left hanging around.</p>
<p>You would not have a few windows pre-loaded in memory for use later as that would be poorly inefficient on so many levels.. I can get from your question and comments you understand this, but worth noting for anyone else who reads this.</p>
