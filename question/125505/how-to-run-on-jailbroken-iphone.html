							<p>Running on a jailbroken phone is the same as a non jailbroken.</p>
<p>As for the iOS SDK vs iPhone SDK… you would need to update your phone to 4.0 or downgrade to an older version of Xcode.</p>

							<p>If you are a registered Apple developer, then the normal steps should work fine.  You will need a development or distribution profile from Apple.  This would be no different than using a device which is not jailbroken.</p>
<p>If you are not a registered Apple developer and you are trying to install without a provisioning profile, then I don&#39;t know the steps involved.</p>
