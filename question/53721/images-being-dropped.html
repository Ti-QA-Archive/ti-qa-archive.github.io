			<h1>Images being dropped</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a TableView showing a list of &#39;mugshots&#39;. Each row also has an &#39;info&#39; button which is the same image (a small .png).</p>
<p>In the previous version of the iPhone SDK 3.2 this worked as it should with all the images and &#39;info&#39; buttons rendering in their rows.<br>Since upgrading to SDK 4.0 (and 4.0.1) the images in the initial view are fine but the rest of the mugshots only render as one scrolls down and the rest of the &#39;info&#39; icons are missing completely! </p>
<p>My first thought was memory - is this to do with images only being rendered when needed to save memory. But I have no idea what&#39;s going on with the &#39;info&#39; buttons - they just stop. As a final word each row is built from the same code so there should be no difference.</p>

							<div><p>Thanks guys for the help on this - I have fixed the issue with my &#39;info&#39; icons disappearing halfway down a TableView. Seems &quot;url&quot; is depreciated in an ImageView which I didn&#39;t appreciate until I&#39;d added the fix for the Ti.API.info bug and got some diagnostics back!<br>However, I still still haven&#39;t found a fix for the strange case that images outside of the initial view area only slowly reveal themselves as one scrolls down - as if they are some guilty secret!</p>

							<p>Well if u copy code to another app.js then i feel u have to change the build path force it to full build</p>
<p>go to the root of your project, in build&#x2F;iphone and delete the build folder( so delete the folder myApp&#x2F;build&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;build)</p>

							<p>Thanks Varun,</p>
<p>I did try a re-build, in fact several of them, but with no luck. The images outside the initial iPhone view only render as one scrolls and the all the &#39;info&#39; images I spoke of are nowhere to be seen beyond that initial view. It&#39;s most odd.</p>
<p>Wasn&#39;t sure what your line about coping the code to another app meant - are you asking if I&#39;d done that or suggesting I should?</p>

							<p>You could try passing a <code>className</code> to your tablerows.</p>
