			<h1>Custom UI Components and Titanium mobile</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>we are currently evaluating the functionality of Titanium mobile.<br>We are very concerned with its ability to create native iPhone GUI components.</p>
<p>I couldn&#39;t find any informations on subclassing some general component class or however things are handled in Titanium when it comes to creating custom UI components. And by custom I don&#39;t mean changing the background color of a button, but painting controls and the like myself.</p>
<p>Can this be achieved with Titanium?<br>How does it affect the apps portability to android?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

							<p>Hi Andre, perhaps the most flexible approach would be to use HTML&#x2F;CSS in webViews. Although if you have Obj-C knowledge you might consider building a specific module for the controls and settings you have in mind.</p>
<p>Of course the experts might have a better answer on this.</p>
<p>cheers,<br>Chris</p>

							<p>Thank you for your answer Chris. </p>
<p>Are you saying that we could integrate our own GUI controls into Titanium? </p>
<p>Since they would have to be written in Objective-C for the iPhone, wouldn&#39;t that completely rule out Android as a target platform or is there a nice and easy way to plug in one of two different controls (one written in Java and the other Obj-C) depending on the platform we&#39;re currently compiling for?</p>

										<p><p>You clearly did not read the question or even understand it, plus the question is 4 years old and the whole world (including titanium) has moved on since this question was asked so the relevancy is very limited now.</p>
<p>Also the link is for Windows ui elements rather than any of the supported mobile operating systems for Titanium.</p>
