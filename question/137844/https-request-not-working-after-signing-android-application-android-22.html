			<h1>https request not working after signing android application (android 2.2)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, In my android application I am using https requests. When I test it on my android device with android version 2.2 its working fine. But after signing application for distribution; my application is not working. Unsigned application with Https requests is working fine. But signed application with Https request is not working .<br>For signing my application I follow <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Packaging+for+the+Android+Market">this</a>. Is there any solution regarding this problem so that I can use https with sign android application.</p>

							<div><p>It would be helpful if you could go in to further detail instead of just &quot;my application is not working&quot;.</p>
<p>You may want to alert the user in your app upon an onerror event to help isolate the problem, if the problem is actually with the https requests.</p>
