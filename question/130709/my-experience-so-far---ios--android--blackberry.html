			<h1>My Experience So Far - iOS + Android + Blackberry</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I thought I&#39;d post my experience so far with Titanium Appcelerator. I&#39;ll try to continue to update this post as I continue with my project. Hopefully my 2 cents helps other folks who&#39;re just getting started.</p>
<p>So - I decided to jump on Titanium because it offers what seems to be the silver bullet solution to writing apps for 3 platforms, and lets just say its been a wild ride. Comments and criticisms are welcome… of course. Here&#39;s a brief overview of writing for each platform:</p>
<p><strong>iOS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Easiest to write apps for using titanium</li>
<li>Has the most compliance [pro] and the apps are pretty stable</li>
<li>Final apps are huuuuge! This is a major [con]. This is due to the Titanium Modules that are part of the package. Code bloat is inevitable with something like Titanium</li>
<li>No problems submitting to the Apple app store</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Android</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It seems quite a few elements are missing… the biggest being the <em>Action Bar</em> [con]</li>
<li>Android is a pain in the ass to develop for in general. Dealing with screen sizes and densities is a universal pain.</li>
<li><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Fastdev+Reference+for+Android">Fastdev</a> helps speed up emulator testing with Titanium, but its still slow. So my suggestion is to check your code over again before testing on the emulator. You&#39;ll spend plenty of time twiddling your fingers [con&#x2F;pro]</li>
<li>Enable snapshots for your emulator (in eclipse)… unless you want to sit around twiddling your fingers</li>
<li>Ti.API.info(&#39;xxxx&#39;) does not log in Titanium Studio. You&#39;ll have to use the Eclipse console log for this</li>
<li>V8 &amp; Rhino are both sloooooooow! I don&#39;t see much difference</li>
<li>Including multiple files will slow your app startup considerably. My suggestion is to combine JS files whenever you can. In addition to that MINIFY the JS and&#x2F;or use Google&#39;s closure <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;closure-compiler.appspot.com&#x2F;home">closure compiler</a></li>
<li>Tableviews… bane of your apps existence. Not sure why tableviews suck the life out of the app [major con]. Titanium will have to do some work here</li>
<li>When using the emulator set your tiapp.xml to install to SD Card directly. The massive sizes of the APK&#39;s will guarantee you space issues otherwise</li>
<li>Use classnames for tableview rows… improves performance</li>
<li>Make absolutely sure that rows sharing a classname are the same type, otherwise you&#39;ll encounter force closes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Blackberry</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You&#39;ll need paid membership with Appcelerator to get started</li>
<li>Getting Titanium Studio&#39;s Blackberry SDK to work will give you plenty of gray hair [con]</li>
<li>Windows Only</li>
<li>Once you get your dev environment going Blackberry is actually a joy to code and work with [pro]</li>
<li>Titanium apps for Blackberry are surprisingly fast, compared to Android</li>
<li>The Blackberry Emulator is freaking awesome and makes you feel like you&#39;re using a real phone. Every possible function is emulated perfectly</li>
<li>Rows in Tableviews work very differently. You&#39;ll have to consult the KitchenSink (Blackberry Edition) for this</li>
<li>KitchenSink comes with handy log generator code that will be invaluable for Blackberry Dev</li>
<li>You&#39;ll probably encounter permission issues once you install your app on the emulator, but this is not a big issue</li>
</ul>
<p>… more later</p>

							<p>Performance testing on Android emulator is not good idea and it does not reflect real performances. To see real performances you must use a device. v8 is a lot faster than Rhino (except TableViews, they perform slower from what I can see). Combining files does not make any difference.</p>
<p>In general, developing on Android device is much more faster, stable and reliable.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Ivan, I actually use 3 different phones to test - HTC Sensation, Original Motorola Droid and a Huawei Ideos. I realize that I need to have 3 separate projects as each platform requires different types&#x2F;levels of optimization. I&#39;ll have more feedback after I rework the Android project.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

							<p>Thanks for sharing David. I agree on iOS things you pointed out. About Android, I am about to start using Titanium to build Android apps, and your feedback is very much appreciated. Are you using the latest 1.8.0.1 build for the SDK? What is your experience regarding screen resolution? I am planning to build for Kindle Fire, Nook and maybe two of the most used Android phones…</p>
<p>Again, thanks for sharing your experience…</p>

										<p><p>Hi Ricardo - I am using 1.8.0.1. Regarding resolution, just follow the instructions on <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;guide&#x2F;practices&#x2F;screens_support.html#DesigningResources">the Android site</a> very closely and especially the the density ratio diagram so that you can scale images appropriately with MDPI as the base. One annoyance is that for some reason Titanium sometimes won&#39;t pick images out of the density folders and I have to use dirty hacks to make it work.</p>

							<p>Thanks for sharing.you may download a free barcode scanner by yourself and have fun instead of worring about that. &quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.keepautomation.com&#x2F;&quot;KEEPAUTOMATION free online bar Code Reader and it is really convenient and useful. You may have a try someday and enjoy the life to the fullest.</p>
