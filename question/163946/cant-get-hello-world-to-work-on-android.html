			<h1>Can&#39;t get Hello World to work on Android</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have been trying for two days now to get the Hello World example to run in an Android emulator but I&#39;m completely stuck. I have been searching the Q&amp;A section for possible solutions but nothing so far has worked.</p>
<p>I&#39;m running Windows 7, 64-bit and Titanium Studio 3.2.1</p>
<p>I followed the instructions in the Quick Start guide to install Titanium Studio and then create the Hello World example. From what I can read the installer downloads and installs all the necessary third party stuff (Java, Node, Git) and it seems to have been installed properly. I left all install options as default. I used Titanium Studio to get and install the Android SDK (again using default settings as presented in Studio).</p>
<p>When I try to run the project on Android (using e.g. the &#39;Galaxy Nexus&#39; option) I just keep getting an error &#39;Application Installer abnormal process termination&#39;. The whole console output is available here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dropbox.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;r6almq7m3mn3pih&#x2F;console.txt">console.txt</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the output from &#39;ti info&#39;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dropbox.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;orpvb18s0dbrc6m&#x2F;ti_info.txt">ti_info.txt</a></p>
<p>Here&#39;s the installed packages as listed in Android manager: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dropbox.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;6fk9viayuj85836&#x2F;android.png">android.png</a></p>
<p>There are no AVDs listed in Android manager. From what I&#39;ve been able to find Studio should have installed at least one AVD, but for some reason that hasn&#39;t happened. Adding an AVD manually makes absolutely no difference. The console output looks like it&#39;s trying to start an AVD with the name &#39;Galaxy Nexus&#39; but Android manager doesn&#39;t allow me to use spaces in the name for an AVD som not sure how that fits together.</p>
<p>Any ideas before I get rid of this application forever?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The Android Emulator is a horrible horrible thing.  I gave up on it some time ago as you spent more time trying to get it started than you do on the app itself.</p>
<p>Two solutions - I recommend using both;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Physical Device</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Connect a device up using USB and you can install directly to the device.  You need to enable developer mode - a quick google will explain how for you device, but usually the settings - about page and then multiple tapping the last entry - it then tells you it is enabled.  Only problem though - you may not have enough devices to match the things yu want to test for.  So…</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Genymotion</strong></p>
<p>A much better emulator that everybody loves - it now works with Titanium 3.2 and higher;</p>

										<p><p>Brilliant!</p>
<p>The Genymotion emulator is working (sort of). I have the same problem as the last poster in that linked article though; when I run &#39;ti info -t android&#39; it says &#39;Genymotion Emulators: None&#39;. Not sure if that is normal or something I&#39;m doing wrong. If I start the device from inside Genymotion first I can see and use it from inside Studio which I suppose is good enough.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t quite managed with a physical device yet. I tried with a Kindle Fire HD but Studio doesn&#39;t see it connected. Think there is a setting and&#x2F;or driver I&#39;m missing</p>

										<p><p>As Genymotion is NOT an Android provided solution there are a couple of differences.  As you have noticed start it first it works.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the Kindle Fire HD is not an Android device in its truest state - should not affect things but just keep that in mind.</p>
<p>To connect an Android device you have to set a few things up first.  Check this out to run through the related items - it is basically just, &quot;this android can be used to debug&quot; and when I connect it &quot;this device can accept side loaded apps&quot;.  Ignore any Android specific development stuff, only the cable and dev mode are important.</p>

										<p><p>Got the Kindle working now. Already had the necessary settings on the Kindle itself, but was missing a bunch of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.amazon.com&#x2F;appsandservices&#x2F;resources&#x2F;development-tools&#x2F;ide-tools&#x2F;tech-docs&#x2F;05-setting-up-your-kindle-fire-tablet-for-testing">drivers and stuff</a></p>
