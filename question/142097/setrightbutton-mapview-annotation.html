			<h1>setRightButton MapView Annotation</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,<br>i&#39;ve got some problems trying to get some annotations with nice pictures on a MapView ^^</p>
<p>So, i&#39;ve got 2 problems in fact, first one being that i successfully get some pictures from a HttpConnection with the iOs debugger, all is working fine, but on the real iphone device, i just don&#39;t see my pictures at all.<br>Therefore i just can&#39;t figure out what&#39;s going on, some hints about what to do when your application is working fine on the iOs debugger but not on the real device would be really great =&#x2F;</p>
<p>Second one is also about iphone but it&#39;s related to the events, it looks like on my debugger, the &quot;click&quot; event is launched not one but at least 10 times for a single click, i would like to know if it&#39;s a well known issue, if i&#39;m the only one getting this one, and what to do to fix it :)</p>
<p>Thanks for your help, any hints will be greatly appreciated =)</p>
