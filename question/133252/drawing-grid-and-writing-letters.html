			<h1>Drawing grid and writing letters</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey all,<br>I&#39;m currently working on a crossword app for iPad. I have tried two ways to achieved that and it seems that both have their speed limits. First, creating 20x20 grid of views is really slow on iPad 1. Creating transparent labels is somewhat fast enough but as soon as I specified a background color or border color it is becoming sluggish. I searched but I didn&#39;t find a way to draw directly on a single view as in a canvas.<br>So the other way is loading a webview and filling it with a canvas element. The problem is then drawing letters. I have to use a Ti.APP.fireEvent for each letter clicked and it&#39;s translating in a delay between the click and the display in the canvas. Also I wasn&#39;t able to preload the htlm file before opening the window and there&#39;s a another delay before the canvas is displayed.<br>The app is pretty simple and should be fast on any devices since it&#39;s only ~100 definitions (rows in a tableview), a grid and a keyboard. Is there any way to efficiently draw a grid and update its field (backgroundColor and labels)?<br>Best regards!<br>Olivier (English&#39;s not my first language, sorry for mistakes)!</p>

							<div><p>Hello,<br>if this is an app only for ipad, I would recommend to do the grid as background and put the tiles as an images with coordinates.</p>

							<div><p>Thx for your quick reply. That solution could work since it will reduce greatly the number of views and maybe that moving images around is faster than coloring background of views. I would have like a less hardcoded solution though ;-)</p>

							<div><p>It&#39;s is a bit faster but I&#39;m still stuck with 400 labels to display the letters in the crosswords. Sure I can load them few at time but at the end the 400 will be populated and the user won&#39;t be able to reload the puzzle properly… Any other insight to write without views?</p>

										<p><p>The problem is not the grid itself but the lag induces by rendering 400 views with backgroundColor and borders. As state in comments in the question, replacing views by moving imageViews may be faster.</p>
