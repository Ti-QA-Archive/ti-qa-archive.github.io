			<h1>Button with Image and Background Image Issues</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m trying to create a button with a scaled foreground image and a stretched background image (image buttons…).  Essentially I want to make generic button backgrounds for when events are fired, and have a scaled image icon as the foreground.  I am trying to accomplish this with the following code</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-id">#optionsButton</span>":<span class="hljs-rules">{
    <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">backgroundImage</span>:<span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">'/images/ftest-bgs.png'</span>,
    backgroundSelectedImage:<span class="hljs-string">'/images/ftest-bgp.png'</span>,
    image: <span class="hljs-string">'/images/ftest.png'</span>,
    height: <span class="hljs-string">"100%"</span>,
    width: Ti.UI.SIZE
    </span></span></span>}
</code></pre><p>Needless to say it does not work correctly.  On an older android version (2.3.4) it will stretch the &quot;backgroundImage&quot; to the width of the &quot;image&quot;, while keeping the aspect ratio and clipping the top and bottom of the image, what I would really like to happen is to have the &quot;image&quot; scaled at its original aspect ratio, with a smaller footprint than the total size of the background image at it&#39;s native aspect ratio.</p>
<p> On a new device (android 4.4.2) it will give the button the proper &quot;backgroundImage&quot; aspect ratio, however the &quot;image&quot; is small…</p>
<p>On ipad (iOS 7) it will do what it does on android 2.3.4 except the height is scaled to the area, so it is smushed.</p>
<p>At this point, my best idea is to create a widget and pass it the height, and then when the screen loads determine the size of the button and the size of the icon, create an imageview with the background and then another imageview with the icon and attach event listeners to the foreground and make it act like a button?</p>
<p>What is the proper approach to Image buttons in appcelerator?  I can&#39;t believe that it is to create tons of individual images for every aspect ratio and load them situationally on a stretched button background…</p>
