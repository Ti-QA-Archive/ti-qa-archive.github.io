			<h1>&#34;Hello World&#34; fails to install on emulator</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi!<br>I just installed Titanium, went through &quot;getting started&quot; guide and decided to build my first app for Android. I did not change anything in default app.js. However, it fails to install on emulator.</p>
<p>here is what I got:<br>[ERROR] Failed installing com.calmforce.calmforce: pkg: &#x2F;data&#x2F;local&#x2F;tmp&#x2F;app.apk<br>[TRACE] Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_OLDER_SDK] </p>
<p>The Titanium SDK is 1.5.1; Titanium Developer version is 1.2.2; Android SDK versions for emulator I&#39;ve tried: 1.5, 2.0, 2.2 - same results.</p>
<p>So what INSTALL_FAILED_OLDER_SDK means?</p>

<p>Make sure you follow the <a href="file:&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;home&#x2F;personal&#x2F;dowsep&#x2F;projects&#x2F;development&#x2F;titanium_documentation&#x2F;output&#x2F;en&#x2F;getting_started.html#preparing_for_android_development">Preparing for Android development</a> guide, particularly with regard to the android packages installed. In addition, note that the &quot;SDK Platform Android 1.5&quot; package currently also needs to be installed due to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32238-titanium-mobile&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;2813">this</a> bug.</p>
<p>Lastly, ensure that you have SDK &quot;APIs 2.2&quot; selected on the Run Emulator screen.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for prompt reply, Hal H, it works now - with APIs 2.2.</p>
<p>I had to reinstall JDK also, since I have 64-bit PC but installed first 32 bit version.<br>So can I target any other Android version or 2.2 APIs is the only option? Titanium by default after install picks 1.5, and my T-Mobile phone only recently upgraded to 2.2.</p>

							<p>So this answer was posted in January of 2011, it appears.  Has this changed?  I can&#39;t get the bloody thing to work either, it&#39;s giving me the same issue.  Also, Paul, the link for the Android development guide doesn&#39;t appear to be accessible.  Not too impressed with this product thus far having gone through set-up hell (on Windows - seems to work ok on OSX).</p>
