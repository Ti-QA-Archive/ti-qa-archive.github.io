			<p>I&#39;m thinking of purchasing this product, but I&#39;m wondering about Android support.  My main question is if when I design using this program, would my placement of controls adapt to screen resolutions, or would there be extra coding?</p>

							<p>Hi Josh</p>
<p>Forged UI was introduced in the Titanium Developer week, so I can give you what they said. Using Forged UI will enable you to develop by using a GUI the screens &#x2F; windows required. At the moment you would build a separate screen &#x2F; window for IOS, Android and the different resolution so effectively 2 for IOS and 3 for Android, then code to display the one required.</p>
<p>going forward they plan to combine this into a single design p screen&#x2F;window.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t tried it but I believe you can try Forged UI for free but not have all the functionality.</p>
<p>This product is still in its infancy and will develop very quickly into a much more mature product.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>T.</p>

										<p><p>Product makes infancy seem mature.  It is a simple GUI designer for new users (imho).  At the current price point, again imho, not worth it.  They are contemplating a price change (mentioned in last weeks webinar) and a lot of the questions were answered with &quot;thats something we are looking at&quot;.</p>
<p>Now, in their defense, developing a WYSIWYG is a pain in the royal backside.  I just think they set their starting price a bit off (as does one of their reviewers)</p>

							<p>1) you don&#39;t need to purchase Ti. You can use it for <strong>free</strong>. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;plans-pricing&#x2F;">Paying</a> will give you better support, more videos, maybe extra bells n whistles (not sure, not a paying customer :p)</p>
<p>2) not so much coding around each screen rez, more towards managing a lot more <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Supporting+Multiple+Platforms+in+a+Single+Codebase">assets</a>. As for positioning the controls, mostly it&#39;ll just adapts quite well, then again, I only have access to a couple of Android devices.</p>
<p>Can&#39;t say anything about developing universal app for Android tablets and mobiles (like on iOS), I have no exp there.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m not asking about Titanium.  I&#39;m asking about Forged UI.  You CAN use it for free, I guess, but you only get 10 code generations…</p>

										<p><p>aaah, didn&#39;t know what forged ui was. until I google it just now, you&#39;d probably should ask this question there. it seems that they have a forum, though very quiet…</p>
