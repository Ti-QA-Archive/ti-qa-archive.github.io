			<h1>Issue with Keystore generated by JDK 1.7 and app signed by 1.6</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>So I just finished an app for a client and was getting ready to push to Google Play store. The client sent over a keystore that he generated (using JDK 1.7). I then built it against JDK 1.6 and no errors, uploaded to play store and now I am getting the dreaded &#39;Package file was not signed correctly&#39;.</p>
<p>So I decided I would just create a new keystore using JDK 1.6 on my machine. The problem is I already uploaded the app on the Play Store so I can not use this new keystore with that app on Google Play.</p>
<p>So to me it sounds like there are only 2 options, please correct me if I am wrong.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Somehow build the app with JDK 1.7, even though in the Titanium compatibility matrix it says only 1.6 is supported.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Remove my app from the store, change the reverse domain name slightly, and then republish the app with JDK 1.6 keystore and build.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyone ever have this issue or recommend one or the other? Any other alternatives?</p>

										<p><p>No worries.  Its one of those tools that the system pushes as an update, or on a fresh install, that you just do&#39;nt think will break your setup. AND, its often pushed as a &#39;security&#39; patch so, gee, &quot;I&#39;d be an idiot not to install this!&quot; and then, bam, the processes of app signing for distribution only comes up a few times a year for most folks, and you discover it broke your tooling.</p>
