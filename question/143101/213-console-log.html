							<p>I had this happen to me just now and here is how I fixed it.</p>
<p>What seems to be the problem is the simulator can&#39;t write to the log file.  For me I was messing around with creating a folder inside my application&#39;s Document folder, which is also where the log file is kept.  What happened was I turned my Document folder into a file called Document.  Now the log file is trying to be written to a place that doesn&#39;t exist hence no output in the console.</p>
<p>Two ways to fix this:</p>
<p>First is the quick and easy way. Just open your app in the simulator, Press the simulator &quot;Home&quot; button.  Click and hold your app icon and click X when it starts jiggling to uninstall it.  Once you re-run everything will be re-created.  This is why it worked fine when you installed it on another computer because everything was created new and working.</p>
<p>Second way:<br>Open a terminal and go to the apps folder.  The path will be something like this..<br>&#x2F;Users&#x2F;yourUserName&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;iPhone Simulator&#x2F;6.0&#x2F;Applications&#x2F;626EF612-0981-4C37-86C0-BC4718DAAE25&#x2F;</p>
<p>Where the long number at the end is the ID of your App.  Each App in the simulator has it&#39;s own ID.  Since you can&#39;t use the Ti.API.info to tell you which one is your App&#39;s ID because it&#39;s not working you will just have to try each one and figure it out.  </p>
<p>In this ID folder you will have the Documents, Library, and tmp folder.  Try to enter the Documents folder.  If your problem is the same as mine it should say it&#39;s not a folder.  Delete the Documents file&#x2F;&quot;folder&quot; and re-run the App.  The Documents folder will be re-created and the log file should be inside it.  The console should now work.</p>
