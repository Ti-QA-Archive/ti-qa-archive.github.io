			<h1>Delete a row in a tableview on Android</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m hoping that there is some functionality thats availible in the the last few updates to make this possible but Ive looked for solutions and have not found one that works. I simply have a tableview that I want to delete records out of by selecting a row and deleting it. Titanium does not support $.table.editing for android, there is no swipe event that works which is the native android behavior, and im not able to loop through and add hasCheck to each row and try to do something through the menu buttons and I&#39;m really stumped. In IOS this is a very easy thing to achieve and any help in getting this to work any way similar would be very helpful. It almost seems like I have to use a differant application to build my android app which would break away from the whole idea of using one platform to build one application for both Android and IOS. Does anyone have any examples of how to simulate deleting rows in a tableview in android? Currently the only thing I can do is delete everyrow from a menu button but this is not very user friendly at all.</p>

							<div><p>@Anthony Catalano : You are correct  <strong>$.table.editing</strong>  is not supported in android  and also same for swipe . i face same problem . At that time i create one delete button in every row. <strong>visible=false</strong> at that time click on edit button all that deleted button <strong>visible=true</strong> . Using that button i delete that row. and i work fine for me BUT not <strong>User Friendly</strong></p>
