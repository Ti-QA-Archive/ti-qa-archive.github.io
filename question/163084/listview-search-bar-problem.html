			<h1>Listview search bar problem</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Trying to understand this but in vain.Why do you need to set the searchText property of Listview even though it works well if you just set the searchableText property of a Listitem? Another thing is can you make the list view search to work on 2 properties simultaneously say a Name as well as City? Thanks</p>

							<p>searchableText is what is being searched for (which you probably know already) and searchText is the search query (the text&#x2F;string you want to search the list for) and is used in a specific case, see below.</p>
<p>There is more than one way to search the list.</p>
<ol>
<li>Using the search view. (i.e. by setting the searchView property of ListView.)</li>
<li>Using, say, another textbox somewhere in your view that is not really associated with the ListView. Or by setting the textbox&#x2F;searchbar to the headerView property of Listview- but same effect.</li>
</ol>
<p>In case of #1: When we type the text in the search view, the results are filtered for us. We don&#39;t code anything explicitly to filter the list. (The searchText is set for us).</p>
<p>In case of #2: We will have to explicitly &quot;search&quot; the list to filter the results. Obviously, just typing something in this view (textbox) won&#39;t do anything to the list. So we will have to explicitly set the searchText (aka search query) to filter the list. You can set the searchText, say, in the &#39;change&#39; event listener of the textbox.</p>
<p>When searchView is set, searchText is ignored. searchableText is needed at all times.</p>
<p>As to searching 2 properties simultaneously:</p>
<p>Since the search is performed on the text set to searchableText, you can set the searchableText to include everything you want to search on (e.g. searchableText = &quot;Adnan Mumbai&quot;)</p>
<p>Now when you search for either the name (Adnan) or the city (Mumbai), you will get the hit.</p>
<p>HTH.</p>
