			<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I am new to the iOS app development scene, and would like recommendations as to what I need for a MacBook.  I am looking at the 15inch MacBook Pro but would like to know how much RAM to go for, it comes with 8GB standard - is this enough?  Also is the 256GB flash drive enough?  Thanks in advance…</p>

							<p>We&#39;re not doing any super computing here. The standard stuff that comes with any MBP is going to be fine.</p>

										<p><p>8gb will be fine.</p>
<p>As for storage, that gets eaten up quickly by any development process.<br>If you are using git, you have the overhead from revisions sitting on your drive as well.</p>
<p>I prefer 512gb-1tb, but the cost is crazy.  You can get an external for side storage for a fraction of the cost.  Do not build to the external, only use it for archiving stale project.</p>
<p>Clean up your build directory on projects you aren&#39;t actively developing.</p>
<p>Should be ok.</p>

										<p><p>To give you an idea of space:</p>
<p>android-sdk: 5.5gb</p>
<p>android-ndk (optional): 600mb</p>
<p>development (my titanium projects directory): 3.6gb - 37 projects</p>
<p>xcode.app: 5gb</p>
<p>~&#x2F;Library&#x2F;..&#x2F;Titanium: 4.2gb - storage for various titanium sdks, modules ect</p>
<p>That should give you an idea of usage for a heavily used system.<br>Projects that we know we arent going to touch get zipped, and moved to a backup (remember to kill the builds directory before zipping).</p>

							<p>Thanks for your quick replies!!  Much appreciated!!   For app development is there any reason to go with the retina display?  I was thinking I could go with the standard MacBook Pro with a much bigger HD for the same price..</p>
<p>Thanks again..</p>

										<p><p>No, it doesn&#39;t make a difference.  As long as your images are designed nice, they may look sharper on the simulator, but once its on your phone, it wont matter.</p>
<p>I develop on a 2011 MBA with 4gb ram and a solid-state drive.  Its as faster (or faster) than my work computer, which is a 2012 MBP with 8GB ram (without a solid-state drive).</p>
