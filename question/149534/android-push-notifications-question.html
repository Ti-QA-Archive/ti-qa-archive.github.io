			<h1>Android Push Notifications question</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to send push notifications to android devices and I wanted to ask if i must install the app from the Google Play store so push notifications work, or its ok if i only install it to a device from titanium.</p>
<p>The apps token retrieved is correct and all the info also correct and the notifications appear to be sent to the google server with no problem but the push never arrives.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

							<div><p>Well, the problem was so dumb… The notification was arriving to the app but i didn&#39;t expect it won&#39;t fire one alert like it does automatically in iOS. You must create the notification by yourself. So the problem was that there wasn&#39;t a problem.</p>

							<p>The push should work even if the app is not published.<br>Normally you should get it even when testing on the emulator.</p>
<p>Have you tried push notifications using ACS ? it&#39;s extremely easy to implement.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Imanol you dont really need to download the app.The push notification would be working on both development side just remember that if u are in development phase you would be using development side of ACS and after you have generated the Signed apk or ipa you should have to use the production side of ACS</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m using PushSharp on the server side. Many people use it so its tested and working and it works fine for iOS in my case. The module i use for registration to the android push is working fine and gives me the token. This is not a titanium problem. Thats why i was just asking if i must download the app from the store. Thanks.</p>
