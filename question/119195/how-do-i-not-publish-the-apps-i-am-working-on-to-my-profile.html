			<p>I have no intention of using appcelerator to release my apps, and I&#39;d really rather appcelerator.com not know about which apps I am working on. Some of them are for my job and are sensitive in nature. Is there any way for appcelerator.com to not even know about it? I see in my profile that there is a record of the apps I&#39;ve been working on, and that&#39;s not cool.</p>

							<p>You could do this by working from the command line only.  </p>
<p>Titanium Developer downloads mobile SDK versions to &#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx&#x2F;&lt;version&gt;, or on windows, C:\ProgramData\Titanium...  </p>
<p>Inside the directory for the mobile SDK release you wish to use, there is a titanium.py file.  This is a command line interface to many functions Titanium Developer usually provides.  Run this script with no arguments for help.  titanium.py is not a total replacement for Titanium Developer, however.  If you want to learn how to do EVERYTHING Titanium Developer does, launch the Titanium Developer binary from the console with a –debug flag.  This will print verbose debug logging to the console.  In the console, you should be able to see what Python scripts are being invoked to do task X, Y, or Z.  For example, if you want to package for distribution, you would do this through the UI, and then in the console, see which Python script was executed by Developer, and what arguments it requires.</p>
<p>Eventually titanium.py will be a full-featured CLI to go along with Titanium Studio, but you can peek behind the veil with Titanium Developer today to circumvent it if you need to.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks. I&#39;m on OSX and in my Application Support directory, there isn&#39;t a Titanium directory. I&#39;m guessing this applies to the desktop API was well (were I able to find the directory)? I keep seeing appcelerator pushing the mobile stuff. Does that mean they aren&#39;t going to continue with the desktop? That&#39;s where all my stuff is. I realize this is two questions in one, so I can start a new question.</p>

										<p><p>I have found the Titanium directory. It is in ~&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support … and not &#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support. :) However, I still do not see a titanium.py file. Does something need to be done for it to be generated in the desktop sdk? I see it in the mobilesdk. It looks like it is specific to the mobilesdk, which is not what I&#39;m looking for, sadly.</p>
