							<p>Hi</p>
<p>As the above additional information request shows - more information is required to answer this question.</p>
<p>In the mean-time however;</p>
<p>You should not need to run anything special to get your app to accept the new entries.  You may want to close the simulator&#x2F;emulators and then run menu Project &gt; Clean on your project and try again.</p>
<p>Have you ever had any string s work from that language?</p>

										<p><p>I did just try this and the string variables still are not updating. They seem to update when they want to after 10 or so re-runs. </p>
<p>When I first created this question, my new strings were blank and showing no values in the app. Now after a bunch of re-runs they show the original values but not the updated values.</p>
<p>This issue isn&#39;t really big deal as long as they eventually show the updates. It&#39;s not like I will be changing them very often throughout the development of the app.</p>

							<p>Not exactly sure why but one way to fix this little issue is to run it on a device, then re-run it on the emulator. Doing so then forces a full rebuild of all the resources I guess. Then the strings will be updated on the emulator.</p>

							<p>I encountered the same issue and it seems it can only be solved by uninstalling the app and installing it again … or take care of your own internationisation house keeping in a separate .js file which is likely more reliable.  You can always just read the Titanium.Locale.currentLanguage to pick the right language.</p>

							<p>Even in Titanium Studio 3.1, any changes to the strings.xml file are not taking effect until a clean build. Simply do a Project–&gt;Clean before running the app.</p>
