			<h1>Numberic Keyboards Which Allow Negative Numbers</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all-</p>
<p>Does anyone know of a keyboard for iOS which allows for the input of negative numbers via the &#39;-&#39; symbol, without using the full alphanumeric keypad?  I am implementing a numeric keypad currently, but this allow for standard floats, but I need users to enter positive and negative numbers, and I was not sure if there was a simplified iOS keypad for numerics with the negative symbol?  I&#39;d rather not need to implement a validator on the textfield if at all possible.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.<br>Chris</p>

										<p><p>I can definitely add it with the standard keyboard:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">  <span class="hljs-attribute">keyboardType</span>: <span class="hljs-string">  KEYBOARD_DEFAULT;</span>
</code></pre><p>…the only issue with this is this give alpha characters as well, and since I am looking to only do numerics, I was looking for something easier for the user, numeric only, with the - character…just wasn&#39;t sure if it existed…</p>

										<p><p>that actually may get me closer…just saw that in the Kitchen sink…still gives a bit more complex a keyboard than I would like with the math chars, but at least no alpha chars within it.</p>

										<p><p>No keyboard types provide a numeric presentation of keys plus the minus (or even the signs like a calc).  Stephens original suggestion of a toolbar with the key(s) you need is the closest you will get.</p>
<p>Always been annoying we cannot have a custom keyboard - ideally just a second page by toggling the blank button on the number pad (period on decimal pad)</p>

										<p><p>ok, do your standard numeric, have a button bar (i use one because i like a done button on my numeric keyboards) that has a button with the minus symbol on it. in the event of the minus button, take the value of your textField and append the - char.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks all…yeah..is a tad annoying…I am scouring the Apple boards as well, and alot of developers are looking for similar functionality.  Seems fairly basic.  I may do the numeric and append as Stephen suggested…will play with some ideas.</p>
<p>Thanks all again.</p>
