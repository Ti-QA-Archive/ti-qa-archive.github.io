			<h1>The Android splash-screen image seems to stay on the heap</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I created a Titanium Mobile &quot;Single Window Application&quot; project, and replaced the default.png file with one of my own.  The new PNG image size is 320x480.  I built the project using Titanium SDK 2.1.3GA, and loaded it onto my Samsung Galaxy S3 phone, running Android OS 4.0.4.</p>
<p>After running the application (which does nothing other than display a single window that states &quot;Welcome to Titanium!&quot;), I used DDMS to create a heap dump, converted it, and viewed it in Eclipse Memory Analyzer.</p>
<p>The memory analyzer showed a large bitmap on the heap, which had a size (in bytes) that was exactly 16 times the number of pixels in my splash screen PNG.  I then replaced default.png with another PNG of a different size, re-ran the test, this time making sure to force some garbage collections via the memory analyzer after the app had fully loaded.  The memory analyzer again showed a bitmap that was exactly 16 times the number of pixels in the differently-sized PNG.</p>
<p>While I&#39;m curious why the size of the bitmap on the heap is 16x the number of pixels in the original image (I don&#39;t know where 16 comes from, and I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s not 16x the number of pixels in the scaled-to-fit-the-whole-screen image), I&#39;m more curious about why the bitmap doesn&#39;t appear to be removed from the heap after the application has loaded.</p>
<p>I ran this same test using one of my applications which does things that are a bit more complicated than displaying a single window, and found the same result…  a bitmap which appears to be the splash screen is never cleared off the heap.  This obviously becomes an issue as my app needs more of the heap.</p>
<p>Any information on how to clear the splash screen off the heap would be very appreciated.  Thanks.</p>

							<p>Indeed it does. It is attached to the application container.</p>
<p>This can be observed if YOUR first created window is lightweight and you click the back button you will be at the application container&#x2F;window.</p>
