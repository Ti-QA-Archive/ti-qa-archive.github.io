			<h1>App on app store doesnt work</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I recently updated my app on the app store, everything seemed to go well and it was approved on the first try. Now however it doesn&#39;t work, when I press certain buttons nothing happens etc.</p>
<p>It worked fine in both the simulator and when I tested it on my devices. So my questions is;</p>
<p>What could be the reason for this? Does the code alter between the distrubution build and the test build and if so, can I test the dist build easily wihtout uploading it to the app store?</p>

							<p>Did you try the app on the device using USB cable? </p>
<p>This is what I do, I upload the generated .apk file from build folder one of my website and then download it from there on to the device. app behaves as close to as it can without uploading it to the device.</p>
<p>Let us know if this works.</p>

										<p><p>This method also works for iphone by installing the .ipa file through itunes then syncing with your iphone. You&#39;ll need an AdHoc distribution profile first though.</p>

							<p>The code does alter between test build and a distribution build, the best way to test is to build for distribution but instead of uploading to the app store, get the .ipa file from your build iphone-release folder and install to your device through itunes. You&#39;ll need an AdHoc distribution profile first, which you&#39;ll need to drag into itunes before the app.</p>

							<p>For iPhone you can do a ad-hoc distribution, you need to upload a .plist which has a link towards the .ipa file. This way you can test you app without cables etc. You go to the link where the .plist is, this will redirect towards the .ipa and install on your phone.</p>
<p>You should try this for sure.</p>
