			<h1>Pro Subscription for 1 Month, then Indie thereafter?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m very excited about the new subscriptions just announced.  I will ultimately go on the Indie plan. But, I&#39;ve been fighting with a problem for 2 weeks and have run out of options, therefore needing the support offered in the Pro subscription.</p>
<p>I&#39;m thinking of going on the Pro subscription for 1 month and then moving to the Indie plan.   I suppose one down-side to that is losing the 30% off option that is only available until 5&#x2F;31.</p>
<p>Also, I&#39;m wondering if the support staff is going to buried now with all of the new products being released and new subscriptions offered.</p>
<p>Any recommendations?</p>

							<p>As I read the pricing options, Pro is only available as a yearly subscription for $2397 (which works out to about $199&#x2F;month).  The India is available either monthly ($49) or annual ($499) but with a option for $399 if licensed by 5&#x2F;31.  (Or the Pro at $1910 by 5&#x2F;31)</p>

										<p><p>Thank you, I missed that. Since I&#39;m not willing to spend $1910 to solve this problem, I probably won&#39;t even purchase the Indie product now and instead spend my time finding a different development product. I&#39;m willing to pay for support, but this arrangement is terrible, nevermind that Titanium is crashing w&#x2F;o any error messages, which leads me to believe this is a bug in Titanium as opposed to my code.  With all of the new subscription options, I&#39;m still left without any viable options.</p>

										<p><p>Yes I have and one person provided some useful tips, but Titianium is still crashing without any error message or clue as to what is causing my crash.</p>
<p>I&#39;m really not looking for Titanium Support to provide any debugging or general guidance.  Just want to know why this product is crashing so I can figure out a workaround.</p>

							<p>Hi, I read your post about your problem. I can work with you to fix it for $199: I estimate I&#39;d be able to do it alone in a little over two hours, which makes it worth my time. Multi-threaded programming is complex and it&#39;s possible that your code is pushing a lower api past its specification. I believe it&#39;s best to go with well worn design patterns for this kind of work.</p>
<p>I&#39;d re-write and partly re-architect the logic with you:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Not start&#x2F;stop the timer, and not create new temp timers continuously. A design pattern for this multi-threaded scenario is to check a flag variable within the thread loop, which is never stopped.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I&#39;d examine switching from a pull scheme to a push scheme. </p>
</li>
<li><p>I&#39;d only allow the threaded loop to fire off a new http request once the previous one has returned.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A great reference for this kind of multi-threaded programming is <em>Concurrent Programming in Java: Design Principles and Patterns</em>.</p>
