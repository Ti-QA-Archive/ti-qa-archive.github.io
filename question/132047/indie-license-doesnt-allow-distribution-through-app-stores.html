		<section>
			<p>I am considering using Titanium Mobile but am concerned about the Indie Edition Agreement at http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;agreements&#x2F;indie-edition-agreement-2011-11-10&#x2F;. It states:</p>
<p>&quot;Customer understands and agrees that under no circumstances will Customer re-sell, re-distribute or re-package any portions of the Products, including without limitation, the portions of the Products included in the Applications, to another third-party. <strong>For the avoidance of doubt, redistribution of the Applications in a third-party application marketplace (such as Apple iTunes) is expressly prohibited.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Applications&quot; is defined as &quot;the software application products that Customer will develop using the Products&quot; so it appears Appcelerator is saying that I would not be permitted to sell applications I build using Titanium Mobile through the App Store or Android Market.</p>
<p>Can somebody from Appcelerator please explain this? Nothing else on the Appcelerator website suggests that commercial distribution of an app you develop using Titanium Mobile is forbidden so I&#39;m hoping this is a misunderstanding!</p>

							<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>There is a problem with the license terms on the site being out of date.  We&#39;re working to correct ALL of these documents to reflect the latest terms, but make no mistake: we&#39;re committed to providing the core SDK with a free, unrestricted license as we always have.  We&#39;ll be publishing a formal clarification and updates to those docs ASAP.</p>

							<p>That&#39;s strange, I can only find this line:</p>
<p>&quot;For the avoidance of doubt, redistribution of the Applications in a third-party application marketplace (such as Apple iTunes) is expressly <strong>granted</strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>It says &quot;granted&quot; for me, not &quot;prohibited&quot;.</p>

										<p><p>Well this is getting interesting.</p>
<p>Following my question today somebody has changed the terms! The February 9 Google Cache shows that distribution through app stores was &quot;prohibited&quot;:</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webcache.googleusercontent.com&#x2F;search?q=cache%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.appcelerator.com%2Fcompany%2Fagreements%2Findie-edition-agreement-2011-11-10%2F&amp;pbx=1&amp;oq=cache%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.appcelerator.com%2Fcompany%2Fagreements%2Findie-edition-agreement-2011-11-10%2F</p>
<p>Also, I found an older version of the agreement which had &quot;granted&quot;:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;agreements&#x2F;indie-edition-license-2011-03-07&#x2F;</p>
<p>Changing the terms around the ability to submit Titanium Mobile apps to app stores is a big deal and I can&#39;t think that the changes from &quot;granted&quot; to &quot;prohibited&quot; and now back to &quot;granted&quot; were accidental. </p>
<p>Can somebody from Appcelerator explain what&#39;s going on? If I purchase an Indie subscription, can I submit my Apps to app stores? If so are there guarantees that this won&#39;t change?</p>

										<p><p>I <em>assume</em> there was a typo or something; though obviously you&#39;d think it would be pretty important to get &quot;granted&quot; or &quot;prohibited&quot; right.</p>
<p>You can&#39;t change a published (and it&#39;s versioned) licence agreement, so once we confirm which it&#39;s supposed to be we can use that going forward.</p>

										<p><p>Well somebody <em>did</em> change the license agreement. Hopefully Appcelerator will explain what&#39;s going on.</p>
