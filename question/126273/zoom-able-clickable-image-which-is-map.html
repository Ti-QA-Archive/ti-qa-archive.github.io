							<p>To keep this as one image you would need to re-calculate your sections (polygons) on each zoom action.  Assuming you are using a ScrollView it would be the scale event.</p>
<p>Another way might be to have the initial image that is not zoomable and handle each section as an overlay that allows the user to drill into it. You see alot of flash based maps do this. It simplifies the calculations needed. We&#39;ve done this and it seems to be the easiest approach.</p>
<p>Another option might be the openGL module.</p>
