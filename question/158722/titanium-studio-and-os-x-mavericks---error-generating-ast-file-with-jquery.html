			<h1>Titanium Studio and OS X Mavericks - Error generating AST file with jQuery</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi</p>
<p>I&#39;ve just updated to OS X Mavericks and updated to Titanium Studio 3.1.4.201310152018 as recommended on the Appcelerator blog. I&#39;m building an Alloy app which uses jQuery to create charts in a webView and I&#39;m now getting an error when compiling my app:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[WARN] :   : <span class="hljs-keyword">ERROR</span>: Unexpected character <span class="hljs-comment">'' [jquery.1.9.js:5,28407]</span>
[<span class="hljs-keyword">ERROR</span>] :  <span class="hljs-keyword">Error</span> generating AST <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> <span class="hljs-string">"/Volumes/IT_Department/Design/_team/James/THW-IOS-App-Local/Resources/jquery.1.9.js"</span>
[<span class="hljs-keyword">ERROR</span>] :  Unexpected character <span class="hljs-comment">''</span>
[<span class="hljs-keyword">ERROR</span>] :  line <span class="hljs-number">5</span>, column <span class="hljs-number">28407</span>, position <span class="hljs-number">92629</span>
[<span class="hljs-keyword">ERROR</span>] :  Alloy compiler failed
</code></pre><p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a need for any code snippets here as all my views, styles and controllers are compiling fine, it&#39;s just any third party JS files I have in my &quot;lib&quot; folder. These files were not causing any errors before I updated my software, so it must be related to the new update. Has anyone else seen this? I think it might be related to JS linting but I don&#39;t know how to modify this. Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>James</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>James, this is a problem I have also experienced as so far no solution.  I have created a JIRA ticket for the problem - I strongly suggest you login in and watch the ticket for updates.</p>
<p>Having done lots of tests - this is NOT a problem with the code you are supplying - but a problem with the way the alloy process of optimising the files is working.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m looking into it. To be fair, this is specific to Mavericks, not Alloy per se. There has not been a change in Alloy that has caused this issue, but apparently something specific to Mavericks is causing the issue. I would suggest to any who have not already, don&#39;t upgrade if you are using Alloy until I can work on the ticket logged by malcolm above.</p>

										<p><p>@Tony - my point is that it only fails on Alloy apps - &quot;Classic&quot; apps are not affected.  So the experience is Alloy apps.  Not blaming your great Alloy work.</p>

										<p><p>Hey guys, do me a favor, try to compile your apps from the command line. </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">alloy compile <span class="hljs-comment">--config platform=ios</span>
</code></pre><p>See if that works. This will help me identify if its an alloy issue or perhaps something specific to studio. We&#39;ve had a couple people so far that can&#39;t reproduce so I&#39;ll need to lean on your guys to help me get to the bottom of it.</p>

										<p><p>James, are you building on a network drive? This was a recent revelation in troubleshooting Malcolm&#39;s situation. If you could respond in the ticket that would be great.</p>
