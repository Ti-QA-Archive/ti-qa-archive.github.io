			<h1>Titanium 3.1.2 + Kitchen Sink + iOS 7 build error</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>When I run Kitchen Sink on Xcode 5 with iOS Beta 5, I get the following error:</p>
<p>&#39;Could not find the file app.js&#39;</p>
<p>This didn&#39;t happen with Titanium 3.1.1. So, how can I get Kitchen Sink running with 3.1.2, to try out iOS 7 controls? The Blog said, 3.1.2 provides iOS 7 support.</p>
<p>Before someone tells me that iOS 7 is under NDA, this doesn&#39;t apply. It&#39;s a Titanium issue.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Whilst I do not know why the Kitchen Sink app is not working for you, but I can guess why you are receiving the error you are currently seeing.</p>
<p>This problem occurred a few minor versions back, it only occurred on apps compiled for devices though - you have not said specifically if you are a simulator or physical device.</p>
<p>Either way, previously the problem occurred due to errors in the code that failed to minify during the compile process.  This is very possible with KS as the app has been built over years and has been updated often so could easily have unforeseen errors.</p>
<p>The errors that killed code before were often trailing commas in the object definition - the last property entry had a comma afterwards which is very wrong.  </p>
<p>Ti SDK 3.1.2 does have preliminary support for iOS7 so you should be able to start your initial testing, but obviously only a limited set of things will work as iOS7, the rest will work as before.</p>
<p>It would be worth checking <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;">jira</a> to see if the problem has been logged, if not log the error and it will be added to the queue.</p>

										<p><p>I am just going to add this as the best answer. The issue is gone since Xcode 5 GM. I guess the betas didn&#39;t play along nicely. Kitchen Sink is running ok, most parts at least. Still some minor glitches but nothing major.</p>
