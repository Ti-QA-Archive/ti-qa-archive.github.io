			<h1>Simulator session times out</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi. I hope somebody can help. I have an app that was working fine in Titanium when I last tested it which was about 3 months ago. Anyway, I started working on it again last night, opened Titanium, updated it with all the latest updates and SDK&#39;s, etc. I then opened Xcode and made sure it was all up to date. So everything is using the latest version.</p>
<p>I then restarted my computer just in case.</p>
<p>I then tried to run my app (only for iphone or ipad) in the iphone simulator (I changed the tiapp.xml file so it is using the lastest SDK) but continually got this error message saying the simulator session times out. I then tried to create a new project (based on tab template). I made no changes and just tried to run it in simulator but it also timed out. Below is the error message:</p>
<p>Session could not be started: Error Domain=DTiPhoneSimulatorErrorDomain Code=2 &quot;Simulator session timed out.&quot; UserInfo=0x102803ea0 {NSLocalizedDescription=Simulator session timed out.}</p>
<p>As I say, Titanium was working perfectly 3 months ago but now that I have updated it, I can&#39;t test anything. Help please?</p>

							<p>I think you have already restarted your system still I will suggest one more time restart your system as that is the only solution few have suggested.</p>

							<p>Its a good idea to regularly delete the emulator you are using and let the build process recreate it.</p>

							<p>Hi all. Thanks for the help. </p>
<p>I managed to get the new application I created running by running it in Xcode manually. I then went back to my old application (that ran fine prior to updating Titanium) and also ran it manually in Xcode and it now gets to the splash screen before the simulator quits. The error showing now is:</p>
<p>bootstrap_look_up failed (44e)<br>wait_fences: failed to receive reply: 10004003<br>server did not accept client registration 68<br>Terminating in response to SpringBoard&#39;s termination.<br>[INFO] Application has exited from Simulator</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure if anybody can help with this error? If not, I am going to have to rebuild the application as a new project - very time consuming.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
