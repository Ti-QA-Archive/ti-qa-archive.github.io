			<h1>iPod Touch crash - Iphone is fine... LOW MEMORY</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Recently loaded my app onto an iPod Touch 8GB (new ipod) and it is crashing. There is no warning dialog, it just quits the app.  The log in Xcode displays &#39;Low Memory&#39; for these events.</p>
<p>The window being opened that seems to crash is mainly a scrollView map.  It loads several PNG files to piece together the map regions. </p>
<p>In watching the memory usage in the OSx activity monitor, the &#39;Real Memory Size&#39; jumps to around 30MB.  There are several other memory values in Activity monitor, but I don&#39;t know what one is accurate or which one is important. </p>
<p>I have been testing my app on my iPhone 3GS successfully for a while now, and the app does NOT crash on iphone or iPad.</p>
<p>Does anyone else have this problem?  Is there a memory difference with the iPod and iPhone?  Is there an established RAM limit for the devices?  </p>
<p>I can also not find any information about memory management for Titanium. Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

										<p><p>it does crash occasionally , but when dealing with the camera and not the map.</p>
<p>i&#39;ve also had issues with opening of modal windows on the device and it crashes, but just fine on the simulator.</p>

							<p>Does anyone have experience submitting an app that was crashing on the iPod?  Will Apple reject an app for that reason?  </p>
<p>It seems like I hear about a lot of apps purchased from the app store frequently crashing on the iPod. So that would lead me to believe they would not reject such an app.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m also getting crashes reported on ipod touch when opening a window using the modal dissolve transition (modal: true, modalTransitionStyle: Ti.UI.iPhone.MODAL_TRANSITION_STYLE_CROSS_DISSOLVE, modalStyle: Ti.UI.iPhone.MODAL_PRESENTATION_FULLSCREEN) and then doing some animation to display a form.  Haven&#39;t seen a log yet.  Using Ti 1.4.0 with iPhone 4.0.1 SDK but the ipod touch is on 3.1.3.  Will let you know if I figure anything out.  I suspect it&#39;s also a memory issue.</p>
