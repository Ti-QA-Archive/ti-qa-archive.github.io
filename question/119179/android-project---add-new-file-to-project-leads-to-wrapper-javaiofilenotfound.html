			<h1>Android project - add new file to project leads to &#34;Wrapper java.io.FileNotFound&#34;</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, </p>
<p>First of all I use Mobile SDK 1.6.2 and the Titanium Studio preview…</p>
<p>I have a simple project, with 2 windows, where each window is created using a separate &quot;js&quot; file : &quot;win1.js&quot;m &quot;win2.js&quot;..</p>
<p>Everything worked fine on Android, until I renamed these files…….</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know the reason, but the build &amp; run in emulator did not take into account the renaming, and each time I call to these files I get a </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Wrapper java<span class="hljs-class">.io</span><span class="hljs-class">.FileNotFoundException</span>:
Resources/window1<span class="hljs-class">.js</span>
...
</code></pre><p>When I go to the build folder (project&#x2F;build&#x2F;android&#x2F;bin&#x2F;assets&#x2F;Resources), the renamed files are not there…</p>
<p>How to make the renaming automatically effective ??<br>Rebuilding index, clean &amp; build does not work…</p>
<p>In fact the project &amp; application is still expecting the old file names (&quot;win1.js&quot; instead of &quot;window.js&quot;)…</p>
<p>Is there a project packager where we can include the renamed file as new file ??</p>
<p>It is stupid, but when I copy &amp; paste the renamed file by myself, and relaunch the app on the emulator everything works fine….(but it will not take into account the modifications on the project of course…</p>
<p>Anyone has an idea ??</p>
<p>Is this a bug ??</p>
<p>How to do efficiently refactoring so that the project &quot;understands&quot; these modifications…??</p>

							<p>Hi Abbdoul</p>
<p>Why explain your code, when you can simply include it here, or paste it to <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;">pastebin</a>?</p>
<p>What OS are you using?</p>
<p>Would you make sure this is the procedure you have followed to force a full rebuild?…</p>
<p>Delete the contents of the project&#39;s <code>build&amp;#x2F;android</code> directory, then touch the tiapp.xml file:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">cd /path/<span class="hljs-keyword">to</span>/root/<span class="hljs-keyword">of</span>/project
touch tiapp.xml
</code></pre><p>The above command will work for OSX and *nix.</p>
<p>If this does not resolve the issue, perform the above procedure again, and see if the project builds correctly if you use Titanium Developer rather than Titanium Studio.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

										<p><p>Hi Paul…</p>
<p>Unfortunately your procedure did not help…Titanium Developer simply says &quot;Tiapp.xml unchanged&quot; and skips the class generation, and builds the same project without my renamed file…</p>
<p>How to include it in the building process ??</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I have never seen a situation where touching the <code>tiapp.xml</code> file does not result in a full rebuild.</p>
<p>When you run the <code>touch</code> command, would you confirm that the modified timestamp of <code>tiapp.xml</code> has been updated?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>Hi, </p>
<p>Thanks for your quick reply ! :)</p>
<p>The reason I didn&#39;t paste my code is that the problem was not linked to it…</p>
<p>It is a problem of renaming a file &quot;*.js&quot; which is then no more included in the build directory of android app…</p>
<p>I am using Mac OS X 10.6.7..</p>
<p>For the rebuild I was in fact also cleaning the android directory…</p>
<p>Therefore this procedure did not resolve the problem…</p>
<p>Again at each rebuild (after cleaning build&#x2F;android) the renamed file does not appear within the build….</p>
<p>I will now try the build with the Titanium Developer, and post the result here in a moment.</p>

										<p><p>Abbdoul, please don&#39;t answer your own questions, otherwise you will not be able to close the thread when the issue is resolved. Also, it makes the conversation very difficult for others to follow. Use the comment facility instead.  Thanks</p>
