			<p>Hello,<br>I have placed all the required icon files under resources&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;  with the appropriate names as given in the guide :<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Icons_and_Splash_Screens</p>
<p>I have verified that the icon files are there and they are of the exact dimensions . Still after publish i get the error that the required icon files are missing. I have triple check all the steps, and files. Seems perfect to me. </p>
<p>Any idea what should be the problem.</p>

							<p>You are most likely giving the files the wrong names. To check what files you need to have, and what names you need I would suggest <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ticons.fokkezb.nl&#x2F;">this</a> excellent tool</p>

										<p><p>Even I ended up with this problem last week, it was an app created a while ago and so the icon requirements had not been accounted for.</p>
<p>I also used the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ticons.fokkezb.nl&#x2F;">TIcons</a> tool and it recreated all the icons and splash pages as I needed them. </p>
<p>By choice I left the <strong>Fix</strong> option on which uses the Apple icons naming schemes instead of the older Titanium one.  You must remove any icons using the old naming scheme if you leave this option enabled.</p>
<p>My app is now in the store.</p>

<p>Now how is the app&#x2F;assect to be used, and what about the resource folder. </p>

										<p><p>Yes it is on the page;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Writes to app&#x2F;assets instead of Resources.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If you know what <strong>app&#x2F;assets</strong> means then you are using Titanium with the Alloy framework.  It appears you do not know what it means then you would uncheck this option.</p>
<p>Titanium with the Alloy framework has many new folders and does not use the <em>resources</em> folder directly.  Instead imagery and other files are places inside this folder only.</p>
<p>You are clearly not using Titanium with the Alloy framework for your app, so you are using what is now called &quot;Titanium without the Alloy framework&quot;.  This places all source files inside the <em>resources</em> folder.  So when you answer that question.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Writes to app&#x2F;assets instead of Resources.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>You say <strong>NO</strong>, this way it using the resources folder.</p>
<p>BTW using or not using the Alloy framework is a CHOICE and one you make at the start of a project, do not think anything here is meant to say you have done anything wrong - you haven&#39;t.  In case you are wondering &quot;should I use that Alloy framework&quot; - then the answer is Yes, but on your next app - NOT this one.  There is no benefit to making that change now when you are about to push the app into the store.  You may decide later benefit from the framework in this app - but expect a lot of work first.  The Alloy framework saves you lots and lots of time - but only if you start a project with it.</p>

							<p>I ran into this problem as well and used TIcons from Maclomb&#39;s suggestion above to determine what the missing images were. These are the icon files and dimensions that I was missing in Resources&#x2F;iphone:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>appicon-60.png</strong> (60x60)</li>
<li><strong>appicon-60@2x.png</strong> (120x120)</li>
<li><strong>appicon-60@3x.png</strong> (180x180)</li>
<li><strong>appicon-72.png</strong> (72x72)</li>
<li><strong>appicon-72@2x.png</strong> (144x144)</li>
<li><strong>appicon-76.png</strong> (76x76)</li>
<li><strong>appicon-76@2x.png</strong> (152x152)</li>
</ul>
