							<div><p>Hi Nikunj,<br>thanks for anwsering.<br>I&#39;m trying to figure out how to create an app that detects your position in indoor areas such as a building. I know there are different kinds of methods to use a wifi network or recording the map but I&#39;m trying to get a better and more informed opinion about those choices and other ones that could work better.<br>An example is the American Museum of Natural History Explorer App that detects where you are and guides you inside the museum</p>
<p>Regards<br>Matias</p>

							<p>For anyone still looking for an indoor navigation&#x2F;positioning solution, we decided to create our own indoor navigation system for our company Movin Software.</p>
<p>We offer an advanced API for showing indoor maps and navigating within buildings. We also offer mapping tools which allow users to update the maps themselves (which is ofter faster than sending an update request to another company). Lastly we have developed our own indoor positioning technology which integrates with our mapping software.</p>
<p>We are planning to release our tools for other developers soon. You can however always contact me if you have any questions. The best way to contact me is by sending an email to info@movinsoftware.nl</p>

							<p>Well off the top of my head, geolocation distance filter will give you a decent read but might not be accurate enough for you. I would say based off your example of the American Museum of History a building of that size uses multiple wifi stations. That being said you could read the &quot;address&quot; of the wifi station the person is connected to and base info off that. Each station can have a different address and the phone will auto connect showing the user closest to said wifi station. good luck</p>

							<p>Matias, in general, you cannot get &quot;fine&quot; location data from inside a building, because your phone can&#39;t &quot;see&quot; the GPS satellites.  However, there is such a thing as &quot;Differential GPS&quot;, which uses ground-based transmitters to supplement the satellite-based transmitters, but that is a little off-topic.</p>
<p>I looked at the American Museum of Natural History app&#39;s demo video.  They talk about &quot;turn-by-turn&quot; directions, but they show the user pressing a button at each turn.  You will also notice that the GPS indicator is <strong>not</strong> lit up on the demo device, even when they talk about &quot;pinpointing&quot; your current location in the museum.  This app is <strong>not</strong> tracking a &quot;fine&quot; (GPS-based) location.</p>
<p>They have wifi all over that museum.  What I think is going on here is that phone will attach to whatever wifi is strongest, and the individual access points in that museum are in known locations, like major hallway intersections.  The app is reading which access point is being used, and assuming an approximate location from that.  You can see that the blue halo of approximate position is large in the demo video.</p>

							<p>Which platforms are you developing this for?</p>
<p>iOS is a bit tricky, as you aren&#39;t allowed to publish apps that make use of wifi signal strength measurements (which is a common way to do indoor positioning on the device). As Cory mentioned, you could also do the positioning calculation on the infrastructure hardware. I think <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;radar.oreilly.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;10&#x2F;indoor-navigation.html">Meridian</a> used some specialized <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cisco.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;US&#x2F;products&#x2F;ps9742&#x2F;index.html">Cisco routers</a> for their system in the Museum of Natural History.</p>
<p>For Android, there are a few options for radio-based indoor positioning. I&#39;ve heard good things about the indoor positioning API from <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;qubulus.com">Qubulus</a>. Eventually, Google may open up their indoor mapping &amp; positioning API, but it&#39;s still early.</p>
