			<p>I downloaded it, but I can&#39;t figure it out from there. I opened console and couldn&#39;t find the file and I am getting really frustrated. How do I add it like a workspace as i did with Cocos2D. Please someone help. Thanks - Brandon P.S. I am using Xcode 4.5 but I also have the Dev. Preview and I am on Mountain Lion, Sorry for being a pain, only have worked with cocos2d and nothing else really. I wanna make a IM app without XMPP cause i don&#39;t wanna use 3rd party like Jabber or Facebook, so i am trying this. Thanks again in advanced</p>

										<p><p>I do not understand what you ant to achieve with the console.  Please elaborate.</p>
<p>If you are looking to use Titanium, why would you try to use it the same way as you have used others in the past.</p>
<p>Titanium can do everything for you in the development process, you can use xcode to build a Titanium created project, but there really is no need.</p>

										<p><p>Yes there is a need because i am remaking an open source project and it was designed in Xcode, all i want to know is ho to install titanium as that was used to build it</p>

										<p><p>If the app was &quot;built using titanium&quot; it would not have been &quot;designed in Xcode&quot;.</p>
<p>If the files are in fact titanium source code, simple install (as mentioned above) and use the titanium <strong>import</strong> menu.  You will need to change the SDK reference to the latest one as long as the source code is not very old.  If it is then you will need to grab an old sdk from the appcelerator site or tweak it yourself.</p>

										<p><p>Did you just mark this as the answer and then unmark it once I gave you more info? Strange, disingenuous.</p>
<p>You are really not giving up any real amount of information that I can try to help you with in my spare time for no financial reward.  You are lucky I have more persistence than you have details.</p>
<p>So you want to use the module <strong>TiSMSDialog</strong>.  Are than anymore words you want share? This still does not having anything directly to do with Xcode or the console.</p>
<p>So last try; what is it about this module you cannot achieve?</p>
<ul>
<li>unable to add to your project?</li>
<li>added to project but no idea how to run it?</li>
<li>added to project and worked out how to use it but not working in the simulator?</li>
<li>something else entirely?</li>
</ul>
<p>Back to you, you have me for 20 more minutes tonight, otherwise tomorrow - as long as I get some more details.</p>

										<p><p>Follow up, if you are using XCODE to create your app and want to use this module in that project - then that WILL NOT work.</p>

										<p><p>Are you getting charged by the word - when you add comments here?  This is the only reason I can think of that you would provide SO little information in order to get HELP for yourself.  For example you have so far barely answered any requests for information so I can actually help you.</p>
<ul>
<li>So far I have still not worked out if you are writing your app in XCODE or titanium?</li>
<li>if in titanium; are you simply struggling to get the module to work in your app?</li>
<li>if in Xcode; are you trying to use this module in your Xcode app.</li>
</ul>
<p>Answer THESE questions.  From this I can guide you, and add details.</p>
