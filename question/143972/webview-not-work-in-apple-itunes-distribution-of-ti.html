			<h1>WebView not work in Apple iTunes Distribution of Ti</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>My application uses a WebView to show a chart in JS&#x2F;HTML, that I believe is also the choice of many other Titanium developers.</p>
<p>The chart displayed fine while running the application from Titanium IDE in both simulator and devices.</p>
<p>The chart also displayed fine while exporting IPA and install the application into devices.</p>
<p>The chart still displayed fine even if I open the Xcode project generated by Ti with Xcode, and then run the application from within XCode IDE, though there were over 800 files.</p>
<p>However, when I published the application as Apple iTunes Distribution, the chart disappeared.</p>
<p>The same issue happened while publishing as Apple Ad Hoc_Enterprise Distribution.</p>
<p>I understand that Titanium did many different in between &#39;debug&#39; and &#39;released&#39; version of the application, but it brought me much pain since I found I can hardly do anything for such a &#39;BLACK BOX&#39;</p>
<p>Any suggestion would be appreciated.</p>

							<div><p>I had finally managed to find out the reason: when publishing the release version, Titanium compiled and optimized all the Javascript files, as long as the file extentions were js, regardless of whether the javascript file was for Ti or for html page in WebView. When the js file for the WebView was optimized, the js chart surely could not work.<br>The solution was simple: change the extention of the javascript file rather than .js.</p>
