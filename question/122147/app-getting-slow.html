			<h1>app getting slow</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve recently finished develop an iPad app, but still didn&#39;t submit it to the appstore.<br>The app is working flawlessly on the emulator, but when I run it no the iPad itself, it works fine at the beginning, but the more I use it, the more slow it gets, until it actually hangs.</p>
<p>Some details about the app -<br>The app downloads rss feed and displays is in a nice for to the user. I used to display the info inside webviews, but switch to regular views because I thought that this was causing my slowness, but even without webviews the app still become very slow after a few minutes of testing.</p>
<p>Thanks<br>Idan</p>

							<p>Hey Idan,<br>I&#39;m new to mobile development so I may be wrong but your problem sounds like what happens to a desktop when it does not have sufficient ram to run an application. its possible that your app is attempting to do too many things at one time for the iPad to handle it. A desktop would not run into this problem in testing unless it was over 5 or 6 years old just due to the low memory requirements for iOs apps in general.<br>Hope that helps,<br>Aaron</p>

							<p>It sounds like a memory management issue. It&#39;s hard to say where to look without seeing any code.  I believe Titanium is supposed to do general cleanup, but you might have something more than that… Perhaps too many&#x2F;frequent web requests?  unclosed database calls?  anything like that?</p>

							<p>Taking a look at it via Apple&#39;s Instruments (part of iOS SDK utilities) could give you some indication.</p>
