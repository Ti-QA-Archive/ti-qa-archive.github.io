			<h1>How to make notification eventlisteners work across multiple scheduled notifications?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am building an app that every hour, schedules  a few localnotifications through a background process.  Currently, the background process runs as designed, and the localnotifications are working.  What I need to do is to use the userInfo field of the localNotification to bring the user to a customized screen based on which notification they clicked.  In order to do that I have set up a notification eventlistener, declared within the background process.  This sometimes works, upon the first notification from when the app launches.  Clicking into the app, and I can see the app catch the event and behave as desired.  All subsequent notifications are not caught by event listeners.  The worst part is I can&#39;t even get the initial notification+eventlistener to work all the time.  I can load the app 5 times in a row and it will only work 2 or 3 times.</p>
<p>I hope this makes sense.</p>
<p>Here is some code - this is the background service that runs when the app is put in the background.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    <span class="hljs-comment">// array declaration for scheduling multiple notifications</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> notification = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">Array</span>();
        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> n = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;

    <span class="hljs-comment">// Confirms each time the bg service is launched</span>
    Ti.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">'bg service running'</span>)    

    <span class="hljs-comment">// This is how I'm catching my notification event.  This works maybe 50% on only the first notification call from the time the app launches, then never works again.</span>
    Titanium.App.iOS.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'notification'</span>,<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">e</span>)</span>{
             Ti.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">'bg event received = '</span>+ e.userInfo[<span class="hljs-string">'id'</span>]);
           alert(<span class="hljs-string">'background notification listener actually worked!'</span>);
        });

<span class="hljs-comment">// This is calling notifications from an array so it doesn't crash.  Each time bg process runs, this function is called a few times.</span>
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">scheduleconfirmation</span>(<span class="hljs-params">interval, id</span>) </span>{  
    notification[n] = Titanium.App.iOS.scheduleLocalNotification({ 
        alertBody:<span class="hljs-string">"Reminder"</span>,
        alertAction:<span class="hljs-string">"View"</span>,
        userInfo:{<span class="hljs-string">"id"</span>: id},
        date:<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">Date</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">Date</span>().getTime() + interval*<span class="hljs-number">1000</span>) 
        });           
    n++;
};

<span class="hljs-comment">// Subsequent code reaches out to web service, pulls down events, and calls the above function.  Each time it runs (hourly), it also calls Titanium.App.iOS.cancelAllLocalNotifications();</span>
</code></pre><p>I hope I&#39;ve explained this alright - its a difficult problem to explain.  To summarize, I need to be able to schedule several notifications to occur at different points in the future, and be able to catch each of those in an event listener when they occur.  </p>
<p>I am using Titanium Studio, with SDK 1.7.0 for this.  I&#39;ve tried on 1.70rc1 with no different.  There is a known bug in 1.7.1 that prevents you from calling localnotifications within a function, so I cannot use it to solve this.  I also tried a daily build of 1.7.2 but the whole thing crashed.</p>

										<p><p>No real solution here - I came to realize that my understanding of the android notifications was wrong.  Its not the same as iOS.  With iOS you schedule when an alert should occur.  With Android, the alert occurs as soon as you create it, so you need to write code to handle exactly when the alert occurs, such as with setTimeout or setInterval.  The date attribute of the scheduleLocalNotification call is only the date that gets shown on the alert and has nothing to do with when the alert is fired!</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Mike. I&#39;m working on iOS platform now. I&#39;d like to create multiple notifications once the user click a button. But it seems that only the 1st reminder works fine, and the others sometimes just don&#39;t show up. I&#39;m using Ti 1.7.2.</p>

										<p><p>Sorry - I answered a different question altogether that I thought you were asking.  I should&#39;ve paid more attention.  Anyways, yeah I never got this to work.  What I had to do was create a function that scheduled all future alerts, and each time I pop an alert, I call the function to cancel all future notifications, then call my function to schedule them again.  Its a bit of a hack but seems to work.  I cannot however get the system to do anything but just open the app - passing data into the app on the relaunch (from clicking view) does not work at all to my knowledge.  Opened a jira case for it awhile back but I don&#39;t think it got addressed.</p>

										<p><p>Well, now the local notifications work fine when the app is in background, but they never popup when the app is open. The &#39;notification&#39; event of Ti.App.iOS seems never fire. Do you have this problem, Mike?</p>

							<p>I don&#39;t know that I&#39;ve tested the alerts while the app is already open.  I don&#39;t know the answer.  The best advice I would have is to log the scheduling of each notification through Ti.App.Info() to make sure they are showing , as well as logging any point at which you are cancelling all local notifications.  Just a thought that maybe you have the cancel function being called when you are resuming the app?  Other than that sounds like a bug.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, I was using Ti.App.info() in the &#39;notification&#39; event but got nothing. That&#39;s why I thought that event may not even fire. So might be a bug.</p>
