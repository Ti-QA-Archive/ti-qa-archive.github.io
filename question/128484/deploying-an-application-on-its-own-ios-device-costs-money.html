			<h1>Deploying an application on its own iOS device costs money???</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have been developing an application with Titanium Mobile and testing on an Android device.<br>I finally got a friend&#39;s Mac and tested successfully on the iPhone emulator.<br>Now comes the time to test on an iPhone or iPad device, and… whatever which documentation I read, it seems I need to pay $99 per year to be able to deploy on a device!</p>
<p>Do I have to pay to deploy my own application on my own device?!?!<br>Or did I miss something??</p>

							<p>Just to confirm and clarify: the $99 developer account is required to become part of Apple&#39;s iOS developer program. Apple requires that you pay the $99 sort of as a sanity check so that people don&#39;t keep creating accounts on the fly to distribute apps and circumvent the submission process.</p>

										<p><p>Why do we need a sanity check to deploy our own program on our own device?<br>I agree you&#39;d better have a sanity check for applications on the market, but for personal applications, that&#39;s absurd…</p>

										<p><p>Without an account Apple couldn&#39;t limit your distribution to 99 devices, and I guess they decided that they&#39;d charge the $99 up front instead of having a two-stage process (sign up for your own device, then pay $99 to deploy to others). I&#39;m guessing that was their though process, not that it&#39;s the best solution.</p>
