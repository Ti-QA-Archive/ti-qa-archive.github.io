			<h1>Do Tizen apps get compiled as NATIVE or as ANDROID apps?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>We all know Tizen&#39;s best feature is its ability to run Android apps, and I was just curious. The Titanium implementation on Tizen, does it simply run the Android build of your app, or does it compile your project as a &#39;native&#39; Tizen app? I only ask, as the time from when you announced you were going to be adding Tizen, to when it was released was really fast! :)</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

							<p>Titanium for Tizen generates neither a &quot;native&quot; Tizen or Android app. Instead it generates a Tizen &quot;web-based&quot; app. We took the Titanium Mobile Web platform, fixed a few compatibility issues, and expose the Tizen API&#39;s so that you can build your Tizen apps using the Titanium API&#39;s. Titanium does not support Tizen&#39;s &quot;native&quot; API&#39;s.</p>

										<p><p>Hmm, thats very disappointing to say the least. No way it can really be used now then without people getting hold of your app&#39;s source code, rendering it useless for a majority of people.</p>
<p>I was going to ask if there were any plans for a real integration for real apps but I&#39;m guessing the answer is no.</p>
<p>Would it not have made sense to compile as an Android app given that Tizen supports them?</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m not a Tizen expert, but I believe Tizen does not run Android apps. Tizen has it&#39;s own native platform that I believe is derived from Bada&#39;s APIs.</p>
<p>I have yet to dig into Tizen application archives, so I can&#39;t say how secure your code is.</p>

										<p><p>Yup, the whole purpose of Tizen&#39;s existence is so that it can run native android apps without them needing to be emulated or modified in any way. The idea is that Samsung (who are the heavy weight behind Tizen) will be moving exclusively to it once its ready, and wont have the problem of people not wanting to use an empty ecosystem, as android devs will be able to run all their apps on it with ease.</p>
<p>Hopefully Titanium will provide this as an option once Tizen gets going. Realistically it needs to be in there by August to have any hope of getting decent apps into Samsung&#39;s appstore ready for launch.</p>

										<p><p>@Rick, I did some quick Googling and it appears you are correct. This was news to me, but then again, I&#39;m not working with Tizen that closely. I have no idea if that&#39;s supported by Tizen 2.0. I would keep an eye on both Titanium&#39;s Tizen platform and Tizen itself and see how this unfolds over the next couple months.</p>
