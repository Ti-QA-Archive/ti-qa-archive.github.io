			<h1>.NET Browser Config File for WebView Control</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Is there version of *.browser file for .NET which works with Titanium WebView Control.<br>I have an ASP.NET website and it is not properly rendered in the WebView Control due to the wrong browser config file. I believe it uses a default config in C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\Config\Browsers\Default.browser.</p>

							<p>The browser being used in a WebView is the default browser for whichever platform you are using. Thats going to be Safari for iOS and Chrome for Android. You didn&#39;t mention which platform you are targeting, but those would be the browser files you would need for each.</p>

							<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>I am trying to render it to WebView on IOS simulator. I was expecting that safari browser will work. However, is seems that the name of the WedView browser is Mobile Mozilla Compatible.<br>So, it cannot be mapped correctly.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, it displays correctly on iPAD and iPhone in Safari browser. The only problem is with Titanium WebView control. You can try www.reachlite.com.</p>

										<p><p>Turnaround time always depends on the severity and priority that the issue receives after its been verified as a bug. So there is no way to give a specific time frame for a resolution.</p>

										<p><p>Jira is for filing bugs only, it is not a support portal. You don&#39;t have a support package, so there is no SLA on your filed issues. If you need a 24-48 hour SLA or other premium support service, please visit our <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;support-services">Support Services</a> page.</p>
