			<h1>What exactly is Storekit.bundleIdentifier ?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m trying to use ti.storekit module, using the example app as starting point, read many docs and having tried for some time and still can&#39;t get my info of my first in-app product.</p>
<p>This question is trying to eliminate one uncertainty.<br>I&#39;m confused about what is Storekit.bundleIdentifier in the sample? </p>
<p>Is it:</p>
<p>a. The ID of my final App? or</p>
<p>b. The ID of my development profile ?</p>
<p>In development stage, the Application ID needs to match the development profile ID, which is different from the final App ID. But I&#39;m gussing that Storekit.bundleIdentifier is used by Apple to identify the In-App products so it should be the final App ID, right?</p>
<p>So should it be a. or b.?</p>
<p>Also my final App Bundle ID has an &#39;-&#39;, i.e. it&#39;s like com.company.my-id, for historical reason, I would like t keep it. Doesn&#39;t that matter?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>as for the rest of your question, not sure why you aren&#39;t using the same appID for your development and your production builds.  I truly doubt your environment is so complex that it requires such a division of development trees.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Stephen, your response seems addressed my issue. Directly or indirectly, I have to test more to confirm.</p>
<p>For iOS, I use development profile for testing, and use distribution profile for app submission. These 2 profile ID are always different per my understanding. I used this practice for all my past projects until this In-App Purchase requirement.</p>
<p>Do you mean that I could ( or even should ) use distribution profile for development? Or is it a special case for In-App testing?</p>

										<p><p>No, I am saying the app id between your production and development stay the same.<br>You are mixing the terms of id and profiles.  </p>
<p>You should be building ad-hoc builds for on device testing.  Not sure why you are dragging &#39;profiles&#39; into a question about app id.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Stephen, thanks for your patience for my confusion on things seems to be clear to you :) </p>
<p>Suppose I have app id &#39;com.company.appdistribute&#39;, which is associated with the distribution profile, and dev id &#39;com.company.appdev&#39;, such ID is also associated with my development profile. </p>
<p>I&#39;m now building directly to device for testing (using the distribution profile directly as you hinted, seems to make my in-app test work). Even if I use ad-hoc build for testing, that ad-hoc profile ID will still be different from the distribution profile ID, right? Each profile links to a unique Apple ID. For Ti project to build, the App ID. i.e. &lt;id&gt; in tiapp.xml, is required to match profile ID. That means if I build with ad-hoc profile, I need to set &lt;id&gt; to be same as App ID associated with the ad-hoc profile. And change the App ID to distribution ID when ready.</p>
<p>So to my understanding, the only way to set &lt;id&gt; in tiapp.xml to be the real final bundleidentifyer is to use distribution profile. All other profiles will have un-matching id and Ti won&#39;t build.</p>
<p>Guess I still need your help to understand why profile and app id are not related?</p>

										<p><p>I have App for company <code>Foo</code> that will be for their <code>Bar</code> product line.</p>
<p>My appId will be <code>com.foo.bar</code></p>
<p>Will register that with apple.</p>
<p>That will be whats listed in my &lt;id&gt; in tiapp.xml.</p>
<p>I will then create an adHoc provisioning profile (which is a distribution) and an App Store provisioning profile (also distribution) in the apple developer portal.</p>
<p>During development, I will push to my device using the adhoc profile (which is distribution) which allows me to test push notifications (if I&#39;v created a push profile and uploaded it to the appropriate service) and in-app purchases on my device.</p>
<p>When the time comes to send to the store, I will build with the App Store profile. App Id never changes.</p>
<p>As for development profiles, I have at max 2 that I care about which are wild cards.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">com</span>.stephenfeather.*
<span class="hljs-keyword">com</span>.featherdirect.*
</code></pre><p>These are only used for quick projects I&#39;m using for testing something out so I don&#39;t have to register an app id, ect.  Can push quick things to a device to confirm&#x2F;test&#x2F;reject as needed.</p>
<p>Any other developer profiles are usually created by xCode and are disposable as far as I am concerned.</p>

										<p><p>As for apology, don&#39;t worry. Apple has made this extremely complicated.<br>HOWEVER, with that complication, comes the assurance that if something goes wrong, you can log in, reset your certs, and start over.</p>
<p>Heaven forbid something go wrong with your Android keystores <strong>:(</strong></p>

										<p><p>Stephen, that was a great illustration by example and mind cleaner for me. I shall try this approach in my next project. Highly appreciated :)</p>
<p>I share the same :( on Android keystores, not long ago. Had to embarrassingly notify users to switch to new app … luckily there&#39;s only a few hundred users at that moment …</p>
