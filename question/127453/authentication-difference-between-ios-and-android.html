			<h1>Authentication difference between iOS and Android?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m developing my first ever application in Titanium and have hit a bit of a hurdle.  My application gets a number of data feeds from a back-end IBM Domino server.  When my application launches the user logs in with a username and password, these are then passed across to a login form on that Domino server along with a re-direct URL using a createHttpClient POST call. That&#39;s the only time I ever pass across username and password to the server and I don&#39;t ever need to deal with any cookies or anything.  On a number of tabs I display data from a number of data feeds from that back-end server and all these feeds work absolutely fine (in iOS AND Android).  These data feeds are simple GET requests that return JSON data which I then display in TableViews.</p>
<p>Today I added a couple of new tabs to the application which display webviews with remote URLs. The URL on each webview is a hook into our IBM Connections Server.  We use single-sign on so that that initial login to our Domino server that the user does on application start-up also works for these tabs as well (I guess there must be some sort of cookie caching going on in Titanium here just like a normal web browser because once that initial login is performed, I never have to pass across any credentials again?).  </p>
<p>Anyway, my problem is that these two new tabs don&#39;t work on Android. On iOS they work perfectly but on Android the two tabs present me with the IBM Connections Login Screen.  So when it comes to webviews, presumably there is a significant difference between what&#39;s happening in iOS and what&#39;s happening with Android (at least in terms of authentication) ?  (Apologies if anything I have said here is daft but as I said it&#39;s my first app).</p>

							<div><p>Ok, I hope this explains a little bit what I&#39;m going on about :-)</p>
<p>I will post a few portions of code.</p>
<p>Initially the user authenticates with the back-end Domino server:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var loginRequest = Ti.Network.createHTTPClient({
  enableKeepAlive:false
});

var parms = {
  Username: _un,
  Password: _pw  
};           

loginRequest.open(<span class="hljs-string">"<span class="hljs-keyword">POST</span>"</span>,<span class="hljs-string">"https://myserver/names.nsf?login"</span>);
</code></pre><p>then, for the various tabs I have some calls to my server to retrieve data in JSON format such as this one:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">xhr.open(<span class="hljs-string">"<span class="hljs-keyword">GET</span>"</span>,<span class="hljs-string">"https://myserver/getData.xsp"</span>);
</code></pre><p>All of this works <strong>100% ok in both iOS AND Android</strong>.  The user logs in when the app starts and all the tabs show their data.</p>
<p>Today I added a new tab which, instead of retrieving data via JSON like the existing tabs, needs to open a URL on our IBM Connections Server (which is setup for Single-Signon with our Domino server so that once you are logged into one, you are logged into the other).  My code for this tab is this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">win</span> = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
    title : <span class="hljs-string">"Connections"</span>,
});

webView = Titanium.UI.createWebView({
url : <span class="hljs-string">"https://connectionsServer/mobile/homepage/StatusUpdates"</span>
});

<span class="hljs-keyword">win</span>.add(webView);
</code></pre><p>Now, <strong>on iOS this also works absolutely fine</strong>.  When you click on the tab, the page from the Connections server is shown (as it should).</p>
<p>However, with Android, the Connections server Login Page is shown (asking for username and password).  So my question, I suppose, is <strong>why, when using the URL based webview, does everything work ok in iOS but not Android?  (and is there an easy solution!!)</strong>  Thanks for reading.</p>

							<p>I <em>think</em> the difference between iOS and Android behaviour is as follows. iOS uses a shared cookie store, so when you login using the HTTPClient, the cookie (ie your session) is stored and reused when you use the WebView. I don&#39;t think this is the case with Android. </p>
<p>Try retrieving the cookie from the headers in the response returned from your login request and pass it to the webview (there are a few existing Q&amp;As on how to do it).</p>

							<p>Thanks David. I will look into examining those cookies.  I assumed this was what was going on (or something along those lines) but posted the question in case I was mistaken and there was a simple tweak to my code I could make in order to get Android to authenticate via the Webview. Appreciate the response.</p>
