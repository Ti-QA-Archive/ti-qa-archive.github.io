			<h1>Storing Different Images for iPhone 5s and iPhone 6</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I apologize if this topic already exists- I searched the Q&amp;A and did not find anything relevant.</p>
<p>I understand that as a Titanium developer you can store different versions of images optimized for different platforms.  For example, you can resize an image using your favorite image editor such as Photoshop or Sketch and store specific optimized versions into Resources&#x2F;android&#x2F;images&#x2F;res-hdpi, Resources&#x2F;android&#x2F;images&#x2F;res-ldpi (for Android) and Resources&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;images (for iPhone). And then when you want to specify the image to use in your Javascript module, you can simply do something like:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-string">image:</span> <span class="hljs-string">'/images/My-Image.png'</span>
</code></pre><p>and it will automatically select the correct image to load for whichever platform you are using.</p>
<p>While it is clear what you are supposed to do to achieve this effect across multiple Android screen densities (or <strong>aspect ratios</strong>, which is a completely different concept that should not be confused!), it is unclear how to achieve this effect across multiple iPhone aspect ratios.  iPhone 5s has a different screen size (different width and height) than iPhone 6.  My app works and looks great in iPhone 5s.  Now when I try to use the iOS simulator for iPhone 6, all of my images are too small…they don&#39;t fit the screen well.  Not that I necessarily want to just stretch them- this could end up looking bad.  I want them to look crisp and formatted correctly for whichever aspect ratio or screen density I am using.  I care about the way my apps look.</p>
<p>How do I specify different images in Titanium for different <strong>iPhone</strong> aspect ratios and screen densities?  It seems nearly impossible to find anything on this searching either Google, Stackoverflow, or this very forum, without pulling up incredibly irrelevant search results.  Thank you.</p>

							<div><p>This probably doesn&#39;t require me to post screenshots.  Here is the issue:  I have a &quot;header&quot; PNG image that I would like to fill the entire screen width in a window on an iPhone 5s.  Naturally, I want to use the smallest image possible in order to reduce memory usage &#x2F; load time.  Now I want to use a similar image on iPhone 6 (or 6 Plus).  I don&#39;t want to use the <em>exact same image</em> since in order to fit the screen width on an iPhone 6 (or 6 Plus), then I would need to stretch the image.  So, it appears there must be a way to specify a different image for each version of iPhone.</p>

							<p>Hi Karl Schultz</p>
<p>If you want different images for iPhone6 and iPhone 6+. then use &quot;-667h@2x.png&quot; for iPhone6 and @3x.png for iPhone6+.<br>for example.. your image is <code>imgHome@2x.png</code> (for iPhone5s) and same image with large size rename it <code>imgHome-667h@2x.png</code> (it use in iPhone6) and <code>imgHome@3x.png</code> (it is for iPhone6+).</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>The difference between iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 is one of dimensions rather than density. This answer provides the closest explanation of them all. Your app should make use of the extra space available rather than simply providing bigger images to compensate for not giving the app more room to show information but if but this is the way to do it.</p>
<p>These are called resolution modifiers, they are added to the file name in addition to the density modifiers (@2x etc). The iOS app will select the best match of all images supplied. You can and should use this technique in your apps - but remember the extra space given should provide more detail or clearer layouts first if possible or suitable. </p>
<p>There are a number of these resolution and density modifiers for iOS, android handles things using density and other modifiers on folders to achieve similar but not identical end results - both have good and bad points. </p>
<p>As the author days go and have a play. But this is the answer I would pick, I can only imagine Hani is having an off day.</p>

							<p>Kari,</p>
<p>What you really want is <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;ios&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;UserExperience&#x2F;Conceptual&#x2F;MobileHIG&#x2F;IconMatrix.html">this</a>. What this means is that you put all images in one directory for ios, but create three different densities. So if you have an image called &#39;a.png&#39;, you would have 3 in your directory. </p>
<ul>
<li>a.png would get used for an iphone 4</li>
<li>a@2x.png would be used on a 5</li>
<li>a@3x.png would be used on a 6</li>
</ul>
<p>So, you create all three with the correct size and titanium will use the correct one based on the device. You simply reference a.png in your app and the correct version will be loaded.</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s incorrect because iPhone 6 uses @2x similarly to 5. Only 6+ currently uses 3x, and even if 3x images are used for iPhone 6 plus they still occupy the same area and look tiny for its large screen even though the resolution is higher.</p>

							<p>You can use custom query styles. Please check <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2014&#x2F;07&#x2F;new-in-alloy-1-4-custom-query-styles&#x2F;">here</a> and <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Alloy_Styles_and_Themes-section-35621526_AlloyStylesandThemes-CustomQueryStyles">here</a></p>
<p>if you&#39;re using older Alloy versions you can do it by creating custom functions to detect platformHeight and PlatformWidth and apply styles accordingly using functions like applyProperties, addClass, createStyle</p>

										<p><p>The problem is not actually with image resolutions to use, of course this should be used as Nilesh stated. it&#39;s more with the layouts. You can use Ti.Platform.displayCaps.platformHeight and Ti.Platform.displayCaps.platformWidth to get screen sizes.</p>
<p>You have multiple alternatives to tackle that. Branching is one of them: You can even create a separate module that returns different styles depending on the phone, and use applyProperties to apply them.</p>

    iPhone6: {height: <span class="hljs-number">120</span>, width: <span class="hljs-number">130</span>}
}
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">getDevice</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span>{
    <span class="hljs-comment">// here you check Ti.Platform.displayCaps.platformHeight to return the correct device</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// for example:</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-string">'iPhone4'</span>
}
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">getStyle</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span>(style[getDevice])
}
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> s = getStyle();
s.image =  <span class="hljs-string">'/images/My-Image.png'</span>


<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> img = Ti.UI.createImageView(s);
</code></pre><p>Another way would be using percentages :</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">
var img = Ti.UI.createImageView({
    <span class="hljs-variable">width</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'80%'</span>, <span class="hljs-variable">height</span>;<span class="hljs-string">'60%'</span>

										<p><p>@Malcom This will make it into a live app soon. </p>
<p>I should have mentioned device specific modifiers but it was in Nilesh&#39;s answer so I was adding to what he said. </p>
<p>And what I was saying is that the image file dimensions are not the only factors that determine the layout in as screen, but they need to be combined with device specific component styling, mainly dimensions and positions, and that&#39;s the best way to achieve what you said : &quot;Your app should make use of the extra space available&quot;. </p>
<p>So making use of space available may mean customizing positions and dimensions using query styles as well as using different pictures (not necessarily resized versions of the same image) depending on the device. Please revisit my example and you&#39;ll see that I specified one image name with 3 different image sizes for iPhone 4, iPhone 5 and iPhone 6</p>
<p>I&#39;m sorry for confusions caused by my answer, I always try to write down all the details as I am thinking, but I fail every time.</p>
