			<h1>Images and resolutions or dpi - dazed and confused</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m thorougly confused about how I should proceed with this. I started out using Titanium in a Windows enviroment with TItanium Developer 1.2.2, and a HTC Hero handset (HVGA-screen) - everything was fine and dandy - the graphic I produced in Photoshop looked OK in both the emulator and on the handset.</p>
<p>Now I&#39;ve moved on to a HTC Desire Z with a WVGA-screen (480x800) and things have gone to the dogs.. I mock something up in a 480x800 pixel large canvas @ 72dpi in Photoshop, transfer the imagery to a Titanium-project, and nothing is the size it&#39;s supposed to be…</p>
<p>Am I missing a crucial understanding of how screen-resolutions work in Android and in Titanium? Should i create the images at a different DPI-setting than 72? Is there some dark black magic i havent found via Google or this Q&amp;A-section? Please - any input at all would be immensely appreaciated, this has taken all christmas for me :)</p>

							<p>Lets takt the emulator-window as an example, at HVGA-resolution the screen measures 320x480 pixels, at WVGA-resolution it measures 480x800, sounds fair that a 70x70 pixel large icon should stay at the same size in both those, unless there is a DPI difference, no?</p>
<p>But that&#39;s not the case though, at WVGA my 70x70@72dpi icon turns out to something over double its original size, like it&#39;s beeing iterpolated up (scaled up). what gives?!</p>

							<p>I understand your frustration. </p>
<p>Based on my experience images and interface design are based on the iPhone&#39;s native&#x2F;original design at 320x480. Images are then stretched to the other dimensions. I may be inaccurate on this since I have not seen documentation on it but this is what I have always assumed.</p>
<p>Basically, I do not believe it is a matter of DPI but the images changing from square pixels to rectangular which will cause more noticeable display issues.</p>
