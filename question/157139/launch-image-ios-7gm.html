<p>&quot;Update the launch image to include the status bar area if it doesn’t already do so. This is a difference of 20 pixels in height, that is, the image is stretched 20 more pixels if you do nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>This is due to the new way iOS7 treats the window and statusbar.</p>

										<p><p>This happens to me, too, with the iPhone 5 on iOS 7 and Titanium 3.1.3.  I voted down this answer because it does not solve the issue and was probably misunderstood.  Notice that the image sizes given are the full screen size on 3.5&quot; and 4.0&quot; devices.  I am doing the same for my apps.  I&#39;m going to consider this a bug in Titanium that will be worked out with the final 3.1.3 release.  It probably expects the shorter image sizes and tries to compensate.</p>

										<p><p>Hi.<br>I agree with you that this must be Titanium acting strange. Since my images are the right sizes.<br>Thank you for your comment. Hope somebody from Appcelerator sees this! :-)<br>Frode</p>

										<p><p>If I remember correctly, didn&#39;t Titanium also have issues with iPhone&#x2F;iPod launch images exploding in size the iPad, until 3.0.x?  I know there was an issue for a little while with that particular use case that has since been resolved. I had just figured that something similar was happening for this.</p>
<p>I have not tested the various window display settings (fullscreen, translucent, opaque, etc.) to see if they make a difference in the flickering size of the launch image, since all apps I&#39;ve been developing have always shown the status bar.  Are you showing or hiding the status bar?</p>
