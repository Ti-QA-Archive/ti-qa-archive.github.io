			<h1>Android Emulator too slow not fully solved but at least now i can work</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, i&#39;m new to Titanium. I don&#39;t want to complain, but my first impressions with titanium are far than good. Now i&#39;ll just say how i could make default project run under Android emulator. I&#39;ve installed anything (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.appcelerator.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;installing_on_windows.html) except git, scons and python (i just want to develop for mobile). Installation worked well but i prefer not to install Google API and installed only Android standard packages. I tried any emulator to run (i tried both starting avd from Appcelerator or from android sdk manager), but Appcelerator created AVD devices can&#39;t run (damn toooooo slow!). If i create a new avd from android sdk manager with the same exact features as the one created by appcelerator, it starts in one or two minutes only. So i decided to copy (!) all the file created with &quot;manually created avd&quot; into the &quot;titanium created avd&quot; folder and run it (so that appcelerator can call this &quot;new&quot; AVD). As expected emulator started in two minutes, but got error while appcelerator tried to install on AVD.<br>So i installed anything from google and tried again same procedure with sdk 1.5…still got an error. I tried it with a 2.2 apis device (i had to manually create one avd equal to titanium&#39;s one and then copying the file as before) and at the end, appcelerator was able to install default application.<br>Now i must start manually the avd i want to use (remember: i had to create one manually and after copying files in the one that titanium would use and remeber i can&#39;t still run 1.5, must use 2.2 apis) and appcelerator can connect to it.<br>It took me quite 5 hour trying that. And this is not good at all for development. It seems to me to be completely absurd and &quot;unstable&quot; and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>If you are going to install a product without following the documentation, then you are bound to have trouble.</p>
<p>I am surprised Titanium even worked at all, if you didn&#39;t have python instsalled, as it is a prerequisite.</p>
<p>Note that Android 1.5 is not supported by Titanium.</p>
<p>The time it takes to boot an Android emulator or launch an app to an emulator is almost entirely dependent on Google&#39;s SDK. However, with this in mind and to give you an example for comparison, on my Ubuntu (i7 processor, 6GB memory) machine it takes 40 seconds to launch an application to an already-booted emulator, as <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.dropbox.com&#x2F;u&#x2F;14392713&#x2F;titanium-boot.ogv">this video</a> video demonstrates.</p>
<p>What is the specification of your machine (processor make and model, and amount of RAM)? What OS are you using?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

							<p>Hi Paul,<br>sure, you are right, if one doesn&#39;t follow documentation one shouldn&#39;t complain about problems.</p>
<p>Right, but it seems to me that here (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.appcelerator.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;getting_started.html) nobody says that you need python for mobile development and infact titanium runs and compile, at least the default project.</p>
<p>There are a lot of posts saying that there is a problem with the emulator start time (google for &quot;appcelerator android emulator too slow&quot;) so i decided to post my &quot;semi-solution&quot;.</p>
<p>I can accept also the 2 minute start for AVD, but i had to &quot;hack it&quot; manually and this is unacceptable to me. Why Android SDK Manager allows me to create a new AVD which starts in about 2 minutes on a slow pc while Titanium provide a conf that will took so much to run?</p>
<p>I&#39;m currently playing with Ti and still not professional developing with it, because i&#39;m evaluating developing native but not-portable code, vs cross-platform, so currently i&#39;m working within a virtual machine and i can accept lower performances but slowness on android emulator with Ti seems to be a Ti problem as all posts and my personal experience suggest to me.</p>
