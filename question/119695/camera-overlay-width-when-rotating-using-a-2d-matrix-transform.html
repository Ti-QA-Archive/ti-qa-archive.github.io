			<h1>Camera overlay width when rotating using a 2d matrix transform</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m just finishing off an AR app and trying to draw parts of the UI which are clickable.</p>
<p>The problem I&#39;m having is that to handle the landscape orientation I&#39;ve rotated the overlay view by an angle depending on the orientation - This works great and even though I can reposition parts of the UI using their top and left values, the container they&#39;re in (camera overlay) is still the original 320px width. This is causing problems for me as any of the UI that&#39;s position outside of this becomes unclickable.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s what I mean - the camera overlay is given a background color of green and the close button is within this and clickable</p>
<p><img src="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.heyphi.com&#x2F;bugs&#x2F;portrait.png &quot;portrait&quot;" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>When I apply a 2d transform and rotate the camera overlay - I can reposition the elements but the width will always remain 320. The close button is not within this and no longer clickable.<br><img src="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.heyphi.com&#x2F;bugs&#x2F;landscape &quot;landscape&quot;" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried setting the width, top and left values of the overlay with no luck.</p>
<p>Hows anyone ever tried anything like this and fixed it?</p>

							<p>I have found out (the hard way) that the best way of getting a components to always stretch, is not to use width at all, but use right and left properties. for example:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> view = <span class="hljs-type">Titanium</span>.createView({<span class="hljs-keyword">left</span>:<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-keyword">right</span>:<span class="hljs-number">0</span>});
</code></pre><p>will ensure the view will always resize to the full width.</p>

							<p>That was the first thing I tried.  The white boxes in the screenshot use only a left and right value with a height. It&#39;s also within a container value that I have to set the width to 320 or 480 depending on the orientation. If it&#39;s not in a container then it always remains 320 wide. Also bear in mind that this view is an AR overlay that&#39;s attached to the camera view. </p>
<p>I&#39;m pretty sure this is a bug and that probably few people have tried doing this so it&#39;s probably gone unnoticed. I just wish the appcelerator guys check these forums as often as they used too.</p>

							<p>I don&#39;t think the camera overlay was ever intended to have any animation&#x2F;2d transforms applied to it. The solution was to place everything in another container view which gets added to the camera overlay and it&#39;s this that gets rotated. Bit of a pain but it works.</p>
