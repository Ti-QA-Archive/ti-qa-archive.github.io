			<h1>Sample App - Mileage Application</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Ti 3.0, Android SDK 4.2, Win 7<br>I&#39;ve been trying to get the mileage app working at http:&#x2F;&#x2F;localadda.wordpress.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;11&#x2F;13&#x2F;titanium-appcelerator-building-a-sample-android-app&#x2F;, and I have finally gotten an app to load on a device properly. However, this app has a entry.js file that accepts mileage and fuel entries which are saved to the database upon Save button depression. The app also has a listing.js which will list the last few entries from the database that were generated and saved in the entry.js file.There are no obvious errors that I see and all four .js files in this project passed a compilation check with Google Closure Compliance service. However none of the entries are displayed. Anyone try this app before or examine the code? If you are interested in looking at the code at the sight listed above, load the source from the link. Don&#39;t use the code on the initial web page as it is incorrect. Thank you.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>You asked an almost identical question 5 days ago, which I offered assistance and code - despite you not providing any of your own code.  I am still waiting to hear back from your earlier question;</p>
<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;147899&#x2F;sample-app---mileage-application">Problem with bike mileage sample titanium app</a></p>
<p>A few things to note;</p>
<ul>
<li>If you ask a question and someone provides help it is polite to respond with the outcome - for example it appears you have moved the app on so should the question be marked as answered?</li>
<li>You have not provided any code to show where the problem is - most people will not download other entire apps to try and debug something when you have not even given a starting a point of provided any indication of changes you may have made</li>
<li>Suggesting &quot;don&#39;t use the code on the initial web page&quot; is not going to help you out.  Not only do you not provide pertinent code to review we now how to guess through someone else&#39;s code on another site and pick and choose what you may have done.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take a step back and see how you can do a few things to help yourself by providing the right amount of information.  Also be polite and review your old questions.</p>

							<p>my reference to code was the url of the site where the code was listed. My code is identical that that listed on that page. I thought it better to provide a url rather than a bunch of code</p>
<p>The question of a few days ago, entitled &quot;I need some success here&quot;, was about getting the code to compile and run. My latest question has to do with the storing, retrieving and displaying the database data. </p>
<p>I replied to both answers I received (both on 1&#x2F;31&#x2F;13. One suggested using a lower sdk version. That other pointed out that I should be looking at the code in the link and not the code on the first page. The only reason I can think for you not receiving my response is that I am posting responses to answers in the wrong place. I will check into that.</p>

										<p><p>Quick tip; please comment on the related answer or the actual question if there is no answer - rather than creating a whole new answer which is really a comment - it makes it harder in the future to work out threads if answers scores change or other answers are added. (You are not being told off)</p>
