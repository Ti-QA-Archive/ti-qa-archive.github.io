							<div><p>While my answer may be more tactful that Stephen&#39;s,  I&#39;m afraid that I have to agree with him.<br>Your posts simply list technologies that are mostly unrelated to one another. And since you are posting this for your client, we should assume that you have a role to adapt his requirements to accomodate his requirements.</p>
<p>Also, while new work is always a good sign for the community, the Q&amp;A is not the place for job posting.</p>

							<p>Hi Stephen, Client is not looking for all the skills. Usually client doesn&#39;t provide all the info. about the projects. They clear it with candidates at the time of interview.</p>

							<p>Hi Christian, Sorry to post this requirement is Q&amp;A . Was bit desperate to get a consultant for this position. I will surely keep in mind from now by not posting the requirement in Q&amp;A</p>
