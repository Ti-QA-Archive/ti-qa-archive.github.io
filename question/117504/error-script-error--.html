			<p>Result of expression &#39;Ti.App&#39; [undefined] is not an object.</p>
<p>Sorry, I deleted this by mistake.</p>
<p>I got this pesky error in a variety of &quot;Ti.App.xxx&quot; calls.  I then reverted from Titanium SDK 1.6.1 to 1.5.1 and it went away.  When I went back to 1.6.1 it seems to have stayed away.  This might be due to a &quot;Full Rebuild&quot; which appears to be a frequent answer to Titanium problems.</p>

							<div><p>When you post a question to the Q&amp;A, you will receive much more accurate answers more quickly by posting a proper &quot;usecase&quot;. A usecase is a self-contained piece of code that demonstrates your issue in the least possible number of lines. Some additional advantages of providing a usecase are that it is much kinder to those wishing to help you, because they won&#39;t have to spend considerable time replicating your issue on their systems, that you will gain a much great knowledge of how Titanium works, and lastly that the process of creating a usecase can often simplify the problem and consequently reveal the answer. You can read more about this subject in the official documentation, under the section <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Contributing+to+Titanium#ContributingtoTitanium-CreatingGoodUsecases">Creating Good Use-cases</a>.</p>
<p>Note that, if the code is long, you may want to create a <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;">Git Gist</a> or <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;">pastebin</a> rather than paste the code here directly.</p>
