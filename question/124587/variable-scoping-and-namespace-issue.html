			<h1>Variable scoping and namespace issue</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I had <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;124447&#x2F;variable-scoping-question">asked previously</a> about persisting variables across windows. Got some good answers about Namespaces, but I don&#39;t think that is working for me here.  I realize now I might not have been clear about what I was trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>I have a function on one window that creates an array.  I need to access this array in <strong>different</strong> Titanium windows.  </p>
<p>It would seem, unless I am doing it wrong, that namespaces only persist in one window. I looked at the links provided in the earlier post, but there are so many different ways to handle this, and I am not sure if this will accomplish what I am trying to do – most of the stuff I read relates to javascript in a web browser, not sure how much carries over.</p>
<p>So, how would you accomplish just this in a TI app:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user chooses items from a list in tab 1. </li>
<li>I need to know what they chose on tabs 2,3,4 to display the appropriate info.</li>
</ol>

							<p>if you are using the URL property to create new windows, then yes the namespace only exists inside each window and is not shared. If you use a single context layout for your app the namespace is accessible anywhere in your app, on any window</p>

										<p><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator-titans&#x2F;tweetanium">tweetanium</a> is a great example of this… you would be treating windows like any other object, and wrapping all your windows in functions and returning the windows (thats a very basic explanation of the various ways this can be done)</p>

										<p><p>Steve, what Matt means by &quot;single context&quot; is an application design where each new windows does NOT use the url parameter to name a *.js file.  The tweetanium application is an example of one such program.</p>
<p>Contrast that with a &quot;multiple context&quot; application design where each new window DOES use the url parameter to name a *.js file.  The kitchen sink application is an example of that design.</p>
<p>Despite its use by the kitchen sink, Appcelerator recommends the single context approach for applications.  One of the primary reasons for this is to allow the use of namespaces (and objects in general) to be available globally.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when you have an existing complex app already using the multiple context paradigm it requires some rework to switch paradigms. :(</p>

										<p><p>All of my coworkers advice is 100% valid… What it will come down to is this… </p>
<p>Using the URL is a great way to separate off a section of your app from the rest of your code, but for most apps, this is not the best way to go… Kitchen Sink does this so as to not pollute each example. At this point, the best advice I can give is that if your not too far along, or if its a small app to refactor it to use a single context and name space… this will let you learn what are considered &quot;best practices&quot; for Titanium development. If that is too much to undertake at this time, then pauls suggestion would solve your current issue without a re-write.</p>

										<p><p>There is one more approach (that I&#39;m using and that works pretty well :) ). I&#39;m using heavyweight windows without &quot;url&quot; property, but with &quot;modal&quot; property (so, I&#39;m using multiple contexts in a different way). I defined global object namespace in &quot;app.js&quot; and in other JS files that I include via &quot;Ti.include&quot; I add function constructors to that global object namespace.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">//app.js</span>
<span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> NS</span> = {};

Ti.include('/components/my_blue_view.js');

<span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> context</span> = Ti.UI.createWindow({ modal: <span class="hljs-literal">true</span> });

<span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> myView</span> = Ns.myBlueView();

context.add(myView);

context.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>();
</code></pre><p>This is very basic example, in real scenario my components opens new contexts that contains other components and so on …</p>

										<p><p>Thanks.  It&#39;s disappointing, because when getting started with Titanium, everywhere says to &quot;use the Kitchen Sink&quot;, so that&#39;s what I have been emulating.</p>
<p>Perhaps there should be more &quot;separate functionality&quot; apps instead of just a kitchen sink.  It&#39;s hard to see how to separate things out from the KS.  I had (and still have) a hard time with nav groups and tabs, since the KS adds an extra layer of complexity just to manage itself.  Would be great to see some apps without the nested code in KS.</p>

<p>As an alternative to Matt&#39;s valid advice, you could store an array in your application&#39;s properties, using the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;latest&#x2F;Titanium.App.Properties-module">setList() and getList()</a> methods. Also, remember you can store JSON objects by converting them to and from strings, as explained in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Working+with+Local+Data#WorkingwithLocalData-StoringJSobjectsasJSONinproperties">Storing JS objects as JSON in properties</a>.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

							<p>Ideally you would have developed your app using a single context so that all data is shared. When you separate each window&#x2F;tab into separate files and access them via the <code>url</code> property, you create separate execution contexts that generally only share data via application level events. That said, you can use <code>Titanium.App.fireEvent()</code> and <code>Titanium.App.addEventListener()</code> to share data, via events, from different execution contexts.</p>
<p>For example, to send data from one window to another that are in separate execution contexts:</p>
<p>win1.js</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Titanium.App.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'app:win2_event'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-comment">// handle event, which can include any serializable data you want</span>
});
</code></pre><p>win2.js</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// the 2nd parameter is where you would put your serializable data</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">Titanium</span><span class="hljs-class">.App</span><span class="hljs-class">.fireEvent</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'app:win2_event'</span>, {});
</code></pre><p>Check out those 2 functions in the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;latest&#x2F;Titanium.App-module">Titanium.App namespace</a> in the API docs for more details.</p>
