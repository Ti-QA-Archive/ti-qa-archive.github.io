			<h1>When to use Require Vs. Include ?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I&#39;m a newbie to appcelerator to JavaScript Design Patterns in general and I&#39;ve been studying all the excellent docs &amp; videos on using <strong>Ti.Include()</strong> and <strong>CommonJS Modules</strong>. </p>
<p>My understanding is that <strong>Ti.Include()</strong> is the same conceptually as copy &amp; paste and by using anonymous functions &amp; namespacing we can avoid polluting the global scope (e.g. I&#39;ve looked at the Tweetanium example).</p>
<p><strong>CommonJS Modules</strong> though seem to do something similar albeit with less work on a developers side through the <strong>exports</strong> object, which guarantees public&#x2F;private access. </p>
<p>Can someone explain why and when I would use one over the other? Is it that <strong>CommonJS Modules</strong> are a more standardised approach that has only come along recently through open Community efforts and that there is a general move towards it? (Remember I&#39;m new to appcelerator :).</p>
<p>Are there some cases where you would use one over the other? e.g. encapsulate UI code in a <strong>Include</strong><br>files while Business Logic and Database Logic might be included as <strong>CommonJS Modules</strong> using <strong>require</strong>.</p>
<p>Am I right in saying a <strong>CommonJS Module</strong> runs in it&#39;s own context and this can have pros&#x2F;cons from a memory perspective?</p>
<p>Thanks for the help</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Moiz, the question is though what is a module? Is it a 3rd party plugin that exposes a JS API, a unit of JS code ? or both ? The term module is used in two different places as far as I can tell CommonJS Module and extending Titanium with 3rd Party Modules</p>

							<p>Both have their good and bad parts. In any case, I would use only one approach. CommonJS seems a way to go in a long term to me. :)</p>

										<p><p>Hi Ivan, that&#39;s my problem understanding the good &amp; part parts. I&#39;d like to make a decision on which one, at the moment I&#39;m thinking CommonJS modules is a <em>cleaner</em> implementation, and has better memory management but if used incorrectly this could have adverse effects?</p>

										<p><p>Yes, exactly. (IMO) Bad part of CommonJS is that every CommonJS module creates new JS context, which means new JS environment. There is no direct access to global objects. Also, if you do something with native prototypes (like adding methods to &quot;Array.prototype&quot;), that won&#39;t be reflected in module&#39;s context. Everything you do needs to be re-done, or re-required (because, you&#39;ll write a module for every type of functionality).</p>
<p>Although I like &quot;Ti.include&quot; and JS namespaces, CommonJS is better choice in long term because Titanium framework will be moving in that direction.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Gagan, is this correct? I think you are confusing this with creating 3rd party modules for extending Titanium? To use CommonJS Modules I simple define my JS in a .js file, exposing public properties and methods via the exports object and use require() to access the module.</p>
