			<h1>Titanium 1.2.1 and XCode 4</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am wondering if anyone else has tried to use Titanium 1.2.1 on a machine that has XCode4 developer preview 2+ installed? I am absolutely loving the new XCode4. I have a brand new machine with XCode4 upon which I just installed Titanium 1.2.1 (mobile 1.4.1.1). Unfortunately, no matter what I do, Titanium crashes whenever I try to &quot;Test&quot; an iOS app. In addition, I am now unable to build&#x2F;create a fresh project if I start with mobile 1.4+. I need to initially create the project using 1.2, which allows the project to be created, then I need to change it to 1.4.1.1.</p>
<p>Bottom line… Is anyone else having similar issues? Is XCode4 off limits if I want to use Titanium at this point?</p>

							<p>I just installed XCode 4 preview 5, and now it appears I cannot &quot;Run on Device&quot; from Titanium Developer.  I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re related or what&#39;s up, but I can no longer get Titanium to install my app to iTunes&#x2F;my device.  I am looking at uninstalling Xcode 4, and will see if that solves it.</p>

										<p><p>Uuninstalling Xcode 4 solved it for me.  I had to subsequently re-install 3, or so it seemed, as Titanium seemed to lose the iOS SDK.</p>

							<p>I also have XCode 4 installed with Titanium 1.2.2.  I am able to run the iPhone simulator, but there are some strange behavior. For example, if I exit out of the app in the simulator I should be able to launch again from Titanium without stopping.  I have found that this does not work for me.  I have to stop the simulator and then run it again.  Most times it doesn&#39;t run the first time.  I have to stop and launch twice before it pulls up the simulator.</p>
