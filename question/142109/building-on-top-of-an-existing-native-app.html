		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m the Co-Founder &amp; CTO of Circle (discoverCircle.com) a beautiful mobile app (you should check us out on the app store). I&#39;m currently evaluating Titanium and want to know if there&#39;s a way to try titanium on a few screens without having to completely rewrite my application. If that means I need to do more low level stuff like loading the engine myself, so be it. I do understand that this loses the cross platform compatibility, since there are other native screens that aren&#39;t portable, and I&#39;d be fine with slowly switching. Any pointers on this would be really helpful.</p>

							<p>Hi Prasanna,<br>nice app.</p>
<p>You can surely try re-implementing some small parts of your app using Titanium in order to feel how the framework behaves, temporarily forgetting reusing your existing code.</p>
<p>Now some personal opinion on your (presumed) objective to port the iOS app to Android… While it&#39;s ideally possible to re-implement the business logic of the application in JS, reusing the native screens, I&#39;d consider the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where does the business logic of the  app reside? Would it be worth rebuilding these parts in javascript as a common base between the target platforms for long term maintenability? It&#39;s actually very hard to estimate the cost of such kind of operation vs. rebuilding the whole app on another platform</li>
<li>Assuming you want to rewrite the business logic of the app in JS, reusing the native screens is not as immediate as it would appear. In Titanium, the application workflow is driven by the framework, so you cannot use Titanium in your existing app, it&#39;s the other way around: you can reuse parts of your existing app in a Titanium app. So, for example for reusing your viewcontrollers in a Ti app, you should wrap them in some native modules, through what are called ViewProxies. Now, this operation may be quite straightforward in simple cases, but it can quickly become a PITA depending on the internal architecture or the native app.</li>
<li>Once you have all this in place, you still have to implement the android views, either using the Titanium framework, or by implementing some native modules</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, this kind of operation can be a bit risky, and its long term cost may be greater than just rewriting the app natively for another platform.</p>
