<p>Try disabling your antivirus and possibly even your firewall just until Titanium sucessfully updates. If this works, you need to configure rules in that software so that it works with Titanium for future updates.</p>
<p>By the way, what antivirus and firewall software are you using? Share your workaround so that it benefits others.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>McAfee in particular is known to cause problems with Titanium, Are you certain that it is completely disabled when you are performing the updates? Check that none of its services are still running, using the tool in Windows &quot;Administrative Tools&quot;.</p>

										<p><p>I stopped windows security center and McAfee services.  I was unable to stop McAfee Validation Trust Protection Service, but that service is internal to McAffee, used by McAfee processes, and not stoppable according to McAfee. Since no other processes are running I think &quot;that &#39;ill do.&quot;  Still no change.</p>

<p>Just fyi, you shouldn&#39;t answer your own questions. Instead, post your solution as a comment under someone&#39;s answer and then mark it best to close it. This way, others may find it more easily in future, as explained in the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.appcelerator.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;contribute.html#participating_in_the_q&amp;a">Participating in the Q&amp;A</a> guide.</p>
<p>Glad you got the problem fixed, though; well done! :)</p>
