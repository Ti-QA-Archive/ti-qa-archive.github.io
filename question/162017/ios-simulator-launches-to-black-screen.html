			<h1>iOS Simulator Launches to Black Screen</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello. I am working on an iOS application using the latest version of Titanium Studio (3.2). My problem is t hat since I upgraded to the latest version my app launches in the simulator but only displays a black screen. At first I thought it was a problem with the Navigation Group, which has been deprecated and is now called Navigation Window. I changed the code to reflect this, but I still get a black screen. I&#39;m really stumped on where to begin to fix this problem, since I don&#39;t have a clue as to what is causing it. I know I haven&#39;t given very much to go on, but I&#39;d appreciate any ideas that the community could provide to help me fix this. Thank you!</p>

							<p>Anytime you have a setup thats &#39;pretending&#39; to something its not, ie, you have an x86 computer app thats pretending to be an iphone, you have the potential for things to unwind.</p>
<p>My first go to fix for simulator issues is to reset the content and settings.</p>

										<p><p>Second, the simulator in xcode 5.x is supposed to be faster, and in most cases it is.  However, we have noticed that when switching between projects, it sits at a black screen for an extraordinary long period of time before launching.  We run iStats on all our macs, so can tell if its just hung, or if something is actually working.  Have found the new simulator pegs cpu usages a lot more on startup than the one in 4.x did.</p>

										<p><p>Third,  add some console logging in your code, top off functions, so you can see how far through the app you have gotten.  This will let you know if its the simulator that is hanging, of if your code itself has caused everything to come to a dead stop.</p>

										<p><p>Stephen, thank you for your advice. I tried reseting the simulator and checking system resources to see if the simulator was hanging, but none of these seem to be the culprit. I tried running the simulator in debug mode and I discovered an error message at the every end of the debug log, <em>&quot;Can not add a window as a child of a view. Returning.&quot;</em> Do you think that this could be causing the app to display a black screen when loading? If so, does the error refer to the .js file just loaded before the error occurred?</p>

										<p><p>this could very well be it.</p>
<p><code>Can not add a window as a child of a view. Returning.</code></p>
<p>The navigationGroup could be added to other windows, to views, to popovers, to ipad splitview detailview.  NavigationWindow is now restricted to being a top level container.</p>
<p>A bunch of our apps had to be refactored to account for the change.</p>

							<p>Okay, I think this must be the problem then. In the code I&#39;m trying to add NavigationWindow to another Window. I&#39;m sure if I play with it for a little while I&#39;ll figure out how to change it so it works correctly. Thanks for your help!</p>
