			<h1>Globally hide keyboard</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, been trying to find out how to either:</p>
<p>a) Globally hide the numeric keypad (so that, if a user decided to tap a tabbedbar at the top of a window whilst completing a textfield, I can hide the keyboard and slide the window they&#39;ve requested by tapping that bar)</p>
<p>b) Do some sort of component search from the app.js or main app window, so that I can reference a child component and fire a blur() on it.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve done a dig around Google and had a look through here, but all the questions are from a same-place perspective, in that, people just didn&#39;t know how to hide the keypad from the window they were using. </p>
<p>My problem is that I have a window with a tabbed bar, and two views. Each view is tied to an index in the tabbed bar, and each view contains text fields. I wish for the tapping of the tabbed bar to cause a universal blur() to occur (or some other method which achieves the keyboard disappearance, I&#39;m not precious about it) so that I can happily slide in the selected view without having a keyboard already on top of it.</p>
<p>Many thanks for your time.</p>
<p>Tony</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>In Android only <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.UI.Android-method-hideSoftKeyboard">hideSoftKeyboard</a>;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">Ti</span><span class="hljs-class">.UI</span><span class="hljs-class">.Android</span><span class="hljs-class">.hideSoftKeyboard</span>();
</code></pre><p>I have only just thought of this - and certinaly not tested it - but this sort of thing should work as it creates a hook the the current text field (or anything that fires a keyboard) ready to later be hidden if still displayed.</p>
<p><strong>keyboard.js</strong></p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> txt = <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>;
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">focus</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{
    txt = e.source;
}
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">blur</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{
    txt = <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>;
}
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">hide</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (txt !== <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>) {
        txt.blur();
    }
}

exports.focus = focus;
exports.blur = blur;
exports.hide = hide;
</code></pre><p>Usage</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">txt1.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'focus'</span>, <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'keyboard'</span>).focus);
txt1.removeEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'focus'</span>, <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'keyboard'</span>).hide);
txt2.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'focus'</span>, <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'keyboard'</span>).focus);
txt2.removeEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'focus'</span>, <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'keyboard'</span>).hide);

<span class="hljs-regexp">//</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">then</span> later <span class="hljs-literal">on</span> you can
<span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'keyboard'</span>).hide()

										<p><p>Malcolm, thank you very much for your answer. The problem is that I don&#39;t have access to the text fields from the tabbedbar. The tabbedbar is on the main Window. The text fields are in views which are inside the main window too, but I can&#39;t get a reference to a text field to fire a blur() on it. </p>
<p>I have no problem with hiding the keyboard when the textfields lose focus, but I need to be able to cause the keyboard to hide when the tabbedbar is tapped, which obviously has nothing to do with, and is not linked to, the text fields in the views underneath.</p>

										<p><p>Apologies I have been out supporting clients on site all day.  That is where the <strong>hide</strong> method was meant to solve.  The lack of scope you mentioned was built into the solution.</p>
<p>The should get round all the issues you stayed above, I am wondering if you used it as I had hoped.  I will check it first thing in the morning to confirm my beliefs when I am back at the office.</p>

							<p>In the end, I added a &quot;blur&quot; (call it whatever you like) method to the view in which the text fields lived. I then called this when the tabbedbar buttons were tapped. The only thing I found was, I had to apply focus() to the relevant textfield first, since it had (to all intents and purposes) &quot;lost&quot; focus by tapping the tabbar buttons. so I basically had to use the following inside the view module:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    <span class="hljs-variable">self</span>.blur = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(</span>) {

        //Had <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> fire focus() first, <span class="hljs-keyword">then</span> blur() worked.
        flField.focus();
        flField.blur();
       };
</code></pre><p>Thanks to <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mattapperson.com&#x2F;">Matt Apperson</a> and Malcolm Hollingsworth for their help.</p>
