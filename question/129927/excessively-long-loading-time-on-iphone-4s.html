			<h1>Excessively long loading time on iPhone 4S</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>We are experiencing up to 40-70 sec delay before the splash screen disappears and opens the first window which brings up a login screen on our app.  We are not able to reproduce on iPhone 4.  This only happens on iPhone 4S. Normal load time on iPhone 4 is averaging 3-5 seconds every which way you test.  This doesn&#39;t make sense.   The app is working great under iPhone 3 and 4.  We have not introduced anything remotely complex or device specific.  Just standard views.   The only thing remotely advanced would be the SQLlite database which currently only has one table and is deployed with the IPA under the resources directory.   Latest build exhibiting this problem was compiled under 1.7.5.  Thanks for any help.</p>

							<p>Hi Neal,</p>
<p>Please check the database connection error or database Warning, if any warning or error occurred it will delayed the starting and data loading time in the application.</p>

							<p>Thanks Gaurang.  I do occasionally get database initialization errors in the emulator, but have not been able to reproduce the problem.  I&#39;m following the code samples in the Kitchen Sink and Titanium docs, but I am going to move the database installation code to another location only when it is needed.  I will retest on iPhone 4S tomorrow and post back any findings.</p>

							<p>Have you tried deleting the build folder and rebuild everything from scratch.<br>For the database, add a new version number so a fresh sqlite file will be installed.</p>

							<p>It&#39;s working now.   I&#39;ve disturbed so much code since 1.8.01 came out a few days ago working around all the bugs and it&#39;s hard to tell what fixed it exactly.  My database code is still the same, just in a different location.   Last night I pushed out my first 1.8.01 compiled build to our client over TestFlight and they are no longer experiencing the problem Thanks for aall your suggestions.   And somebody please fix 1.8!</p>
