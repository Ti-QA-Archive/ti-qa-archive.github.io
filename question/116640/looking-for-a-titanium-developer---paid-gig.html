			<h1>Looking for a Titanium Developer - Paid Gig</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Since we do not have an official job board in this forum, I&#39;m posting this request here. If there is a better place to make this post, please point us to it.</p>
<p>Our team is building an exciting mobile app in the entertainment space with about 75% of the app completed with the help of one developer. We are looking for an experienced Titanium developer to join the team to push through the final phase of development to meet tight beta deadlines. We would like the developer to hit the ground running. The majority of the work would be to complete the 2 remaining screens (one of which involves working with facebook API) in the app and get the app working on android.</p>
<p>Please respond to glueflix [at] gmail [dot] com if interested.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>The GlueFlix team</p>
