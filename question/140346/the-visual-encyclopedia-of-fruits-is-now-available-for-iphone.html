							<div><p>Joe, thanks. I have sent you a promo code.</p>
<p>Trevor, I have no plans, at the moment, to develop for Android, sorry. I tried one year ago to install everything for Android development under Titanium and I couldn´t make it. The installation for iOS was flawlessly. I may try again… I also a bit concerned about developing for a platform with so many different screen resolution, specially for apps which rely heavily on design. And I don´t own and Android tablet…. Any suggestions? I may change may mind about Android…</p>
<p>Thanks Malcom.</p>

							<div><p>The amount of information you have in this app I would hope you go and create two more apps - both aimed at children (and hopefully adults).</p>
<p>Number 1: Guess the fruit.<br>Show a random fruit photo and then ask which one it is from a choice of say four names.  This will greatly improve the knowledge and understanding of the players and expose them to more than the standard fruits young kids currently know including; apple, banana, orange, mars bar and skittles.</p>
<p>Number 2: Top Trumps<br>You have great information about the nutrition - use these values as your top trumps statistics, would make a great multi-player game.</p>
<p>Would even be happy to collaborate.</p>

							<div><p>Thank you Malcom for your suggestions. They sound very interesting. I have started developing an Encyclopedia of Mammals with a similar format (and a bit more work, since there are more species of mammals than fruits…). Once finished I may consider your suggestions. Thanks again.</p>
