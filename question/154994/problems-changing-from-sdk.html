			<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>When upgrading from 1.8 to Titanium 2.1 Titanium had enough problems of incompatibility with the code of a project (Android, mobile) that worked perfectly and that forced me to rewrite many lines of code. Now I encounter the same problems when passing Titanium 3.x, these problems are events stop working or malfunction, etc … and are not related to changes in the API. Am I doing something wrong?</p>
<p>I know that I can continue programming in Titanium 2.1 but I guess I&#39;ll stay out of date in some time with the new versions of Android, you can confirm me?</p>
<p>Sorry for my bad English and thank you very much in advance</p>
<p>Juanjo</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>It is common to have to do some house-keeping when updating to a newer SDK, however there are two main issues here;</p>
<ul>
<li>In each of your cases you have moved from one major version to another major version</li>
<li>The most recent jump should have had a lot less changes</li>
</ul>
<p>Between SDK 1.x and 3.x there have been many changes, including many names space changes, some stuff has gone and some moved.  Also advice from SDK 1.x days is not as common practice now.</p>
<p>You should actively consider jumping up each minor SDK version as soon as is sensible, review the change logs for each version and tweak as required, this will give you very little to do each time but give you huge performance and reliability benefits.</p>
<p>As Titanium has been an evolving product and the platforms have had increasing feature sets - everything will change, just follow along quickly and it is much easier.</p>
<p>There is no reason you should be on any version other than Ti SDK 3.1.2 right now, unless you are targeting a device that is very old - and one that the provider themselves no longer supports.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Malcolm,</p>
<p>understand the evolution and logical changes between versions of Titanium and Android, but strange things happen to me I do not see normal. For example, my code written for Titanium build: 2.1.2.201208301612, to open it in another computer with Titanium build: 3.1.1.201306112235 completely updated … Open events do not run and I have seen changes in its definition, which can be the cause?</p>

<p>win.addEventListener(&#39;focus&#39;, function() {<br>    Ti.UI.createNotification({ message : &quot;FOCUS OK&quot; }).show();<br>});</p>
<p>the open event never fires, the event focus operates normally</p>

										<p><p>I do not understand the last question.</p>
<p>I suggest you create test event handles to show what is and is not firing on the window, then work out if those that do not fire that may have done previously are a problem or not.</p>

<p>yes, the window is within a TabGroup. Because so far it fails if it worked?</p>

							<p>Hi Christian,</p>
<p>The questions are two:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It is normal to have many problems when changing SDK version?</p>
</li>
<li><p>If I stay in Titanium 2.1.x&#39;ll have problems with the newer versions of Android?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>thank you very much</p>
<p>Juanjo</p>

										<p><p>Quick tip; next time - please do not create a new answer when your contribution is actually a comment - it confuses thing in the future when trying to work out relevance.  You are NOT being told off.</p>
