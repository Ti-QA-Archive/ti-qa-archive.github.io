			<h1>Develop app compatible with iOS 3.1.3 and 4.2.1</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello to all you guys!</p>
<p>Should I develop a simple app , but it must be compatible with the old iOS, such as iOS 3.1.3 for iPhone 2G and iOS 4.2.1 for iPhone 3G.</p>
<p>I tell you now that I could do two &#x2F; three separate app if this is the problem, not so much the will release on appstore but as ad hoc distribution.</p>
<p>I now have the latest version of xCode (4.5.2) with iOS 5.1.1 and iOS 6 SDK ,  and as the titanium SDK 2.1.4GA.</p>
<p>So I ask you, in order to make the app compatible with iOS 3.1.3 and 4.2.1 should I download old versions of xCode that include the old SDK, take the folder of the SDK from within xCode SDK directory and copy it to the new xCode?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>According to to the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Titanium_Compatibility_Matrix">comparability matrix</a> you will need to use much older unsupported versions of the SDK as well.</p>
<p>This means you will have to avoid all new functionality that arrived in the 1.8 branch and 2.0 branch - so say goodbye to T.UI.FILL &amp; Ti.UI.SIZE for a start.</p>
<p>You should consider running side by side versions of XCODE and Titanium to keep them sand-boxed from each other.  SO make sure you copy each to folders OTHER than the default ones.  You may also find you need to run a terminal command to let the system know which xcode you are using at any one time.</p>

										<p><p>The app is very easy, so there should be no problem of missing features …<br>there remains the problem of the SDK, you can not do as I said before?</p>

										<p><p>No the latest versions do not carry support for older SDKs, you will need to run them side by side.</p>
<p>In fact as far as I am aware; there is no OS that supports both Xcode 3.x and Xcode 4.3.x. There is no version of the OS that supports both Xcode 4.0.x and 4.3.x. The last OS that supported Xcode 3.x was Snow Leopard, and Xcode 4.3 is only supported on Lion.</p>

										<p><p>accidents then it is a big problem ….<br>Well at least for the iOS 4.2.1 should be able to make compatible the app …<br>because I use the IOS SDK 5.1.1, which requires minimum iOS 4.2.1</p>

										<p><p>That is right and most likely the best you are going to be able to achieve now.  Given the tiny market share that 3.x now has - this hopefully will not be too much of an issue.</p>
<p>If this has answered your question please mark as such to help those in the future.</p>

										<p><p>Yes that would do it, I guess you have a very specific reason to support a platform that Apple no longer does.</p>

										<p><p>According to the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.1&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Titanium_Compatibility_Matrix">current comparability matrix</a> - for iOS 4.2 you need Ti SDK 1.71 or higher</p>
<p>And the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Titanium+Compatibility+Matrix">previous comparability matrix</a> - shows you need Ti SDK 1.7 or higher for iOS 3.1.2.</p>
<p>So unless 1.7.1 provided anything specific to your needs above 1.7 - then you could try and use the 1.7.  Just remember this is no longer supported by Appcelerator.</p>

										<p><p>This question - just keep going :)</p>
<p>I have no been able to find 1.7 myself, bu I noted in this <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;128196&#x2F;better-ci">answer</a> Tony comments he has every old version and suggested the other people could devmail him to obtain a specific one.  Might be worth a try and see if he is still able to provide the older SDKs.</p>
