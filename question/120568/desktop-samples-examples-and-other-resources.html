			<h1>Desktop samples, examples and other resources</h1>

		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m very interested in finding Appcelerator Desktop samples, examples and other resources.</p>
<p>As I understand it, Appcelerator Desktop is a wrapper for HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;Javascript and you can use Ruby, PHP, etc for further programming.</p>
<p>Am I correct you need to use a JS UI framework such as JQuery UI?</p>
<p>In terms of PHP, Ruby, etc. These are all server side programming languages, but they are included in Appcelerator Desktop which is reliant upon a client-side language, Javascript.</p>
<p>This confuses me. Can you run PHP code that interacts with say a MySQL database, or even SQLlite?</p>
<p>Wouldn&#39;t this mean the end-user has to have MySQL, or other libraries pre-installed on their machine, or is packaged&#x2F;bundled in?</p>
<p>Thus, I would like further information on Appcelerator Desktop and if there are sample downloads, examples, source code I can play around with, even better.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>Let me try to give a big picture:<br>The main idea behind Titanium Desktop is to have the same UI, and nearly the same codebase, for an application that runs on the Desktop and as a webapp in a browser. Similar approaches are Adobe AIR, WPF&#x2F;Silverlight and Mozilla Chromeless. But even if you develop for the desktop only, you might be interested in such a solution, because HTML&#x2F;CSS gives you a very flexible UI, where you can do things that are hard to do, or even impossible to do, with GUI-libraries like Windows.Forms, SWT or Qt. Attempts to overcome those limitations are WPF and JavaFX.</p>
<p>So the UI is made up by Webkit-rendered DOM-elements. You certainly don&#39;t &quot;need&quot; a framework like jQueryUI, but it maybe a good idea to use one, as this will save a lot of work. It depends on what you want to do. Titanium Desktop offers a lot more to a JavaScript-developer than a browser, such as access to the filesystem. But you might have stuff already written in PHP, Python or Ruby, or you have some special needs, that can&#39;t be done in JS.  Then you have the possibility to package any of these languages along with your application. There seems to be quite a big interest in using PHP, but Python is intergrated the best, as the folks of Appcelerator rely heavily on Python on their backend. JS-code can access functions written in those languages ( and vice versa, at least in Python). There is a Python-library for almost anything you can think of, so I wouldn&#39;t call Python a server-side language. You may build your own packages with certain versions of those languages, but I guess thats not an easy task.</p>
<p>You may use PHP to access MySQL in a Titanium Destop app. You won&#39;t need it for SQLite, as this is build in. There is certainly no easy way to bundle MySQL with a Titanium Desktop app, probably Oracle won&#39;t allow it anyway.</p>
<p>There is a strange lack of websites&#x2F;blogs dealing with the Titanium-Desktop-specific JS-stuff. Appcelerator offers hardly more than some introductory videos&#x2F;webcasts and the API-Reference, which also shows examples. That&#39;s not surprising as they are making their money by teaching people how to develop Titanium apps. But as Holge mentioned you can learn a lot by looking at the examples: KitchenSink and Tweetanium, which are also available for Desktop. Appcelerator is hosting them on github.com&#x2F;appcelerator. Keep in mind that most of your stuff will be pure HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS and there are tons of information on how to use that ;)</p>
