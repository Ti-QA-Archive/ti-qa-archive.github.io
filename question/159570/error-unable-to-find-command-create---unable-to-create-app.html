			<h1>[ERROR] Unable to find command &#34;create&#34; - unable to create app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all</p>
<p>Am unable to create a mobile app project in Titanium.  I get the following error:</p>
<p>[ERROR] Unable to find command &quot;create&quot;</p>
<p>I have the latet version of XCode as I have been writing native apps for almost a year now.  I thought it would be a good idea to jump onto the cross platform bandwagon.  I have heard much about Titanium and have been really impressed with applications thus far that have been deployed by other companies on the App Store.</p>
<p>Please can somebody advise as to what the issue and fix could be for this???  I have been following the entire process by the book and still no joy.  i do really want to develop apps with Titanium.  My only alternative in the meantime is Intel XDK.  Just FYI i have already installed Node.js onto my mac.</p>
<p>Any help that you can provide will be much appreciated.</p>

										<p><p>It almost sounds like the SDK is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Missing</li>
<li>stored under bad permissions</li>
</ol>
<p>The following should force the reinstall of the latest (as of this post) and use it as the default.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">titanium sdk install <span class="hljs-number">3.1</span><span class="hljs-number">.3</span>.GA --force --<span class="hljs-keyword">default</span>

										<p><p>An issue similar to yours, was the missing &#39;build&#39; command that occured for users that had already working ti installs but upgraded.</p>
<p>Per Chris Barber, try to set owner ship of the Titanium support files to yourself using this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">sudo chown -R <span class="hljs-escape">`w</span>hoami<span class="hljs-escape">` </span>~/Library/Application\ Support/Titanium

										<p><p>glad we could figure it out.  Sometimes the installers miss something, and with a system as complex as Titanium, it happens.  Mark the answer correct so others can find your question w&#x2F; the correct answer quickly.</p>

							<p>Hello Stephen</p>
<p>I have tried the line &quot;titanium sdk install 3.1.3.GA –force –default&quot;.  It installed the app via terminal and now I am able to create an app&#x2F;project.  </p>
<p>I am ever so grateful to you for your help and support.  I shall keep you updated nevertheless but so far so good and thank you ever so much :-)</p>
<p>Regards<br>Prashant</p>
