			<h1>Titanium Studio - Save password/Auto login</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>In Titanium Developer, the application would automatically save your credentials and auto log you in.  When I upgraded to Titanium Studio, the program forces me to enter by username and password every time it starts up.  My co-workers instance of Studio auto logs them in as expected.</p>
<p>Does anyone know how I might go about correcting the settings so that my instance of Studio saves my credentials and auto logs me in?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>Since it seems every answer on the Q&amp;A points back here, here is an additional update:</p>
<p>I had problems with this again (on my Mac, both on 10.6 and later on 10.8), and this solution was not working for me, this time after updating Studio from an old version to the current stable release. I ended up updating Studio to 3.0.2 (currently in beta, but can be installed from http:&#x2F;&#x2F;preview.appcelerator.com&#x2F;studio&#x2F;). I also used Keychain Access to grant access to equinox.secure.storage from everyone.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Michael.  On OS X, look in Applications -&gt; Utilities  and open the program called KeyChain Access.  In the Category Pain (lower left on my computer), select All Items.  Then, search for equinox.secure.storage using the search bar in the upper right of the window.  Open the resulting item by double clicking on  it.  There should be two tabs in the resulting window, click on the one labeled Access Control.  Click the radio button next to &quot;Allow all applications to access this item&quot; and click Save Changes.</p>

							<p>I am running TitaniumStudio on OS X. One machine auto logged in and the other did not.<br>This is how I fixed the one that didn&#39;t.</p>
<p>This issue was with the eclipse secure data storage. I don&#39;t think it was updating it.<br>Anyway, this is how I fixed it. </p>
<p>First I ran TitaniumStudio using the following command (from the Terminal) and logged in as normal:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-regexp">/Applications/</span>Titanium\ Studio<span class="hljs-regexp">/TitaniumStudio.app/</span>Contents<span class="hljs-regexp">/MacOS/</span>TitaniumStudio -eclipse.keyring ~<span class="hljs-regexp">/secure_storage</span>
</code></pre><p>When I exited, it created a new secure store file for me at ~&#x2F;secure_storage.</p>
<p>I made a back up of the existing default secure storage file (just in case):</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">mv ~/.eclipse/org<span class="hljs-class">.eclipse</span><span class="hljs-class">.equinox</span><span class="hljs-class">.security</span>/secure_storage ~/.eclipse/org<span class="hljs-class">.eclipse</span><span class="hljs-class">.equinox</span><span class="hljs-class">.security</span>/secure_storage.old
</code></pre><p>Then copied the newly generated one to the right location:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">mv ~/secure_storage ~/.eclipse/org<span class="hljs-class">.eclipse</span><span class="hljs-class">.equinox</span><span class="hljs-class">.security</span>/secure_storage`
</code></pre><p>Started up again and it just worked!</p>
<p>I hope that helps.</p>
<p>David</p>
