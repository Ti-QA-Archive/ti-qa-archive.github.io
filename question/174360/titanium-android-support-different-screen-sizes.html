			<h1>Titanium Android Support Different Screen Sizes</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,<br>    I was wondering how we support different screen sizes of android in Titanium. Currently i specify height, width, top and left in percentage but the issue with this approach is that images stretch when application runs on devices with different aspect ratio. Please suggest an approach to resolve this issue.</p>

							<p>This is a very common issue and answers to this were given a hundred times before. There is also a guide for this in the Android docs and you will find useful information in the Titanium docs too. You should also <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.de&#x2F;search?q=site%3Adeveloper.appcelerator.com+Titanium+Android+Support+Different+Screen+Sizes&amp;oq=site%3Adeveloper.appcelerator.com+Titanium+Android+Support+Different+Screen+Sizes&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.8327j0j8&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=91&amp;ie=UTF-8">search google</a>.</p>
<p>My recommendation is </p>
<ul>
<li><p>avoid percentage values, instead go for density independance. </p>
</li>
<li><p>When using Alloy, use <strong>form-factor</strong> tags in your views and styles. </p>
</li>
<li><p>read the guide on <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Using_density-specific_resources_on_Android">Using density-specific resources on Android</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>use <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Platform.Android-property-physicalSizeCategory">physicalSizeCategory</a> to determine the screen-size</p>
</li>
<li><p>provide different layouts for different screen sizes</p>
</li>
<li><p>use the same dimension on different screen densities</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, there are some techniques, conventions and tools that will help you to support all screens. There are also lots of solutions to related issues. If you can&#39;t find them, get back here with a question to a specific problem. In the meantime and to get a better understanding (or just as an overview) you can read this <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;training&#x2F;multiscreen&#x2F;index.html">Designing for Multiple Screens</a> - it&#39;s a good starting point to find the best approaches.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you Manuel and Malcolm, Both of your replies are really helpful. I have gone through all of the given links and it really increased my understanding of app designing. But the only question that arises in my mind is that when i will be designing different layout in Titanium using commonjs then i have to add checks for each screen size in my code and design the layout accordingly or is there any other better approach. thanks in advance</p>

										<p><p>When I used to work with commonJs and needed to provide different layouts for handhelds and tablets that is provided by the template (when you create a new classic titanium app in Titanium Studio). It should look similar to the KitchenSink app: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;KitchenSink&#x2F;blob&#x2F;stable&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;app.js">app.js (KitchenSink)</a> - This is where you should determine the platform &#x2F; formFactor and bootstrap your UI according to an appropriate require. This guide is old but may be useful if you still need to work with commonJs: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;MVC_Style_App_Framework">MVC Style App Framework</a> but as I see things like Ti.include in the snippets I advise to be careful with that. The <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator-titans&#x2F;App">Community App</a> may be a better example on how to branch UI across multiple devices.</p>

										<p><p>My question &quot;What sort of app are you creating?&quot; is meant to determine if you are creating a gsme or a standard UI app.  </p>
<p>If you are creating a standard UI app then you do not need to worry much about any of the resolutions.  There are some aspect ratio slight differences - but as using the techniques described in the links I provided about including using DP in the tiapp.xml and managing layouts with Ti.UI.FILL and Ti.UI.SIZE there are few if any occasions you have to be so specific that the automatic process is not handling for you.</p>
<p>In one of the point Manuel made; use the MVC - Alloy.  If you are creating this app as a re-write or this app is brand new - then Alloy will same you time and help you to manage the process and tweaks based on form factors.</p>
<p>You can and do still use CommonJS in Alloy - but rarely if ever for UI elements - those are mostly handled in XML and controllers.</p>
<p>Alloy has made the whole process simpler - and again - follow the points from my two links answers above and you are unlikely to hit any problems with layouts.</p>
<p>One note;  both of those answers were prior to Alloy being available, so just keep this in mind;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// without Alloy (most of those examples)</span>
{appname}<span class="hljs-regexp">/resources/</span>iphone/example.png
<span class="hljs-comment">// would change to</span>
{appname}<span class="hljs-regexp">/app/</span>assets<span class="hljs-regexp">/iphone/</span>example.png
</code></pre></p>

							<p>Android categorizes device screens using two general properties: size and density. You should expect that your app will be installed on devices with screens that range in both size and density. As such we should include some alternative resources that optimize our app’s appearance for different screen sizes and densities</p>
<ol>
<li><p>There are four generalized sizes: small, normal, large, xlarge.</p>
</li>
<li><p>And four generalized densities: low(ldpi), medium(mdpi), high(hdpi), extra high(xhdpi)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To declare different layouts and bitmaps we like to use for different screens, we must place these alternative resources in separate directories, similar to how we do for different language strings.</p>
<p>Also, be aware that the screens orientation (landscape or portrait) is considered a variation of screen.</p>
