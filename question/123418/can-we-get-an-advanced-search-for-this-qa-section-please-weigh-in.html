		<section>
			<p>Hey everyone.</p>
<p>This Q&amp;A tools is a GREAT resource, but it needs a better search.  Please weigh in by viewing and replying to this question.</p>
<p>Last night I needed to find an issue related to recent release of TI Studio.  </p>
<p>It would have been great if I could have used an advanced search to limit my results to recent posts (or at least sort by recent posts first), and also limit the results to answered questions.</p>
<p>TI is a GREAT product, this Q&amp;A is an invaluable resource, and I know the business model is based on paid support, but I don&#39;t think an advanced search option in this public area would take away from that.</p>
<p>Please share your thoughts here.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Peter Janett<br>New Media One</p>

							<div><p>There are so many more efficient forum solutions available. It pains me to think that Appc, a tech company, appears to care so little about supporting this vital resource that it continues to be a major headache THREE YEARS after Peter created this post.</p>
<p>For now, we deal with it because we have to. However, if someone has a suggestion for somehow pushing the issue with Appc, I would support it. There is simply no valid reason for forcing the community to work so hard to find solutions. In fact, Appc has every reason to make it as simple as possible,  I would think.</p>

							<p>Agreed. And also better SEO - I have to append <strong>-tag</strong> to all Google searches otherwise I just get unrelated results &quot;tagged&quot; with my keyword.</p>

										<p><p>I think the sort goes something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Best&quot; or accepted answer, if any, is first regardless of votes</li>
<li>Then sorted by number of votes, descending</li>
<li>Then sorted by date&#x2F;time, ascending</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea is to give the &quot;best&quot; answer first followed by other answers which are voted a higher rating on the theory they may be the most meaningful to a user visiting the thread.  When nothing is marked as the accepted answer, and nothing is voted up or down, then they appear chronological.</p>
<p>Comments always appear under their associated answers.</p>
<p>So there is some method to the madness.  And it works well enough on short threads.  But IMHO it is a complete bear on longer threads such as the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;5291&#x2F;tips-and-tricks-mobile---thread-to-share-some-experience-that-may-help-the-others">Tips and tricks</a> topic.  When that has a new comment added to an answer, just try and find it fast!  (Hint: I use the browser search function and look for &quot;minutes ago&quot; then &quot;hours ago&quot;.)</p>
