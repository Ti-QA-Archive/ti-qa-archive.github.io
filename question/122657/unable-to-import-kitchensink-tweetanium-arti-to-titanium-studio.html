		<section>
			<p>hi, im new with titanium studio and i got problem. im using OS X 10.6.7. when i imported kitchensink there is only api.jsca on App Explorer and when i clicked run button, there are no choice for choosing whether it will run on ipad, iphone, or android simulator, just Run Configuration.</p>
<p>But, if i just simply create new project it run smoothly with no problem. I tried to run that kitchensink on Titanium Developer it&#39;s OK. any idea?</p>
<p>i just upgrade my titanium SDK to 1.7.0 RC1 but nothing happened.</p>

							<p>When you import, are you selecting the folder that has the Tiapp.XML file in it?  Also, Tweetanium has several versions in the download package(incl. Desktop), so you probably want to drill down to the mobile subfolder before you try to import the project.</p>

										<p><p>i have keep checking the kitchensink folder on finder and found every file necessary such as tiapp.xml, licenses, etc. however, when i imported to titanium studio only api.jsca appeared. for tweetanium, i sure have chosen the subfolder for mobile. thats why its little bit weird. i checked the tutorial video and followed exactly same step as it.</p>

										<p><p>mmmmh… below is what I see in mine, using Ti Studio.  I know it doesn&#39;t solve the original question of why this is happening, but other similar posts have simply been solved by creating a new project, and copying and pasting all of the resource folder contents into the new project&#39;s resource folder (overwriting the app.js, of course).<br><img src="..&#x2F;Users&#x2F;verobrian&#x2F;Desktop&#x2F;KiSink.jpg &quot;t &quot;" alt="pic"></p>

										<p><p>Also, the latest Ti SDK is 1.7.1.  Separately, check GitHub for the version of KiSink that you have (latest avail is 1.7.0).  Also, you should do &quot;Project - Clean&quot; for the Kitchen Sink app in the Ti Studio menu, to do a clean build (and do that fairly often during any odd development issue).</p>

										<p><p>Okay, good - one last thing because I&#39;m stubborn:)…Some people do &quot;File - Import&quot; from the menu and then don&#39;t see the &quot;Import Existing Titanium Project&quot; option near the bottom of the dialog, under the Titanium folder, that must be selected.  Assuming you&#39;ve done that, I&#39;m not sure if I can be of any other help at this time.  Sorry.</p>

							<p>Wilson: are those project directories immediate children of the workspace directory? I had the exact same error when trying to import some of my old projects. Please see http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;124130&#x2F;cannot-import-mobile-project-in-studio for more info.</p>

										<p><p>Yes this problem exist with me, then I created new project and then re-add and replace all files and it works like a charm, I came to conclusion that kitchen sink is built on previous version and it is not compatible with new version so need to re-add the files</p>
