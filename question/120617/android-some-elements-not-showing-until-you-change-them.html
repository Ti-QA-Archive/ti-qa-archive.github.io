			<h1>Android: Some elements not showing until you change them</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>This is the same problem I had last week. Then it was with tabs, now it is with regular windows. Some elements just &quot;choose&quot; not to show up. They are defined EXACTLY the same as other elements (in this case labels) and they show on iOS. </p>
<p>However, on Android they will not show up until you change them AFTER the window loads. On the tab one last week, I grabbed the event focus from the tabgroup and then changed something arbitrary and then it magically showed.</p>
<p>I just did a test and did a click event on some other element (that was showing) and changed the text of the label that was not showing… and BOOM then it shows right away.</p>
<p>It seems to me that maybe it&#39;s a drawing issue.. and changing the text makes it re-draw.</p>
<p>Anyone dealt with this??  Anything you can do about it but the hackish thing of listening for the window focus event and changing something arbitrary?</p>

							<p>Is this really what it comes down to??</p>
<p>Me.Layout.Window.addEventListener(&#39;open&#39;, function() {<br>    lblExample.text = &#39;xxxxxx &#39;;<br>});</p>
<p>Note the irrelevant space at the end of the string… because I have to <em>change</em> it from its previous setting to make it redraw. I have three labels in this particular window that are not drawing.  So I&#39;m going to need to do this for each of them. Not the end of the world now that I know it, I guess… but WTF?? And how do I know others won&#39;t randomly decide not to draw on other phones or updates. So do I need to wait to define all text after window open event fires??</p>

							<p>I had trouble with buttons doing that, if I used percents for sizing (ie width:100%).  Can we see the label code?</p>
