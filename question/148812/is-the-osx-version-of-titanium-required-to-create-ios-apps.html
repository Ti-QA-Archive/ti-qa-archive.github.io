										<p><p>I realize that a Mac with XCode is required for sure. Are you saying that installing Titanium Studio on OSX is also required? There is no way to export an XCode project from Windows?</p>

										<p><p>The reason why you would be requiring titanium ios too because titanium from windows would be producing java files and not xcode files so you would be requiring titanium for  mac osx to convert it into xcode Do you understand now?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>Yes, I understand that. Other cross-platform solutions allow you to create iOS apps from Windows (as long as you build them on a Mac) by having bridging scripts that create an XCode project from whatever the Windows IDE spits out. I&#39;m getting that Appcelerator does not offer this kind of functionality.</p>

										<p><p>Actually the benefit of the titanium is that it ultimately use the native code and not just wrap the html which slows down the performance of app</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>And so what does this mean for future Windows 8 support. The Windows 8 Emulator runs only on Windows 8 just like the iOS Emulator runs only on OSX. How would I be able to use an IDE running on just one OS to build to iOS and Windows 8? Without some kind of bridging script or other solution, this would be impossible.</p>

										<p><p>Actually on the above surface titanium uses the javascript for all platforms so you would be pasting the javascript of mac in windows and it would give you the app for windows</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>No, this will not work unfortunately. Because you will Xcode if you want to generate the ObjectiveC code in the first place.</p>
<p>Hope this made it clear for you.</p>
