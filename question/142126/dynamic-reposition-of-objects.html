			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have an issue with dynamic position of objects.</p>
<p>On different screens, when orientation changes, I call a specific function for the current window, which changes the position of the contained objects. Mainly, this is to ensure that objects do not overlap once the screen has been rotated.</p>
<p>That function scans all objects in the different views of the window and modify the position based on custom properties of each object (like: topMargin, bottomMargin) etc …</p>
<p>The issue is that it seems that the layout udpates are not taken into consideration quickly enough. In other words and to make it easier to understand, i have to pause about 50 milliseconds after each object so that during the next loop, the next object properties are properly updated (based on the preceding one).</p>
<p>I have tried to include the code updating the properties into a </p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">object</span><span class="hljs-class">.StartLayout</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">//change the properties </span>
<span class="hljs-tag">object</span>.finishLayout
</code></pre><p>but it does not work. Only the 50 ms pause seem to give time enough to the app to take the changes into consideration.</p>
<p>While this could be fine (although difficult to accept) on a simple window (only a label and a window), there is 5 or more object that is not acceptable anymore.</p>
<p>Has anybody ever had an issue with layout properties not being updated fast enough ?<br>Note: This occurs both in IOS and ANDROID</p>
<p>thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Ti : 2.1.2</p>
