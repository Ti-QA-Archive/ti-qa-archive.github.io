			<p>Is there a way to remove some apps from my dashboard?  For some reason I have a TON of apps, some were when I was doing some testing, so I have a few &#39;mytest&#39; and things like that.  I can deactivate them, but I want them gone completely.</p>

							<p>When you click on APPS, there would be an option in the drop down, which would say ALL APPS, there against each app there will be a delete button, press it and delete the selected app.</p>

							<p>Not for me.  In the Active Apps all that does is make it Inactive.  In the Inactive apps, there is no delete, which is what I&#39;m looking for in that section. </p>

							<p>I just found it in my Application Data, in my system it was in: </p>
<p>C:\Documents and Settings\myusername\Application Data\Titanium\appdata\com.appcelerator.titanium.developer\app_com.appcelerator.titanium.developer_0\0000000000000001.db</p>
<p>I just deleted that file and restarted Titanium, it asked me to login again, but it got rid of all the projects.  I just had to do the &quot;Import Project&quot; to open back up the projects I cared about.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if there is a better way, but when I grepped my directories for one of my projects, that was the only file that came up.</p>
