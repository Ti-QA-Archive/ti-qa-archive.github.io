		<section>
			<p>Is it possible to use Exit Games Photon Cloud API with Titanium? Im in planning stages of a menu based card game of sorts and wondering if I can take advantage of Exit Games Photon Cloud service to handle the multiplayer aspect. If not, is Titanium compatible with some sort of similar service? I&#39;d rather not host the backend but I will still need a similar set-up to what Exit offers with waiting rooms and the connections they describe. I dont need &quot;real time&quot; communication necessarily, just enough to allow players to enter a &quot;waiting room&quot; and select other players manually to play with, establish the connection, and play. Its a card based game and played in turns so like I said no need for &quot;real time&quot; communication just quick and sent to the correct person. I will support some back end mainly for player info database and the like and also push some other data out on player request, I just dont want to develop and support the connection protocols. </p>
<p>Photon might even be a bit much for my project but their rooms, matchmaking and event pushes are what interests me… and the fact that they host the back end for that stuff. Of course I would have to pay for the service so I may look at other stuff but just wondering.</p>

							<p>Well, although you would be the first one to do it, I believe you can pull it off.</p>
<p>Looking at their documentation, they have a <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.exitgames.com&#x2F;photon-cloud&#x2F;SDKjavascript&#x2F;#cat-SDKs">JavaScript version of their SDK</a>. I haven&#39;t looked at it but my guess is that you could use it to make the calls to their cloud since Titanium supports external JavaScript libraries. (not all of them, but a lot of them)</p>
<p>Hope this gives you some pointers.</p>
