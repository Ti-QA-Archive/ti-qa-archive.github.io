			<h1>Titanium 3.1.3 NavigationWindow Partial Drag-Back Issue</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve run across an issue with Titanium 3.1.3.20130908095038 and the new Ti.UI.iOS.NavigationWindow for iOS 7.  One of the interface changes to iOS 7 is the ability to drag the current window to the right to pop it off the stack and return to the previous window (in addition to the old method of using navbar&#39;s back button).  If the user drags that window partway to the right, then back to the left, that top window remains on the stack, and no window-level events get fired.</p>
<p>The issue I&#39;m having relates to the partial drag that keeps the current window on the top.  Any events on the current window that follow that action still fire, but none of their resulting functions will push a new window onto the stack.  I&#39;ve verified that that new window object is properly set and that the NavigationWindow object is properly set, as well.  Both are, but that window does not go onto the stack and show in the UI.  If I follow these attempts with a full drag-back or back button click, then return to this same window, everything begins working, again.</p>
<p>This sample code assumes that the NavigationWindow already exists with the name &quot;navGroup&quot; and has at least one window hidden in the stack.  myButton is also attached to the current window at the time the window loads.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> NewWindow = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'ui/handheld/ios/NewWindow'</span>);

(<span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.myButton = Ti.UI.createButton({
    title: <span class="hljs-string">'My Button'</span>
})).addEventListener(
    <span class="hljs-string">'singletap'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>)</span>{
        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">window</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> NewWindow(navGroup);
        navGroup.push(<span class="hljs-built_in">window</span>);
    }
);

							<div><p>Quick update: When I close the current window, it appears that all the previous attempts to open the new window quickly fire, like they buffered into a queue.</p>

							<div><p>Where is this feature of the ability to drag the window (instead of using the back button) documented? </p>
<p>Or is this from some custom methods you have implemented? </p>
<p>In my experience, trying to do the window menu dragging feature can have issues if your window contains tableviews or scrollviews, which can &#39;steal&#39; the drag events. (particularly if the scroll&#x2F;tableview requires swipe functions themselves) </p>
<p>Very interested to know if the new NavigationWindow solves this.</p>

							<div><p>The window dragging feature is built into iOS 7. You can do it with the deprecated NavigationGroup and the new NavigationWindow.</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;m very surprised that this ability hasn&#39;t been mentioned anywhere in the docs. </p>
<p>Especially as this is a feature that quite a few people has attempted to build various modules to try and do in the previous versions.</p>

							<div><p>Here are some examples from stock apps in iOS 7.  To return to the previous window, touch and drag from the left of the screen toward the right of the screen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Safari: return to the previously visited page in history</li>
<li>Mail: return to the inbox from a message</li>
<li>Contacts: return to the main list from a specific contact</li>
<li>App Store: return to the main list from a specific app page</li>
<li>Notes: return to the main list from a specific note</li>
<li>Messages: return to the conversation list from a specific thread</li>
<li>Phone: return to the recent call log from details of a specific call</li>
<li>Settings: jump up the hierarchy from anywhere in the menu</li>

							<div><p>AFAIK this issue has been fixed in CI builds since 3.1.3.GA came out. I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll be merging it back in to 3.1.3.GA though.</p>
