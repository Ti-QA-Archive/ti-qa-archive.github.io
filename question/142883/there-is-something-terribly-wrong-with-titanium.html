							<p>This is a QA board for people who have questions and want to get answers. If you&#39;ve got a questions, please ask it in proper question format. It becomes really hard to help you out if we don&#39;t really know what the problem is. Seems like you may be having an issue with the way your ADB is acting, but what exactly is it? Can you NOT run the default project in the emulator? Are you having issues creating or launching projects? We can only help you if you provide enough information for us to do so. If you have any questions about what info is needed, please see the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;ask">Ask A Question</a> page for a detailed list of what is needed.</p>

							<p>the problem is centered around how TITANIUM communicates with ADB.EXE.<br>But since this has been known for at least two years, judging by all the posts I&#39;ve read on the subject, it seems Titanium either don&#39;t know how to fix it or aren&#39;t interested.<br>Titanium makes their money in the market they&#39;ve setup, not in the tool it self.</p>
<p>Rather sad….</p>

										<p><p>I noticed that I would get two instances of ADB.exe in my task manager.  Ending the process didn&#39;t work because it would just re-appear.<br>So I went into the Titanium IDE and used the &#39;Remove Launch&#39; button in the Consol Toolbar to close the Application Installer.   Then I returned to my Task Manager and was able to kill ADB.exe.</p>
<p>This cleared the path for my app to run on the next RUN command.</p>
<p>Sounds like Titanium isn&#39;t communicating properly with ADB.  Maybe it&#39;s not closing the connection to the emulator, I don&#39;t know.<br>It&#39;s also possible that on the first run of the emulator, Titanium doesn&#39;t wait long enough.  There should be a handshake for this, not simply a delay.</p>

										<p><p>Or, you could just deal with it.  Its a free tool that you didnt contribute at all to, lets thousands of people develop cross-platform apps without having to learn 2 specific languages, and provides easy ways to interact with the hardware.</p>
<p>So you get two adb process?  BFD.  Just keep the emulator open (never close the Android one when you&#39;re developing), and just kill the adb process every now and then.</p>
<p>Or go.  Won&#39;t miss you.</p>
