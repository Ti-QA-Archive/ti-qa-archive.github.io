			<h1>Packaging failes: global name &#39;true&#39; is not defined</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a serious problem: I can&#39;t package any of my desktop apps anymore. I always get the message &quot;Packaging failed with message: global name &#39;true&#39; is not defined&quot; and it stops.</p>
<p>This happens with the &quot;TiDev&quot; compiler as well as with Titanium Studio.</p>
<p>It happens when building for any platform, but Win &amp; Linux packages are created regardless if the error shows up, or not. Only mac packages aren&#39;t created at all.</p>
<p>I tried switching the compiler (TiDev &#x2F; TiStudio) - changed nothing. I tried a solution mentioned in another Thread, switching the &quot;Show Spash Screen&quot; option to &quot;Yes&quot;, which didn&#39;t help at all.</p>
<p>I have created completely new projects, copying the contents of my resources folder inside it - IT DIDN&#39;T HELP.</p>
<p>I have no clue how to solve this problem and I&#39;m really desperate…</p>

							<p>My own experience: </p>
<p>Build to Mac:<br>Works fine. This will then give you the download page link.</p>
<p>then, Build to Linux + Mac:</p>
<p>You get the &quot;global name &#39;true&#39; is not defined&quot; error, but when you visit the download page (though Studio will claim it doesn&#39;t exist - i had to go in via Ti Developer) you will see the Linux builds - so it&#39;s the mac one that fails. </p>
<p>So, build and download the linux packages, and throw them up somewhere else for people to actually go and grab them.</p>
<p>Then go and build Mac only, and grab that, and do the same thing- put it somewhere else for people to download. This is my current workaround. Can&#39;t comment on windows, since not targeting it at all.</p>
<p>hope this helps someone.</p>

										<p><p>Hey, I think there is a way to package mac desktop app locally. I read it some where. I lost the link other wise I definitely give you that link. Try to search on that. You may be able to package it on your local machine.</p>
