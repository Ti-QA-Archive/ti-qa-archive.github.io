							<p>I have just had the same problem. I don&#39;t if my solution will help, but here it is.</p>
<p>In init_normal_dirs() starting at line 30 in env.py I added to:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">self.install_dirs = <span class="hljs-special">[</span>
        xyz,  
        'C:<span class="hljs-command">\\</span>Documents and Settings<span class="hljs-command">\All</span> Users<span class="hljs-command">\Application</span> Data<span class="hljs-command">\Titanium</span>',
        script_dir + '<span class="hljs-command">\.</span>.<span class="hljs-command">\.</span>.<span class="hljs-command">\.</span>.'
    <span class="hljs-special">]</span>
</code></pre><p>This was needed because env.py hard codes: &#39;C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Titanium&#39; which on my Win XP installation is not correct.</p>
<p>Hope that helps,<br>Neville Franks</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m sorry I got that bitter! I just wanted to share that edit env.py is steel needed. </p>
<p>Looks like everytime I encouter some bug on Desktop SDK I got a bit jealousy that the mobile SDK seens to get all the attention from the appcelerator team.</p>

										<p><p>Allan,</p>
<p>To be honest, this wasn&#39;t something I have even been aware of. I am not required to come and answer questions on Q &amp; A, I do it to try and help folks. Currently I&#39;m the only one working on Desktop, and there have been various infrastructure issues. I can look at this when I get some time. I recently spent time getting PHP running on Lion, but haven&#39;t heard if this works for others yet or not.</p>
<p>The Windows webkit needs an upgrade severely, but I just can&#39;t do everything at once.</p>
<p>Is this the patch in env.py that your using:</p>
<p>self.install_dirs = [<br>        xyz,<br>        &#39;C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Titanium&#39;,<br>        script_dir + &#39;......&#39;<br>    ]</p>

										<p><p>BTW, this could be an issue in kboot.exe for Windows, not sure without looking at it, but it&#39;s inside kboot where the namespaces are extended for the app, as I recall.</p>

										<p><p>If you are the only one working on desktop SDK it proves two things for me:</p>
<p>1- Appcelerator need to pay more attention to desktop SDK and put a team to help you out.</p>
<p>2- Seens like it&#39;s some type of karma to the ones named Alan&#x2F;Allan that they need to work alone in projects that wold require more developers. :)</p>
<p>Yes, is that patch I&#39;m using.</p>
<p>This bug always spikes me because I go to Windows (VM) only to test if the app is working there, I prefer to use Linux to do my stuff.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m with you getting more help on Desktop, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s in the cards for the near term. I don&#39;t think they will drop support for Desktop, just that they have other fires at the moment and more people are using mobile, so they need to provide as much there as they can.</p>
<p>In the best world we would have an entire team working on desktop, but in the real world that doesn&#39;t always happen. When a customer has a problem with desktop, in some cases I need to look at it immediately, and other times not…just depends on the problem and the customer.</p>
<p>This is not an idea situation for desktop, but it is the situation at the moment.</p>
<p>I will try to give this a look next week, please do ping me so I don&#39;t forget about it and&#x2F;or allow it to slip through the cracks.</p>

										<p><p>Well I only started using Appcelerator this week and 1.1.0 is what was installed with my download. I then ran through the updates when Titanium was installed as per the Installation Guide and all I can see is 1.1.0 and 1.0.0.</p>
<p>So how am I supposed to know I am use an old version and how do I get these newer versions you allude to?</p>

										<p><p>You&#39;re talking about two different things. Titanium Desktop SDK 1.1.0 is the most current one, it has nothing to do with Titanium Mobile SDK 1.5.0 or 1.6.0.</p>

										<p><p>Ah, I see what I missed. I thought he was talking about the Mobile SDK, not the Desktop. Sorry for the misunderstanding :P I always forget there is a Desktop SDK and that it&#39;s only on 1.1.0.</p>
