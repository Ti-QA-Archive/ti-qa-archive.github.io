		<section>
			<p>Is it really worth paying for the videos, because i saw one post stating that its totally waste and not of any help as titanium has evolved a lot during these years.And they are still providing the old videos.</p>
<p>Please clarify my doubts as i am planning to take one of the subscription.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

							<div><p>I saw the videos again recently and don&#39;t think that much has changed - only Ti Studio being introduced, but the videos naturally focus on the code anyway.  Also, I got the impression the free videos were the older ones while the paid ones were newer.</p>

							<p>With the introduction of Ti Studio and deprication of Ti Developer the videos (which I recently paid for) somewhat useless as they still refer to Ti Developer.</p>

										<p><p>So are they really not of any use??? Because some people are saying that they provide new versions and some say older so i m really confuse now :(. Are they providing older version too with the indie annual subscription??</p>

										<p><p>I have an indie subscription and can tell you that the video are old and do not cover Ti Studio at all, though as some have pointed out much of the material is not editor&#x2F;ide oriented so still relevant.  I am still very disappointed that no new material has been provided as the current material could be potentially confusing to new users tying to use Ti Studio.</p>
