			<h1>XML or SQLite? That is the question...</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>So I am building an App for a client that lets the user add people to the app and each user gets a weekly chart where they can log whether they completed a task very well, ok or poorly.  Each person can have multiple tasks.</p>
<p>The client wants to give users the opportunity to compare the stats from the last week with the average of all times.</p>
<p>That brings up my question.</p>
<p>I need to keep a database of each user and this database has to keep record of even day since the person was added of how they performed their task.</p>
<p>I am very comfortable working with XML and not at all with SQL. Heck, I don&#39;t even get why there seems to be dozens of varieties of SQL.</p>
<p>I am asking those of you more familiar with databases if you think wether XML will be viable for this or if I should bite the bullet and do an intense, remedial, lighting, self-taught course on SQL? I don&#39;t really know what a schema is or what any SQL commands beyond SELECT * FROM tablename is completely foreign to me.</p>
<p>Opinions?</p>

							<p>Hi Raul</p>
<p>The requirement which you explained above really needs a Database which is smart enough to give you result fast. If you go with xml you might achieve what you wants but the speed and efficiency even the complexity will be more compare to any other Database. </p>
<p>In my opinion it will be good to go with Database and also Good that you start learning it as it will be sure going to help you a lot in the future with lots many projects. </p>
<p>Not to worry if you are totally unfamiliar with SQL, i believe that its the most easy to learn so you will sure get it in a day. </p>
<p>For mobile device SQLite is the Database you can use and its similar to mysql.</p>
<p>Wish you luck for learning and your project.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Nikunj</p>
