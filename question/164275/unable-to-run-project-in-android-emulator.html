							<p>Hello Dwayne,</p>
<p>Can you please check the ADT version in your machine? As there was issue with ADT version 22.6.1 as this update contains a bug (to be fixed in 22.6.2) that prevents the creation of AVDs from the command line. This impacts Studio and any other Android-related tooling that uses this functionality.<br>Please go through the link below for more information: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2014&#x2F;03&#x2F;updating-to-android-22-6-1-tools&#x2F;</p>
<p>I hope it solve your problem. </p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>I tried it and it did not work. In a desperate attempt to get my project tested in Android I manually downloaded the sdk and installed all the versions I needed after pointed the file path to Titanium.  It worked. The only problem is it failed on first try due to permission problems but that is easily resolved. </p>
<p>-Thanks</p>
