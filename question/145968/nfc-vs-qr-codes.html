			<h1>NFC vs QR codes</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Can someone confirm…<br>With a QR code i need to scan with an app to read the code. However any QR code app will read any QR code, displaying the information behind the QR code.</p>
<p>With NFC however if i use an app to write to an NFC tag if other phones that ARE nfc enabled dont have that app when they scan that tag nothing happens. </p>
<p>What is the point of NFC if i am required to have a specific app to read the tag. I may as well put a URL and get them to type it in. </p>
<p>So my question is is there a way around this? Writing to a tag for generic reading and not app specific reading?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Devices such as the nexus 7 android can read NFC chips and then using android intents farm out the process to an app or choice of apps.  If the NFC data is generic for example a web URL then it simply launches a web browser.</p>
<p>So in that case, there is nothing special and no other app needed.</p>
<p>However, if you have more specific data on the NFC chip you can do more, a product or shipping code for example.  As the data is specific then you would have an app to handle that, usually to speed up a process an improve accuracy.</p>
<p>But as your example only requires a URL then the OS will handle that for you and unlike a arcade it does not have to have ANY specific app open to read it as that process is automatic.  So in this case NFC is much simpler than a QR code.</p>

										<p><p>I have just written a new URL to my NFC tag and then tapped it to the back of my Nexus 7 and it immediately launched chrome and visited my website.</p>
<p>I did not have to choose anything, press anything - just simply touch the back of the nexus and there I was.  I was out of all apps at the time and just on the standard Android launcher screen prior to tapping the card.</p>
<p>For interest I used <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.nxp.nfc.tagwriter&amp;hl=en">NFC TagWriter by NXP</a>, got good reviews and is free.  See if that improves your situation.</p>

										<p><p>I tried NXP tag writer and it worked fine. So i suppose its how they are writing to the tag. If the application is purposefully writing the tag with a wrapper then it will enforce using the app.</p>
<p>My only issue with the app is that its very simple in that you can&#39;t write many thing to the tag. I would like to write to the tag to turn on blue tooth etc.</p>
<p>So that is my next step to figure how to do that generically…</p>
<p>any ideas…<br>BTW Malcolm i am now following you on twitter :)<br>Ilan</p>

										<p><p>I am with you, I want more functions.  I have no answers now but I am now (because of you) very interested in NFC.</p>
<p>I only had one hanging around so I used that - I have now ordered loads :)  I will let you know how I get on.</p>
<p>Do not forget to mark this as answered if you think it is - in the hopes other can learn from what we found.</p>
