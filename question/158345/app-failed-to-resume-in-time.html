			<h1>App failed to resume in time</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>We are having a lot of users who are experiencing big problems with our app. The app is using background location and the crash logs say &quot;App failed to resume in time&quot;. As far as I can understand, there is something in the Titanium SDK (3.1.2) that is causing this, since the javascript processing should reasonably not disturb the wakeup process. So far, everyone who has had problems have been using iOS7.</p>
<p>I am not sure how to file this possible bug, since we have not managed to produce a small code example that securely can reproduce this problem. </p>
<p>Since there is no support email address on Appcelerator that I know of, I have no other option that posting this problem here.</p>

							<div><p>Can someone at Appcelerator provide answer to the following question: When in background mode (using for example background location), what happens to changes to the gui that the javascript code does (for example text label changes, view positions etc)? Are they performed right away, or are they queued and executed as soon as app comes back to foreground?</p>

							<p>I will have to reply to my own question: One thing that can go wrong (and what is probably the problem in my particular case) is to do lots of operations on UI elements while in background. Those operations are queued up and executed as soon as app resumes. If there are many such things to do, the app might not resume in time, and thus crash.</p>
<p>There are probably more things that can go wrong, but this is probably a quite common mistake.</p>

							<p>You said yourself. You haven&#39;t been able to provide <strong>any</strong> sample code to reproduce your issue. Also, keep in mind that Titanium is an open-source product and while it is developed by Appcelerator, they are in <strong>no way</strong> obligated to offer you support for your particular issue (that you cannot even reproduce I might add) Unless, you decide to subscribe to a paid support plan.</p>
<p>Of course, you can create a ticket on the community JIRA tool (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org</a>) and follow its progress. But as I said earlier, you will <strong>need a reproducible test case</strong> if you want someone to have a look at it.</p>

										<p><p>I was not expecting someone to present a ready made solution to the problem, but merely to provide ideas on what kind of things that could lead to this kind of behavior. I have some experience with coding, and usually there are not a huge number of mistakes you can do in situations like this. </p>
<p>Luckily, I have now managed find just such thing: when you do stuff on the UI while in background mode, those things are queued up and executed as soon as the app resumes. And that would have been a pretty nice reply to my question, and one that would have been possibly without any sample code presented.</p>
<p>I am sorry if I phrased my question badly.</p>
