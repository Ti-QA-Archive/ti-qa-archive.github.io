		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Appcelerator working on the adaptation of new mobile devices, such as connected watches? Galaxy Gear (Android and Tizen) are interesting. The next Moto 360 (Android) also seem very exciting.</p>
<p>it is exciting to think about all the new possibilities that we offer these new wearables devices.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The standard answer for these sorts of things is that Appcelerator will generally support changes to SDKs when they go live at least for compatibility at launch and more afterwards. </p>
<p>These are special cases as neither are actually Android SDKs, the Android Wear is its own SDK.  Galaxy Gear is a limited device in that only some handheld devices can actually use it and this has nothing to do with Android proper - it is Samsungs own offering.</p>
<p>For both of these the answer is always wait and see.</p>
<p>However I do know that there is much interest in Android Wear and as I understand it from (very) early looks it may be possible to bring some of the elements into the main solution.  Watch this space.</p>
<p>Keep in mind whilst I have more knowledge than many on this subject I am NOT an Appcelerator employee and the internal product roadmap is not publicly published and even internally it is subject to revision as the mobile landscape changes.</p>

										<p><p>As I said, there are efforts to bring some (maybe all) things into the Titanium solutions.  But keep in mind that Appcelerator Titanium is designed to create cross platform apps for handhelds, tablets and mobile web solutions.  There are significant changes occurring to the core of Titanium to allow for an even greater range of compatibility.</p>
<p>BTW the WinDev solution for Galaxy Gear is not park of Android SDK - this is why this is currently not linked, that solution is a distinct and separate dev environment to the Android SKD itself.</p>

										<p><p>As of now (post Google I&#x2F;O 2014) Samsung Gear &#39;Live&#39; and soon to be public Moto 360, are both very much a part of Android SDK&#39;s.  You program notifications to the wear device to act on via the Android SDK.  The Gear Live is not Samsung specific as were the 2 or Fit but tied into 4.4 and L no differently than say the LG watch.</p>

							<p>ok, thank you Malcom.</p>
<p>I hope qu&#39;Appcelerator already working on these products! There are already platform development tools that build for the Galaxy Gear (ie Windev http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ObudJe2xUT0).</p>

										<p><p>Quick tip; next time - please do not create a new answer when your contribution is actually a comment - it confuses things in the future when trying to work out relevance, simply add a comment to the answer it is related to, or if the additional information is a follow up to the question or general information then add it as a comment to your own question at the top.  You are NOT being told off.</p>
