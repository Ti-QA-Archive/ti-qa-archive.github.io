			<h1>Can&#39;t find iPhone or provisioning profile</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m stuck.</p>
<p>I have a registered iPhone plugged in, a development provisioning profile in xCode and a development certificate.</p>
<p>The &quot;Run on Device&quot; tab has found the WWDR Intermediate Certificate only, and consequently I can&#39;t put anything on my device.</p>
<p>What is the next step? What am I missing??</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your help Eddie, but I&#39;m afraid it is answers like this that are confusing a hell of a lot of people who are starting out with Titanium. The question remains - HOW does one add a provisioning profile?</p>
<p>There is no &quot;Add provisioning profile&quot; button, or &quot;Add&quot; development certificate, so your instruction is just adding to the confusion.</p>
<p>What there is, is an &quot;Upload&quot; button, which when clicked allows you to select a provisioning profile to add to your Titanium account.</p>
<p>For those stuck at this point, after lots of trial and error, this is the process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Xcode and go to Window &gt; Organiser</li>
<li>Click on Provisioning Profiles and right click on the one you want to add, then click on Reveal Profile in Finder - make a note of where the provisioning profile is located (probably &#x2F;Library&#x2F;MobileDevice&#x2F;Provisioning Profiles)</li>
<li>Go back to Titanium and click on Upload, selecting the provisioning profile you want to add</li>
<li>If all goes well, the provisioning profile will be added to your account and your phone, certificates etc. will also be found at this point.</li>
</ol>
<p>If it doesn&#39;t work, then someone else may have an answer.</p>

										<p><p>Ian,<br>I agree with the response pre-amble you gave to Eddie&#39;s answer.</p>
<p>I also found it quite frustrating getting around a new environment.</p>
<p>P.S. The solution you supply worked fine for me with the same problem symptoms.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>I couldn&#39;t right click in xcode, or find it in the library - so what I did was go to the apple dev site. Download the provisioning profile and then back in studio upload it from downloads.</p>
