			<h1>Unlicensed module error after upgrading</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am using the Barcode Scanner module by Scandit (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;3907?916047513), which is free. After being notified by Appcelerator that a new version is available, I downloaded it, put it into my project directory and changed the version in tiapp.xml to match the new version.</p>
<p>Immediately on starting the app I get an &#39;Unlicensed Modules Detected&#39; error.</p>
<p>This is a free module that I was prompted to upgrade, and after the upgrade it no longer works. I followed some advice in these threads:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;125625&#x2F;unlicensed-module">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;125625&#x2F;unlicensed-module</a><br><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;126870&#x2F;unlicensed-modules-detected-on-plus-modules">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;126870&#x2F;unlicensed-modules-detected-on-plus-modules</a></p>
<p>And got it to work again, but that solution involved removing the app from my products and adding it again, which subsequently broke the live version on iTunes!</p>
<p>Is this a problem with the module? Or am I doing something wrong in the upgrade process? This seems like either a serious gap in the whole upgrade procedure or a poorly documented option that is impossible to find.</p>
<p><strong>What is the best process for upgrading a module to its newest version?</strong></p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

							<p>Mohammed, that didnt work for me.. it is still not working right :(</p>
<p>I know Scandit have said that there is an issue.</p>
<p>They have rolled back their changes, and have said they are waiting for appcelerators approval process!</p>
<p>If you guys can give me any idea on how you fixed it that would help me a lot!!</p>
<p>Mohammed, i have done as i think you have suggested, changed guid in tiapp.xml to match that in the modules manifest for Android.</p>
<p>My apple app works fine?!</p>

										<p><p>Mohammad&#39;s answer doesn&#39;t work for me either. Scandit have rolled back their changes, so if you didn&#39;t change anything in terms of guid, just stick the new (or old) module into your folder and it will work again.</p>
<p>Scandit are awaiting advice from Appcelerator I believe.</p>
<p>I personally did these steps to get the version working (the new one before the rollback):</p>
<ul>
<li>Downloaded the new module and placed them in the android &#x2F; iphone directories.</li>
<li>Removed Scandit Barcode Scanner from &#39;My Products&#39; on the Appcelerator website.</li>
<li>Added Scandit Barcode Scanner back to &#39;My Products&#39; and assigned team members to it.</li>
<li>Created an empty project in Titanium Studio.</li>
<li>Copied the guid from the new empty projects&#39; tiapp.xml file and into my project&#39;s tiapp.xml file.</li>
</ul>
<p>This allowed the new version to work. There must be a better solution for all involved, because this kind of &#39;upgrade&#39; is a right pain.</p>
