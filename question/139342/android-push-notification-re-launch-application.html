							<p>I get this crash the first time starting my app after installation, but once restarted it&#39;s OK. We don&#39;t use push notifications. So far, only tested on v. 2.3.4 and 4.0.3.</p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t have the exact answer, but i would look into these 2 jira tickets that have been resolved. If there is any information it is giving you as a clue, that would be helpful to know. The original poster stated that it talked about issue 2373, which is not necessarily a Titanium problem, it is a way that the Android operating system functions and even native developers find ways to work with this.</p>

										<p><p>At the top of that page is a dropdown menu that stats what branch you are looking at. Make sure that you select &quot;Master&quot; from the dropdown and that will give you access to the newest builds, currently the 2.2.0</p>

							<p>The push notifications are a very important part of the application. I think that is not well documented the implementation of this.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll have to put android push notification for inactive until it is resolved.</p>
<p>Anyway, thank you very much Appcelerator team for their work.</p>

							<p>Hi, yes I resolve this issue by rewriting the whole application from sratch in native android java. Titanium is a joke. Don&#39;t loose your time anymore here. There&#39;s no solution and if there&#39;s one, it will cost you a lot of money to learn it.</p>

										<p><p>Almost every Android roadblock i&#39;ve run into, i&#39;ve been able to overcome. I will agree that Titaniums support for Android is lacking in comparison to iOS, but they are making some great progress. Coming from someone that is so highly promoting their knowledge of Titanium on your website, i&#39;m surprised to see you on here stating that it is a joke. Just because you couldn&#39;t figure it out, doesn&#39;t mean the platform is bad.</p>

										<p><p>About the website you&#39;re right. This will end soon. The fact is that this arguments is not just base on experiences, it is base on the reason that you cannot promote like they does to professional and let them stuck with all the problems. Also, they ask 30$&#x2F;month for the ios&#x2F;android urban airship module and they refuse to answer my questions. I&#39;m sorry but you can&#39;t ask money without giving support. I will never let a client that pay well without support. It&#39;s not totaly worst, but I can&#39;t recommand titanium for my customer. And I&#39;m not the only one. Before making m opinion, I use the develop two cross platform app and study a lot of documentation and pass the two exams. I think I deserve the right to express my self. Thank for your comment.</p>

										<p><p>No one said you couldn&#39;t have an opinion, but trashing the platform is hardly helping the person who is asking for help. You simply could have said you don&#39;t have the answer, or stated that you decided to code natively without calling Titanium as a whole a joke.</p>
