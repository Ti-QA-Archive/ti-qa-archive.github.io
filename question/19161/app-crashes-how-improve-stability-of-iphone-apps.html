			<h1>App Crashes. How improve stability of iPhone Apps?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I have some issues with the stability of my titanium iphone app. It crashes randomly. But i can´t reproduce the crashes in detail. But the crashes mostly occur when using a slider that causes many labels to change its values. Also when scrolling in a table view where each row contains controls and labels. Each row can be added dynamically. And writing&#x2F;reading to&#x2F;from the memory of the iphone via Titanium.App.Properties.setList are the most commen tasks in my application. </p>
<p>Are there any tips in general how to avoid the crashes? It sounds to me like memory leak issues, because the crashes occur randomly. Can I do some memory management in my app? Is there a Garbage Collection in Titanium? </p>
<p>It it important to fix this javascript warnings? &#39;functionname&#39; was used before it was defined.</p>
<p>many thx for your help,<br>florian</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>For custom tableviews, are you sure you set the className ? this is very important, and is telling the OS to render the rows using the same template for the same type of rows, to improve the memory and cpu usage.</p>

							<p>I also see some crashes in my table rows but when I give each of them a unique classname, even all of them have same layout and structure, it became more stable…. kind of opposite of what Tamas said…. I wonder why?</p>

							<p>Hello, the className hint helped a lot. The app is much more stable now. I used same className for rows that have the same layout. But sometimes crashes still occur. My application is tab-based. In 2 tabs i have basically table views with many rows and hasChild true. Sometimes you must click &quot;back&quot; 5 times to arrive at the top level table view again. I guess all top windows then are still in memory. Perhaps it could be a good idea to navigate back to top level table view to make the children ready for &quot;garbage collection&quot;. Or just create the tab windows when they are needed. I will give it a try. thx, florian</p>
