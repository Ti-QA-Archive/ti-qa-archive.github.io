			<h1>ACS Push Notifications - timing</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m using ACS in my Titanium iOS app for push notifications.  I&#39;ve been able to register and subscribe (I can see it is subscribed when managing My Apps online.  I&#39;ve then sent out a few test notifications from the Manage your App tool.  It&#39;s taking about an hour to get the notification and sometimes I don&#39;t get them at all or I haven&#39;t yet.  I was hoping to set this up as an alarm alert but if it will take hours to get that will not work.  Anyone know how long the notification take to go through using ACS?  Is there a way to schedule notifications?  Any other suggestions for creating alerts at specific times?</p>

							<p>Hi Judy,</p>
<p>For scheduling notification, it is not support currently. Maybe we will add new feature for sending scheduled notification in the future, but it has not been discussed.</p>
<p>For lost notifications, just want to remind you that, do not add &quot;aps&quot; into your payload json, and put &quot;sound&quot;, &quot;alert&quot;, &quot;badge&quot; into second level inner json. Because we support both iOS and Android, we will pick up &quot;sound&quot;, &quot;alert&quot;, &quot;badge&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;, &quot;title&quot; etc, and put them into correct place as needed. Please refer to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.appcelerator.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;android#push">our document for push notifications</a> about json payload.</p>
<p>Maybe you didn&#39;t meet that problem I mentioned above, just a reminder to ensure there is no format problem on payload.</p>
