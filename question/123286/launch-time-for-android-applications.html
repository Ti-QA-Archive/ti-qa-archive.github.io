			<h1>Launch time for Android applications</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m not sure if this is an Android specific problem or related to Titanium, but the launch time for my application seems to be more or less proportional to the size of the application.<br>My application contains a lot of images and sounds - all in all it sums up to about 50MB. Launching the application on a Samsung Galaxy S2 takes 4 seconds, on an LG-E720 it takes 20 seconds!<br>Removing the folder which contains most of the images and sounds, leaving the application size at 10 MB the launching times are 1 second and 4 seconds respectively.</p>
<p>Now, is that normal? I do not find launch times like this acceptable. Is there any way I can influence this? </p>
<p>(I&#39;m using Titanium SDK 1.7.1 and Android target sdk 8, min sdk 7)</p>

							<p>To answer my own question partly. The launch time doesn&#39;t seem to correspond to the actual size of the app, but with the number of files that are contained.<br>If instead of having all the subfolders with the images, files and sounds I put in one dummy file of the same size like all the media together the launch time speeds up to a reasonable time again.<br>Does anyone know if there some trick to deal with a huge amount of files (~6000)?</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve had some problems with the launch time of an Android app myself. The issue, however, was the number of JavaScript files that were included by using Ti.include. </p>
<p>I included about 30 files, some of which contained more than 800 lines of code. The start-up time was way too slow. My app started in about 8 seconds on the Galaxy S. I wanted to reduce it to about 2 seconds (which is reasonable). </p>
<p>First I merged all files with the packager juicer to one JavaScript-file. This way launch time was reduced to 4 seconds. Which is still too slow in my opinion.</p>
<p>Then I read that when the final package for distribution is compiled, the JavaScript code is compiled to bytecode. It is possible to enable byte code compilation for development mode by adding the following line to <em>tiapp.xml</em>:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">property</span> <span class="hljs-property">name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"ti.android.compilejs"</span> type=<span class="hljs-string">"bool"</span>&gt;<span class="hljs-constant">true</span>&lt;/<span class="hljs-keyword">property</span>&gt;
</code></pre><p>Have a try and see if this helps. I would like to learn your findings.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Mark,<br>Thanks for the tip! My app is still rather small code wise, so using the compilejs  property didn&#39;t speed up the launch by much, but I did see an improvement of a second or something. </p>
<p>The real problem is&#x2F;was indeed the huge amount of files in my Resource folder.</p>
<p>But it&#39;s good to know that once my code has grown bigger I get a more realistic launch time result when I use the compilejs property.</p>

										<p><p>Hi, unfortunately not so far. I&#39;ve changed the design to having only a small portion of the data in the resource folder and downloading the rest on demand. </p>
<p>This still doesn&#39;t really help, because now I have the problem that getting the (few) data from resources to the data directory (which is necessary, because in the end I need all my data in one single place) takes a lot of time - so I didn&#39;t gain anything. </p>
<p>Still trying to find a way around that new problem now.. Never gets boring.. ;)</p>
