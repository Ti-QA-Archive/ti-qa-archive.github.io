<p>Now whilst I agree that Titanium&#x2F;Appcelerator development might be somewhat faster&#x2F;easier, it doesn’t necessarily mean that it is better. A common problem that I’ve run into with Appcelerator projects was incapability to effectively do a background work, or multithreading in other words. Say we’ve had the iOS app dounload and process some data, including resizing images and creating and storing the thumbnails in devices cache. This was nothing but a pain with Appcelerator, which was effectively blocking the UI and thus greatly reducing user’s experience with the app. If we needed performance or some special native stuff, we had to create module in objective-c, which then added the total time needed for development, effectively ruining our great idea of RAD development with Titanium…</p>
<p>But to be fair, if you want to create a simple multiplatform app quickly (i.e. app that shows splashscreen and two lines of text), Titanium is a great way to start.</p>

<p>please reply to this query is there any work around for doing background tasks for titanium your prompt  reply would help us in deciding titanium</p>
<p>thanks</p>

							<div><p>What is your definition of a &quot;background task&quot;? The commentary you mention has to do with multithreading and holding up the main UI thread with resource intensive tasks. Typically &quot;background tasks&quot; speak to actions you wish to perform while the app is placed in the background (the app is open, its just not the app that is currently in the foreground).</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I am confused by your question.  It starts off asking; &quot;about background tasks can tianium can do it ???&quot; but then quickly moves to being a shopping list of complaints you have have with little or no substance to those points.  It then ends with &quot;app that shows splashscreen and two lines of text&quot;.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;Now whilst I agree that Titanium&#x2F;Appcelerator development might be somewhat faster&#x2F;easier, it doesn’t necessarily mean that it is better.&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>It also does not mean it is worse and it does not mean that your opinion based on <strong>ONE</strong> day of usage has ANY merit whatsoever.  How much time have you;</p>
<ul>
<li>spent understanding the platform?</li>
<li>refining your techniques?</li>
<li>testing out how each part works?</li>
<li>determining which methodologies you will use for each part of your app?</li>
<li>what approach you will take to solving each section of the app?</li>
<li>what storage needs do you have and what is the right answer? </li>
</ul>
<p>You then reference an article that is 3 years old by someone who was incapable of using the platform mostly due to a lack of their skill and most due to his fundamental lack of understanding.  This article and most of those commenting that agreed - still believed that html5 was going to be the app savour.  BTW html5 would not then nor now allow you to achieve ANYTHING you mentioned above.  The sensible bunch of commenter&#39;s fell into two main categories ;</p>
<ul>
<li>This looks good and is going somewhere</li>
<li>This is good what are you talking about</li>
</ul>
<p>Given this is three years old and the platform like all dev platforms have matured - I was making many apps at this time using Titanium all for Blue Chips.  So if you are choosing to rely on such outdated and moronic information then I am afraid there is no hope and anything I say will wash straight over you.</p>
<p>If however your rant, insults and references to pointless commentary by a single incompetent then we can move forwards.</p>
<p>You mentioned background tasks but seem to be confused by what that phrase actually means.  Background tasks occur when the app is no longer in the foreground.  So either when the user has a different app running, the home screen displayed or the phone is in standby mode.  iOS has recently gained improved options for background tasks (keep in mind actual background tasks are controller by the OS and have only been available for the past couple of iOS versions).  The ability to download large files using the OS to manage this is now built into iOS and we have access.  There are rules to how it can be used - the same rules apply to all apps built by all people on all dev platforms.</p>
<p>If you actually mean multi-threading then that is not the same thing.  That allows several process to be run at the same time - or at least seem to be.  We have always had this - long before mobiles, long before desktops and long before mainframes - it is a simple concept and requires zero OS help.  There are some helpers from the OS or differing levels depending on the need - however it is a devs job to actually do some dev.</p>
<p>You should look up time-slicing - this is a concept and NOT a developmental feature.  Once you get that idea then everything else falls into place.</p>
<p>Appcelerator Titanium is a great tool for professionals and amateurs alike.  Those who put in real effort get excellent rewarding results and a profitable future.  The others do not.  If you are looking for a dev system that lets you press a few buttons and kicks out a generic app - Titanium is not for you.  Whilst it is easy and fast it does not skimp on capabilities just so devs do not have to actually be devs.</p>
<p>Yes I am biased;</p>
<ul>
<li>I have used this system for years, long before that article was written</li>
<li>Yes in the very early days there were limitations - but that was YEARS ago</li>
<li>The platform has matured beyond anything that could have been though back then</li>
<li>It has some stuff coming up (publicly announced) that takes it even further and faster than ObjC apps</li>
<li>I make a good living using it</li>
<li>I understand a few shortcomings on each platform are very out weighed by the ease of cross platform dev</li>
<li>I understand all of those can be plugged by creating modules - which is a rare need.</li>
</ul>
