			<h1>Client closed connection before receiving entire response</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>My application (which has worked fine for 6 months or so) now occasionally has a big problem whereby on doing a POST HTTPClient request to a REST Web Service, an error occurs even though the web service is correctly processing the data and returning the correct response to my app.</p>
<p>I am using Charles to look at the requests and responses and although everything is as it should be, very often the request has (shown inside of Charles) a status of &quot;Complete&quot; but with a Failure message of: </p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-string">"Client closed connection before receiving entire response"</span>
</code></pre><p>I have set the HTTPClient timeout to 400,000 (which I think is 40 seconds?).  Charles shows the failed response comes back after 20.85 seconds so I assume that the application is not timing out.</p>
<p>My application looks for a response code of &quot;1&quot; from the web service so that it knows the request was processed successfully but in these instances where the failure occurs, it obviously gets nothing back.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any idea what might be causing this?</p>
<p>Titanium SDK 2.1.3.GA<br>XCode 4.5.2</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<p>Richard</p>
