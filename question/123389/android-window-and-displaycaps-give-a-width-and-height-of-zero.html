			<h1>Android window and displayCaps give a width and height of zero</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am working on a custom &#39;widget&#39; like screen for iPad and Android Tablets. My implementation on iPad is working great but as for Android I am having issues. </p>
<p>What happens is that I lay out tiles on the screen and their size and position are based on device orientation and screen size.</p>
<p>For the iPad I create the window which works fine with my grid:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">gridW<span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> = Titanium.UI.createWindow({  
     url:<span class="hljs-string">'items/itemGrid.js'</span>,
     title:<span class="hljs-string">'Grid/Widget Board Test Screen'</span>,
     backgroundColor:<span class="hljs-string">'#ddd'</span>,
     navBarHidden:<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>,
});
</code></pre><p>Creating that same window on android will result in a window height and width of zero.</p>
<p>I have tried several different iterations in creating the window, the most recent being (the paths may be different per device but the path is correct):</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">gridWin = Titanium.UI.createWindow({  
    url:<span class="hljs-string">'views/item/itemGrid.js'</span>,
    title:<span class="hljs-string">'Grid/Widget Board Test Screen'</span>,
    backgroundColor:<span class="hljs-string">'#ddd'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-variable">width</span>:Ti.Platform.displayCaps.platformWidth,
    <span class="hljs-variable">height</span>:Ti.Platform.displayCaps.platformHeight,
});
</code></pre><p>Which if I output to the console the actual displayCaps the width and height are fine, meanwhile the window width and height will still read zero.</p>
<p>To make matters more confusing for me if I open the window, displayCaps then reads it&#39;s width and height are zero, and of course the window will also be zero for width and height.</p>
<p>I have even gone as far as instead of including the url file for the window, placing the code in an if statement for an android that does the exact same thing as what the ipad&#39;s itemGrid.js does and still my window and displayCaps are zero in both dimensions.</p>

							<p>Hi Benjamin.</p>
<p>Try this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">gridWin.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'open'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span> {
    Ti.API.<span class="hljs-built_in">debug</span>(gridWin.size.width);
    Ti.API.<span class="hljs-built_in">debug</span>(gridWin.size.height);
})
</code></pre><p>I hope you&#39;ll have &quot;ahaaaa&quot; moment. :D</p>

										<p><p>I did try that and the gridWin will get dimensions. The issue is that I then have to build the grid in the open event, which the user will then see it being built. This is a behavior that I do not like at all. I would like to pre-build the window before opening.</p>

										<p><p>Add them to the window and then open the window. If you open window before you create component, that will force redraw and you&#39;ll have poor user experience.</p>

										<p><p>The window opens based on a tab opening the window. The issue is that the dimensions are zero until the window opens.</p>

										<p><p>No, that&#39;s not an issue, it&#39;s the way Titanium works. Dimensions are calculated when window opens and not before.</p>

										<p><p>It is an issue for what I need. The iOS implementation of my grid does allow me to use window sizes before opening. I also attempted to set the width and height so I could then have access to them, but I can not. </p>
<p>It looks like for android I will have to force a redraw at the open event and draw it where the user can see it.</p>
