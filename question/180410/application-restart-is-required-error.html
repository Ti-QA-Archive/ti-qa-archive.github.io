							<p>What version of the API are you using? You need to compile using 3.4.1GA to support Lollipop.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, you need to update with 3.4.1 and make sure that fixes your issue on Lollipop. Remember, mobile apps are like kids, you need to feed, clothe and take care of them. Can&#39;t just code them once and send them out into the app store to fend for themselves forever… They need continual attention.</p>
