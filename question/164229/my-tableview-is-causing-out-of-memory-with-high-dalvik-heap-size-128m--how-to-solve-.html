			<h1>my TableView is causing &#39;Out Of Memory&#39; with high Dalvik Heap size (&gt;128M) ! How to solve ?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, </p>
<p>I am developing an Android App with TableView and TableViewRow. Each row consists of 2 images (50~150K each), 3 labels. The images and text are from remote server. The numbers of row is very much depends on the numbers of records in the server and can be from 100~300 rows. I am using lazy load.</p>
<p>The problem I am facing is &#39;Out Of Memory&#39; issue as the Heap size grow &gt;128M and subsequently the app crashed. This problem especially obvious when I scrolled the table up&#x2F;down &#39;very fast&#39;.</p>
<p>I had tried others methods and checking my code, don&#39;t seems to find any clue. Had been struggling for weeks.</p>
<p>Appreciate if anyone can advice me on this matter or a workable solution&#x2F;concept. Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>I am testing on Android device with Android SDK 4.4.2 and Ti SDK 3.2.2</p>

										<p><p>Goh Ten Fatt, I&#39;m curious if switching to ListView solved your problem? I&#39;m seeing the same issue with a tableview and can definitely switch but would prefer to just figure out why scrolling a tableview up and down is causing a memory issue… Seems very odd.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Michael, I had tested with &#39;ListView&#39; and the same problem exist. It doesn&#39;t solve my problem, so I still stick to use &#39;TableView&#39;. This problem seems to be worst if scroll up&#x2F;down at fast speed. Even I tried with &#39;closing&#39; the TableView, it doesn&#39;t release the memory. When I &#39;open&#39; the table again, the heap size keep adding up until &#39;out of memory&#39;. I suspect it could be a memory leak with TableView or GC doesn&#39;t act fast enough as compare to &#39;scroll&#39; up&#x2F;down speed. </p>
<p>My table row consist of 2 remote images view and 2 label with about 100 rows.  What I do now temporary is set &#39;android:largeHeap = true&#39; in  &#39;tiapp.xml&#39;.</p>
<p>what is your thought on this matter?</p>
