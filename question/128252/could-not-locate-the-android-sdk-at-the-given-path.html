			<p>Had a look through some of the other topics with this title, but had no joy with a solution.</p>
<p>How do you get the Android SDK to work with a new project in Titanium Studio!?</p>

<p>I am currently investigating some problems that seem to arise when users update their Android Tools packages to revisions 15 and 9.</p>
<p>Would you try something for me, please?</p>
<ul>
<li>close Studio, delete the system variable <em>ANDROID_SDK</em></li>
<li>start Studio and install the latest continuous build from the <em>master</em> branch of our <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;build.appcelerator.net&#x2F;">continuous builds</a> site, using Studio&#39;s <strong>Help &gt; Install Titanium SDK from URL</strong> function. Note that you don&#39;t need to use this version (1.8.0.1) when compiling your apps - you just need it for the python scripts that Studio will automatically use</li>
<li>restart Studio</li>
<li>try to configure the Android path again in Studio, being careful to click the apply button if necessary</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me know how you get on. I will check back frequently until this is resolved.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I am obviously very happy that you are back up and running, but your solution really should not be necessary, and we need to stop it happening for other users (if it can be corrected in our tools).</p>
<p>If anyone experiences this issue, I&#39;d really appreciate it if you would try the above steps and report your findings as a comment. This will really help us to resolve it for good.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>i tried this but no success. This morning i found out that titanium could not use my sdk any more. I can&#39;t find any things that might have changed could this be because of the sdk tools update? </p>
<p>is there already a fix for this problem?</p>

							<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for the quick reply.</p>
<p>Sorry I should have mentioned that I am a Mac user.</p>

							<p>Are you on Windows, Mac OS, Linux ?  Windows sometimes has difficulty with embedded spaces in paths so the default location for the SDK on windows should be something like c:\android_sdk<br>Also, you need to ensure your environment variables for ANDROID_SDK are set (in your .profile for Mac, or System Environment settings for Windows). Close&#x2F;Reopen TI Studio after any such change too</p>

							<p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>I went through that post and still no joy.</p>
<p>I was already able to access the Android SDK Manager.</p>
<p>I had managed to download and move the android-sdk-macosx to my Applications folder.</p>
<p>The problem I am having is that when I try to configure a new project in Titanium studio to use the Android SDK whenever I point the directory to the following &quot;&#x2F;Applications&#x2F;android-sdk-macosx&quot; the following error message appears &quot;Could not locate the Android SDK at the given path&quot;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

										<p><p>I remember something from an earlier post where you have to have certain versions of the SDK installed think it was 1.7 or something so by updating the SDK manager you probably also installed these required SDK&#39;s.</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve got Linux , ArchLinux version.<br>The problem I&#39;ve discover is with the python version<br>I&#39;ve resolved the problem in a little steps:<br>1.- Change the default version in Python removing the symbolic link with python3.2 to python2.7 ( rm &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;python , ln -s &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;python2.7 &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;python<br>2.- Execute again Titanium Studio . Change in Windows&#x2F;preferences&#x2F;Titatium and click &quot;restore defaults&quot; , close it . Open it again and browse to android sdk folder and it works.</p>
<p>Kind regards,<br>Javier</p>
