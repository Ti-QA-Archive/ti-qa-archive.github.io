			<h1>Android: iphone app to android errors</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello</p>
<p>I have a working iPhone app ready, now when I run it on android it gives a whole lot of errors.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve got a few questions.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Isn&#39;t it possible to determine the width by a percentage? (for example: width: &#39;80%&#39;;). I used this in my iPhone app and it works perfectly, but not in Android..</p>
</li>
<li><p>How do you have to set your navigation? I have a map &#39;pages&#39; where all my main pages are in, then i have submaps for every page their childwindow. Now when I have &#39;media&#39; for example, and I want to go to my twitter page (which is twitter.js in a folder named lets say mediaFolder), I do &#39;url: &quot;media&#x2F;twitter.js&quot;&#39;. Now this works on my iPhone app, but the android says it can&#39;t find that directory (now he searches from the root, and skips the pages folder where my main folders are in). </p>
</li>
<li><p>Can you set your background, or header for a row on android? I have created a row, and i want to set the header afterwards by &#39;row.setHeader(&#39;Header&#39;);&#39;. This works on my iPhone, but again, Android gives an error it doesn&#39;t recognize setHeader as a function.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Can anyone point out some mistakes i have made? Or tell me how I should do it?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>1: lately i found out that using width = &#39;80%&#39;; causing it not to show up initially in a table view. However this works fine when you create it and put in onto a window.</p>
<p>2: try putting ALL .js files in your resources directory, where the app.js is in. OR put them in the Resources&#x2F;Android directory</p>
<p>3: If i remember correctly it is row.header = &#39;value&#39;; but i am not sure about that, you should search the Q&amp;A and API for that one.</p>

										<p><p>Hey Kami. The width gives an error here, it says it cannot parse &#39;80%&#39; to an integer. About the .js files, they are in sub dirs for a nice structure, so I can find everything back fast, and the row.setHeader is a function too i guess, since it works fine on my iPhone app, or is this just for iPhone only? (didn&#39;t see that anywhere so i guess not?)</p>

										<p><p>Widht depends on what object you are using it, i guess some android objects dont accept the width %</p>
<p>i guessed you where gonna say that, cant you rename your files, so its still structured?</p>
<p>Even tho Titaniums is made to use code for both iPhone and Android, there are still alot of differences i guess, havent experienced iPhone yet, but i think its 100% chance that i run into bugs&#x2F;problems when converting my Android app to an iPhone app</p>

										<p><p>For now as I start the app on android it seems that it runs way better on iPhone. Also when I run it on android the app doesn&#39;t run smooth, it takes forever to load a page, while in iPhone it goes very smooth</p>

										<p><p>are you running it on the emulator or on a real phone for the Android,</p>
<p>The Android emulator is nicely said, crap. Takes ages to load and the performance of the emulator is alot slower then on a real phone. </p>
<p>I can imagine an iPhone app being smoother and faster due to the iPhone specifications.</p>

										<p><p>So if I test it on a real phone it should go way smoother? </p>
<p>And when running on a real phone, do I have to remove the app and re-install it every time? or just run it again</p>

										<p><p>It should go smoother, but it all depends on your coding and stuff</p>
<p>On the Android you simply press install on phone and you have the latest version.</p>
<p>Is the iPhone different in this then?</p>

										<p><p>ahh right, well the iPhone emulator is alot lighter and runs apps smoother then the Android emulator. A fact well known by many ;)</p>
<p>Also installing an app on Android should be pretty easy and free :)</p>

										<p><p>Yeah almost, but can you tell me how to put the 80% in android? Or do you really have to do a math calculate for the number and assign that to the width?<br>And can you never use the .setProperty on an object in Android?</p>

							<p>i never used .setProperty in Android, the only way is by trying out on different properties. Go debbuggin mode, which is a pain on Android emulator, but the only way to find this out is by trying.</p>
<p>For instance for the %, and as i said before, this does NOT work in a tableView!</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">win1 = Ti.UI.createWindow();
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> textBox = Ti.UI.createTextField({
    width: <span class="hljs-string">'80%'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-keyword">value</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'Testing the %'</span>,
    top: <span class="hljs-number">54</span>
});
win1.add(textBox);
win1.Open();
</code></pre><p>This should work ;) , try this out in a new project</p>
