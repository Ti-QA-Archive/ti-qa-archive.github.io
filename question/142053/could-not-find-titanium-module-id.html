			<h1>Could not find Titanium Module ID?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Can someone please advise me what may be causing my module to not be found in my project.  I followed the tutorial on how to create the Calc module and that worked fine.  Now I am creating my own module and I get the error that the module id can not be found.  I am working on a Windows 7 machine. The module is android made from and built from the command line.  I have the require line in my app.js and the module xml node in the tiapp.xml.  However the module can&#39;t be found. I see it there in the Modules folder but it can be found for some the reason.  I have checked for misspellings, cleaned the project and still nothing.<br>Thanks</p>

							<div><p>Your right and apologize for that but I am quite tired and frustrated at this point (not that its your fault) from the hours I&#39;ve put in just trying to get this installed correctly and now facing antoher error.  The application type is mobile. Titanium info is Titanium Studio, build: 2.1.2.201208301612<br>(c) Copyright 2012 by Appcelerator, Inc.  All rights reserved.</p>
<p>Build: jenkins-titanium-rcp-master-232 (origin&#x2F;master)<br>Date: 30 August 2012, 16:14:46<br>.  Platform and version Andriod 8. Host Operating system Windows 7 64-bit. I don&#39;t have a test case to provide you with and was looking for some guidance in generally on what the possible error&#x2F;problem was since I did the same thing I did for the calc tutorial.  Maybe its a bad assumption but should it matter whats in the module if it can&#39;t even be found? I wouldn&#39;t think so but hey wouldn&#39;t be the first time I was wrong. Is there anything else that I can provide that would help you identify what the problem may be? Here is the error:<br>[ERROR][TiJSError(  296)] (main) [336,6627] —– Titanium Javascript Runtime Error —–<br>[ERROR][TiJSError(  296)] (main) [1,6628] - In ti:&#x2F;module.js:372,8<br>[ERROR][TiJSError(  296)] (main) [0,6628] - Message: Uncaught Error: Requested module not found: org.jbr.ASpeaker<br>[ERROR][TiJSError(  296)] (main) [0,6628] - Source:     throw new Error(&quot;Requested module not found: &quot; + request);<br>[ERROR][V8Exception(  296)] Exception occurred at ti:&#x2F;module.js:372: Uncaught Error: Requested module not found: org.jbr.ASpeaker<br>Thanks,</p>
