			<p>Hi All </p>
<p>I found a really annoying bug would love a fix or a solution i can see the bug has been report here https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC-1660</p>
<p>I am using the latest titanium install and sdk 3.0.0.GA</p>
<p>I have my project structure within my Resources&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">appicon<span class="hljs-class">.png</span>
Default-<span class="hljs-number">568</span>h@<span class="hljs-number">2</span>x<span class="hljs-class">.png</span>
Default-Landscape<span class="hljs-class">.png</span>
Default-Portrait<span class="hljs-class">.png</span>
Default<span class="hljs-class">.png</span>
Default@<span class="hljs-number">2</span>x.png
</code></pre><p>Ok with all the files above i have opened in photoshop and change to my custom colour see image below.<br><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;WzAgcn">View Image</a></p>
<p>After i do a build i have notice that if i look in the build folder none of the resources have been updated with my custom screen see below<br><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;YjMWU9">View Image</a></p>
<p>I stupidly miss this bug as it worked fine on the simulator but not on the device and my app is now on the store and pops up with the custom loader screen which isn&#39;t good.</p>
<p>So if anyone can give me a solution to this i would really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Do a clean and rebuild titanium magic solution for everything did not work for me i have completely deleted the build folder and then rebuilt i have also tried project clean project many times, i have tried deleting each folder one by one and still no solution believe me i have tried everything as far as clean and rebuild goes.</p>
<p>I will always regenerate the titanium Default.png every time its so frustrating.</p>

							<p>Always try a clean build.  If that fails, a temp solution is to find where the Default.png is in the SDK you are using and place your files there.</p>

<p>I have tried overwriting the images in build&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;Resources with my custom ones in the Resources&#x2F;iphone which will work.</p>
<p>But as soon as i deploy to device or even store it does a full rebuild and the same thing happens it overwrites my custom images with titaniums powered by titanium default ones????</p>

							<p>For anyone else viewing this and expecting a proper solution without changing the Titanium folders read on.</p>
<p>Remove the iphone&#x2F;android folders containing the your custom splash screens, copy them to the desktop &#x2F; back them up.</p>
<p>While not strictly necessary rebuild the app without these folders. </p>
<p>Place the folders back into your app directory.</p>
<p>Rebuild and enjoy your splash screens.</p>
