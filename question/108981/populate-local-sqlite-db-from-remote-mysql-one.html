			<p>I&#39;m working out some logic, and am wondering if this is possible.  </p>
<p>Its for some data syncing, and basically my script might do some parsing on the server and I want to be able to bring some data changes and store them inmy local sqlite db.</p>

							<p>There are many approaches to syncing data, each with various pros and cons.  What works best for a given environment depends on a multitude of factors, none of which were given in the question.  So the only definitive answer I can give is yes, this is possible.</p>
<p>How you decide to implement it is another matter.  A few of the more obvious unknowns that impact that decision:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the data syncing bi-directional, or only server updates mobile?</li>
<li>If bi-directional, how collisions will be resolved.</li>
<li>The volume and frequency of changes compared to the total local db size</li>
<li>Whether the data on the device is read-only</li>
</ul>
<p>A few off the cuff alternatives to how to update data:</p>
<ul>
<li>xhr download of json data to be inserted&#x2F;updated in local db</li>
<li>xhr download of SQL statements to run against the database</li>
<li>xhr download of complete sql db to just replace local db</li>
<li>xhr download of a sql db with changes, then local transfer of data</li>
</ul>
<p>So yes, it is possible, but assuming the next question is &quot;how?&quot;, we really need a lot more information on the environment.  The more explicit the better.</p>

							<p>Well, its going to be bi-directional.</p>
<p>Basically, if they add&#x2F;edit&#x2F;delete information on the website, then I want it synced with the mobile app.</p>
<p>If they add&#x2F;edit&#x2F;delete on the mobile device, I want it sent to the website as well.</p>

										<p><p>It is certainly possible, but the devil is in the details.  The actual exchange of data is probably the easy to test and debug.</p>
<p>The real work is in deciding what data to send each direction, and how to resolve conflicts where both sides have changed the same data since the last sync operation.  That really isn&#39;t an appcelerator issue as much as it is just a logic and algorithm issue.</p>
<p>If you have multiple client phones syncing to the same server database, and they each are allowed to make changes on the device, the conflict resolution potentially becomes more complicated.</p>
<p>It sounds like you mostly want to send just changed records on each side to the other.  As a starting point, I&#39;d suggest each database keeps a &quot;dirty&quot; flag field with timestamp when it was changed.  When you sync, each side creates a result set of their own &quot;dirty&quot; records, converts to json format, and sends to the opposite side.</p>
<p>If the other side does not have the same record marked &quot;dirty&quot;, then you simply do an update (or insert).  The real complication comes when both sides are marked dirty.  Then you get into whether you require a user to decide what to do, or need the decisions to be automated at the expense of possibly making the wrong call.  Timestamps may help, or may be irrelevant depending on your data.  Time zone differences may need to be considered too, so you may prefer to store all update timestamps in UTC.</p>
<p>It gets way messier if multiple clients sync to the same database (unless the records can be subseted to a single user).</p>
<p>You may want to do web searches on bi-directional sync algorithms to help get the logic right.</p>

										<p><p>Well basically, I&#39;m thinking like this:</p>
<p>A user is on the website and adds&#x2F;edits&#x2F;deletes some information.<br>The queries generated are stored in a separate table</p>
<p>On the app, if the person is a user (this is optional), there will be a &#39;sync&#39; button.<br>If they press the sync button, it connects to this table and downloads the queries (I&#39;m assuming in a local array) and runs against the database.<br>After each query is run, it sends the id of the query back to the server to flag it as having run (it will be set to NOTrun by default) and I&#39;ll clean these up via cron job later.</p>
<p>On the app side, I&#39;m  thinking everytime I do an add&#x2F;edit&#x2F;delete, do the same thing, send it to the server to run.</p>
<p>Thoughts?  If it sounds good, I&#39;m wondering how to store a query in JSON on both the app and php side, and parse on both.</p>
<p>Finally, does Titanium support md5, so I can generate a unique key?</p>

										<p><p>You can generate a <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;latest&#x2F;Titanium.Utils.md5HexDigest-method.html">md5 hash</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of sync logic, if you do not process in real time you need to consider the ramifications of multiple sync operations with conflicting changes prior to the server processing the queue.</p>
<p>For converting sql result sets to json, I&#39;d suggest either generic web searches or even just this <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;search&#x2F;json%20result%20set">Q&amp;A</a> as a starting point.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m thinking if maybe when the app loads, if I do a sync then I should be ok.</p>
<p>I wasn&#39;t going to have web sync at all, but my brother in law who plans on using it a lot suggest the feature, saying it would be nice if his secretary could enter information and have it pushed to his device.</p>

<p>Its just a one-to-one sync, not multiple devices editing the same data.  I&#39;m going to store a username or some other key to differentiate it.  So at the most it will be one user on the device, and one on the app.  I doubt they are going to be doing it at the same time, most would use the website just to have a real keyboard.</p>
