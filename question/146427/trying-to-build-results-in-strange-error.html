			<p>Current error is such:</p>
<p><strong> BUILD FAILED </strong><br>The following build commands failed:<br>    Ld &quot;build&#x2F;Debug-iphonesimulator&#x2F;nib Corporate.app&#x2F;nib Corporate&quot; normal i386<br>(1 failure)</p>
<p>This happened after updating titanium studio (which brought along with it other problems which I&#39;ve now resolved). This is the only error I get, and can&#39;t for the life of me figure out what&#39;s going on. I read another question saying that having the two folders with the same name is no good - but nowhere in my app do a parent&#x2F;child have the same folder names - it only happens in the build. Any suggestions?</p>

							<p>hi,</p>
<p>as you said that you have updated titanium studio right..? so just try to restart titanium studio and then clean build your project and also remove your app from simulator or device and try again.</p>
<p>remember you should try to clean build your project..</p>

										<p><p>Yeah I&#39;ve tried this numerous times - Titanium doesn&#39;t even give the option to clean so I cleaned it manually - still no go. Some research I did stated that I need to define dependencies somehow, but apart from titanium, I don&#39;t have any dependencies =\</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your help, but as I just mentioned - Titanium does not give me the option - it&#39;s grayed out. Also, I&#39;ve cleaned it manually before, still doesn&#39;t help.</p>
