			<h1>Tableview performance on Android</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a very simple example of adding 25 rows to a tableview and its taking almost 3 seconds on android.  I&#39;ve tried a few things and nothings seems to positively impact performance.</p>
<p>The example code can be found here:<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;1541974</p>
<p>Is there anything that I can do to speed things up?</p>

							<p>Not sure why this thread came to the top of the list, but one thing you can do is give the same className to the table rows that have the same format. This will make it perform better if the rows have images in them.</p>

							<p>I tried your code out, and had to do the following to get it to show anything (on iPhone first):  removed layout=&#39;vertical&#39; at the top (got blank screen with this left in); removed &#39;row.title=&#39; as it overwrote rest of text on row; removed &#39;bottom: 60&#39; to prevent leaving a big gap on bottom of page (you may want that for something…?); removed the tmpView (per your comments, and it is not needed); removed the backgroundImage and SelectedImage (didn&#39;t have those); removed the initial var rd[] and tView.data=rd (not needed); and removed the timer code (no timer.js).</p>
<p>After that, the code worked fine on both iPhone and Android sims, using Android APIs 2.2, Ti Developer 1.2.2, and Ti Mobile 1.5.1.  Android Sim takes less than 2 seconds to display a 25-row table; 100 rows takes about 4.3 seconds.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that unlike the iPhone Sim, the Android Sim tends to run slower than the code on the device.  I timed the same 100 row creation on a Droid 2 and it took 2.1 seconds.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks a bunch for testing it out.  Your times look a little faster but in general it still seems slow.  Also, I guess not having a Mac to test iPhone on is going to leave me with lots of surprises when I finally try to test on Mac.  Thanks again for at least doing a sanity check for me.</p>

							<p>I believe I ran into a similar issue and I resolved it by removing background colors and&#x2F;or images from the table and row.</p>
<p>I forget which one it was, sorry, but I would suggest starting there.</p>
<p>I noticed you have both backgroundColor(s) and row images specified in the sample code you provided</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, during some testing I inadvertently added both.  My primary design just uses images and actually has no border or background color settings.  I still see very slow performance.</p>

										<p><p>I just took a look an my code, and I ended up removing the view also, I believe it impacted the performance I was seeing. I just ended up positioning the row content without the view to hold everything.</p>

							<p>I also had trouble with the android TableView. It is very slow and the &quot;data&quot; member variable doesn&#39;t work.  I created a &quot;table&quot; with bunch of labels and textfields and it works great.</p>

							<p>I had exactly the same. However, removing the font properties in all the labels seems to speed up enormously. For me 20 lines took about 4-5 seconds, now it shows in less then 1! </p>
<p>I didn&#39;t test it in your code, but mine is very similar. </p>
