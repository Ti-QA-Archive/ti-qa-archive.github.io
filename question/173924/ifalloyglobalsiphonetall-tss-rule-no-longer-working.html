		<section>
			<p>Per the document here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Alloy_Styles_and_Themes<br>Tried on SDK 3.2.3 and 3.2.2 and does not work</p>
<p>This was working yesterday and I can&#39;t get it to work anymore.</p>
<p>I need to style for iphone 3.5&quot; and iphone 4&quot; and it is doing the [if=Alloy.Globals.iPhoneTall] rule anyway.</p>
<p>I created a simple hello world app and it is STILL not working:</p>
<p>here is index.xml:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">Alloy</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">Window</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">class</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"container"</span>&gt;</span>
        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">Label</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">id</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"label"</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">onClick</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"doClick"</span>&gt;</span>Hello, World<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">Label</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">Window</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">Alloy</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>Here is the broken TSS:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">"<span class="hljs-class">.container</span>": <span class="hljs-rules">{
    <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">backgroundColor</span>:<span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"white"</span>
</span></span></span>},
"<span class="hljs-class">.container</span><span class="hljs-attr_selector">[if=Alloy.Globals.iPhoneTall]</span>": <span class="hljs-rules">{
    <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">backgroundColor</span>:<span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"red"</span>
</span></span></span>},
"<span class="hljs-tag">Label</span>": <span class="hljs-rules">{
    <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">width</span>:<span class="hljs-value"> Ti.UI.SIZE,
    height: Ti.UI.SIZE,
    color: <span class="hljs-string">"#000"</span>
</span></span></span>}
</code></pre><p>here is the alloy.js</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Alloy.Globals.iPhoneT<span class="hljs-literal">all</span> = (OS_IOS &amp;&amp; Ti.Platform.osname == <span class="hljs-string">"iphone"</span> &amp;&amp; Ti.Platform.displayCaps.platformHeight == <span class="hljs-number">568</span>); 
Ti.API.<span class="hljs-keyword">debug</span> (<span class="hljs-string">"iPhoneTall is "</span> + Alloy.Globals.iPhoneT<span class="hljs-literal">all</span>);`
</code></pre><p>The debug log is confirming that iPhoneTall will = true when it is 4&quot; and false when it is 3.5&quot;</p>
<p>BUT.  the the background is red even when iPhoneTall is false!</p>
<p>Please help</p>

<p>Also you can see in my debug that it was in fact setting to true and false correctly.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The new <strong>if</strong> conditonal Alloy View attribute is available from Alloy 1.4 and higher.  However TI SDK 3.2.2 &amp; Ti SDK 3.2.3 only come with Alloy 1.3.1.</p>
<p>You would have to have Alloy 1.4 installed.</p>
<p>A quick check for this would be open terminal and type;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-title">alloy</span> -v
</code></pre><p>What does this return?</p>

										<p><p>Sorry to be brash, just highly annoyed it worked yesterday - I checked and its version 1.3.1 - I also went to Help -&gt; Check for updates and it says no updates, then Help -&gt; Check for Titanium Updates - no new updates.  So how do I update this thing? download and install over?  Or uninstall &#x2F; download and install?  Just don&#39;t want to break anything.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>Ok wow, it has been a very long time since someone has been so rude to me when I was offering an answer and the starting point to ruling this out.  Not sure how to proceed here.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;release-notes&#x2F;?version=3.2.3.GA">3.2.3 release notes</a></li>

</ul>
<p>The section you refer to says;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Since Alloy 1.4, you can create custom queries to select which styles to apply in both the TSS and XML files. These query statements must return a boolean value. Custom query styles override all styles, that is, class, id, and markup element styles, except the ones defined as attributes in the XML file.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In <strong>Alloy XML Markup</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>if = Use a custom query to apply additional styles to the element (since Alloy 1.4.0). See Alloy Styles and Themes: Custom Query Styles for more details.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Each clearly state Alloy 1.4 is required.</p>
<p>So not sure how I am <strong>flat wrong</strong>. Whilst I understand you are frustrated; is annoying the person attempting to offer assistance going about it the correct way?</p>
<p>There are no publicly released GA or RC releases that have Alloy 1.4 included.</p>
<p>&quot;sorry to be brash&quot; is not sufficiently suitable as it implies you are correct! my information is still incorrect.  Especially when you choose to point out my apparent stupidity with big red test.</p>

										<p><p>I think its funny that you are </p>
<h4 id="flat-wrong">flat wrong</h4>
<p>but he still wants you to answer his follow up questions.</p>
<p>So, that raises two philosophical thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>What desire is there for you to continue to aid him?</li>
<li>Why would he trust your additional answers if he believes the first one you put forth was wrong?</li>
</ul>
<p>-1 and +1 thrown around as deemed appropriate.</p>

										<p><p>#Yeah looks like I&#39;m flat wrong</p>
<p>Sorry about that, and nope I wasn&#39;t correct.</p>
<p>The funny thing is, it worked yesterday, so not sure what happened but I suppose it was a fluke.</p>
<p>Annoying the person attempting to offer assistance is not the correct way no matter how frustrated.  I didn&#39;t even realize you were the Director until after I posted my comment. I admit am wrong and can&#39;t believe I didnt see the 1.4 in the doc!  Sorry about that again.</p>
<p>This doesn&#39;t work on 1.3.1 - works 1.4 - 1.3.1 is the latest stable release.</p>
