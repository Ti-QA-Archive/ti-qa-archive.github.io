			<h1>Which UI elements for something like this?</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am totally new with Titanium and so far I am very impressed!</p>
<p>I am trying to make something like this small app: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;market.android.com&#x2F;details?id=com.zellenterprises.birdsongs</p>
<p>Which UI elements would I need to make a similar scrollable table of images on top of another image?</p>
<p>In KitchenSink I didn&#39;t find anything similar.</p>
<p>Martin</p>

							<p>The best way to address this would be using a <code>ListView</code> with <em>&quot;custom&quot;</em> <code>TableRows</code>. This will have a more native and consistent look rather than using a <code>WebView</code>.</p>
<p>Each row would contain 2 <code>ImageViews</code> (or more depending on how many you want).</p>
<p><strong>Here is code a snippet I pulled together that does just that:</strong><br><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;955520">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;955520</a></p>
<p>The code is commented so you shouldn&#39;t have any trouble understanding what it does.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for code. It works! However, there is a problem which is perhaps with Titanium itself:</p>
<p>Some of the images are missing in the grid. In my demo I created 12 cells to make the table large enough to be scrollable, but image 6 and 10 is missing, both in the emulator and on the phone.</p>
<p>If I switch to something else (another app or the home screen) and switch back, then all images are present. But only on the phone, not in the emulator.</p>
<p>To me it looks as if the screen is not refreshed properly, but I don&#39;t know how to remedy it.</p>

							<p>Hi Martin,</p>
<p>There&#39;s usually more than one way to solve any problem, but the easiest in this case might just be to use a web view for the main content.  Creating a grid of pictures is trivial on the web, and you can process the clicks on those pictures in the web view itself, or bubble them up to Titanium.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

										<p><p>Yes, a web view could do it. However, the Titanium guides suggests not using web views due to the overhead. But I don&#39;t know how much this means in practice.</p>
<p>Is it possible somehow to tell if a given layout is made with a web view? For example if I see a nice app and wants to know how they made the UI?</p>
<p>As a secondary (and off-topic!) question, is it possible to tell if an app is made with Titanium? I am just curious.</p>

							<p>If I have additional comments or questions, like above, should I just write them in comments or should I ask them here like I do now?</p>
<p>I ask because comments do not seem to generate notifications.</p>

										<p><p>If you have a question regarding a different topic, then you should post it in another Question entirely. This will make it easier for other people who are looking for the same information as you. </p>
<p>Also, if you feel your question has been answered, mark an answer as the best one. This will <em>close</em> the question and prevent any subsequent comments to be added. </p>
<p>It will also highlight the best answer so other developers don&#39;t have to go through the entire thread in order to find the best answer.</p>
