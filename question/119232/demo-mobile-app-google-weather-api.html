			<h1>Demo mobile app: Google weather API</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>This is a sample mobile app that I wrote to retrieve Google&#39;s undocumented and unsupported international weather API.  It&#39;s still very rough.  You can find it here on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bob-sims&#x2F;GWeather">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Change the value of the wx_location variable in Resources&#x2F;ui.js to change the default location.</p>
<p>This app might be helpful as a component of larger app, such as a conference or &quot;brochure&quot;-type app to show local weather conditions.  I&#39;ve tried to use some of the global-scope protection techniques outlined in the recent video, but still need to learn more about modularizing my code.</p>
<p>This app created using Titanium Studio.  Any feedback or suggestions from experienced devs are most welcome.</p>
<p>Known issues:</p>
<p>Currently no error handling.</p>
<p>createActivityIndicator() not working as expected.</p>

							<p>Hey Bob Sims,</p>
<p>First, great work. I&#39;ve probably spent close to four fours trying to wrestle with Yahoo! Weather API, WorldWeatherOnline.com JSON and XML, Weather.com RSS, Google&#39;s undocumented API, etc. But your code finally made everything coming together nicely, at least for Android.</p>
<p>I loathe iOS, but I added the platform&#39;s functionality to your code after forking your GitHub code and making a few changes. I&#39;m having difficulty install Git on this thing, but I was able to copy and paste my changes in the Text Editor. I changed the tiapp file, app.js, and ui.js. You can see what I adjusted, but essentially I made the Weather window appear within the app.js file&#39;s tab groups (like on Kitchen Sink), so ui.js doesn&#39;t create an overriding window.</p>
<p>I defined your function and called it at the end, I guess for organizational purposes, and added a few variables above that definition, like in the twitter.js Kitchen Sink example. This removed the error messages I was getting on iPhone and Android upon application launch.</p>
<p>Known issues:<br>iOS background image is overridden by TableView. I have a few hunches, but I&#39;ll be making that change soon.<br>iOS styling is broken slightly. Might resolve with an if=&#39;platform&#39; or something along those lines and define two separate styles for that.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you very much for this. I can&#39;t tell you enough how helpful this is. You&#39;ve saved me many more hours of frustration.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s my <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tshedor&#x2F;GWeather">GitHub fork</a>.</p>
