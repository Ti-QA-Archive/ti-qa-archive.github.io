			<h1>[ERROR] Timed out waiting for android.process.acore</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have installed Titanium about 4 days ago. I could run some test apps (helloworld kinda) in the 1st 2 days. I even ran the kitchensink once or twice. I am very new to mobile programming.<br>But, since yesterday I get &quot;[ERROR] Timed out waiting for android.process.acore&quot; - have never been able to see anything on the emulator screen. As far as I know, I have not changed any setting after I installed all this for the first time (4 days ago).</p>
<p>What could be the cause. I am completely stuck at this point. Please help.</p>
<p>I am working on the Windows platform trying to experimen with the Android version.</p>

							<p>Sorry, this is fixed. I was using the wrong SDK API version. I selected &quot;APIs 2.2&quot;  and that fixed the timeout problem.<br>Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>I am new to this too, can you share a little more detail on this?  Is it you have to select &quot;APIs 2.2&quot; not others?  And the reason?</p>

										<p><p>Seems that it happens randomly and is based on the load on my PC. Looks like some kind of race condition. Seems that the best thing to do is to launch once. Let it fail as it races against the emulator starting up. Then try again. Keep the emulator between tests and everything seems OK.</p>

							<p>Don&#39;t worry, this is easily done, Sameer. :)</p>
<p>Selecting the latest-supported Android SDK (currently <strong>APIs 2.2</strong>) is mentioned several times in the &quot;Installing on Windows 7&quot; guide, including in the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;installing_on_windows.html#test_a_default_project">Test a default project</a> section. Well done for fixing it, though. Hopefully this post will help others.</p>
