			<h1>Stop current and pending http client</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have multiple tab. I&#39;m currently loading multiple images using http so that after 1 image is loaded, it will load the next one. But while its loading, when I switch to a new tab, I want to stop the loading. to do this, I fireevent function to abort the http client.</p>
<p>The problem is that sometimes this works, sometimes it doesnt. Sometimes the loading stop, and sometimes the loading continues on to the next image.</p>
<p>How can I make sure the http client is stopped and wont continue loading?</p>
<p>I am building for ipad and using 3.1.3.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Multiple httpClient calls that you are clearly not managing are not recommended.  It is possible to manage those calls correctly using a scheduling function that you would write - but this does not appear to be sensible for this issue.</p>
<p>As has been pointed out - you have provided, far to little information in order to provide as specific answer, so for right now I am limiting this to thoughts;</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have multiple tabs and you are loading images in the background for tabs you cannot see - WHY?  This has to have a very good reason otherwise all you are doing is slowing down the app, increasing memory usage and potentially costing the user increased data bandwidth for sections they may not visit in this session.</li>
<li>Why are you using httpClient to download images?  The imageView has its own cache handler for images and when to call them.  If you are doing this to cache images locally for next time - build an inteligent scheduler that works when there is no activity. Otherwise - do not use httpClient just to show an image.</li>
<li>Your explanation of loading one image after another means that imageView caching itself will solve the issue and manage the memory management and just-in-time network calls better than you will be able to.  As the caching only loads images when they are visible or nothing else is happening (if that is a good app move based on internal logic) swapping tabs will hold that process until the user returns anyway.</li>
</ul>
