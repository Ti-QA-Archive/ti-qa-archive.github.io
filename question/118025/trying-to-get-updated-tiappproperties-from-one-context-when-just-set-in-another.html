			<h1>Trying to get updated Ti.App.Properties from one context when just set in another</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi everybody,</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to build a mobile app (iphone) with four windows, and a tabgroup. Each window is a .js file and the app.js is the hub.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve got two properties which I can modify in one of the contexts (a settings screen&#x2F;window), but, I can&#39;t get the freshly modified property appear on another window. </p>
<p>However, when I re launch the app, the property appears modified. </p>
<p>Anyone any idea for a clean way to do so ? So basically, one window modifies the settings, the others display them.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>xav </p>

							<div><p>In order for someone to advise you about this, would you create a usecase? A usecase is a self-contained piece of code that demonstrates your issue in the <strong>least possible</strong> number of lines and that runs <strong>without modification</strong> when pasted into an empty <code>app.js</code>. Some advantages of providing a usecase are:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is much kinder to those wishing to help you, because they won&#39;t have to spend considerable time replicating your issue on their systems</li>
<li>you will likely receive more accurate answers, as people will be running exactly the same code as you</li>
<li>you will gain a much greater knowledge of how Titanium works</li>
<li>the process of creating a usecase can often simplify the problem and consequently reveal the answer</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read more about this subject in the official documentation, under the section <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Contributing+to+Titanium#ContributingtoTitanium-CreatingGoodUsecases">Creating Good Use-cases</a>.</p>
<p>Note that, if the code is long, you may want to create a <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;">Git Gist</a> or <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;">pastebin</a> rather than paste the code here directly.</p>

							<p>Xavier, I&#39;d use application level events to pass the information between the windows. Better yet, avoid using the separate execution contexts of the individual windows (don&#39;t create them with the url:yourfile.js notation). My suspicion is that the properties are not actually serialized and stored synchronously so that you can&#39;t rely on them as an instant means to transfer information between window contexts.</p>
<p>Oh, and what Paul suggested is good practice too.</p>
