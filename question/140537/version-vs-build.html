			<h1>Version vs Build</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I recently came across an interesting issue that either I don&#39;t understand, or if I do, Titanium needs to change the way they work.</p>
<p>In Xcode you have version numbering and build numbering. My understanding is that during development, while I may be working on version 1.0 of my app, I may have various builds during that process. When I am finished with 1.0 and release it, it may be build 15, who knows. Test Flight App understands it this way as well.</p>
<p>However in Titanium Version = Build. You can have incremental builds in the same version, as far as I can tell anyway. This is a problem. The main reason is because I think it is incorrect, especially since the build number is in the info.plist file and always matched the version number. Unless there is a way to change it that I don&#39;t know about, but in the 2.1.0 SDK I don&#39;t see anything.</p>
<p>The second reason is that my current app that I am updating from PhoneGap to Titanium is currently in the app store as Version 1.0.2 Build 14. Well, now in Titanium I need to release version 15 of my app so that way it&#39;s higher than build 15. Other wise I need to generate a custom info.plist file.</p>
<p>Please fix this in future versions of Titanium unless I my understanding of builds is incorrect, in which case I apologize before hand. It seems easy enough to add &quot;Build Number&quot; as a setting in the tiapp.xml file.</p>

<p>Two strings that actually mean anything when submitting:</p>
<p>CFBundleVersion - specifies the build version number of the bundle</p>
<p>CFBundleShortVersionString - specifies the release version number of the bundle</p>
<p>Until recently (within the last 6 months) apple only cared about one of them.  They then made a submission change and required BundleShortVersionString be present and incremented on submission.</p>
<p>In titanium, they are equal to each other. </p>

										<p><p>Do you think it&#39;s a bug? I can&#39;t believe that it doesn&#39;t allow for editing or works the way it does. I am familiar with some of the progress Ti has made in regards to similar issues, but it doesn&#39;t seem that they think the build numbers are an issue.</p>
<p>Also, I signed up for an account, but I can&#39;t see how to post a ticket for Ti Studio. All I see is Aptana.</p>

										<p><p>You should be able to post to TC which is the titanium community side of the JIRA. If its accepted or sponsored, it will get moved appropriately.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t see it as a functional big deal. The end user doesn&#39;t give a rip about your build numbers. Actually, they see what you self declare as the version when you submit the app. You could call it version 3.0 and its really only tagged in the plist as 2.0. If yours actually says &#39;build #14&#39; in the app store, then something was weird&#x2F;odd&#x2F;irregular with that submission.</p>
<p>major.minor.builds is how we name ours here.<br>[2].[2].[2] digits notation</p>
<p>And thats NOT every time we run the compiler.  Builds for us is every time working code is added.</p>

										<p><p>I change builds every time I distribute, not necessarily to app store but to test flight. Versions I only change on release to app store. That was in XCode though. I believe that is the correct way to do it too.</p>
<p>Since I did that… I released version 1.0.2 as build14. The iTunes binary remembers that and won&#39;t accept another build prior to 14. Since build = version in Titanium it won&#39;t work. My point is, I think Ti is doing it wrong. (Pardom the Meme).</p>

										<p><p>Strange also is… Build in Xcode = Bundle Version<br>Version in XCode = Bundle version string short.</p>
<p>Here I was Keeping the version as a constant and to xcode… all that really matters for app store submission is build.</p>
<p>Like you said, it doesn&#39;t matter, but when deploying to Test Flight, the only way to increment builds is to change the build number. But if you are working on a single version of the app, you can&#39;t use that workflow in Ti, and to me, that workflow makes the most sense.</p>
<p>I guess you can if you manually change the version 1.0.1 to 1.0.2 to 1.0.3… so maybe it&#39;s a mute point. I&#39;ll post it to Jira because they are two different values in the info.plist and you should be able to edit them independently in Ti as well. Thanks for your input.</p>

<p>Version and Bundle are different. I had to make the Ti version 15 to get it to validate.</p>

										<p><p>yes, because your CFBundleVersion from phone gap was 14, you will need to have the CFBundleVersion greater than that to submit to Apple now.</p>
<p>But, since the end user never actually sees it because you specify the version they see when you update, its not a functional problem.</p>

										<p><p>I didn&#39;t see that completely in the comments. I guess I&#39;ll just have to get used to incremental versions as you noted above… major.minor.build to Test Flight still works as usual and Apple accepts the builds.</p>
<p>While a minor issue I don&#39;t like having a crucial setting such as this be un-editable within Ti.</p>
