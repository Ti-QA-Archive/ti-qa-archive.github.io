			<h1>LeftNavButtons Views</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I want to add two buttons in the NavBar of the navigation window; one on the left and the other in the center. I tried a few approaches to create the UI: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>I tried to add one button as the leftNavButton and the other (centred button) as the rightNavButton, However,I cannot style it so the button is in the middle. </p>
</li>
<li><p>My other approach is to add both buttons as the leftNavButton since the leftNavButton takes an array of views as the parameter. I created all the components in the XML and style it according to the top left corner of the NavBar of the navigation window (by setting both top and left attributes in .tss file to 0). Both buttons fire events without any problems, but the component shift position twice before it is in the correct position. At first, I can see some left padding and the component is overlaying the StatusBar. After it shifts once, the component became the right height (no overlay on StatusBar), but the component still has some left padding. The component is in the expected position only after the second shift. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I already made sure that I did not change the style in any way in the JavaScript. Does anyone know what might be the cause of this odd behaviour? </p>
<p>I apologize for not attaching any screenshots. I cannot find a way to attach local images on my laptop to the Q&amp;A.  </p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>Did you try using the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.UI.Window-property-titleControl">titleControl</a> ? It allows you to embed views (ie buttons) inside it</p>

										<p><p>Thanks your answer. That worked almost perfectly! Except it is changing the style when the new title is shorter (has less character) than the very first title that is displayed. Do you know how to fix this?</p>

										<p><p>Nvm. I did not set the style for the label. After setting top and left property, the titleControl worked perfectly!</p>
