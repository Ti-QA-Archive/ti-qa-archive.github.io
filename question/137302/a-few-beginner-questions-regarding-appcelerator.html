			<h1>A few beginner questions regarding Appcelerator</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am new to Appcelerator and new in the mobile world. I have a few questions regarding this platform.</p>
<p>1) If you build your interface using HTML. Are you limited to mobile web app? By web app, I mean an application that rely on Internet to work.</p>
<p>2) Is it possible to publish to App Store and Google Store?</p>
<p>3) I believe a built-in simulator is inside the IDE. Does it support all the popular events such as slide and double tap?</p>
<p>4) And finally, is there a way to copy it on a real mobile before publishing it somewhere? And if it&#39;s possible, does your phone need to be unlocked?</p>
<p>Thank you guys!</p>

							<p>Steve, few things you have to understand (and make use of :) related to the point 1 )</p>
<ol>
<li>Titanium despite the fact that uses javascript as programming language has nothing to do with the web ( on the iOs and android platforms).<br>Javascript is bridged to the native UI elements, so when you create button, you don&#39;t get a noce styled html element but a native iOs&#x2F;Android  button like it was written in objC&#x2F;Java.<br>This being said the app will work on the device without the need to have an internet connection.<br>Your final app will be a native app, with native UI in a native environment, no simulated with html (like phonegap for example.)</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><p>Yes, in both of them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The simulators (android and iOs ) belong to the native SDKs  not to Titanium Studio and tehy do register almost all the events a normal device has.</p>
</li>
<li><p>on iOs you will have to be subscribed to Apple as a developer. On Android u just set the device to accept &quot;Unknown sources&quot; and &quot;USB Debugging&quot; and you&#39;re good to go.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There is 3rd platform (MobileWeb) that indeed uses web technologies (html&#x2F;css&#x2F;js) but is for online webapps like any other online mobile web (think jQmobi if you want). The advantage is that with almost the same codebase you get 3 platforms at once.</p>
