							<p>Couple of things:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Apple requires HLS for streaming media to an iOS device.  Vimeo&#39;s &#39;brad&#39; has repeatedly been anti-hls.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Vimeo will not expose mobile MP4s.  Each time a way has been discovered, they have removed it.  They actively prevent this.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Their only solution is to use their player, which will not load in a web view on Titanium.  Their model is based upon their player and Brad Doughtery is often hostile  towards those (even PAID PRO users) desiring a cleaner mobile integration (read the forums as far as 2 years back). If you sense some frustration on my part, its because there is.  Vimeo is a cheap solution.  As such, you get what you pay for.</p>

							<p>The following assumes your client is making all their videos available for mobile use, which may require a paid account. This works on iOS, but has not been tested on Android yet. </p>
<p>After getting the RSS feed from a Vimeo channel I get the URL for the video and then replace part of it with &quot;m&#x2F;&quot; (see code section) to create the mobile URL for the video:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> videoUrl</span> = videos.item(<span class="hljs-number">0</span>).getAttribute(<span class="hljs-string">"url"</span>);
<span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> mobileURL</span> = videoUrl.replace(<span class="hljs-string">"moogaloop.swf?clip_id="</span>,<span class="hljs-string">"m/"</span>);
</code></pre><p>Then I load the mobileURL into a webview where the user can click to watch the video fullscreen similar to a YouTube video.</p>

							<p>@Stephen. Not sure what you mean by &quot;Their only solution is to use their player, which will not load in a web view on Titanium.&quot; You can easily embed a Vimeo video by using their embed code in the HTML of a web view eg</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">&lt;<span class="hljs-tag">iframe</span> src=<span class="hljs-string">"http://player.vimeo.com/video/videoID"</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">width</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"320"</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">height</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"240"</span> frameborder=<span class="hljs-string">"0"</span>&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</code></pre><p>where videoID is the ID of the video you want to play. What I want to do is get the MP4 absolute URL though so I can play the video in the Titanium video player. As you say it is nigh on impossible to get this information (I have tried hard but to no avail). The default using the above embed method is that the video opens in the standard iOS video player. The problem with that is that I want to trap when the user closes the video popup. This is so I can do some orientation changes - my app runs in portrait mode mostly except when it plays video when I want to to allow landscape mode. Titanium doesn&#39;t trap the close event from the standard video player. And when it closes the video there is a bad bug which f£$%s up the toolbar at the top of a view, partially hiding it behind the system toolbar.<br>Cheers Simon Buckingham.</p>

										<p><p>At the time of the posting, TWO MONTHS AGO, my statement was accurate.</p>
<p><em>Their only solution is to use their player, which will not load in a web view on Titanium.</em></p>
<p>Regarding HLS and iTunes submission guidelines, that also remains accurate and unchanged:</p>
<p>9.4 Video streaming content over a cellular network longer than 10 minutes must use HTTP Live Streaming and include a baseline 64 kbps audio-only HTTP Live stream</p>

										<p><p>@Stephen. I&#39;ve been using this solution for at least 10 months now. None of my video is over 10 minutes so hopefully will be OK.</p>

							<p>Hi Gertjan, as I mentioned above I have had Vimeo video working for at least a year on iOS. I haven&#39;t tried recently on iOS7 though. Are you talking about iOS 7?</p>
