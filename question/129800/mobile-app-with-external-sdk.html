			<h1>Mobile App with External SDK</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am new to mobile app development and working on an app for my company that needs to work on both Android and iOS phones&#x2F;tablets.  Currently I am writing the program in a GWT project, using Java, and then compiling it into Titanium Mobile and from here, building it to the separate platforms.  The problem I am having is I need to use an external SDK for my app.  This external SDK is written platform specific, using the function calls to either os(Android or iOS).  Is there a way that I can write the app once, using this external sdk, and then deploy it to both devices?  Or do I need to either re-write the sdk, or write two apps, one for each platform, using each specific sdk?</p>

							<div><p>I dont even understand your approach? You are mixing technologies and creating an over complicated architecture which will be difficult to maintain in IMHO.</p>
<p>But other than that… your question is not very clear, can you be more specific?</p>

							<p>Yes I am mixing a lot of technologies but that was the only way I could see to do it, other than writing two apps.  </p>
<p>There is a framework available (Emitrom) that will take a java GWT project and compile it into Javascript, which I can then import into Titanium Studio to deploy to both iOS and Android.</p>
<p>I am writing my app in Java, compiling it through GWT and Emitrom into Titanium Studio, and then using Titanium Studio to push it to iOS or Android.</p>
<p>I have a credit card scanner that attaches to mobile phones&#x2F;tablets.  This scanner came with two separate SDK&#39;s, one for Android and one for iOS.  I would like to write one app, that utilizes one of the SDK&#39;s (the Android SDK since I am programming the main part of the app in Java), and deploy it on both Android and iOS.</p>
<p>Is there a better way to do this, perhaps write a server side and a client side app that communicate? Or just write separate apps for iOS and Android?</p>
