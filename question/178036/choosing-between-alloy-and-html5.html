			<h1>Choosing between Alloy and HTML5</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I realize this is very much a loaded question but I am very interested in the opinions of the community.</p>
<p>My background: I&#39;ve built a few titanium apps using the standard SDK (not alloy), most have been utility style apps.  </p>
<p>I&#39;m looking to build a &quot;game&quot;, not one with much animation, but rather a quiz style game.  It will need to show questions, make a few sounds, persist&#x2F;store current status&#x2F;scores, connect to app stores to do in-app purchases and most importantly it will need to look good.  Also, if the app succeeds I&#39;d like to be able to easily &quot;rebrand&quot; the app for other topics (not sure if that effects the question below).</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to decide between using alloy versus build an HTML game and plugging it into titanium as a webview (I still need a native app for in app purchases at a minimum).  I&#39;m just looking for your thoughts on the two approaches?  </p>
<p>Some areas I&#39;ve been thinking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dealing with the bridge between native app (app store purchases) and the webview&#39;s state.</li>
<li>Persistence, If I go hybrid do I persist using HTML5 persistence or native?</li>
<li>Which will provide me the best UX</li>
</ul>
<p>All thoughts appreciated.</p>

							<p>You can have either or with Titanium :-)</p>
<p>However, native apps will deliver a better user experience.</p>
<p>Titanium is easily able to handle quiz style games.</p>
<p>If you want to do something fancier then, you may want to look at http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lanic.co. It is a SDK that runs on top of titanium and allows you to build 2d and 2.5d games. </p>
<p>It is a rewrite ( or at least vast update) from the TiQuickGame2d framework.</p>
