			<h1>Titanium, run as &#34;android *&#34; won&#39;t work (Android Emulator)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Titanium SDK : 3.2.2 GA</p>
<p>Device : Android</p>
<p>OS : OSX 10.9.2</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>After reading 100 posts&#x2F;question all over internet, and trying X configuration modification, i finally came down to ask you about my Android Emulator problem.</p>
<p>Okay, so everything seems fine on Titanium, SDK &amp; NDK paths are valid, adb is in both tools and platform tools (read an issue about titanium looking for it in tools as he&#39;s normally in platform tools), when i right click tiapp.xml i can run as a lot of android device emulator, and all my emulator are working fine if i start them from titanium studio &gt; preference &gt; studio &gt; platforms &gt; Android &gt; manage AVD &gt; start. </p>
<p>But, when i&#39;m in project, and right click tiapp.xml and go &quot;run as <em>*</em>&quot; it launch run configuration, where everything looks fine, so i click on run on that window and…. it appear again, and again, and again… </p>
<p>It seems that the compile doesn&#39;t even start as i have no log whatsoever.</p>
<p>What the hell am i doing wrong ?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help</p>

							<div><p>is this a newly created project?</p>
<p>Does this behavior occur with a new project?</p>
<p>When was the last time it worked with this project, if ever?</p>
<p>Why are you right clicking the tiapp.xml and going through that route and not clicking one of the run icons on the toolbar?</p>
<p>throw us the output from <code>ti info</code> (run from a terminal)</p>

							<div><p>Hello,</p>
<p>No it&#39;s not a newly created project, this behavior does occur with a new project. I didn&#39;t run it since a long time on android (easier to test on iOs) but it was working few Android&#x2F;Titanium updates ago. </p>
<p>Right clicking tiapp.xml a habit i took when someday the run button stopped working.</p>
<p>ti info is like 500 lines long, is there a specific part i can look for to give it to you; or should i throw you the whole log ?</p>
<p>I precise, as i didn&#39;t in my previous post that this problem affect all of my project (new or old) even though they all run on any iOs device (so it must come from a bad configuration on Android SDK etc..).</p>
<p>Thanks for your time,</p>

							<p>I also faced this issue and managed to solve it by doing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open your tiapp.xml.</li>
<li>Set the Titanium SDK to the latest version under build properties.</li>
</ol>
<p>It seems that you need to do this every time you update the SDK. I also updated my Android tools to be safe.</p>
