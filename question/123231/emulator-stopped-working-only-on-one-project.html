			<h1>Emulator stopped working only on one project.</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hi all!,</p>
<p>So, the thing is i have a snow leopard, with xcode, itunes and so on… I&#39;m currently developing for IPhone (although i have the android SDK installed, to try and see how does it work in another platforms).</p>
<p>So i have several projects (kitchen Sink, and 5 more) which i&#39;m currently developing. In one of them i wanted to use the <code>Titanium.Media.openPhotoGallery</code>, but it didn&#39;t work, so reading the forums someone said to delete the build and make a new one (because of compression some modules where not loaded, or something like that).</p>
<p>So i delete my iPhone build, and when i try to launch (so titanium can create it again), it stops working. </p>
<p>And after that, tis project, and only this one, is the one that i can&#39;t make it run in the iPhone emulator, only on android, the tab in the titanium developer with the label of iphone has disappeared.<br>The other projects work in the iphone emulator, but this one it does not….</p>
<p>I need it to work again…Any help please???</p>
<p>thank you all!!</p>
