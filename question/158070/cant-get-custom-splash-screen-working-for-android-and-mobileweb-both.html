			<h1>Can&#39;t get custom splash screen working for android and mobileweb both</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m using Titanium Studio build 3.1.3.201…. blah blah blah with Titanium version 3.1.2 . Resources&#x2F;android&#x2F;Deafault.png has the screen I want. I&#39;ve modified every image in Resources&#x2F;android&#x2F;images&#x2F;&lt;size-resolution-folder&gt; so that it has its folder labeled. I&#39;ve done the same with Resources&#x2F;mobileweb&#x2F;apple_startup_images . And yet both my android and mobileweb builds show the clean default splash screen. I can&#39;t find any more images in my project to modify.</p>
<p>Why would the default still be used? Is there any configuration where I can point to specific images to use? How can I solve this?</p>

							<div><p>Why the -1? Is this how the appcellerater community treats newbies? By biting them? Please note that I have read the documentation here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Icons+and+Splash+Screens and have done my own google searching.</p>

							<div><p>Ok, I successfully changed the splash screen with a new project by changing the Resources&#x2F;android&#x2F;default.png file. However, it still isn&#39;t working with my other project. I did read that the splash screen image file needs to be in all lower case. I had read somewhere that it had to be uppercase (i guess for iphone), which probably screwed me a bit. Regardless, after changing it back to lower case, deleting the build folder, it still doesn&#39;t work on my old project.</p>

										<p><p>I tried both running &quot;Project -&gt; Clean…&quot; and deleting the build folder. Neither made a difference. I also already mentioned I&#39;m running titanium sdk 3.1.2. I did figure out how to change the mobileweb splashscreen though - I ignored the mobileweb&#x2F;spash html. </p>
<p>How am I supposed to change the splashscreen for an android application?</p>

										<p><p>I was just about to do that, but I tried cleaning again, and it worked this time. I shouldn&#39;t have to clean to get it to work though - this is clearly a bug. What&#39;s the appropriate way to file a bug ticket?</p>

										<p><p>I did try with the new project I created and it&#39;s splashscreen changed with just a rebuild (no clean). No idea what significant difference there is between them would cause this.</p>
