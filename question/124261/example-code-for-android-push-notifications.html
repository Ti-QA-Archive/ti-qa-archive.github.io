			<h1>Example code for Android push notifications?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>There is plenty of documentation and Q&amp;A iPhone push notifications going. It only took me a few hours to wrap my head around the entire process, add push notification to an example app and write my simple own push notification PHP server. Very easy. However, I&#39;m having a really hard time with Android push notifications. I&#39;ve spent a few hours looking at android documentation, Titanium documentation (there is none for android push), and this Q&amp;A section, but I can&#39;t figure out if push notifications are supported by Titanium yet, and if so, what needs to be done to register with a C2DM server, etc. There are a staggering number of unanswered questions on this site about this, and any info I do find seems to be about a year old now. Are push notifications supported with Titanium? If so, does anyone know of tutorials or example code?</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;ll add a more specific question to the above. For iPhone PNs, Titanium includes the registerForPushNotifications method. There seems to be nothing of the sort of Android. Does this mean we are required to write our own Java modules to connect to a C2DM server, or is there a way to easy accomplish this within the Titanium network? If not possible, are there plans to add support?</p>

							<p>Jude, there is a module in Ti+ that gives you push notifications via UrbanAirship. But for this you&#39;ll need an Indie subscription at least.</p>
<p>Another module would be this,though I never played with.</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;IGx89&#x2F;titanium-c2dm</p>
