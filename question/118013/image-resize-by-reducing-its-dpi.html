							<div><p>Without knowing your 3rd-party mobile and Titanium SDK versions, I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s difficult to help you. It&#39;s good practice to state this information <em>whenever</em> you post a question, and the question tags field is the most convenient place for it.

										<p><p>Apparently, you can add the image to an imageView and set the width and height to a smaller value, then perform a <code>toImage()</code> on the imageView to obtain a smaller image that can be saved to a file.</p>
<p>Other methods for manipulating images are also available. See the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_mobile&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;Classes&#x2F;TiBlob.m#L287">TiBlob</a> source code for iphone.</p>
