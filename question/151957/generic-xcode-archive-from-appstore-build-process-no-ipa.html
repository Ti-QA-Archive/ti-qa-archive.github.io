			<h1>&#34;Generic Xcode Archive&#34; from AppStore build process, no ipa</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Earlier versions of builds produced an iOS App Archive that I could validate and distribute. Now, when I build with Titanium Studio, the output is a &quot;Generic Xcode Archive&quot; that cannot be verified. If you try to distribute it, it crashes Xcode, repeatedly.</p>
<p>anyone else seen this?  It worked before, why would it stop working?</p>

							<p>I&#39;m not sure I have understood your issue.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re trying to share the archive file, it won&#39;t work since it can&#39;t be distributed. You have to sign it with a provisioning profile generated <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;account&#x2F;ios&#x2F;profile&#x2F;profileList.action">here</a> in order to transform it into an ipa file.</p>
<p>To achieve this, just open your archive file (double-click) with Xcode. It will open the <strong>Organizer</strong> in the <strong>Archives</strong> tab. There, click on the <strong>Distribute</strong> button and choose the correct provisioning profile. It will generate an ipa that will be be able to share…</p>

										<p><p>I am trying to distribute in the iTunes appstore. As I mentioned above, it worked before, using my distribution certificate and distribution provisioning profile. Now after updating to Titanium 3.1 and the latest Xcode the output of using Titanium studio&#39;s &quot;Run configurations -&gt; Titanium Apple iTunes Distribution –&gt; my configuration&quot;, where &quot;my configuration&quot; is the configuration I used before, that worked. I also tried this with a new configuration using my distribution cert and distribution profile, and after Titanium is done building the Xcode organizer opens and a new &quot;Generic Xcode Archive&quot; is shown. I have earlier versions in my organizer that shows iOS app archive which I can validate and distribute. I cannot do that with the Generic Xcode Archive.</p>

										<p><p>Have you added new libraries ? Because it can be one of the explanations according to <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;10715211&#x2F;cannot-generate-ios-app-archive-in-xcode-4-3">this page</a> or <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pulkitsinghal.blogspot.fr&#x2F;2012&#x2F;03&#x2F;wrong-archive-ios-app-archive-vs.html">this one</a>.</p>

										<p><p>Romain - thanks for the suggestion. I decided to check if there was anything innocuous that I might have changed after reading your comment. There was no new libraries, but thinking about that did make me realize that I added a app icon@2x.png to my custom info.plist. Once I removed that AND removed the image I created called app icon@2x.png, it finally built correctly and could pass validation in Xcode organizer. So your answer wasn&#39;t what I was looking for, but helped set my mindset to remove the app icon@2x.png that I had forgotten that I added. Now I have to figure out how to make Xcode know I have a 2x icon w&#x2F;o getting hosed in the build build process.</p>

										<p><p>You don&#39;t have anything to do.<br>Only put this line in your tiapp.xml :</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">icon</span>&gt;</span>app_icon.png<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">icon</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>and place your 2 images <strong>app_icon.png</strong> and <strong>app_icon@2x.png</strong> in your <strong>Resources&#x2F;iphone</strong> folder.</p>
<p>Sorry for the delay of my answers, but I&#39;m in Europe ;)</p>
