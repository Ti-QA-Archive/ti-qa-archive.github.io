			<h1>Multiple TSS files for a controller</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey all,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve seen a module or something like that during earlier trollings of the internet that somehow allow the use of multiple tss files (besides app.tss and the controller.tss file), but I can&#39;t seem to find it anymore :(</p>
<p>Basically, my app.tss file consistently gets huge and I&#39;d like a way to separate out app-wide styles into files that make sense for the types of elements I&#39;m styling.</p>
<p>Anyone know?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<div><p>maybe you could better explain what exactly you are trying to do. If it does exist we can show you how. If it doesn&#39;t, you can log it as a <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC">Titanium Community Jira Project</a> feature request.</p>

							<div><p>Tony, here&#39;s an example then.</p>
<p>Say I have an app with various pages that have form-like screen in it.  A login screen, an account screen, and some other screens with TextFields in them.</p>
<p>It would be nice to be able to include a &quot;form.tss&quot; file for just those screens.  This form.tss would have the common styling that I like to have applied to my form elements.</p>
<p>What I end up doing is putting all these common elements in the app.tss file.  This works, but say there are a ton of other subclasses of things that I would like to apply this same logic to.  For instance, styles applied to lists, common styles I like to apply to text of different types, button styles, image styles, etc.  Right now I just navigate my app.tss file to update it, but is there a better way to separate this stuff out?</p>

							<p>You can have multiple classes on a UI element but I don&#39;t know about having many .tss files associated with a widget and&#x2F;or controller.  Here&#39;s how you would have two or more classes associated with a UI element: </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">&lt;Button <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"checkbox middle"</span> /&gt;
</code></pre><p>The above code applies the class checkbox and middle to the UI Button.</p>
