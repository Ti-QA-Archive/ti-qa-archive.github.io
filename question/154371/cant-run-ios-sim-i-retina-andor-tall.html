							<div><p>I think this is the issue with Simulator. I got into this issue also.. App was working fine on simulator while trying on retina simulator I got the same error. Searched a lot after fighting around I found some jira links that told that is the issue in simulator. And there I left thinking I will check on the Phone instead to confirm that is this the simulator issue.</p>

							<p>Are you using a release candidate ? (ie not 3.1.1GA) If so, see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;150101&#x2F;cannot-launch-in-simulator-against-any-30-sdk-weird-error">here</a></p>

										<p><p>Another thought.  Does your current project have 3.1.1GA set as the build SDK ? (Open your TiApp.xml file to check)</p>

										<p><p>Yes it does. I&#39;ve tried 3.1.1GA - 3.1.0GA - 3.0.2GA.<br>I&#39;ve done some more checking and I can&#39;t switch between normal iPhone, 3.5 inch and 4 inch in he simulator. It crashes the simulator!? Never seen this before!?<br>I can hovever build for 3.5 inch and it launches ok. The same for 4 inch. But I can&#39;t switch between them…. Hmm….. :-)</p>

										<p><p>I can launch the simulator as a stand alone and switch between normal - 3.5 - 4 inch without any problems. So it only happens when I launch the simulator from Titanium studio..</p>

										<p><p>Try these steps; Delete the build directory, close Studio, open the simulator from XCode and from the simulator menu select Reset Content and Settings, and close that and Xcode. Then restart Studio, and go to Titanium Studio &gt; Preferences &gt; Studio &gt; Platforms &gt; iOS and change the default dipslay option to Retina. Let me know if that works.</p>

							<p>This is why it happends because your application may be created on old titanium environment and you are running it with updated one, so to overcome this issue update it with latest version change that version in tiapp.xml file and try to run it you will definitely get the desired output</p>
