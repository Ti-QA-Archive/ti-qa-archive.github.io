			<h1>Coordinating animations</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>How can I coordinate animations?</p>
<p>For example, to mimic the default sliding effect of iOS tabGroup, I slided out an old view while sliding in another view. I gave the same duration to both of animations and it worked perfect on simulator. However, when running on device, I found that there&#39;s a lag between two distinct animations, so that a view starts moving first than the other. So it looks ugly.</p>
<p>So I experimented with a dummy container view containing the two views and animate that container view to animate. The animation worked alright on device, however, the app crashes frequently and the new view ignores most of user inputs. I was convinced that that was not memory-efficient way to manage views, just for the transition animation between the two views.</p>
<p>It would be common to coordinate several animations to give better experience to users. Does anyone have a solution to this critical problem? Thanks in advance.</p>

							<p>At the current time it is not possible to run animations concurrently with titanium. The way I got round sliding a view in and out, was to put both views into a parent and then move the parent.</p>
<p>So very much the same solution you came up with, I don&#39;t have the crashing issue though. So that might be another issue, if you post some code we may be able to find it.</p>
