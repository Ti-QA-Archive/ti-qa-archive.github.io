			<h1>Alloy require path error - &#34;Couldn&#39;t find module: X&#34;</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all,<br>I have a file I need to require in my controllers. The absolute path is app&#x2F;lib&#x2F;Piwik&#x2F;Tracker.js. The require statement is this <code>var tracker = require(&amp;#39;Piwik&amp;#x2F;Tracker&amp;#39;);</code> But when I try to run the app with that require statement, I get the error <strong>&quot;Couldn&#39;t find module: Piwik&quot;.</strong> I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing wrong here. The folder and file exist as stated in the &#x2F;lib folder. Another file I use in &#x2F;lib causes no problems. I&#39;ve tried &#x2F;Piwik&#x2F;Tracker and ..&#x2F;Piwik&#x2F;Tracker. Neither work. This is puzzling.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleaned&#x2F;rerun the project</li>
<li>Searched forums for related posts</li>
<li>Moved Tracker.js up one folder level</li>
<li>Reread Alloy doc</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these worked. Your help is appreciated.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>As Alloy is a pre-processor of file into resources before the actual compile starts it is worth checking your <strong>resources</strong> folder once the app has launched to check where the file has ended up.</p>
<p>If it does not appear in…</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">{appname}<span class="hljs-regexp">/resources/</span>Piwik<span class="hljs-regexp">/Tracker.js</span>
</code></pre><p>…do a search to see if it made it through somewhere else in resources.</p>
<p>Other things</p>
<ul>
<li>personally I prefer to lowercase all files as case sensitivity can cause unexpected issues</li>
<li>check you do not have another file&#x2F;folder combination that could overwrite the the file</li>
<li>does the CommonJS file actually work? If not it may have been excluded</li>
<li>does the file appear on the pre-processing list that is performed in console?</li>
<li>try a very simple CommonJS module with the same name to confirm the process works.</li>
</ul>
<p>If all else fails; close the simulator, emulator or device, cancel the current build, clean the project AND empty the resources folder contents.  This will make sure no pre-existing files that were in different folders are causing conflicts or read only rights to files.  The resources folder will recreate on next build.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m simply removing the code for now. I can&#39;t seem to decipher how to implement it in my code and the developer isn&#39;t being very helpful. Piwik is meant for web analytics anyway and one person on their team built their mobile app with Titanium. Since my client refuses to use cloud-based analytics, I thought this might be a solution. So far, I haven&#39;t found anything else to replace it. Stephen Feather suggested Count.ly, but that requires a linux host which my client doesn&#39;t use.</p>
<p>&lt;sigh&gt; Back to the drawing board. Thanks anyway, Malcolm.</p>

										<p><p>Not exactly sure what &quot;no cloud based analytics&quot; expressly excludes, but you can include <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MattTuttle&#x2F;titanium-google-analytics">Google Analytics</a> into your app.  This also allows you to blend your app analytics into your website analytics - or keep them separate if your choose.</p>
<p>Just in case this does fit with the clients acceptable list.</p>

										<p><p>&quot;no cloud-based analytics&quot; means the client wants self-hosted analytics data that are stored on their servers only, meaning no google analytics. If GA were an option, things definitely would be easier.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>
