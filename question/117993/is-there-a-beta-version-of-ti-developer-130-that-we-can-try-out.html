							<p>Hi, i&#39;m currently use 1.3.0 (beta).</p>
<p>You can compile, but the easiest way:</p>
<p>1- Download https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_developer&#x2F;zipball&#x2F;master.  (Trust me… the name of zip has 1_2_2, but this will be release as 1.3.0, if you see inside tiapp.xml, you will read: &lt;version&gt;1.3.0&lt;&#x2F;version&gt;)</p>
<p>2- Go to your Application folder and duplicate the Titanium Developer App.</p>
<p>3- Rename this new to &quot;Titanium Developer 1.3.0&quot;.</p>
<p>3- Open the new App (folder) with &quot;Show Package Content&quot;, open &quot;Contents&quot; folder, delete &quot;Resources&quot; folder and &quot;tiapp.xml&quot;, save here the &quot;Resources&quot; folder and &quot;tiapp.xml&quot; from the source downloaded.</p>
<p>4- Now run &quot;Titanium Developer 1.3.0&quot; and you be able to create a new project in &quot;Universal iOS&quot; mode.</p>
<p>If you need, your app can be a &quot;smart&quot;, detecting if is iPhone ou iPad, using:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> device</span> = Titanium.Platform.model;
</code></pre>

										<p><p>Actually. I couldnt wait till tonight…and had to try it. It TOTALLY worked. The version of my app works almost perfectly on ipad simulator in full screen without any tweaks. (i&#39;m sure I&#39;ll find a few bugs I need to address). VERY VERY COOL! Thanks Adriano!!!</p>

										<p><p>Awesome.</p>
<p>So basically this allows you to just make a Universal app then, correct?  And you&#39;ll have to spread your code out to be something like &quot;if device is ipad, do this&quot; kind of thing, right?</p>

										<p><p>Yes, you can create a &quot;Universal Project&quot;.<br>This type of App will run on iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p>All code to iPhone App will run in iPad.<br>You need carefull with Ti.UI.iPad, because this code will NOT run on iPhone.</p>
<p>Except this, the only change is the window size.<br>You can use codes to detect and change your layout for each one.</p>
<p>You can use:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> device</span> = Titanium.Platform.model;
</code></pre><p>or getting the window size.</p>

										<p><p>So if you create a Universal app, on the iPad it will show up full screen, instead of small with the 2x button by default?</p>

										<p><p>Hey. I was just trying to submit my universal app the app store and hit a snag. I followed the directions on <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;ios&#x2F;#qa&#x2F;qa1686&#x2F;_index.html">this page</a> to add the icons for the iPad and iPhone. But I get an error when uploading to app store from xcode that says &quot;iPad: Icon.png: icon dimensions (57x57) don&#39;t meet the size requirements. The icon file must be 72x72 pixels, in .png format.&quot; The thing is, the Icon.png file is the 57x57 file, Icon@2x is the 114x114 file and Icon-72.png is the iPad image. It seems its not recognizing the images. Any ideas how to solve this?</p>

							<p>Thanks Dan, </p>
<p>1.3 isn&#39;t up there unfortunately. So I guess they are just skipping over it and going right to TiStudio then? My users are getting very antsy about not having a full screen ipad version. I could create an ipad version separately but that would piss them off (its a paid app) b&#x2F;c they wont want to pay for the app twice. </p>
<p>Guess we just have to wait then. </p>
<p>Thx</p>
<p>Fish</p>

							<p>Hey all. </p>
<p>I was just trying to submit my universal app the app store and hit a snag. </p>
<p>I followed the directions on <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;ios&#x2F;#qa&#x2F;qa1686&#x2F;_index.html">this page</a> link to add the icons for the iPad and iPhone. But I get an error when uploading to app store from xcode that says </p>

format.
</code></pre><p>The thing is, the Icon.png file is the 57x57 file, Icon@2x is the 114x114 file and Icon-72.png is the iPad image. It seems its not recognizing the images.

I tried changing the order so the ipad one was first but for some reason it keep only looking at the one Icon.png file. </p>
<p>Any ideas how to solve this?  any help is GREATLY appreciated. </p>
