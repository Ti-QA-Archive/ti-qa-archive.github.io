			<h1>SOCKS proxy required for Titanium Developer?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am trying to install and use Titanium Developer on Windows XP in an environment that does not allow direct Internet access, and no SOCKS proxy is available. Only pure HTTP and HTTPS proxy functionality is available.</p>
<p>Is it possible to get Titanium Developer to work in this environment? I have run through the –debug option process, and have managed to get the HTTP proxy server to be recognized and used by Titanium Developer upon startup (&quot;[Titanium.Proxy] [Debug] Found proxy http:&#x2F;&#x2F;&lt;blah,blah,blah&gt;:1080) in environment&quot; - proxy removed from the message).</p>
<p>However, the connection drops after a few seconds (&quot;You are not connected to a network&quot;, &quot;[Titanium.NetworkStatus] [Debug] ti.Network: Online status changed ==&gt; 0&quot;).</p>
<p>So, I spun up Wireshark. I can see the request going out to api.appcelerator.net, and the 200 connection established coming back.  After that, there&#39;s a fair amount of retrieving certificates going on, and then the connection appears to drop.</p>
<p>Any suggestions? Is it possible to get this working in a pure HTTP&#x2F;HTTPS environment without SOCKS support?</p>

							<p>Hi Joe</p>
<p>Yes, it&#39;s certainly possible. Set the environment variables relevant to your situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTTP_PROXY</li>
<li>HTTPS_PROXY</li>
<li>FTP_PROXY</li>
<li>SOCKS_PROXY</li>
</ul>
<p>The format for the value is <code>http:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;username:password@proxy-name-or-ip:proxy-port</code> or simply <code>http:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;proxy-name-or-ip:proxy-port</code> for proxies that do not require authentication.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, but sorry, that doesn&#39;t actually help. I am past the environment variable HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY stage.  As I indicated, they are set and Titanium Developer is properly picking up these two values, and is being observed as attempting to use them. </p>
<p>I cannot set SOCKS_PROXY, as I have no SOCKS_PROXY to use.  Is it possible for Titanium Developer to work properly with ONLY an HTTP&#x2F;HTTPS proxy, and no SOCKS proxy?</p>
<p>It does not appear that the version of Titanium Developer that I just downloaded can work with an HTTP&#x2F;HTTPS-only proxy that does not support SOCKS.  Would it be helpful if I provided the –debug trace?</p>

<p>If you have used wireshark, then you will have discovered which protocols and ports are being used. If you need to know what SOCKS is, read it <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SOCKS">here</a>.</p>
<p>Hence, it should work fine with only HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY configured, afaik.</p>
<p>Please see my updated post above, with the correct format of these.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
