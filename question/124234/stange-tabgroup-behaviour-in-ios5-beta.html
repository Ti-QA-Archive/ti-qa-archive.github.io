			<h1>Stange Tabgroup behaviour in ios5 beta</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I realise iOS5 isnt offically supported yet, but I have concerns that simple tabgroup operations that work fine in iOS4 seem to fail in iOS5.</p>
<p>My app uses the tabgroup system for navigation. Ive installed my app on iOS5 and the navigation seems mostly broken. Im very concerned that when iOS5 comes out my app will stop working on anyone who upgrades.</p>
<p>Some weird effects include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>when navigating &#39;back&#39;, the navigation bar animation happens (slide effect), but main view simply vanishes (no animation) revealing the correct window</p>
</li>
<li><p>closing windows (<code>win.close();</code>) causes the main view to removed from stack but the nav bar remains (this is really odd and means you have the wrong nav bar on the wrong window)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Is anyone else seeing these sort of issues with the core?</p>
<p>(seems to affect my app in beta&#39;s 1 to 5)</p>

							<div><p>I have also noticed, that the Ti.App.addEventListener() is processed every time a window on the stack is visited - but the old ones are not cleared.</p>
<p>So if you open a window which has an eventListener added, then you go back, then open it again, then back and open it again… that  event listener will fire multiple times on response to a fireEvent (and in my case that listener opens a new window, so i get loads of windows loaded at once).</p>
<p>And removeEventListener crashes the app. Doh.</p>

							<p>I had the issue with the animation with one of my apps. It was corrected once I downloaded the iOS 5 SDK and made a build using Titanium with the iOS 5 SDK.</p>
<p>Another thing you can do, create a flow chart of how your app navigates and then reference that as you check your code to make sure everything is placed and flows properly. This can sometimes solve problems that you didn&#39;t even know about or it could fix nothing. Just throwing it out there.</p>
