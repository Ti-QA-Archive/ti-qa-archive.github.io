			<h1>URL scheme not correct format</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>since a 1&#x2F;3 year my 54House streaming radio app is available in the apple app store. Now I made some changes for iPads and can&#39;t upload an update because of a problem with the URL scheme. </p>
<p>The URL scheme of my app is: com.FrankDase.54House </p>
<p>If I understand the problem right, it&#39;s wrong to start with a digit after the point.<br>If I change it to the right format, I can&#39;t upload because then it&#39;s missing the reference to the already uploaded version. </p>
<p>any idea what i can do?</p>
<p>thanks<br>Frank</p>

										<p><p>Matt Berg is right, when I first submitted the app they allowed &#39;54House&#39; at the end of the URL scheme, but now they reject it and I can&#39;t change the apple ID afterwards. </p>
<p>So now it&#39;s impossible for me to update my app. It&#39;s also not possible to write to the apple support via their contact form, because I have to write my apple ID in the form and get the same error when I try to submit the form.</p>

										<p><p>the question is this:</p>
<p>Is it the urlScheme or the app id that is the problem with apple?</p>
<p>If it is the urlScheme, then you custom modify it using an info.plist.</p>
<p>If it is the appId, then you need to contact Apple (by phone) and discuss the problem.</p>

										<p><p>I followed your link to the description how to modify the urlScheme, but I think that will not help, because I have already an app online with a NOW incorrect urlScheme and I think if I change it now, I can&#39;t update because the new and the old one won&#39;t fit together. </p>
<p>I will give it a try.</p>

										<p><p>Frank - URL scheme is different than bundle id. The URL scheme is for openining your app from an external link, like fb:&#x2F;&#x2F; or similar.</p>
<p>The above code does not have to do with your bundle id.</p>

										<p><p>as matt says. unless you have a huge network of other apps opening your app through custom links, this is NOT a big deal.</p>
<p>How about we start over, and you actually post the error you got from apple instead of what seems to be your interpretation of the problem.</p>

										<p><p>Stephen - even though his original question referred to URL Scheme, it sounds like he is talking about Bundle Identifier, which cannot be changed. I don&#39;t think custom links are the issue and it was just an error in how he worded it.</p>

										<p><p>Stephen - my fault for making it worse, Frank previously answered affirmative in trying to change the Bundle ID.</p>
<p>I&#39;m curious, did you ever file that JIRA ticket you mentioned in one of the other posts where trying to update CFBundleURLTypes in tiapp.xml was not overwriting the generated Info.plist file? Seems like that would help quite a bit here too.</p>

										<p><p>ok got it, I searched in the project folder for the Info.plist and modified it with a text editor.  The validation was now successful. The problem was, when I followed Stephen&#39;s link there was only a description how to modify the Tiapp.xml, but not what to do with the info.plist.</p>
<p>Upload also succeeded. </p>
<p>Thanks to Matt Berg and Stephen Feather for your help. :-)</p>

							<p>So it seems like when you first submitted your app, they allowed the &#39;54House&#39; at the end, but now when trying to update they are rejecting it?</p>
<p>I am pretty sure that you can&#39;t change the Bundle Identifier of a released app, so I think you might be out of luck with updates.</p>

										<p><p>sorry man that is unfortunate. seeing as you previously were allowed to use that bundle id, you have a good argument with the app store team, but i honestly doubt they will help you here. i hate to say it, but you might be better off creating a new app and telling your customers to download the new one.</p>
