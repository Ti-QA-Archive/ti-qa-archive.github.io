			<h1>Itunes Connect Upload Process</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Ok I have an issue at present where I am in the process of uploading my iPhone App to the iTunes Connect portal. It fails and it gives me the following error:</p>
<p><strong>The binary you uploaded was invalid. Apple is not currently accepting applications built with this version of the SDK.</strong></p>
<p>I have tried using a number of SDKs from within Titanium Developer but still get the same error.  During testing I have been successfully using </p>
<ul>
<li>Titanium Developer 1.2.1</li>
<li>Ti SDK 1.3.2</li>
<li>iPhone SDK 3.1</li>
</ul>
<p>With these settings i have been able to test my app on my iPhone 3Gs with out a problem.  So here is question to those who have managed to successfully have apps accepted into the iTunes system.  What settings did you use?</p>

							<p>Are you using the final version of the Apple 3.1 SDK? Perhaps try downloading and installing version 3.2 of the SDK.</p>

							<p>Chris,<br>I just had another app (3rd one) approved on Tuesday using:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">* Titanium <span class="hljs-number">1.2</span><span class="hljs-number">.1</span>
* iPhone SDK <span class="hljs-number">3.1</span>
</code></pre><p>Went fine, no issues. Have not upgraded to Apple SDK 3.2&#x2F;4 yet. Right now, everything is working flawlessly but will upgrade once Ti 1.4 is released. Until then, for me at least, I&#39;m sticking with Murphy&#39;s Law -&gt; If it works, don&#39;t fix it!</p>
