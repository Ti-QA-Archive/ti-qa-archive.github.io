			<h1>Navigation control - sharing variables and controls</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,<br>I&#39;ve implemented the cross platform navigation control as shown in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;08&#x2F;forging-titanium-episode-2-a-cross-platform-navigation-controller.html">Forging Titanium Episode 2</a>.</p>
<p>It&#39;s working fine, but I was wondering how can I share controls on one window with another. I&#39;m building a navigation based registration, where each window is a step in the registration. In window 2 I need to access the textField controls from the first window - how can I do that?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>There could be a second option. Do you really need to access the actual objects on the prior windows or do you just need the values? It seems to me that the text field values aren&#39;t going to change when they aren&#39;t on the screen, so you could just store the values of the text fields as you move from screen to screen. If they do change, then you can just store the value that they change to and update each screen as it comes back into view.</p>

										<p><p>Hi, That&#39;s what I ended up doing. I figured that since I&#39;ve built this reg wizard as a commonJS module, then those &quot;global&quot; variables will stay within the module score and after registration is completed will be destroyed.</p>
<p>And yes - in some cases I need to access the actual control since I can change values from different windows (I have a selector window with a big list that I didn&#39;t want to put in a combo).</p>
<p>Do you think it&#39;s good practice ?</p>
<p>Thanks :)</p>
