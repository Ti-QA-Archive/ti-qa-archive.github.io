			<h1>Map Region and Route Display</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a mapview that&#39;s doing almost the right thing and I&#39;m having trouble closing the gap on the last 2% of what needs to be done. The problems boil down to these 2 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zooming the map so that it&#39;s as large as it can possibly be in order to display 2 annotations. One annotation is the user&#39;s current location and the other is a facility location. Setting deltas in the <code>region</code> property seems pretty brittle since I don&#39;t know how wide the area may need to be. It <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> be all that big, but I can&#39;t guarantee that nor do I know how far &quot;all that big&quot; is.</li>
<li>Displaying route info. Right know I define a route with 2 points (the current location and the facility location). The route that gets drawn is simply a straight line between the 2 points. I&#39;d like something a little less, um, rudimentary than that. I thought the route would at least follow the streets on the map. In the Kitchen Sink app, the &quot;Map View with Routing&quot; looks much better, but the route is also insanely complex. Maybe that&#39;s what it takes to look reasonable?</li>
</ul>
<p>Any advice on how to tackle this last 2%?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>1) you need to calculate the region based on the two points to properly set the map region</p>
<p>2) yes, you need the more complex coordinates to get the routing overlay</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, Aaron. Can you elaborate on how to go about calculating the region based on the lon&#x2F;lat of the 2 points? I guess I&#39;ll have to skip the route since the current location is dynamic. That kind of complexity plus a dynamic location is not likely to end well.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

										<p><p>Yeah, but I&#39;m doing something in there that is causing the whole thing to crash. There seems to be an issue with precision in the lat&#x2F;long and&#x2F;or delta values. I bumped into it earlier in a different context where the max precision was 6 decimal places.</p>
