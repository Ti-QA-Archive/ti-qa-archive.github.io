			<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been developing apps using Titanium for a while and I really like it. Only thing I don&#39;t understand is use of JavaScript. Objective-C is strong typed language, JS not. There are plenty of ECMA based languages which are more suitable for this - for example AS3. Are you considering allowing developers to use another (=strong typed) language  for development?</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>Viktor</p>

							<div><p>It would be swell if they added additional language options, including strong-typed languages… however I think they need to spend at least 3 more releases improving what they have introduced.  We&#39;re far from a strong type of polished Desktop SDK&#x2F;Docs yet, quite far from it.</p>

							<p>Hi Viktor,<br>I&#39;m not part of the stuff but my understanding is that Ti is using JS to allow the web developers to get close to the native mobile development.<br>As a web developer you already know Javascript so you don&#39;t have to learn another programming language for this. You just have to get used with the concepts of each platform and that&#39;s it.<br>AS3, Lua  are maybe more powerful, but they are not so well spread.<br>On the other side JS stats to become a very popular language and moved already even to the server side ( node.js ) where performs very well.Besides there are other mobile platforms that took this road entirely -  like webOS.</p>
<p>If we discuss about Apple , at some point they allowed only objC  and javascript to run inside the javascriptCore engine applications ( the big adobe-apple war) so if they would have kept their position a lot of other frameworks would have been disappeared ( corona, rhodes mobile, mono touch, etc ).<br>Also Apple still does not allow interpreted scripts to be run on the mobile platform ( for example PHP ) because they want to keep the full control on what is installed on their devices.</p>
<p>So I think this decision has a strong reason :)</p>

							<p>I am not one the staff, but thought I would chime in as a fan of Javascript.  </p>
<p>While on its own it tends to be messy with many sharp edges, Javascript&#39;s power is that it can be extended on the fly via prototypes, and there are some libraries out there that bring a new level of sophistication to the language by doing this, Prototype and jQuery to name two.  While the full libraries typically won&#39;t load at the titanium app level due to references to the document&#x2F;DOM (they will load in a web view), if you get to know your favorite library you will find you can pick and choose functionality from them. Just a few extensions of the String and Object prototypes is often all you need to clean up you code a bit.</p>
<p>I think by not including a standard base library packaged with Titanium they have actually done us a favor by leaving the choice up to us.  Every Javascript developer has a favorite, mine for now is Prototype. If you would like the code for my pared down version please feel free to contact me.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
