			<h1>Compiling for Distribution APK missing! Windows 7</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>Okay, I&#39;ve finally compiled for distribution.</p>
<p>Normally the apk shows up in the BIN directory.</p>
<p>Packaging for distribution asked me for a specific path where I would like to save the &#39;final&#39; apk.</p>
<p>I have tried giving it 2 different (increasingly simple) paths and there is no apk there!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve even use windows&#39; search facility to search for every APK on my machine and it does not exist!</p>
<p>I get a &#39;box&#39; that pops up in Ti Studio informing me it has compiled correctly and offering to open the appropriate folder and each time it simply takes me to my own user&#39;s folder with the My Documents folder selected &#x2F; highlighted.</p>
<p>No it&#39;s not in &#39;my&#39; folder nor is it in my documents!</p>
<p>Any suggestions please?</p>

							<div><p>Hello,<br>you are using the preview of Ti Studio, which could break as you can see with this issue. Go and get the stable one, that should be able to work properly. </p>
<p>Best,</p>

							<div><p>Hi Mauro,</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion. I&#39;ve tried 4 different builds now (restarting Ti each time) and I still have the same problem!</p>
<p>Which of these would you suggest please?</p>

<p>Many thanks for your time.</p>

							<div><p>Just as a bit of further information - the app-unsigned.apk IS in the build directory as normal.</p>
<p>Could it be a problem with the signing process? What would happen if I had done some part of the keytool process wrongly? Would the build fail and say so? Ti Studio DOES pop up the box at the bottom right saying the build was completed and offering to open the folder location of it (but always opens the same place as described in my first post!)</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

							<div><p>Okay, it has taken me 2 days of head scratching but the problem DID seem to be connected to the keytool (etc) not signing the apk properly PLUS it was also related to the JDK SE being 1.7 (which doesn&#39;t work - we have to have JDK 1.6!)</p>
<p>I now have an apk out the other end of it… Jarsigner is verifying it - everything is flagged as &#39;s&#39; and&#x2F;or &#39;m&#39; <em>BUT!</em> when I try to install it on my phone, it goes through the installation process and at the end simply says &quot;Application not installed&quot;</p>
<p>Would anyone have any suggestions please?</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
