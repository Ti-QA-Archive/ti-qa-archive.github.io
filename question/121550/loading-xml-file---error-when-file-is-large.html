			<h1>Loading XML file - error when file is large</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve recently been trying to process some xml - fairly large file returns - and while in most cases my app is working fine sometimes it crashes with a &quot;null&quot; response.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve traced the problem back to when the data is loaded, i.e with the code below…</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">// <span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">Create</span> the <span class="hljs-keyword">xml</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">data</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> the <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">string</span> information.
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> xmldata=Titanium.<span class="hljs-keyword">XML</span>.parseString(this.responseText);</span>
</code></pre><p>… so my next point was to try to work out if the string was fully parsed or not before continuing - however I can&#39;t find any information on how to go about it.</p>
<p>Any help or guidance that you can give me would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>TIA,<br>Paul Hutson</p>

							<p>What do you consider to be a large XML file size? Does you XML file save complete to the file system when it is downloaded?</p>
<p>When I load XML files from a web service in my apps I tend to write them to the file system first and then load them. The onload fires an event, and that event then loads the XML back up.</p>
<p>I do this mainly for caching purposes as I use them as an alternative to sqlite databases.</p>

										<p><p>Tbh, they&#39;re not &#x2F;huuugggee&#x2F;, at times around a thousand records or so… And the crashes don&#39;t happen everytime.</p>
<p>When the xhr.load is called I simply parse the response into a variable then use it from there…</p>

							<p>I&#39;m having the same problem - about 160KB (3400 node) XML file and if I just try to parse it out and print out the nodes, I get about 10% through before the app quits with null sometimes and sometimes it gives an indication of where it died, but generally it is meaningless.  </p>
<p>Instead of downloading the file, in my case the file is local and I&#39;m reading it into a string and using XML parseString. </p>
<p>From my tools biz experience, I&#39;d say there was a memory leak that builds up as the XML routines are called and then - poof - you&#39;re dead.  Depending on how deep I parse the file, I get further along, but never to the end.  And the XML file is perfectly formed according to Studio and NetBeans.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve read older posts about the &quot;half-implemented&quot; XML implementation - this isn&#39;t a case of functionality, more of robustness.</p>

							<p>After wrestling with Studio for about an hour (&#39;such fun&#39;) I managed to get my app running on the Android simulator - and it works.  The identical code with identical XML file.On iPhone the same code gets about 10% through the XML and quits.</p>
<p>This would be trivial to duplicate with any large XML file.  Mine is a hierarchical directory - nothing special, no attributes, just tags and values.</p>

							<p>Did anyone get this problem solved? I got the same issue here with a fairly large XML compilation of nodes from a webservice. It&#39;s about 1500 nodes and varying, and I get less than 10% of the nodes traversed, and then the app dies - no output other than null.</p>
<p>I figured this has something to do with the app receiving an application-will-terminate from iOS and before this, a message about memory consumption, though I have yet to prove this.</p>
<p>It would be really nice to hear from anyone with an idea on how to get around this.</p>
