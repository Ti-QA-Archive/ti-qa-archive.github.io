		<section>
			<p>Latest Ti Studio; Titanium 1.7.1&#x2F;1.7.2</p>
<p>This is kind of a vague question, and I apologize.  I&#39;ve tried to build a use case but can&#39;t isolate the problem.  That said, this is an in-production app that is currently being used a fair bit, and everything works fine if I switch back to 1.7.0.</p>
<p>The problem is that sporadically, a window opens, all the controls (such as textfields and buttons) are clickable&#x2F;usable, but none of them seem to process a message.  In the debugger or via Ti.API.info(), I can verify that, for instance, the button&#39;s &#39;click&#39; handler is never called.</p>
<p>However, going back (this is a navgroup) and opening the same window again usually fixes it: all events get fired and handled properly.  At least until the next time that window gets opened, in which case it might all be unresponsive again – who knows.</p>
<p>As I said, everything works perfectly in 1.7.0.  Again I apologize for this being vague and having no replicable use case, but I&#39;m a bit at my wits&#39; end here:</p>
<p>Did something in particular change in the point release 1.7.1 that is indicative of where I should start looking?</p>

							<p>Can someone posts a complete use case (aka code that can be just pasted into app.js and run) that can demonstrate this issue? I will look into it asap</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ll try to get one together, Matt.  Sorry for not being able to provide one as is.  It happens fairly predictably, but the app is fairly complex.  That said, it happens early enough before a lot of other stuff has gone on that I should be able to strip it away.  Currently, I&#39;m trying to chase down a not-working-on-Android-3.x bug, though, and since 1.7.0 Works For Me For Now it gets bumped to secondary priority.</p>
<p>But for what it&#39;s worth, just so I can find out the type of thing I should be trying to isolate – either for a use case or to point directly at what the problem is – what exactly did get changed at a more fundamental level between 1.7.0 and 1.7.1?</p>

										<p><p>Okay, I finally got back to this after months of sticking to 1.7.0 and it still doesn&#39;t work with 1.7.5.  I took some time to cook up a <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;128475&#x2F;dead-button-on-171-and-later">use case</a>.</p>

							<p>Are you using OS X Lion?</p>
<p>There are some problems, as far as I am aware of, between 1.7.2 and 1.7.1 and Lion. Switching back to 1.7.0 solves them.</p>
<p>Android works fine with Lion and 1.7.2.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m not, actually, using Lion.  I&#39;m curious, though:  what sort of problems?  I&#39;m surprised (well, more surprised than not) that the Titanium SDK is that dependant on the OS.</p>

							<p>Okay, so it sounds like the answer is yes, there are issues with recent 1.7.x versions of Titanium re: iOS.  I read somewhere else something about changes to the iOS threading model.  Were there big (enough) changes in the 1.7.1 point release to cause this?  Is there a detailed breakdown of the changes that I can start digging to see where things got broken?  The release notes I&#39;ve found so far give only a fairly high-level feature list.</p>
