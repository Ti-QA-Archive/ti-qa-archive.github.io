							<p>A possible error that can be received when launching a mobile app with Titanium SDK 1.5.1 is:</p>
<p>[ERROR] Error generating R.java from manifest</p>
<p>This error can be thrown by not having the correct syntax for the Application ID. The Application ID must contain at least 1 &quot;.&quot;, ie:</p>
<p>Valid names: &quot;com.zaks.tester&quot;, &quot;anyword.anotherword&quot;, &quot;this.that&quot;</p>
<p>Invalid names: &quot;Mytest&quot;, &quot;MyFirstApp&quot;, &quot;ThisIsBad&quot;</p>

							<p>Regarding the apkbuilder.bat error, you can safely ignore it. Read <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.appcelerator.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;troubleshooting_your_installation.html#apkbuilder.bat_-_this_tool_is_deprecated">apkbuilder.bat - THIS TOOL IS DEPRECATED</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Note that &quot;APIs 2.3&quot; is not yet supported by Titanium. Use &quot;APIs 2.2&quot; instead.</p>
<p>Have you tried to delete your build files and force a full rebuild?</p>
<p>Caution, though; currently the process for Android and iOS is different. This is due to ticket <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32238-titanium-mobile&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;2852">#2852</a>.</p>
<p>Hence:</p>
<p>For iOS&#x2F;iphone, delete the contents of the project&#39;s <code>build&amp;#x2F;iphone</code> directory, select <em>Edit Project</em> in Titanium Developer and click the <em>Save Changes</em> button to force a full rebuild. Then launch the app.</p>
<p>For android, only delete <strong>the contents of the immediate subdirectories</strong> of <code>&amp;#x2F;build&amp;#x2F;android</code>, otherwise you may encounter problems. Then click the <em>Save Changes</em> button to force a full rebuild and launch the app, as above.</p>
<p>Lastly, what processor and RAM do you have installed on your system?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>First the Processor - Intel 2 duo core, 2.66ghz, 64bit<br>Ram is 8 gig.</p>
<p>Steps so far:</p>
<p>Started New Project named &quot;leons5&quot;, Saved changes, did a Launch, got the r.manifest error.</p>
<p>&quot;For android, only delete the contents of the immediate subdirectories of &#x2F;build&#x2F;android, otherwise you may encounter problems. Then click the Save Changes button to force a full rebuild and launch the app, as above.&quot;</p>
<p>Then looked in &#x2F;build&#x2F;android, found these subdirectories:<br>&#x2F;assests<br>&#x2F;bin<br>&#x2F;gen<br>&#x2F;lib<br>&#x2F;res<br>&#x2F;src</p>
<p>There was nothing in \assests, \src or \lib<br>\bin had two folders, \assets and \classes, deleted both.<br>\gen had two folders, \com and \leons5d, deleted both.<br>\res and 12 directories, deleted all</p>
<p>Went to Edit, Save changes.<br>Went to Test &amp; Package, clicked Launch.</p>
<p>Here is the Info:<br>[INFO] Building leons5 for Android … one moment</p>
<p>[INFO] Titanium SDK version: 1.5.1 (12&#x2F;16&#x2F;10 16:25 16bbb92)</p>
<p>[INFO] Copying project resources..</p>
<p>[INFO] Detected tiapp.xml change, forcing full re-build…</p>
<p>[INFO] Compiling Javascript Resources …</p>
<p>[ERROR] Error generating R.java from manifest</p>
<p>It forced a re-build, but still the error.<br>It did re-create all of the above directors and contents again.</p>
<p>Tried running Titanium as administrator - same result - error.<br>Tried running in 32bit xp service pack 3 mode - same result - error.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s more - If I create a new project and leave the SDK set to 1.5.1 it gives the r.java error.<br>If I then change the SDK to 1.2.0 it runs and installs on the emulator OK.<br>If I create a new project and set it to SDK 1.2.0 at creation time - when I go to Test &amp; Package I get a blank gray screen. I can&#39;t get it to create the project.<br>I&#39;ve tried this over and over about 4 times and it screws up each time.</p>
<p>So to do an app I have to create the new project with 1.5.1, then go back to edit and change it to 1.2.0, then launch and it will work. But I can only use 1.2.0, can&#39;t get anything to run with 1.5.1.</p>
<p>Any suggestions - very frustrating. I&#39;m coming out for the training next week - would really like to get this working.</p>

<p>Was your original issue with a Windows 7 machine? Do you still have this machine, or have you reinstalled it with XP?</p>
<p>Please note that Windows 7 is a much more suitable machine for using resource-intensive java applications, because it has far superior memory management to XP.</p>
<p>Let me know if you still have your Windows 7 machine and I will try to help you further with it. If you do, please don&#39;t uninstall any of the Titanium-related software, is it will confuse the issues.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>Good stuff! ;)</p>
<p>I will try to help you with this, but you will need to provide me with some information about your system:</p>
<p>Please follow the instructions at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.appcelerator.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;installing_on_windows.html#install_diagnostics_for_windows">Install Diagnostics for Windows</a>. Copy the output and paste it to your preferred <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;">pastebin</a> service. It&#39;s important that you do not modify it <strong>in any way</strong>, as this could mask problems with your configuration. Do <strong>NOT</strong> paste it here! This is because the system will change the formatting.</p>
<p>Also, please create and share a screenshot of your android installed packages, using something like <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;imageshack.us&#x2F;">ImageShack</a></p>
<p>Lastly, run the command <code>systeminfo</code> at the commandline and share it in a pastebin.</p>
<p>Then I will help you further</p>

										<p><p>Here is a page to the things you&#39;ve asked for:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;zaks.com&#x2F;appcelerator</p>
<p>When I did the Install Diags I found I didn&#39;t have Python on this machine, I did add it.</p>
<p>Now Current Status is:<br>We have the Kitchen Sink working with 1.5.1 but not new projects.</p>
<p>If I create New Project it defaults to Titanium SDK 1.5.1. I click Save Changes, then change the SDK to 1.2.0, then go to test &amp; package, then Launch, it works.</p>
<p>I also have a Macbook pro I&#39;ve been setting up. I have kitchen sink running under iphone and android with 1.5.1. If I start a new project, choose iphone, test&amp;package - launch, it builds and runs OK.<br>If I then choose android, test&amp;package - launch, I get the R.java manifest error.<br>If I go to edit, change to SDK 1.2.0, test&amp;package - launch, it works.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ve seen a lot of problems with this but haven&#39;t run across a definitive answer, I think we&#39;ve found it. When trying to Launch a mobile app with the Titanium SDK 1.5.1 you may receive this error:</p>
<p>[ERROR] Error generating R.java from manifest</p>
<p>The problem is the application id format. The application id has to have a &quot;.&quot; (dot) in it. So when I create a new project called &quot;mytest1&quot; it won&#39;t work, gives the R.java error if I use SDK 1.5.1 (not with 1.2.0). If I rename the id &quot;mytest1.asdf&quot; then it will launch and load on the emulator. </p>
<p>This isn&#39;t perfect - it will load and  be available on the emulator but you will get a Force Close error.<br>The best thing to do is to restart with a new name, new application id (with a &quot;.&quot; in it) and launch - then it&#39;s OK.</p>
<p>So I think the next version or next quick fix for the SDK 1.5.x should have a parser that doesn&#39;t need a &quot;.&quot; or at least warns you that you don&#39;t have one in the app id.</p>
<p>This works on the Mac and Windows. Don&#39;t have a Linux running so I couldn&#39;t test it there.</p>
<p>I want the hours back I&#39;ve got into this … but I hope it helps someone else.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Leon</p>
<p>I can certainly understand your frustration with the time you spent; in an ideal world, there would be some validation on the App ID field to alert the user of an error. In fairness, though, the App ID format is clearly displayed as <code>com.companyname.appname</code> when the user creates a new project, and the user must clear it in order to enter their own value.</p>
<p><img src="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;img522.imageshack.us&#x2F;img522&#x2F;7250&#x2F;screenshot208.png" alt="screenshot"></p>
<p>If the user deviates from the recommendations, it&#39;s not unusual that they will experience unexpected results.</p>
<p>Anyway, well done for finding the cause of this issue.  Hopefully it will come in useful to someone in similar circumstances.</p>

										<p><p>Hello - I&#39;m taking exception with your statement that it would take an ideal world - it is a very important piece that was missed. Put &quot;R.java appcelerator&quot; in Google and browse some of the 329,000 hits. Many people have hit this error, I would guess not all got this error because of the same reason as I did, but I would also bet that many where. When looking for an answer I went to Google first and looked and read. </p>
<p>I also watched the video at appcelerator university. When the instructor started a new mobile app he says (at 4:40) and I quote:<br>&quot;Let&#39;s create a new project, let&#39;s select mobile from the drop down menu this time. Titanium developer checks for necessary iPhone and Android prerequisites while I enter some basic information about my app. The application id is significant because it must match to an iPhone provisioned profile, which we will cover in ..unintelligible.. - FOR NOW JUST ENTER A STRING OF CHARACTERS.&quot;</p>
<p>As far as the &quot;recommendation&quot; it may look good on a Mac (as it does on my Mac) but on the machine I used to start investigating Appcelerator which is a fairly new (with 3 21&quot; Samsung lcd monitors, Nvidia video card) Windows 7 machine with default fonts the &quot;.&quot; do not show in the light gray (also often used for inactive or incidental things) text. That coupled with the &quot;just a string of characters&quot; in the training video, to me, doesn&#39;t rate as a recommendation but rather one of the things taken for granted by those familiar with the product or system.</p>
<p>This week, with coming to the training next week, the air fare, hotel and such adding up to over a $3,000 investment, it behooves me to see this product&#x2F;system succeed, not to see beginners whom may not have stuck it out as we did, drop this system because of a &quot;.&quot;.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#39;ll meet you next week,<br>leon …</p>

										<p><p>Maybe I wasn&#39;t clear; I agree with you that the field should be validated and the user alerted.</p>
<p>I remember when I first found Titanium, and have to admit it was a steep learning curve. It didn&#39;t last very long and gave me a broader knowledge, which was good, but I was certainly frustrated at times. That is why I have always spent a considerable about of time helping new users, often at the expense of much more interesting problems, as I have done with you.</p>
<p>The &quot;positive&quot; to come out of this, though, is that you have isolated the cause of an issue and, as a result, I have been able to document it in ticket <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32239-titanium-developer&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;115">#115</a>. Now it is in the core developers&#39; work queue, we can both watch it and be emailed when it gets resolved.</p>
<p>You can submit bug reports too when you find them, but it&#39;s important to be absolutely certain that the report is valid, or else you simply hamper the core developer team and hence the development of Titanium itself. You can avoid filing bad reports by following the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.appcelerator.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;contribute.html#submitting_bug_reports">Submitting Bug Reports</a> guide, as I did.</p>
<p>Good luck with it - and welcome! :)</p>

							<p>I thought I&#39;d come back and put the answer in just in case someone else runs into this problem or something similar. It turned out that it had nothing to do with my installation, what version of Windows I as running, it wasn&#39;t 32 or 64 bit or anything close to that. It was the Application ID. It seems in the Titanium Developer the ID MUST be in a format like the reverse-DNS system. (here&#39;s a wiki reference to it: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reverse-DNS)</p>
<p>I wasted hours on this, it&#39;s not documented anywhere that it has to be in this format. I found one of the tutorial videos that stated &quot;You can name it what you want, I use xxx.xxx.xx&quot;. Wrong. It will throw the manifest error if the ID isn&#39;t in that format.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve not tried it in the new Titanium Studio. These are the kinds of things that make the frustration level creep up with a product.</p>
<p>Hope this helps someone. Be aware of problems as out of line as this.</p>

							<p>I realize this is an old thread. But I just spent an hour tracking down an &quot;Error generating R.java&quot; problem that wasn&#39;t caused by an invalid app id. So, I thought I&#39;d add a note here in case it helps someone else. Turns out, I had duplicate entries in my strings.xml file. The thing that threw me is that I tried building the project a half dozen times before I got more than just the R.java error message. Finally, I got another error about a duplicate resource that clued me in. I hope this helps someone else.</p>
