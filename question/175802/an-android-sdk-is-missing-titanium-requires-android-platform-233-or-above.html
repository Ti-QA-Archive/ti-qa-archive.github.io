			<h1>An Android SDK is missing. Titanium requires Android platform: 2.3.3 or above.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I keep getting this notification on the program&#39;s Dashboard. I&#39;ve been at this for 2 days. There is no way I&#39;m doing this incorrectly. This is a fresh install of Titanium Studio 3.2.3. I clicked on the button that says &quot;Install or Update Android SDK&quot;. On the following screen, &quot;Android&quot; is checked, and after clicking &quot;Settings&quot;, I have tried several combinations of Android SDK selections, always making sure I have at least &quot;Android 2.3.3&quot; and &quot;Android 4.4.2&quot; selected. The SDK location in the above field is definitely correct.<br>Not only that, but it also has a red &#39;x&#39; on the iOS SDK! I definitely have the latest version of Xcode installed. Note that I haven&#39;t attempted to make any apps yet. I haven&#39;t gotten past this Dashboard dilemma.</p>
<p>I&#39;m using MAC OSX on a MacBook Pro.<br>Titanium Studio build: 3.2.3.201404181442<br>I have the Android SDK stored in &#x2F;users&#x2F;username&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;android-sdk (I&#39;ve tried several other folders and names)<br>From Android SDK Manager, I&#39;ve tried selecting API 10 (2.3.3), and 4.4.2, and many other API&#39;s. I&#39;ve even tried some obsolete ones (API 5 and API 9), all to no avail.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve seen many others with this issue and have tried many suggestions. But most of the same issue that I&#39;ve come across is from months or years ago.</p>
<p>I have to say, I&#39;m a first time user and Titanium has made a really crappy first impression. I would really appreciate the help.</p>
