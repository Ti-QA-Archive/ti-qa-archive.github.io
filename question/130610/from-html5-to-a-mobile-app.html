			<h1>from html5 to a mobile app</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a web site that I made, using HTML5, PHP and Mysql DB.<br>Is it posible to take it as is and by using Titanium make a mobile app from it?</p>
<p>If not.. Do I have to do a lot of changes to do that?</p>
<p>I tried to put it as a project in the Titanium and to run it on Android SDK, but got all kinds of errors.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

							<p>Hello,</p>
<p>The quick answer, could be use a webview inside the app, and just open your website. But that won&#39;t solve the resize issues. </p>
<p>The path to go from your website to a mobile app requires more work. Basically:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You need to create webservices that generates or provides the content of your webpage.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create the UI&#x2F;UX using Titanium components.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create code in javascript that glues the webservices with your UI.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This in effect can take some time, it depends on the information architecture and implementation of your webpage.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro</p>

							<p>You should just be able to open a webview with the url when the app loads.  On your server, you&#39;ll want to have some javascript in each page to see what type of device is using it, and resize based on that.</p>

							<p>No, you can&#39;t use html5 code as is. Though it speaks JS, Ti is ultimately native.</p>
<p>And you&#39;ll pretty much need to create a new interface from scratch, and set your server up so it spits out raw data where your app can use.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure on the Android side of things, but you can deploy a <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sixrevisions.com&#x2F;web-development&#x2F;html5-iphone-app&#x2F;">HTML5 app in iOS</a> with some extra assets and <code>meta</code> tags.</p>

							<p>Thank you for your answers!</p>
<p>So I guess the easiest way is to use the first way that Mauro suggested. And by adding to each page some javascript it will be resized automatically for all the devices, as Josh wrote.<br>Is there any cons from the other option Mauro suggested?</p>
<p>And most important.. Can I do it with Titanium? I heard about PhoneGap, which one is better?</p>

										<p><p>you meant Josh&#39;s answer? Mauro essentially said building the whole UI from scratch.</p>
<p>Ti and PhoneGap are like apples and oranges. All I can say is, developing on PhoneGap isn&#39;t fun.</p>
<p>Not knowing what your app is or does, makes things kinda hard. But if I rephrase your question to, can one create an app that just load a remote website and push the app to the marketplace, then yes, Ti is able to do that.</p>
