			<h1>Twitter-like navbar with scrollview titles and paging controls</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s possible to replicate the Twitter&#39;s iOS app navbar with Alloy&#x2F;Classic code. I thought of these two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add labels to each scrollview. With label&#39;s having a negative top value and a zIndex higher than the navigation bar. This latter is not possible because of hierarchy issue. Could create a custom navbar but that would get complicated as I&#39;d need to build animations etc when child windows are opened&#x2F;back button is pressed etc.</li>
<li>Track scrollview&#39;s offset and create an animation to replicate twitter&#39;s fadein&#x2F;out and slide of the title. This is probably the way to go – but I&#39;ve no idea where to start&#x2F;what the structure would be.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>By the looks of this it is not how you think.</p>
<p>It appears to have a <strong>scrollableView</strong> on the main window and has no direct association with the titlebar at all - that is achieved in code.</p>
<p>The title bar is created a view added as a <strong>titleControl</strong>.. Then it has two main sections;</p>
<ul>
<li>top part - labels<ul>
<li>x labels that are the same width as the available space which must be a numeric value NOT FILL or SIZE.</li>
<li>each label has the text centered</li>
<li>only the first label is visible to start with - but NOT by using <strong>hide</strong>, using <strong>opacity</strong> with a value of 0.</li>
<li>on the scrollableView <strong>scroll</strong> event you move the labels in and out to the the position of 0, with labels moving right ending up with a left equal to the width of the titleControl space, labels moving left end up with a negative value also equal to the width of the titrleControl - only the visible label is at left of zero</li>
<li>use opacity as a value between 0 and 1 to make the labels come in and out of view - this can be a simple calculation of the scrollableViews current views left position (returned as property of event) - this will tell you which direction it is going and the view width divided by the device width can be passed to opactity when worked out as a percentage </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>bottom part - page indicateor<ul>
<li>add a container view equal to the width of the titleControl</li>
<li>add a label with a bullet character for each &quot;page&quot; you have and make the width twice the width of the actual bullet (gives the padding - adjust as you want)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>when the scroll or scrollend events dictate set the opacity of the current page to 1 and the others to something less - 0.5 for example.</li>
</ul>
<p>This will replicate the effect you are after.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the clear instructions (and the fast reply!) – so far so good. One issue though, when listening for scroll for my scrollableView element, the returned event properties is:</p>
<p><code>{
    bubbles = 1;
    cancelBubble = 0;
    currentPage = 0;
    currentPageAsFloat = 0;
    source = &amp;#39;[object scroller]&amp;#39;;
    type = scroll;
    view = &amp;#39;[object __alloyId256]&amp;#39;;
}</code></p>
<p>I used currentPageAsFloat to calculate the left position etc, but this is not as smooth as I would like it to be: especially when the user scrolls&#x2F;swipes quickly. Any advice on this? Is there any way I can actually get the left position of the ScrollableViews and use that for my calculations?</p>

										<p><p>Ended up smoothing out the re-positioning: <code>titleControlView.animate({left: (evt.currentPageAsFloat * labelWidth), duration:50});</code></p>
<p>Thanks so much for your help!</p>
