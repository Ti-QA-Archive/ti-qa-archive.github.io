			<h1>tabgroup limitations</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am designing the UI paradigm for a complex project and can&#39;t get tabgroups to operate consistently the way I anticipated.  In searching the Q&amp;A history, I am coming to the shocking (to me) revelation that a tabgroup may be restricted to the root window.</p>
<p>Is this really true?  Is this documented anywhere?  Is this a &quot;feature&quot; of iOS and&#x2F;or Android, or a limitation of the current Titanium SDK that may be lifted in the future?</p>
<p>In my envisioned hierarchy of screens, some of the nested windows would themselves utilize tabgroups with scrollviews to separate controls into logical groupings for the user.  But I can&#39;t make a nested tabgroup behave right consistently.  Do I just need to rethink my paradigm and not use any nested tabgroups?</p>
<p>I&#39;d consider replacing with a TabbedBar, with each button bringing a certain page of a SrollableView to focus, but AFAIK Android OS does not support a TabbedBar.</p>
<p>Are there are documents &#x2F; blogs &#x2F; whatever that summarize when UI elements are allowed on which platforms?  And which properties don&#39;t work with both iOS and Android?  For example, one recommendation was to define a tab group on the root window even if you don&#39;t need it, then hide it with tabBarHidden:true to allegedly increase performance &#x2F; memory handling.  Yet in another spot it is revealed that Android OS does not support tabBarHidden, making the first suggestion useless for cross-platform work.</p>
<p>It isn&#39;t fun to be well down the road expecting to use one design only to find the UI controls don&#39;t support the intended usage.</p>
<p>Are there any definitive references available?</p>

							<p>Doug, I think at the moment you are going to have a difficult time utlising tabgroups in the way that you would like, particularly with regard to your cross-platform objectives. In the long-term though, I believe it could certainly be possible, and even desirable, for them to provide the features you have described.</p>
<p>I have done quite a bit of experimentation with tabgroups following your question, although only on android. One approach I had was to create multiple tabgroups and open and close them to simulate different &quot;levels&quot; of submenus, which I presume is the effect that you are after. It transpires that this is not possible for android because the tabgroup object is missing the close method, as confirmed in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32238-titanium-mobile&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;2015">this ticket</a>.</p>
<p>Then I attempted to add and remove tabs from a single tabgroup, to give a similar effect that would probably not be much more difficult for the developer than my previous technique. However, the removeTab() method did not have any effect, as I described in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32238-titanium-mobile&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;2385">this ticket</a>.</p>
<p>That said, there is another solution that would not be difficult either, which is to use <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;latest&#x2F;Titanium.UI.View-object">Titanium.UI.Views</a> to emulate tabgroups.  This would be totally platform-agnostic, with the advantage that you have complete control over their look and behaviour.</p>
<p>Even better, some kind chap called Christian from the Appcelerator community has generously written some code that creates custom tabs and made it available for everyone. You can find it <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;46801&#x2F;giving-to-the-community-custom-tabgroup-class-working-on-android-and-iphone">here</a>.</p>
<p>I hope you find this info useful.  Good luck with your project!</p>

							<p>Hal,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for the reply – yes the info sounds useful and I will research it.  Strangely, I never found the solution mentioned when I searched the Q&amp;A for tabgroup and I thought I visited virtually every search result on that word.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Q&amp;A has more answers and solutions than I give it credit for; I wish I would have found this in my own searches.</p>
