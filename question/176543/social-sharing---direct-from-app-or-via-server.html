			<h1>Social sharing - Direct from app or via server?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Just a curiosity for now, but if I wanted to implement social sharing options for various sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, etc., would it be better to implement that functionality directly into the app or to offload it to a remote server and send requests from the app using an HTTPClient?</p>
<p>Naturally sharing via a remote server might increase the response time, but the app is already set up to interface with a CodeIgniter application, so the framework in which to build a simple OAuth library is already in place. On the other hand, building it into the app might provide a quicker end-user experience but may be more troublesome to implement and maintain.</p>
<p>Are there any significant advantages or disadvantages for either approach?</p>

							<p>When you add a server share there is an extra step the user has to do: authorise your app to access the social service. If your app doesn&#39;t need facebook or twittter to work (so the user is already logged in) you will lose a lot of potential posts -  the user is lazy or he doesn&#39;t want to give you access.</p>
<p>Sharing from device is faster and seamless - iOs has fb&#x2F;tw already baked in, on android you can use intents.<br>The drawback -  for other networks you need to find&#x2F;build the sharing part yourself and you won&#39;t be able to control the text -  on server you can always add &quot;via myAwsemeApp&quot; :)</p>

										<p><p>I suppose sharing directly from the device makes more sense, especially if they sign into each social network it&#39;s easier to keep those credentials. In terms of Facebook and Twitter, Titanium has Modules.Facebook for Facebook and Alloy.builtins.social for Twitter; is that how you would facilitate sharing to those two sites? Any reason why Facebook has not been implemented as part of Alloy.builtins.social? Is it just that new?</p>

										<p><p>No idea why is not there. However I use <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;viezel&#x2F;TiSocial.Framework">TiSocial</a> for sharing (ios).</p>

										<p><p>Are you just using it as-is, or are there things that need to be tweaked as changes are made to the Titanium SDK and Facebook&#x2F;Twitter APIs?</p>

										<p><p>As it is. It uses the Apple&#39;s Social.Framework so it should be safe from changes, as long as Apple doesn&#39;t change the underlaying API.</p>
