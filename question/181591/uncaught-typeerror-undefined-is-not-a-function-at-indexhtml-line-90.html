			<p>Working on Windows 7<br>Titanium SDK 3.5.1 GA</p>
<p>Was revisiting an HTML based app I was working on. Ran it in mobile web preview in browser. First thing to come up was the error Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function at &#x2F;index.html (line 90). Line 90 in index.html is CSS, no functions are being executed. I decided to create the template HTML based app and run that, sure enough I had the same issue. Thought it was an issue with my install so I re-installed titanium, still the same issue. Installed titanium on another machine and ran a fresh template HTML based app on that… still same issue. I&#39;m guessing its an issue with setting up titanium however I don&#39;t remember running into this issue when I started working on this application earlier last year. There might be a new step involved however I am not seeing anything I am missing in the startup guides. Any help on how to get this running again will be much appreciated.</p>

							<p>Hi Sean, the thing you might be missing here is that not every function is cross-compatible.</p>
<p>So you could check the supported platforms before running the app on any browser, this is where we have to do platform-specific coding.</p>
<p>At Ti docs, every function, property &amp; event is listed by the icons of supported platforms.</p>
<p>Or just provide us some more information to know the exact error.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>I&#39;m having the same issue.</p>
<p>Running the webview in Firefox shows a more detailed information about the javascript error.<br>(I&#39;m trying to run the basic HTML View example app)</p>
<p>Turns out that the file ui&#x2F;ApplicationWindow.js is accesible via 127.0.0.1:8020 but mobileweb&#x2F;ui&#x2F;ApplicationWindowPlatform.js not. (Returns 404 on direct reference using http:&#x2F;&#x2F;127.0.0.1:8020&#x2F;mobileweb&#x2F;ui&#x2F;ApplicationWindowPlatform.js</p>
<p>So, as ui&#x2F;ApplicationWindow.js loads the later one, this is the cause of the problem. (ApplicationWindowPlatform() function defined in his .js is the &#39;undefined&#39; thing the error referres to.</p>
<p>The solution? I don&#39;t know. Maybe a misconfiguration of the server not setting the correct permissions to this mobileweb path, but how can we change it?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
