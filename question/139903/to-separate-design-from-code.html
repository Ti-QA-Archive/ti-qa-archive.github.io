			<h1>To separate design from code</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to separate my logic code from my design code. A little bit like a mvc framework, but not that complex.</p>
<p>I looked at some mvc framework on titanium and I didn&#39;t like any of them, some of them had great idea that I incorporate in my developpement structure but that pretty much it.</p>
<p>So the main two reasons why I would like to separate my logic code from the design code, is first: it&#39;s easier to read<br>Then, I want to be able to support multiple screen size. I know we can use percent, but in my experience, using percent is only a &quot;good enouph hack&quot;, it never really give you exactly what you want. Further more, some bigger screen should be able to have more options, and be optimized.</p>
<p>So I tried to include &#x2F; require a file, I tried using a normal include, or using it as a commonJs module, but could not make it work.</p>
<p>My graphics variable aren&#39;t passed to the logic file.<br>So is there a way to do so, without having to pass every single graphics variable to some function?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

							<p>Percent is not the way to go if you want to support multiple screen sizes. (<code>dp</code> is the way to go)</p>
<p>As for your <em>passing every single graphics variable to some function</em>, I must admit that I don&#39;t quite understand what you are trying to achieve. Titanium already has some mechanisms in place to do just that. (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.1&#x2F;index.html#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Using_density-specific_resources_on_Android">there is even a dedicated section</a> in the Titanium guides)</p>

										<p><p>This work well for images, but imagine you have a app that will run on a 10&quot; tablet and on a cellphone.<br>Of course, you may not have all the options on the cellphone since you don&#39;t have the same space, or at least they won&#39;t be showed the same way.</p>
<p>But I don&#39;t want to double (maybe triple) my code on the object that will be on every screen sizes.</p>
<p>So if I create a button that will be every screen size, and the action is the same, I want to define that code only once. </p>
<p>My idea to pass every variable to some function was to create an function that will add the event listener or other logic code to every graphic element (variable), so I would have to pass every single one of thoses graphics elements to this function, but I was looking for a better way to do so.</p>

							<p>I do a bit of this, not MVC, just trying to separate things. I think it&#39;s going to come down to your style. My apps so far have been fairly easy on the resources so my process may not work on larger apps.</p>
<p>I usually create a namespace for each group of activities and separate each name space into different files. So my ajax calls are in a call.js file in the app.ajax namespace. Then I define all my ajax calls as so:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">app.ajax.getThisData = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span>{
<span class="hljs-comment">//CODE</span>
}
app.ajax.getThatData = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span>{
<span class="hljs-comment">//CODE</span>
}
</code></pre><p>I do the same thing for different parts of my application. I also have a general.js file that has constructors for various UI parts. So:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">app.general.createTableSection = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span>{
<span class="hljs-comment">//CODE</span>
}
</code></pre><p>This helps because then for all platforms I can simply call:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> tableSection</span> = app.general.createTableSection();
</code></pre><p>and it will build the section platform&#x2F;device specific based on which general.js file was included or other logic in that file.</p>
<p>Then in my app.js file I include different files based on platform&#x2F;device&#x2F;etc. So that way I can have an altered general.js file for each platform etc and build things a bit differently. Other parts of my app such as calls, events, etc can be the same across all platforms.</p>
<p>That&#39;s my way and is probably in no way the best. I also have an events.js file to handle all App level events, and an init file to handle initial loading os things.</p>

										<p><p>I forgot to mention, certain elements I scope in the namespace rather than just functional scope. Like a certain table that may need to be accessed outside the function. If it were in the settings window for instance I might name that table app.settings.settingsTable just so later in an ajax call or something I can easily access that table rather than having to drill down through the window&#39;s children.</p>
