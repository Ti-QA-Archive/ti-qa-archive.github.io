			<h1>How to hack Appcelerator Cloud Services ?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>How secure are the Cloud Services, and please correct me here if I misunderstood something. I am just thinking out loud here, worried a little bit about the security in ACS.</p>
<p><strong>Thought 1</strong> :<br>When app is developed with ACS and published to all platforms (iOS, Android and Mobile Web) - one could open up the source, find the API Key for ACS, and write a little script to actually pull out all of the Users, with their emails, locations, reviews, images, etc.<br>Same goes for the Mobile Web and SQL lite database, - open source, find name of SQL lite database, and download it via URL. </p>
<p><strong>Thought 2</strong> :<br>Even if the App is not published with &quot;Mobile Web&quot; option. It is possible to connect any mobile device to a router and log a request the App has made and get the API key (again) from the ACS Cloud Services, and read all the data I have stored.</p>
<p>I know Thought 2 could be countered with a 2-legged OAuth, but it&#39;s currently not supported in Javascript SDK according to http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.appcelerator.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;authentication</p>
<p>The SSL doesn&#39;t really matter in this case, as it only protects user from receiving false responses. If I&#39;m logging the requests, it is not an issue.</p>

<p>I noticed on Wed that the API details were at the bottom of the generated Mobile Web project.  Some sort of oauth would be useful.</p>

							<p>I found this on the <code>Build Mobile Apps with Titanium</code> book. This is in iBooks couldnt find it on the web. Hope it helps</p>
<p>Your app must prove that it is allowed to talk to ACS. This keeps your data secure by preventing anyone from making requests to ACS that impersonate your app. ACS provides secure authentication via Two-Legged OAuth. This is a process by which a key and secret are used to sign each request made by your app. When the ACS server receives your request, the secret is used along with the data sent in the request to calculate another signature. If sent signature and calculated signature match, the request will be processed.</p>
<p>You could put those keys into the tiapp.xml file by adding the following keys:</p>
<p>tiapp.xml</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">property</span> <span class="hljs-property">name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"acs-api-key"</span> type=<span class="hljs-string">"string"</span>&gt;get_from_app_admin_page&lt;/<span class="hljs-keyword">property</span>&gt;
&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">property</span> <span class="hljs-property">name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"acs-oauth-key"</span> type=<span class="hljs-string">"string"</span>&gt;get_from_app_admin_page&lt;/<span class="hljs-keyword">property</span>&gt;
&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">property</span> <span class="hljs-property">name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"acs-oauth-secret"</span> type=<span class="hljs-string">"string"</span>&gt;get_from_app_admin_page&lt;/<span class="hljs-keyword">property</span>&gt;
</code></pre><p>Keep in mind that the tiapp.xml file is included as plain text, even in a production-build version of your app. So, a more secure means is to set these values in your JavaScript.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var Cloud = require(<span class="hljs-comment">'ti.cloud');</span>
Cloud.apiKey = <span class="hljs-comment">'YOUR ACS API KEY HERE';</span>
Cloud.consumerKey = <span class="hljs-comment">'YOUR OAuth KEY HERE';</span>
Cloud.consumerSecret = <span class="hljs-comment">'YOUR OAuth SECRET HERE';</span>
</code></pre><p>For production builds to native targets (iOS&#x2F;Android, but not Mobile Web), your Titanium JavaScript is semi-compiled: on Titanium JavaScript is semi-compiled: on iOS, it&#39;s included as the inline value of a variable in a C file that is actually compiled; on Android, it&#39;s converted to bytecode. Neither build process protects your keys completely, but both will stop all but the most determined individuals from gaining access to your keys.</p>

										<p><p>That provides a reasonable security with trying to crack-open the app. But if I attach the phone (with the app running) to a router with a specific system to log all Network requests, I am actually able to read out what URLs are requested, and see the Key that has been encoded.</p>
<p>And from this I understand that JavaScript SDK (The one used for writing Mobile apps) doesn&#39;t support OAuth yet, which basically is a security threat because Two step oAuth isn&#39;t possible, so the data is accessed only with the API Key without any tokens:  http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.appcelerator.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;authentication</p>

							<p>App key should always be used together with access control for mobile devices. We currently have some basic access control. We have several projects going on to address security issues for the next release which includes keyless client and custom access control.</p>
<p>If you are not the current user, you can&#39;t get another user&#39;s email and external account tokens. You should try to store private data in keyvalue setting access_private to true.  See http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.appcelerator.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;api&#x2F;v1&#x2F;keyvalues&#x2F;set</p>
<p>In the app setting, you can disable user creation from API and disable query to non-logged in users. But this is extreme since most app would like to allow user creation from the device.</p>
<p>We do support oauth in javascript, please check out http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.appcelerator.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;javascript and search for oauth. I realize that the doc might be inconsistent in other places mentioning that oauth is not supported for javascript and we will fix that.</p>

										<p><p>I have looked through the <strong>ti.cloud.js</strong> in my Modules, and could not find <strong>apiKey</strong>… but I did find <strong>appKey</strong>, so I tried that:</p>
<p><code>Cloud.appKey = &amp;#39;DifferentXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&amp;#39;;</code><br> with no luck :p</p>
<p>I figured I should have tried solving it myself. :&#x2F; spend a full day on this and still no luck :s</p>
<p>On the Other hand, the SDK for Javascript can create a new Cocoafish in the code, like so:</p>
<p> <code>var sdk = new Cocoafish(&amp;quot;app key&amp;quot;);</code></p>
<p>As well as in Adobe AIR:</p>
<p> <code>var sdk:Cocoafish = new Cocoafish(&amp;quot;acs-app-key&amp;quot;);</code></p>
<p>It&#39;s <strong>Only in Titanium I am having difficulty creating a new Connection to the Cloud via Javascript</strong> <em>(and not via tiapp.xml)</em>.</p>
