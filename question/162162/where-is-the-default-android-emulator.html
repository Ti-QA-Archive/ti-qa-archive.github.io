			<h1>Where is the default android emulator</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I recently had to install 3.2 on Windows 8 i7 16 GB computer which had been reset to factory settings.  I followed the instructions and accepted the default values.  When I tried to run the sample program on the Titanium site for Android, the system responded that there was no emulator.  This was not the case with 3.1.3 - which was installed on the same computer after being reset to factory settings.  Therefore, both installations started from the exact same point.</p>
<p>After manually creating an emulator - it runs about 20 times slower than the emulator that had been installed with 3.1.3.</p>
<p>I asked for a simple straight forward install that gets me developing - 3.2 is not the answer.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The Android emulator has been always been something of a let down, it is a surprise that Google has allowed it to remain this way for so long.  There may of course be some issues with how Titanium talks to it that do not help things - I do not know - but in short using it is nothing short of frustration at best.</p>
<p>Personally I have given up on it and until recently simply connected physical devices - not always practical for a variety (despite having loads) as you cannot account for as many configuration variations as you would like.</p>
<p>Not what you want to hear I am sure - as there is no magic answer…</p>
<p>…there is a magic answer.  A solution know as Genymotion - it is an emulator that is widely liked and by some loved.  Reported to be very fast and generally and all round winner.</p>
<p>I would suggest giving it a go, there is a free version that has no restrictions - paid versions with more features, the free one will do everything I imagine you need of an emulator - so your choice to buy a license.  The only thing I will say is if you use it all the time - consider a licence.</p>
<p>First off - genymotion has nothing to do with Titanium - but Titanium can connect to it and it works well.  You just have to set a few things up before it will work - but it is easy enough and there are blog posts to help you along.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2013&#x2F;11&#x2F;genymotion-an-android-emulator-you-can-use&#x2F;">Genymotion – An Android emulator you can use </a></li>

</ul>
<p>Some of this information was created before Ti SDK 3.2 was available so simply take that into account when setting things up - for example you are no longer working with a beta of 3.2.</p>

<p>Hopefully this will get you back and</p>

										<p><p>It might be worth jumping to Ti 3.2.1 RC as there are a number of fixes in there.  I do not know if any address your specific issues but certainly worth checking - make backups (always make backups).</p>
<p>Additionally there is a blog article that addresses some issue - worth checking out.</p>

</ul>
<p>Whilst there were a few installation issues that some people got - your installation (from your own description) seems to be so bad I would suggest performing a clean install. As to how you are getting different code results during each successive compile with no code changes - I have never heard of that one.  Something is not right with your setup.</p>
<p>I use the betas of everything, I am way in the the next version and the one after that - I have not experienced any of these issues.</p>

							<p>Thank you for the suggestion.  I will certainly try it.  However, I would like to know what is going on with the installation of 3.2 and the lack of agreement between online documentation and the actual product.</p>
<ul>
<li>Emulator not installed</li>
<li>Android SDK not fully downloaded during installation - parts are missing</li>
<li>Required software such as Nodejs, Java, and Android SDK not installed in the locations that the online Titanium documents specifies.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have not even addressed the problem that different results can be obtained with each Run of the application - without any code changes.</p>

										<p><p>Quick tip; next time - please do not create a new answer when your contribution is actually a comment - it confuses things in the future when trying to work out relevance, simply add a comment to the answer it is related to, or if the additional information is a follow up to the question or general information then add it as a comment to your own question at the top.  You are NOT being told off.</p>
