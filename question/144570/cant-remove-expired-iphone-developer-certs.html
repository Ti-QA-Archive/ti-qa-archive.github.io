							<p>Open the keychain and find your certificate and provisioning profile, select the one which you want to delete and delete them by pressing the delete button. also provisioning profile is associated with your mobile(iPHone) so go to your iPhone settings app and scroll down to see all your profiles and delete the profile associated with you expired certificate.</p>
<p>Hope that may help? for more help i may need more detail about exact error message or steps you do to delete the profile.</p>

										<p><p>Ashish-</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply however there is a misunderstanding.  I am not referring to a mobile provisioning profile for an app.  I am talking about the Developer Certification.</p>

							<p>UPDATE:<br>Now there is an addition developer cert instead of 4 there are 5.  Only 1 is valid.</p>
<p>Before this was annoying as it would force me to delete the three revoked certs and then compile.  Now I can not compile at all as it reinserts the multiple developer certifications and throws and error of there being too many of the same developer certs.</p>
<p>I have deleted, rebooted the computer, I have done everything I can think of but these certs keep coming back.</p>

							<p>Same issue here! Ti-Studio generates the wrong certificate, even when it&#39;s already been removed from the keychain</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m still dealing with it, too. I guess it would make sense to generate a new deverloper certificate at the iOS provisioning portal. Did you tried this?</p>
