			<h1>Blurry Text on a TextField...</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am developing an iPad application and I have a textField and a standard Label next to each other… For one reaosn or another, the textField text looks quite blurry compared to the label which is very crisp.</p>
<p>I have read some stuff on Retina Display, but not entirely sure what it is… or if I have to do anything special to implement..</p>
<p>Any help to solve this problem would be awesome. It doesn&#39;t look very professional to have blurry text. Looks like an amateur developed application.</p>
<p>Just FYI:<br>I have tried to the following items with no luck:</p>
<p>1) Removing my fontSize and other font attribs.<br>2) Removed width, top left right and bottom attribs on the text field</p>
<p>I am not sure what I am doing wrong here. Anyone else have this issue?</p>

<p>Can you post a screenshot of exactly what it is you are experiencing. Also, what version of the platform and mobile sdk are you using.</p>

<p>You actually cannot tell to well on the Emulator that the text is blurry, because the whole display is quite small… I would have to upload from an actual iPad.</p>

							<p>I had the engineering team take a look at this phenomenon and this is what they had to say:</p>
<p>From <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-14067">TIMOB-14067</a></p>
<p>This is not a bug, just the way iOS draws stuff on half pixels.</p>
<p>Lets take the example of the first custom tab which looks blurry.</p>
<p>It has a width of 185. The tab1_interior has an autowidth of 100 [36 + 12 + 52(label)]. So with no position pins this draws the view at half pixels which causes the view to be blurry. The same is true for the retina display as well, except that the screen resolution is so high (4x pixels) you can not really see the blurred edges.</p>
<p>The claim that the tab with an even width is not blurred is incorrect. That is blurred as well but only slightly (since only the frame.origin.y calculates to a half pixel). To prove the point just change the height of <code>customTab3</code> to 58 to see a crisp rendition of the view.</p>
<p>To fix the issue, just give a proper top and left to all the autosized containers. You can get the approximate values from the postlayout listener on the views. I just ran the sample with the following redefinition</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var tab1_interior = Ti.UI.createView({
    layout: <span class="hljs-string">"horizontal"</span>,
    horizontalWrap: <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>,
    width: Titanium.UI.SIZE,
    height: Titanium.UI.SIZE,
    top:<span class="hljs-number">14</span>,
    left:<span class="hljs-number">43</span>
});
</code></pre><p>The postlayout listener reported the rect property of this view to be [x,y,width,height]=[42.5,14.5,100,28]</p>
<p>Going to mark this as wont fix since we are actually doing exactly what the code specified.</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve had the same problem too for the iPad. I&#39;ve managed to fix it by using even number widths. Also if you use a split view make sure in your detailNav window (the right side) use odd number widths because the black line that divides the splitview is 1 pixel making the detailNav width 447px an odd number, so any even numbers will blur the text.</p>

							<p>Have also seen this on the app being currently developed. We had to play around with the font and size, and colours…. It ended up with it being the font colour on the background. but took a while sorted it out, think it was font suez which we eventually sorted.</p>

							<p>I appreciate you taking the time to respond… Perhapse pasting some of my code will help… If you look at it you will see that I have the same exact font size and color for each of the fields, but in this case the label is super crisp and the textView is blurry.</p>
<p>Here is my textField</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var registrationPostalResultsLabel = Ti.UI.createTextField
({
<span class="hljs-label">     value:</span>Ti.UI.profile[<span class="hljs-string">'zip'</span>],
<span class="hljs-label">     font:</span>{<span class="hljs-string">fontSize:</span><span class="hljs-number">14</span>}, 
<span class="hljs-label">     textAlign:</span><span class="hljs-string">'right'</span>, 
<span class="hljs-label">     color:</span><span class="hljs-string">'#395587'</span>, 
<span class="hljs-label">     right:</span><span class="hljs-number">5</span>, 
     <span class="hljs-string">width :</span> <span class="hljs-string">'50%'</span>, 
     <span class="hljs-string">autocapitalization :</span> Ti.UI.TEXT_AUTOCAPITALIZATION_NONE, 
     <span class="hljs-string">autocorrect :</span> <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>, <span class="hljs-string">keyboardType :</span> Titanium.UI.KEYBOARD_NUMBER_PAD
});
</code></pre><p>Here is my label:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var registrationGenderResultsLabel = Ti.UI.createLabel
({
     <span class="hljs-built_in">text</span> : (Ti.UI.profile[<span class="hljs-string">'gender'</span>]==<span class="hljs-string">'1'</span> ? <span class="hljs-string">"Male"</span> : <span class="hljs-string">"Female"</span>),
     font:{fontSize:<span class="hljs-number">14</span>},
     <span class="hljs-built_in">textAlign</span>:<span class="hljs-string">'right'</span>,
     <span class="hljs-built_in">color</span>:<span class="hljs-string">'#395587'</span>,
     right:<span class="hljs-number">5</span>,
     <span class="hljs-variable">width</span> : <span class="hljs-string">'50%'</span>
});

										<p><p>It may help to note these fields are both in a TableViewRow… I am not sure if this is the issue, I haven&#39;t tried that… but that would require I re-do all my code into a standard view without tabless… lame if this were the fix.</p>
