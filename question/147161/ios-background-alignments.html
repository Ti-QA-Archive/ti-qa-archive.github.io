			<h1>Ios Background alignments</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have found that in a tabbed application my backgrounds are not aligning properly from the 3 different screen sizes.<br>OK first off i have the 3 diffrent sizes for my splash screens and they are working ok.<br>Default.png        320x480<br>Default@2x.png        640x960<br>Default-568h@2x.png        640x1136<br>I now launch into a tabbed application with a TiUi.createView of height:480 width 320.   And a Ti.UI.createImageView with Background.png of height:480 width 320.    I have 3 backgrounds.<br>Background.png        320x480<br>Background@2x.png    640x960<br>Background-568@2x.png     640x1136<br>I also have buttons that have to line up in specific places like top 159 left 172.</p>
<p>I have found that for the splash screen everything is ok and the os uses the 3 provided images.<br>But for adding an image for a background or createImageView it will not use the -568 for 640x1136 it will use the 640x960 version and create a shift where the image should be.  Also the buttons will not appear in the create place for 640x1136 version.   I have attempted to use height and width of Ti.UI.Size but that just attempt to squash the image into place.<br>I have also tried<br>var imgback = &quot;Background.png&quot;;<br>if (Ti.Platform.displayCaps.platformHeight &gt; 480 {<br>imgBack =  &quot;Background-568h@2x.png&quot;<br>THis does not work. </p>
<p>The problem for the 640x1136 size is that the os is defaulting to useing a image that is 640x960.  This creates a line or shift of the image to make up the remaining 176 points.   If I apply an button in a specific position for 320x480 and 540x960 it will be off 176 points for 640x1136 screens.<br>Is there any way to apply a correction for the larger screens of 640x1136???   Detecting the screens is not working and we should not have to do it when ever we are applying images.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>This has been asked and answered before - so you are in luck.</p>
<p>Here is the main part: -</p>
<p>The default image is the only one that supports this naming convention so default-568h@2x.png will work for the splash&#x2F;start-up screen but this is the only place.</p>
<p>So your example is a background image, this will NOT be done automatically for you, you have to manage this yourself.</p>
<p>iOS will swap between non-retina and retina images but not height adjusted images, you will need to swap those in yourself using logic to determine the device height.</p>
<p>This is not a Titanium limitation it is an iOS one.</p>
<p>Here is the full answer <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;147042&#x2F;iphone5-screen-resolution#answer-254780">iPhone5 Screen Resolution</a></p>
<p>Here is a function that will provide a wrapper solution;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">h568</span>(<span class="hljs-params">strFilename</span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> (Ti.Platform.displayCaps.platformHeight === <span class="hljs-number">568</span>) ? strFilename.replace(<span class="hljs-regexp">/(\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4})/gim</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'-568h$1'</span>) : strFilename;
}
</code></pre><p>Here is how to use it;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var view = Ti.UI.createView({
    backgroundImage: h568(<span class="hljs-string">'back.gif'</span>),
    <span class="hljs-variable">height</span>: Ti.UI.FILL,
    <span class="hljs-variable">width</span>: Ti.UI.FILL
});
win.<span class="hljs-built_in">add</span>(view);

										<p><p>Ok The backgrounds are correct now.   The button positions are in the correct position for 320x480 and 640x960 but not 640x1136.   How would we show the correct positions for -568?  Riddle me this and I will give you a best answer!</p>

										<p><p>Bribery aside, can you give me some code for the buttons and ideally an image showing it working and failing, I am sure I can give you a helper function or even a way to do it without and calcs - depending on what you are doing.</p>

										<p><p>var Button = Ti.UI.createButton({<br>        height:20,<br>        width:120,<br>        backgroundImage:&#39;&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;ButtonOff.png&#39;,<br>        backgroundSelectedImage:&#39;&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;ButtonOn.png&#39;,<br>        top:159,<br>        left:172<br>    });<br>    self.add(Button);</p>
<p>I have 3 different button files<br>ButtonOn.png<br>ButtonOff.png<br>ButtonOn@2x.png<br>ButtonOff@2x.png<br>ButtonOn-568h@2x.png<br>ButtonOff-568h@2x.png</p>
<p>For 320x480 and 640x960 they are in the correct spot.   On the new 640x1136 they appear to be closer to the top of the screen.  The must be a way to have them in a different spot for -568 version.</p>

										<p><p>I suspect you have more related code than this as you have only added one button line and it has a fixed top so it will always be correct as long as it parent is also fixed to a top or bottom.</p>
<p>I am going to need more code and a couple of screenshots to get a sense of where the problem is.</p>
<p>Also what is the difference between <strong>buttonon@2x.png</strong> and <strong>buttonon-568h@2x.png</strong> as your code has the dimensions for both as the same.</p>
<p>More details please and I will check first thing in the morning as it is 2am here in the UK right now,</p>

										<p><p>Without further information I am at a lose to work out where the position problem is.  If you add a single button to; non-retina, retina and tall iPhones where you set the top, they will all appear in the same place over the respective backgrounds - as long as those backgrounds are correctly designed.</p>
<p>If it is the background image that actually changes visual position within the canvas then it is the design not the position that is the fault.</p>

							<p>unfortunately that&#39;s all the code there is.   I used only the above written code.  The 3 different buttons are an attempt to see it Ios is using them for the different screen sizes, as they are all the same size.  If you use the provided splash screens with titanium and use them as a background and create a 20x120 button to test you would see I am correct.   I have tried several different ways to get things to line up but it seems imposable unless there is a way to have one button in two places for the different screen sizes.  It seems wired that ios has not run into this problem before.</p>
