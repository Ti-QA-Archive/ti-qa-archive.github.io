			<h1>SDK Updates in Linux</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have Developer 1.2.2 Installed on both my Win7 Laptop and my Linux Mint 10 Desk top.  </p>
<p>The Windows updates fine,  but when I click the link to update the Mobile and Desktop SDK&#39;s in the linux installation the application does nothing?</p>
<p>Anyway to fix this?  or is it there are are no prebuilt packages for linux? </p>
<p>I tried to compile from from source but there seems to be a thousand dependencies that keep causing errors in the compiling,  after 8 hours of looking up and fixing the error only to have more errors I am about done with tring to compile it locally,  I wish there was good documentation for building from source,  it seems to be spread out across 100&#39;s of posts all with different information.</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated </p>

<p>Note that only Ubuntu is officially supported. See <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.appcelerator.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;getting_started.html#installing_titanium">Installing Titanium</a>. I have no problems at all using Titanium on either Ubuntu 9.10 or 10.10.</p>
<p>There really should be no need to compile from source, unless you are patching one of the components or building a module.</p>
<p>You should use a network analyzer like <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wireshark.org&#x2F;">Wireshark</a> to see whether the request to the server is being made, and whether anything is preventing it from proceeding.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>Mint Linux is more or less Ubuntu,  it is a derivative of it with some extra Media and different theme etc. </p>
<p>I will look at the network and see</p>

										<p><p>And just to be clear,  the Application seems to work fine,  I can run the app, Build APK&#39;s,  Launch Emulators etc.  It just will not install any of the new SKD&#39;s,  right now I only have Ti SDK 1.2, it will not load 1.5</p>

										<p><p>does the directory that the SDKs are being installed to have the correct permissions?  Have you tried running Titanium Developer as root, just to install the SDKs?</p>
