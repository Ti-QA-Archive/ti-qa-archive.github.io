			<h1>Add a custom build music player in Titanium Mobile</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Currently building an app for a band and has run into a problem!<br>Is there any way to implement a custom music player and add it on top of all windows so that it will be available at all times?</p>
<p>I got the idea from some MobileRoadie-apps (Pink, TakeThat etc.) - they have even added a &quot;hide-player&quot;-function which allows the user to minimize the player with music still playing in the background!</p>
<p>If anyone know anything similar to what I&#39;ve described or have a solution to implementation problem I&#39;d be very glad to hear from you :)</p>
<p>&#x2F;Anders</p>

							<p>I have found a temporarily solution which is not the best, but either way it works okay.</p>
<p>Using <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;838012">this code</a> deleting contents and adding custom features I have been able to create a tableview with mp3-enclosures, so that &quot;it looks&quot; like a playlist.</p>
<p>For the controls I have created a label on which I have applied buttons to animate the label in and out of the screen - quite complicated when you&#39;re new to JavaScript and Titanium :)</p>
<p>To make the controls (the label on which they a applied) appear on top of all windows I have used the syntax: </p>
<p><code>tabGroup.add(your_item)</code></p>
<p>Please, if you have any further questions or need code examples - don&#39;t hesitate to ask!</p>
<p>&#x2F;Anders</p>

							<p>How do we get your code? I also want to include visible player controls in a popUp window for the Kitchensink RSS example you cited. Using your modified code will greatly help my situation. If you can&#39;t provide the code, please point me in the right direction to minimize my search for a solution. thx</p>

										<p><p>Hi Adebesi</p>
<p>Unfortunately I don&#39;t have that code anymore, but maybe I can give you some tips.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You need to create a XML-file with your selected attributes, which shall then be located on your server (or any other) - you then need to link this to the url in you script.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Media.AudioPlayer">Titanium.Media.AudioPlayer</a> as the back-end of your audio player and put a listener on your RSS-tableview - then initialize your audio player with <code>your_item.play();</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>Now you have your audio playing, but to control the audio you need to add an eventlistener for each control-instance of your player. These could be <code>your_item.pause();</code> or&#x2F;and <code>your_item.stop();</code> - whichever you prefer</p>
</li>
<li><p>Attach these listeners to your button-objects - which could be a play and stop.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Next you need to add your buttons to a view, which should be added to the tabGroup or your top window. Set the top-parameter (or bottom) as <code>top : - your_item.height</code> - that way it is possible to animate your view in and out of the screen.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope that was helpful, but please write if you have further questions.</p>
