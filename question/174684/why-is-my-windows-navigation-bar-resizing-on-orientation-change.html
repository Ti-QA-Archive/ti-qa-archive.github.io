			<h1>Why is my window&#39;s navigation bar resizing on orientation change?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a navigation window with a root window.  Everything looks fine when the app loads and works as expected.  But, I am running into an issue where the navbar height permanently shrinks when the orientation changes.  It seems that the navbar height decreases by about 15px.  As far as I know of, there isn&#39;t even a property to set the navbar height, so I&#39;m really not sure why this is happening.  Does anyone know what might be causing this? It is occurring on iOS 7.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I think you will find this is by design and has done this since iOS was launched.  This is something iOS does and not something that Titanium has any control over.</p>
<p>Start the &quot;Messages&quot; or &quot;Camera&quot; apps and rotate the device. you will experience the exact same behaviour with those apps and they were created by Apple.</p>
<p>The reason it shrinks is so there is as much content area left when the device height has reduced due to the landscape orientation.</p>
<p>If having seen those two apps you feel your example is still different - please provide a screen short of both orientations of your app with a clearly visible navigation bar.</p>

										<p><p>Good news you are right.  Bad news you are right.</p>
<p>The navigation bar height is adapting to the orientation as it should - however the bar is then getting stuck under the status bar information.</p>
<p>My two thoughts;</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a very basic test app that ONLY has the NavigationWindow and orientation - does this suffer the same problem?</li>
<li>It could be a bug - but without the test app you cannot confirm.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me know what happens.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m worried that it&#39;s a bug too.  I&#39;ll make a test app and post the results as soon as I have a chance.</p>
