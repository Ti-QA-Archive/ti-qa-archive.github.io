			<h1>Problems building enterprise app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I created a small app using my personal developer license for my place of work.  We are starting to use apps internal and we are hoping to use the app that I created.  I&#39;ve built it for enterprise distribution which created a ipa file and I&#39;ve also given him the xcode project.  However, when my coworker tries to build it on his work mac, he gets errors.  The current error is looking for the builder.py script.  Is there something that I need to do in order to get him the build files he needs for distribution?</p>

							<p>Personally, I would have him download&#x2F;install&#x2F;configure Titanium and let him build the project that way.</p>
<p>Also, keep in mind that you&#39;ll need to transfer the enterprise certificate &amp; private key (a common iOS dev issue)</p>

										<p><p>I would recommend setting up a deployment machine.  This way, you and who ever else can code locally, but when it&#39;s time to deploy, check the code out on the deployment machine, build, and, walaaaa…  I am currently using this method with 3 other developers.</p>

										<p><p>Can you be a little more specific?  You could consider my machine a development machine.  How would I check out code for him to build?</p>
