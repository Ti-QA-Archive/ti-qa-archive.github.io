			<p>What is the main difference? We are supposed to use Studio over Developer. I just downloaded Titanium Developer and it looks much prettier than Titanium Studio. Is Developer deprecated and should&#39;t be used?</p>

<p>Titanium Developer is simply a GUI for creating and building Titanium projects, whereas Studio is a full IDE, that includes code-assist&#x2F;autocompletion, debugging, code validation, git integration, wizards to help with deploying your apps, and many other features.</p>
<p>Although Developer is no longer supported or developed by Appcelerator, since we moved all our focus to Studio, since it is an open source project, it has been adopted by some of our community members. You can find out more about it at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;121270&#x2F;titanium-developer-130">Titanium Developer 1.3.0</a>.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

							<p>Appcelerator bought Aptana who are the company behind a lot of specific eclipse IDE&#39;s as a result Studio was released. It is basically Eclipse customised for Titanium development.</p>
<p>Developer as I am aware is not being pushed forwards and although will work and create applications with and should use all the latest SDK&#39;s the primary focus appears to be on Studio.</p>
<p>Developer does give you lots of options on what editors etc to use and my understanding is that it basically is a wrapper for the command line compilation. Which you can do from the command line anyway.</p>
<p>It is recommended to use Studio. but if you prefer developer or command line then you can use those.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>T.</p>

							<p>While Titanium Developer does in fact work, I have no clue on how well it works. There have been changes made to Studio to work around some issues and&#x2F;or other features added to it. I&#39;m not clear how the community version of Titanium Developer keeps up with that. As an example, I just worked with the Studio team to handle Desktop elements &quot;noinstall&quot; and &quot;release&quot; properly, so that the proper booleans are sent to the server upon packaging. It&#39;s not clear to me how the community tracks those changes and&#x2F;or if they even are aware of them.</p>
<p>I would see this as becoming more of an issue in the future, and both will most likely diverge even more.</p>
<p>As such, it&#39;s almost impossible for Appcelerator to support the community version of Developer, so use at your own risk. Not that it is broken, but it certainly has the potential to be, at any time.</p>
