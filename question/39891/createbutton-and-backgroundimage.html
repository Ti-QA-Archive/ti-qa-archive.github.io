			<h1>createButton and backgroundImage</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a tableview which I am using to display contact information. I have been trying to create a mail button but I have been unable to set a backgroundImage. I have been using the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var mailMe=Titanium.UI.createButton({
<span class="hljs-string">backgroundImage:</span><span class="hljs-string">'../img/mail.png'</span>,
<span class="hljs-string">right:</span><span class="hljs-number">5</span>,
<span class="hljs-string">top:</span><span class="hljs-number">12</span>,
<span class="hljs-string">height:</span><span class="hljs-number">32</span>,
<span class="hljs-string">width:</span><span class="hljs-number">32</span>
});
</code></pre><p>I have tried setting it from the createButton method, setting it from an event handler and changing the background, setting the backgroundImage, backgroundImageselected at creation, I tried moving the images to a different folder as explained <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;20881&#x2F;titaniumuicreatebutton--backgroundimage--cursing">here</a> but have been unable to get it to work. I even tried using image instead of backgroundImage and have been unable to get it to work. </p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated!</p>

							<p>I finally got it working.</p>
<p>My app.js opens a file in a folder called main-windows. However, as I went through the code to try to figure out what was wrong, I realized that in my code I was calling the<br> <code>url:&amp;#39;&amp;#x2F;main-windows&amp;#x2F;main.js&amp;#39;</code>,<br> however, when I changed it to<br><code>url:&amp;#39;main-windows&amp;#x2F;main.js&amp;#39;</code><br> it all started working properly.</p>
<p>Thank you Christian and Kevin for all your help! </p>
<p>So if you have this problem, make sure all your references are correct because although the main.js did open up, that is what prevented the backgroundImage from showing!</p>

							<p>i guess you&#39;re using the android platform, if so, those properties (like backgroundImage) are only available in the constructor of the object, which means you can&#39;t change them at runtime.</p>
<p>my solution to this problem was creating a button while using an imageview. if you wrap this inside a custom function, you may even be able to get off&#x2F;on state behaviour by using touch-event listeners</p>
<p>as it&#39;s true that there are quite some properties missing for the android implementation of ti-mobile, one often is able to code around them by using custom function or creating javascript classes that result in similar behaviours</p>

										<p><p>could you try to set the title-property to &#39;&#39;? i looked at my code a moment ago, and can&#39;t find any problem with yours. also try to put this properties into it. maybe the on&#x2F;off state properties are needed for custom button images</p>

										<p><p>It could be that button has a bug where backgroundImage isn&#39;t respected when inside a table view.  As Christian suggested, you might need to use an image view or a regular view with a background image to get the effect you&#39;re looking for.  Have you been able to produce a simple test case where we could see this behavior in action ourselves?</p>
