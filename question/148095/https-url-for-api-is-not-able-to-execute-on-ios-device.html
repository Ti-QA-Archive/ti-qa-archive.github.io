							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Obviously this is a difficult question as without knowledge of the service you are using and access to test it, anything offered will be guesses only.</p>
<p>So here go some guesses;</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you test any of the web services in a browsers, something simple so it returns back valid data?  If so - try to run that same test on the devices built-in browser (Safari in this case).</li>
<li>Is the service a public web service or private?<ul>
<li>If private; If it is working in the simulator but not on the device, then it may be network settings on your computers local connection that are not enabled on the device.</li>
<li>If public; Can you try on a different device?</li>
<li>If Public; Does your WiFi connection have different privileges to your LAN? </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Test against a different SSL connection, does this work?</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>Yes I know Malcolm it is difficult to give answer without service url but the issue is that to test that service at you r end you need VPN connection and that is difficult to share it here if you have any skype id so that i can share you details and you and see at your end.</p>
