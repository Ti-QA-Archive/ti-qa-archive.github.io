			<h1>Titanium.Network.HTTPClient Timing Out and Doesn&#39;t Recover?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m using the HTTPclient and it connects to my web service fine.  I can see the request come in and the response go out.  For several requests, the Titanium networking gets the response and it works fine.  Sometimes it times out.  After the first timeout, the networking never recovers.  I can see the request come in and then a response returned from the web service, but the device never picks it up as being returned after a timeout occurred.  If I make requests in a web browser like Chrome or Safari, the server responds repeatedly.</p>
<p>Note: This is all in the IOs simulator, not on an actual device.</p>

							<div><p>Have you done the .onerror function, and added a setTimeout(xxx) to your http client, to help add some error handling?</p>

							<div><p>Yes.  It says it timed out from that point.  Assuming I get a timeout, is there something I need to do to reset the network call?  I have my setTimeout(60000).  As far as handling, I&#39;m just outputting the error so I can see it in the debugger at the moment.</p>

							<div><p>No, and I can place a break in the web service and hold there pretty much infinitely it seems and then step through the rest of the way with the debugger and the web browser will handle putting the JSON on the screen.  In the web browser, you can see it just constantly sits waiting for the response (Chrome).</p>
<p>If anyone has a strong network HTTPClient example code I could review, I will certainly compare it to what I have.  I&#39;m not at my system at the moment, so I can&#39;t post my code fragment.  I will get that up as soon as I am back.</p>
