		<section>
			<p>Hello, I integrated AdMob (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;03&#x2F;tiplus-modules-starter-pack.html&#x2F;comment-page-1#comment-56920) into my app whit option testing:true 4 days ago. I made some tests.<br>Today I tried to access into my AdMob account and my account was suspended!<br>Why??? What is the testing option? I was totally sure that my ads was not counted as real ads whit this option, and now my account is suspended..<br>Any feed?<br>Thanks, Stefano.</p>

							<p>The same thing happened to me right after an iPhone updated app was released ! probably the sudden number of users updating my app made admob think I was doing something to generate more revenue !<br>Beside I use GCM and Push notification to bring users to my apps always (which are legal), which can be another cause for them to suspend that I use a software.<br>Just let me advice you of something, google always are happy when your revenue is as much low as possible, once you make an effort and work hard to your app customer base they just put the bad thoughts on their mind and suspend your account for any reason they have in their long list of terms and conditions that no one have much time to read.<br>JUST think about it, why do they not give you the real reason when they suspend your account? they don&#39;t want to tell you, why ? because either they are not sure or they just don&#39;t want to pay you when you do a hard work on your app.<br>P.S: my adsense account was not closed, but at the same time I didn&#39;t place any adsense ads yet! so it is separate issue as I&#39;m certain.</p>
