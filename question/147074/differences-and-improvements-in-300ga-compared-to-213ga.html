			<h1>Differences and improvements in 3.0.0GA compared to 2.1.3GA</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have gone through the release note, but I would like to know if anyone is aware of any additional improvements that have been done in 3.0.0GA compared to 2.1.3GA and earlier versions.</p>
<p>Or in a better way why should we upgrade to SDK 3.0.0</p>

										<p><p>But I would suggest that 3.0 is in beta , means its not yet released , appcelerator peoples are making it fine day by day, Once it is finally released by appcelerator then only you should start production in it, before this we can only go through the latest released , just have a practice it.</p>
<p>One major bug which we have faced is Cloud has bug , so dosen&#39;t work properly in 3.0 , so we have put on step back to 2.1.x sdk.</p>
<p>The major changes which I feel are in 3.0 are alloy and navigation group for android.</p>

							<p>The release notes are drawn from the JIRA bug fixes that have been applied to the release. If you want a deeper understanding of what the changes are you an review the commits for the JIRA. The QA and regression testing on the releases has improved hugely in the last 6 months so I would always say in the case of minor upgrades (version revision changes) just upgrade, but for a major release (like 3.0) then its usually prudent to wait a short while before doing so and monitor the Q&amp;A for any issues people report.</p>
