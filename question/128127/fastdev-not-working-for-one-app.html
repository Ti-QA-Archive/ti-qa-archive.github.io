			<h1>Fastdev not working for one app...</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>….all other apps work just fine….until I run the one app, then all other apps have issues too.</p>
<p>The error message I get is &quot;Warning: Fastdev mode disabled Error message 10.0.2.2:52014 - connection refused&quot;</p>
<p>As I said, if I start the emulator and make changes to my other 3 apps (e.g. edit app.js, etc.), those 3 work fine. If I run the 1 app that is having fastdev issues, the other 3 will begin to have fastdev issues as well. The fastdev issues go away for the 3 apps if I shut down the emulator and restart it.</p>
<p>Titanium Studio, build: 1.0.6.201110251616<br>The 1 app that causes everything to go kaput was tested using Android 2.2 and 2.3.3 google api&#39;s.</p>
<p>The other 3 apps are using 2.2 Google Api&#39;s.</p>
<p>I also tried Titanium SDK 1.7.1, 1.7.3, and 1.7.5.</p>
<p>This seemed to start happening after I updated from 1.7.1 to 1.7.3. I&#39;ve also searched the Q&amp;A forum for my issue. It doesn&#39;t seem that the problem is that fastdev isn&#39;t running, it just seems to lose connection to the emulator.</p>
<p>Any ideas? Any thoughts?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

							<div><p>Aaron - Prior to your comment, I had checked tiapp.xml and there wasn&#39;t any reference to fastdev, so I added the item and set it to true. That didn&#39;t have any impact. If its possible, I think the issue wasn&#39;t that fastdev wasn&#39;t starting, it just wasn&#39;t connecting, almost as if the port numbers got scrambled. The fastdev error message that included the port number didn&#39;t match the port number given in the console.</p>
<p>The good news is I fixed it, the bad news is I made the cardinal sin of troubleshooting by changing more than one thing at a time. Here is what I did do, albeit I did them all at the same time:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I noticed that my app id somehow was changed from its original name to originalname2 (the number 2 was added to it). So I changed that.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I also copied and pasted my original app.js to a temporary location, created a new project with the same name, and then copied my original app.js back over. My thinking here is studio would rebuild the whole thing with the proper linking, if you will.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I ran the android avd and ran whatever updates were available, then restart&#x2F;rebooted my OSX.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The last thing I have yet to figure out with this project (even after creating a new one as mentioned above) is why Project –&gt; Clean is grayed out.</p>
<p>Out of the 4 apps I have in Studio, this problem-child of a project is the only one grayed out.</p>
<p>Should I start I new thread? I tried searching for this issue and I haven&#39;t seen anything yet….</p>
