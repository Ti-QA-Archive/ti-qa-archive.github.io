			<h1>ACS bug - Web portal Deletes ACL when deleting a User that owns a Custom Object that has the ACL</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve Created a User &quot;aUser&quot;, which also Creates the user&#39;s Custom Object &quot;aObj&quot;, which has an ACL.</p>
<p>The ACL is Not Owned by &quot;aUser&quot;, but by another Admin user.</p>
<p>If I delete &quot;aUser&quot;, their Custom Objects logically gets deleted with them. All fine here. Though the issue is, the ACL deletes as well, though it is not owned by &quot;aUser&quot;, but by another Admin user.</p>
<p>The ACL is used by many other Custom Objects, and should not be deleted.</p>

							<p>Hi, I&#39;ve tried to reproduce the bug.</p>
<p>So I create user A and user B.</p>
<p>Created a ACL C of owner user B.</p>
<p>Create a custom object D with ACL C of owner user A.</p>
<p>Deleted user A.</p>
<p>Which on my side it deletes user A, custom object D and not ACL C.</p>
<p>But you were saying ACL C, also got deleted?</p>
<p>What was the property on ACL? Did you specified and reader or writer ids?</p>

										<p><p>Yes the ACL has all read&#x2F;all write.</p>
<p>The thing is many users&#39; custom objects have the same ACL, and once I start deleting these users, from the web portal the ACL gets deleted.</p>
