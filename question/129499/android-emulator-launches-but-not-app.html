							<p>Check to make sure the app is loading to the emulator.<br>Just because the emulator loaded, doesn&#39;t mean Titanium is communicating with it.<br>I find it&#39;s easier to use an actual device.</p>
<p>Pop open a command prompt (run &gt; cmd) and use &#39;adb devices&#39; to see if the emulator is being seen, recognized and is online.<br>If Titanium won&#39;t communicate with the emulator try shutting everything off, disabling any firewall software or antivirus you have running and then run the emulator.<br>Once the emulator has loaded, check with adb devices.</p>
<p>If the emulator is present, then load Titanium, and run the &#39;install to emulator&#39; option.<br>The funny thing about this process is that Titanium will start another emulator and NOT talk to it.  You can shut off the new emulator right away, and Titanium will still conduct transactions with the original emulator you started before you ran Titanium.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not the smoothest operation, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend using the emulator for more than academic purposes.  Meaning to check a callback or behaviour in particular circumstances.</p>
<p>The emulator will not force close the same way a device will, hence if you only test on the emulator, you may end up releasing a broken app all the same.</p>
<p>I hope that helped.</p>

										<p><p>Ahh, you must add the android&#x2F;android-sdk&#x2F;platform-tools path or navigate to that path to operate adb.exe<br>For example, on my computer, my SDK is located at c:\android\android-sdk and the platform-tools sub folder is where ADB is located.</p>
<p>There are instructions on the Android developers network regarding the proper configuration of your path but if you know where the path variable resides for your version of windows (and how to add one) just do that and you&#39;ll be able to access adb anywhere.</p>

							<p>Go to tiapp.xml under your project, click on configure to find out what Android SDK you are using. Make sure you use Google APIs.<del>~</del>~</p>

<pre><code class="hljs">Google APIs Android <span class="hljs-number">2.3</span><span class="hljs-number">.3</span>

							<p>@Jiale it says i am using SDK version: 1.7.5<br>Then when i click &quot;configure&quot; it has the path to my android sdk and shows the &quot;Default Android SDK&quot; as Android 4.0</p>
<p>Does that seem right?  thanks!</p>
