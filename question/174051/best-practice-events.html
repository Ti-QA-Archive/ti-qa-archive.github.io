							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Within reason have <strong>one</strong> to handle multiple events.</p>
<p>I say within reason as some people might take this to mean &quot;only have one for an entire window&quot; - this would be wrong.  Good examples of how to simplify event listeners;</p>
<ul>
<li>TableView; one event listener on the table NOT for each TableViewRow.  The same single TableView event listener can also listen out for button, label and other events on each TableViewRow.</li>
<li>A fake button bar; Android does not have a ButtonBar, so you would create a parent View and add the buttons to that, but you listener to the events from the parent View</li>
</ul>
<p>If you had two TableViews in the same window I would have two different event listeners - unlss the function of each table was so close the actual handler was basically the same.</p>
<p>The idea to reduce is manage events that are related to each other.</p>
<p>You should also ALWAYS create event listeners like this;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> tableHandler = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-comment">// do something</span>
};
tbl.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, tableHandler);
<span class="hljs-comment">// later one during a clean up routine (usually before the window is closed)</span>
tbl.removeEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, tableHandler);
</code></pre><p>This way the event can be removed as you have the reference to the handler.  Doing this means any memory or objects ties to this event handler can be freed up when you run the clean up function.</p>

										<p><p>+1 for event listener definition. Should do the same in case you use app wide event listeners.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you very much Malcolm. </p>
<p>So even if the listener is only serving as a switch to direct the event toward different functions and the listener holds little by way of logic it would be better to have, for sake of understanding lets say 20 listeners rather than have 2 with 10 switch cases?</p>

										<p><p>..or to be more realistic, since in the case of the fake button bar we are already switching multiple cases to a listener lets say 10 listeners, some with up to 5 switch cases vs. 2 with 20 switch cases.</p>

										<p><p>..given that all events are from similar sources like buttons rather than lumping buttons with tables.</p>
