			<h1>Bluetooth 4.0 Support</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello, all</p>
<p>Presently, both Android 4.3 and iOS have support for the Bluetooth 4.0 standard, but after digging for a while, I found that the only way to get BLE with Titanium is to purchase a $350 module. Are there plans to incorporate support of the Bluetooth 4.0 standard in Titanium?</p>

							<p>The answer from engineering is that , yes, its on the roadmap.  Until then, for ios support, there are a few folks working on modules.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jbeuckm">Joe Beuckman</a> has done some preliminary work.</p>

<p>Any ideas of an ETA? Not trying to be needy, just want to plan accordingly :-)</p>

										<p><p>I have an article queued for the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tidev.io">tidev.io</a> launch tomorrow afternoon with another going into the queue later this afternoon.  First is simple getting started, second is on proximity.  </p>
<p>Estimotes released their android sdk to github yesterday, so my shop is looking at what it would take to build out ios&#x2F;android modules at the same time for parity.</p>

										<p><p>This might seem a bit vague, but I have begun prototyping artifacts with arduino and I wanted to enable 2-way communication via BLE (shorter range to help conserve battery life). I am not familiar with the protocol per-se, but as I&#39;m getting started, I want to know it&#39;s available to me</p>
