			<h1>Problems Creating A New Ruble</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve followed the &quot;Creating a new Ruble Using the Wizard (New!)&quot; and &quot;Checking to ensure your Ruble loaded&quot; steps on the https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;tis&#x2F;Creating+a+new+Ruble page. I can see my Ruble is loaded, but the project and file templates don&#39;t appear in the appropriate menu options&#x2F;wizards (and I also can&#39;t find them through the filters).</p>
<p>This seemed like it should have been a straight-forward process. What am I missing?</p>

							<p>Hmm, tough to troubleshoot without seeing exactly what you did, but you can see exactly what I did to create one. Check out this episode of Forging Titanium where I walk through the process of creating a ruble template: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeopro.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;forging-titanium&#x2F;video&#x2F;33685267">Forging Titanium Episode 19: Titanium Studio 1.0.7</a></p>
<p>Fast forward to around 17:00 for the part you&#39;ll be interested in. If you can&#39;t get it working still, leave a comment here and we&#39;ll see if we can get you sorted out.</p>

										<p><p>The simple part I was missing was that the project template is a step that shows up <em>after</em> you select the project type of &quot;Titanium Mobile&quot;. I was loading up a default Ruble Template project like you were doing in the video and as stated in the wiki (with no modifications), but I was misunderstanding what the output was supposed to be.</p>
<p>Now on to seeing how far I can customize the template. Is it possible to extend the project setup wizard from the ruble to ask for options and modify the project output accordingly? For example, can we ask a creation for the number of tabs a tabbed project should have, or is that just something that would need multiple templates?</p>
