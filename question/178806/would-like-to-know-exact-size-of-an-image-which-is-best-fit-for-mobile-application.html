							<p>Hi Kusuma,</p>
<p>Your issue is logical here. It will depend on device memory.</p>
<p>If you are dealing with only one image that you are downloading from server side then normally 3-5 MB image does not create any problem but if you are dealing with multiple image then you have to care about that all images should download in sequential manner. And your memory wiped out for previous object also.</p>
<p>Can you tell me how much images you are downloading simultaneously?</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>When you get memory error ?</p>

										<p><p>I load multiple images every time. Say i have 4 pages in my application when the user login then he will be redirect to one of the page in which i&#39;ll load multiple images.if he does some operation in that page it will be redirect to respective pages and if come back to previous page or home page i&#39;ll again load images. Sometimes not enough memory or sometimes bitmap or the application crash or stop working</p>

										<p><p>Make sure you are loading one page at time and removing all content of previous page. Decrease amount of global variables.</p>
<p>It will reduce your problem.</p>
