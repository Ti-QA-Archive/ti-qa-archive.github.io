			<h1>Pricing?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>What is up with the pricing? Why is it so hard to find a pricing structure?<br>If you are developer and you are having to pay on  per app basis, passing that along to clients is going to be a must so it would be nice to see some pricing and not have to email sales which can take days to get back to you.</p>

							<p>Well, getting a price is a little crazy. Called and talked to someone and still could not get a price. I would have to of described the app, all the features and then they would tell me. Because I signed an NDA, I can&#39;t do that so their  current way of pricing stuff will not work me.</p>
<p>While this looks like a great product, the pricing is just way to flaky for me and price on a per app basis is ridiculous. None of the other products on the market price in that manner.</p>
