			<p>Thanks to some of the people on this forum, I am now able to create a android module with Ti and from the command line. However, I have searched all available documentation I could find and nothing tells me how to include the .jar file in the module and then the module in my project. According to the documentation, once a module is created, several folders are created as part of it. That&#39;s true, but the number of  folders that were created when I build the module is far fewer than that descrbed in the documentation. In particular, it refers to a &#39;dist&#39; folder with a zip file of the .jar and some other things. First of all, how did the jar file get in there and why is it zipped? Secondly, I don&#39;t have that folder along with several others. And I&#39;ve found nothing that mentions how to incorporate the module into my project. Any help would be appreciated.</p>
