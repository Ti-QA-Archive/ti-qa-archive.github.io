			<h1>What about platform related guidelines?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>am a new incomer in Titanium, but quite used to overall app developpment (all platforms).<br>Currently, after I was able to build some apps, and perform  deployment on serveral android devices (smartphone with 2.3 and tablet with 4.0.4), I am trying to convince some people (including me) that they should use Titanium.</p>
<p>Most of answers of the questions I had could be found quite easilly (although It was often not on official documentation). But there&#39;s one very question whose answer I couldn&#39;t found… about platform related guidelines. Android by example, has strong recommandations (for later release)  here (actionBar example in order to point out what I was expecting in KitchenSink) : http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;design&#x2F;patterns&#x2F;actionbar.html</p>
<p>My problem is that, using eg the KitchenSink demo, I saw no difference between a 4.0 version of my app and a 2.3 one… I thought Titanium used native UI widgets from each SDK to build the app… so was quite puzzled about this.<br>So, I am wondering whether this is the standard behavior (ie one unique design per OS, whatever the target is), or related to this very demo (KitchenSink)… In that last case, should I start from scratch to design a version-related app or may I use one of the provided template and … whatever I should do with it in order to reach my goal..</p>
<p>And in any case, is there some &quot;best practice&quot; or guideline that would help a developer stick to each platform&#39;s latest design &#x2F; guidelines?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for reading, and in advance for any suggestion &#x2F; answer.</p>

							<p>If you want to see 4.0 widgets, add this to tiapp.xml:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">&lt;uses-sdk <span class="hljs-string">android:</span>minSdkVersion=<span class="hljs-string">"7"</span> <span class="hljs-string">android:</span>targetSdkVersion=<span class="hljs-string">"14"</span>/&gt;
</code></pre><p>(inside the ti:app&#x2F;android&#x2F;manifest element)</p>
<p>Without this, you&#39;ll see older style widgets even on Android 4.</p>
<p>I tried this on Kitchen Sink with Android 4.1, and it does use the newer styles, but it&#39;s pretty clear that the Appcelerator folks haven&#39;t tested it with this setting, as there are a lot of text wrapping&#x2F;layout problems.</p>

							<p>Bear in mind that the Kitchen Sink demo is meant to show examples of functionality across all sdk versions.  In your example, the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;guide&#x2F;topics&#x2F;ui&#x2F;actionbar.html">action bar</a> that was only introduced into API 11. Its&#39; really up to you to consume new features where available and fallback when they are not. This assumes you are targetting the entire 2.-x&gt;4.x sdk ranges.</p>

							<p>Thanks for your answer, Nick.</p>
<p>If I understood well, I should be aware of each version of the OS in order to get the best user&#39;s experience, thus, knowing very well each SDK? Means that if I want to focus on users&#39; experience, I have to use (when available) platform related components (eg api&#x2F;Titanium.Android.*)  and provide alternatives for older versions when it is needed? </p>
<p>This answers most of my questions, then. I&#39;ll try to do some more POCs doing such… </p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

							<p>Jason,</p>
<p>excellent suggestion! That was the very feature that I missed.Thanks for it!<br>This is a very good point toward my using the API :) </p>
<p>This also confirms that you need knowledges on the platform-related SDKs and not only Titanium (I was not able to find this feature on appcelerator website)</p>
<p>Thanks again for all your suggestion and answers!</p>
