							<p>We do this by having a system which stores the messages on a cloud database and serves them up in the app.</p>
<p>We also handle the push notification, which if the app is closed opens the app and using specific links within the notification, we then handle navigation within the app. </p>
<p>However if the notification isn&#39;t selected then nothing will happen, and that is a user option, which is why we handle a messaging system on top of the push notifications, as the user can also switch off notifications for the app.</p>
<p>Hope this helps, but the solution is to code it.</p>
<p>T.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Trevor,</p>
<p>What Im trying to do is basically push a news article to the top of the table and show it in a different colour from the push notification that has been sent, do you have any suggestions on how I could achieve this or would I just have to show that that item has been marked for high priority as a in the db record?</p>

										<p><p>You would need to identify that record in the DB… All the push notification will do is send a message to the device which associates it to your app. Using the DB means that you can code to show that article however you wish.</p>
<p>Ideally you would only notify the user of a new article, and by using a link in the notification take them to that part of the app. But the main DB would do the work of display etc.</p>
<p>Thus if the user has notifications off, then they will still see the article as new.</p>
<p>Hope this helps </p>
<p>T.</p>

										<p><p>No worries.</p>
<p>And yes you cannot add to a closed app via a notification, unless the notification is selected which opens the app.</p>
