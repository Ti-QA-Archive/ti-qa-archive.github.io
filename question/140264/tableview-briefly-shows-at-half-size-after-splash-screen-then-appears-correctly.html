			<h1>TableView briefly shows at half size after splash screen, then appears correctly.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi there.<br>When my app shows on either iOS emulator or my iPhone 4S, the tableview which should be visible after the splash screen seems to momentarily show at half size at the top left hand side of the window with words on the left hand side cut off, but a right side scroll bar is visible. After less than a second the screen comes right. It appears to be only half the screen width and height, but then comes right.</p>
<p>Seems strange and I was wonder if anyone else has had this issue?</p>
<p>Many Thanks.</p>

<p> I&#39;ve seen this occur with what should be views that are to fill their container on two different projects.  I haven&#39;t had the time to write a ticket with test case yet.<br>In our case, multiple views, in a single parent container, that are switched visible: true&#x2F;false to &#39;page&#39; through them.</p>

							<p>You need to provide the code you used to create the table and any parent views before any reasonable help can be provided.</p>
<p>Try setting the width and heights to Ti.UI.FILL or removing both as two tests to see if anything changes.  If the table is a child of another view - check that views width and height as well.</p>
