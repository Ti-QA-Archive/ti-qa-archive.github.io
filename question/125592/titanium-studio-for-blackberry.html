			<h1>Titanium Studio for BlackBerry</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi Team</p>
<p>I need create my first application with Titanium Studio for BlackBerry. I downloaded the all environment and install the Titanium Studio.</p>
<p>When i created the first app the titanium studio say:&quot;Could not auto-detect the installation location for BlackBerry Plugin….&quot;</p>
<p>I investigated in Q&amp;A forum and any post suggest the buy the Indie or Professional Account type with Titanium.</p>
<p>I need know if exist the option for install the Titanium Studio for BlackBerry without buy the indie or professional account, or exist the trail version.</p>
<p>My initial purpose is define the feasibility of develop blackberry app with Ti Studio.</p>
<p>Please, let me know</p>
<p>Thanks<br>Have a nice day!!<br>Jorge Luis</p>

							<p>Since the Blackberry SDK is still in beta, it is only available to those with &quot;early access&quot; status.  In other words, those with a paid subscription level.  Once officially released, it will be available free to the community.</p>
<p>There is a 30-day trial available for the various subscription plans, last I knew.  So AFAIK you could sign up for one of those then try out the Blackberry early access beta.</p>

										<p><p>It is available to paid subscribers.  However, realize it is still considered to be in beta status.  Generally speaking, I personally don&#39;t recommend using something in beta to produce something more than a prototype for a client.</p>
<p>But that is me, and a generalization.  I have not tried the Blackberry beta, so I can&#39;t speak to its feature set and stability.  And maybe by the time you develop the app and need to go &quot;final&quot; on the client, the SDK will be out of beta status.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t address when the Blackberry SDK will be out of beta.  I am just a user, and one who is not following the Blackberry status.</p>
