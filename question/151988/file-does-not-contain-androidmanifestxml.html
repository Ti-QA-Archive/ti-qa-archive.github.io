		<section>
			<p>What would cause this issue?  The app runs about 1&#x2F;2 the time (at best) when trying to debug Android, but it&#39;s suddenly stopped working completely with this error.</p>
<p>[ERROR] file &#39;&#x2F;Users&#x2F;Greg&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;Sparkd&#x2F;build&#x2F;android&#x2F;bin&#x2F;app.apk&#39; does not contain AndroidManifest.xml</p>
<p>I have NOT modified the tiapp.xml file, and git shows no changes to it.  I&#39;ve tried to clean the project as well, no joy.</p>

							<div><p>Latest version of Titanium&#x2F;Alloy SDK, happens in both the device and the emulator.  No, there&#39;s no example code.  It sometimes happens, and sometimes doesn&#39;t, with the same code.  I can literally run it, fail, run it, fail, run it work.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been working with Android for a long time and recognize that it&#39;s a &quot;challenging&quot; environment, but it&#39;s clear that the integration with the SDK and Android is very touchy.  What kinds of situations can cause that error to occur?  Perhaps there&#39;s something in my process that I can avoid.  As I said, a &quot;clean&quot; does not resolve the issue, but <em>something</em> in the build process sometimes does.</p>

							<div><p>I get this VERY frequently – much more often with Ti Studio 3.1 than with previous versions.</p>
<p>I also don&#39;t have the option to &quot;clean&quot; – that menu item is permanently grayed out.  I have to manually delete the build directory.</p>
