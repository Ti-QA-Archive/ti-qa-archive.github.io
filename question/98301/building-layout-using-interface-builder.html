			<h1>Building layout using Interface Builder</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am a visual guy, so I need to be able to layout my labels and textfields using a WYSIWYG editor.</p>
<p>What I&#39;ve been doing so far is using Interface Builder for layout to get the x&#x2F;y values.  It works fairly well, although I&#39;ve noticed that where IB says x&#x2F;y should be, it appears slightly off after Titanium compiles.</p>
<p>That got me thinking if it was possible to build the layout in IB and then somehow, export the XIB into a JS file.</p>
<p>Anyone see a possibility in this or perhaps it has (fingers crossed) already been done??</p>

							<p>Great idea…. What would be neat too, is to also integrate with the Droid Draw as well, so then you could have a include for iPhone and and include for Android, it would definitely help with the write once suck everywhere issue.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m working on a xib file parser &#x2F; renderer in coffeescript ( which compiles to regular javascript, running titanium )</p>
<p>I actually got as far as implementing UILabel, UIView, UIButton, UIImageView, UIScrollview, with support nested subviews, background colors, font size, font family, font color, top,left,width,height etc</p>
<p>you just pass it a regular xib file path and it renders and attaches all the views, and even gives you reference to them using their UI builder labels ( some magic using the xib objectID was required for this)</p>
<p>this only took a few hours.</p>
<p>I feel like UIBuilder is the big missing piece to the tititanium development environment. i am sure with their purchase of aptana studio, they are building something similar.</p>
<p>anyone interested?</p>
