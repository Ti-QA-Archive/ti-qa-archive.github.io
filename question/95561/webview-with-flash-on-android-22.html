			<h1>WebView with Flash on Android 2.2?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello, I am using Titanium 1.2.2 with SDK 1.5.1 targeting Android 2.2.  Compiles great and runs live on my phone (HTC Desire Z).</p>
<p>I am using a WebView to view local html content using the following code:</p>
<p>var window = Titanium.UI.createWindow();<br>var www = Titanium.UI.createWebView({url:&#39;index.html&#39;});<br>window.add(www);<br>www.show();<br>window.open({fullscreen:true,navBarHidden:true});</p>
<p>The above works great for html but any Flash files embedded within do not get rendered, even though Flash is included with Android 2.2.  </p>
<p>Is the WebView using an older version of the WebKit browser than the one that came with my phone?  </p>
<p>Or have I done something wrong in the html and Flash does indeed work?</p>
<p>Any hints?  Any way to &quot;turn on&quot; plugins?  </p>
<p>I am most grateful for any help.  Thank you!</p>
<p>P.S.  Happy New Year 2011!  =D</p>

							<p>I don&#39;t mean to necro, but you can definitely run Flash in a WebView for Android. By default, Titanium turns off plugins, but you can enable it by setting <code>pluginState</code> like so:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> view</span> = Ti.UI.createWebView({
    url: <span class="hljs-string">"http://www.adobe.com/flash"</span>,
    backgroundColor: <span class="hljs-string">"transparent"</span>,
    pluginState: Ti.UI.Android.WEBVIEW_PLUGINS_ON
});
</code></pre>

							<p>I guess there is no solution in titanium. I think they could, but they don&#39;t want to support flash. Finally we gave up and wrote our solution in native Code (Java).</p>

										<p><p>Hi B.Zech </p>
<p>Please make sure that Adobe Flash have stopped the further development of flash player for mobile. They are not going to continue with that. Sooner or later all mobile will also stopped the support for that.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

										<p><p>Yes, you are right. You know we made our development 10 months ago. Today you have to use html5, even it is still in its infancy and has currently not one tenth of the power flash has …</p>

										<p><p>Yes B Zech </p>
<p>I believe that all should start working on Html5 before its too late.. Atleast one resource out of 10 should know html5 in any company. Html5 is not only in mobile but also on the web so  its now the most important requirement for all.</p>
