			<h1>Unable to select provisioning profile when building to iOS device</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am working on an app in Titanium Studio 2.1.1.201207271312, with Titanium SDK 2.1.4 GA. I have previously been able to select  <strong>Run &gt; iOS Device</strong> without issue. I recently updated to Titanium Studio 3 and Titanium SDK 3 and since then I have had problems with the Run on iOS device not letting me choose a provisioning profile. I uninstalled Titanium Studio 3 and the Titanium CLI, then re-installed Titanium Studio 2.1.1. When I re-opened the project Titanium Studio 2 let me build to an iOS device… once. Now when I select <strong>Run &gt; iOS Device</strong> I get <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;WldnQ.png">this dialog</a>, and there are no options for selecting a provisioning profile.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;lJ0js.png">Xcode still lists my profile as valid</a>. If I try to click on <strong>Manage Settings</strong> in the dialog in the link above, I get <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;NVKV0.png">this dialog</a>. I clicked browse, selected my certificate and hit add but nothing showed up on the list.</p>
<p>Also I tried deleting my project and creating a new one with the same name. When I followed the wizard for setting up a new iOS device I got to the point of adding a provisioning certificate, but when I select my certificate I get an error <strong>&#39;Provisioning profile is invalid or is the wrong type&#39;*</strong>.</p>

							<div><p>Ashok, I&#39;m having the same exact issue, as are others. I asked a similar question here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;145790&#x2F;cannot-run-as-simulator-or-build-to-device-after-updating-to-ti-studio-and-sdk-30</p>
<p>It must be a bug in Titanium Studio 3.0 since so many people are reporting the same issue. Hopefully someone from Appcelerator can investigate this and give us an official answer.</p>

							<div><p>Hi Slim, hopefully the extra detail and debug traces you posted are of some use to the Titanium team so they can get this resolved quickly. In regards to your post, I&#39;ve never had any &lt;ios&gt;&lt;plist&gt; sections in my tiapp.xml and haven&#39;t used a custom Info.plist. There must be something else going on.</p>
<p>What really frustrates me is that reverting back to previous versions of Titanium Studio and Titanium SDK doesn&#39;t seem to help at all!</p>

							<p>These issues should be addressed in Studio 3.0.1. You must have the correct versions of the SDK and CLI installed as well. If you are seeing these issues, please make sure you have the following installed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Studio 3.0.1.  </li>
<li>Titanium CLI 3.0.21 (titanium -v)</li>
<li>SDK 3.0.0.GA</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are still experiencing issues, check whether the CLI can see your provisioning profiles:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-title">titanium</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">info</span> -t ios
</code></pre><p>This should list your distribution certificates. If you do &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;not&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; see any listed by the CLI, chances are you are running into a known issue with the CLI that causes it to fail when there are a large number of keys in the keychain. To check for this issue, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">security <span class="hljs-built_in">dump</span>-keychain | wc -<span class="hljs-built_in">c</span>
</code></pre><p>This returns the size of the keychain output in bytes. If the size exceeds 1M, you&#39;re seeing a known CLI bug which will be addressed in the near future.</p>
<p>If the CLI does list certificates, try building from the command line. This indicates a problem between Studio and the CLI. If this is the case, please open a JIRA ticket so we can investigate ASAP.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m on version Titanium Studio, build: 3.0.2.201302191606 and every time I add a provisioning profile under settings, it adds it, and I click &#39;okay&#39;, and then it doesn&#39;t show up in the distribution wizard. When I click the settings again, it isn&#39;t there. It won&#39;t save it. What do?</p>

										<p><p>Using Titanium Studio 3.1.1.201306112235 (sdk 3.1.1.GA), seems I am having the exact same issue where the provision profile is not getting added to the project.</p>
<p>Clicking on green arrow (run) &quot;iOS Device&quot; brings up the &quot;Run on iOS Device&quot; dialog where all items are checked green except the &quot;Select Provisioning Profile&quot;.</p>
<p>Clicking &quot;Manage Settings&quot;, I try to manually browse to and select one of our .mobileprovision files. This first asks to open up xCode, which I have tried to both accept and decline, and then seemingly adds the provisioning profile to the currently empty list. However upon hitting either &quot;Apply&quot; and&#x2F;or &quot;OK&quot;, and being taken back to the &quot;Run on iOS Device&quot; dialog, it is still not added to the drop down and the red X remains. Upon going back to &quot;Manage settings&quot; the Provisioning Profile list is once again empty. </p>
<p>Also to note, while in the &quot;Manage settings&quot; dialog and after trying to add the provisioning profile, hitting the &quot;Refresh&quot; button (above the &quot;Browse…&quot; button) causes the just added Provisioning Profile to get cleared out.</p>
<p>Sorry if I am missing something obvious, any and all help would be super appreciated… though if possible, avoiding any solutions that require me to fully uninstall&#x2F;reinstall Titanium would be highly preferred, as every time I have to uninstall&#x2F;reinstall and even update&#x2F;upgrade causes around 1-2 days of other &quot;issues&quot; for me to resolve.</p>

							<p>Hi Ashok and Slim,</p>
<p>We are actively investigating the cause of this issue, and there is currently a ticket open against it in https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC-1616. We have not been able to reproduce the behavior locally, so would very much appreciate your help in tracking down the root problem. The last comment in ticket TC-1616 has steps to provide us more logging information on what is going on. I will copy them here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Update Studio to the beta stream using the update site http:&#x2F;&#x2F;preview.appcelerator.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;studio&#x2F;standalone&#x2F;update&#x2F;beta&#x2F;;</li>
<li>After Studio restarts, clear the log via Help &gt; Titanium Studio &gt; Clear Log File;</li>
<li>Open the Preferences &gt; Titanium Studio &gt; Troubleshooting page, set the Debug Level to all, and make the &quot;com.appcelerator.titanium.mobile&#x2F;debug&#x2F;provisioning&quot; and &quot;com.aptana.core&#x2F;debug&#x2F;shell&quot; entries checked;</li>
<li>Restart Studio, and open the Preferences &gt; Titanium Studio &gt; Titanium &gt; iOS Platform page;</li>
<li>Click &quot;Refresh&quot; button in the &quot;Provisioning Profiles&quot; section and close the page;</li>
<li>Attach the log content from Help &gt; Titanium Studio &gt; View Log File to the JIRA ticket.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks very much.</p>

<li>os: osx mavericks</li>

<p>I don&#39;t know why ticket <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC-1616">TC-1616</a> is closed because this issue remains in 3.1.3.GA. I&#39;ve tried all the steps posted here and in the ticket. I&#39;ve restarted both Studio and Xcode. Xcode shows that I have 4 profiles – all valid. Studio shows that I have 7 profiles which include the profile I want to use. However, the correct profile is not avaiable for the Select Provisioning Profile option. If I missed something, let me know. Meanwhile, guess I&#39;ll log it as a new bug.</p>
<p>Before you ask, I cannot upgrade to 3.2, yet, until I finish with my current project.</p>

							<p>We have a potential fix available in the 3.0.1 beta stream. Can the folks who have issues with provisioning try out that version and report back logging information? The update site for the 3.0.1 stream is: For 3.0.1, the update site is http:&#x2F;&#x2F;preview.appcelerator.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;studio&#x2F;standalone&#x2F;update&#x2F;beta&#x2F;</p>

										<p><p>This still is not working for me. I updated Titanium Studio to 3.0.1 via the beta stream and also installed pyOpenSSL and pyCrypto but it didn&#39;t fix the provisioning profile issue. I&#39;m posting my log to the Jira ticket.</p>

										<p><p>@Andrew We released a blog post about 3.0.1, indicating this issue is documented as a requirement for some environments. See http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2012&#x2F;12&#x2F;titanium-studio-3-0-1.html</p>

							<p>I am running Titanium Studio, build: 3.1.0.201304151600 and have been going through how to test on an ios device on the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Deploying_to_iOS_devices">titanium website</a> and I am stuck on the final step. I can not see in the run menu a place to select iOS as you can see for this capture <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sharktank.ca&#x2F;images&#x2F;capture&#x2F;ScreenShot.png">capture</a> is there another way to specify the device?</p>

							<p>I have two apps with the same app id: one is made with alloy and the other with normal titanium (they&#39;re the same app). The one with normal titanium I can install on my device and it automatically detected the certs and provisioning profile etc. But the app with alloy even says I have to install a new iTunes and log in the apple developer program etc. and won&#39;t let me choose the certificates or provisioning profiles either.</p>
<p>What should I do? I can&#39;t get another certs from the webpage cause it&#39;s the same app, just made in two different ways.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
