			<h1>When using IOS device, get error &#34;Could not find the file app.js&#34;</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all, I have an app for Android, IOS that I&#39;m developing. I have the latest titanium studio and the latest xcode. My app works fine in the simulators but when I try and install it on the device I get the error (I obviously have this file).</p>
<p> &gt; Could not find the file app.js</p>
<p>The strange thing is that I can debug on the device and it works just fine, so this only happens for this one scenario. While I have the latest xcode (with the 6.1 sdk) this was happening before as well.</p>
<p>Any help or advise on how to resolve this?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>This is a problem with the 3.0.0, it has been fixed in the 3.0.1 branch.</p>
<p>The reason you are getting this is because there is an error in your code that is stopping the minification process on your code.  On previous and upcoming versions of the SDK if the minify process failed it used the non-minified version (as far as I know) however there was a problem with 3.0.0.</p>
<p>I would suggest you run through your code and look for any errors, for example trailing commas in property object for view and window creates.  This is a common issue and one that will trip up most minify engines.</p>
<p>That is the best plan.  The quicker but lazier :-) method is to update to the latest version.</p>

										<p><p>Oh wow, thanks much.</p>
<p>I guess my only other question is whether you can see any logs anywhere that might point me at least to the right file for where it&#39;s getting tripped up. Otherwise it kind of feels like a needle in a haystack (I guess I&#39;ll just have to start commenting out large chunks of code).</p>

										<p><p>Unfortunately that is the situation, you do need to start working through your code.</p>
<p>However this is a very good and worthwhile endeavour as you are still looking for bugs.</p>
<p>Some suggestions;</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with your own <strong>app.js</strong></li>
<li>Follow the files in the general order in which you imagine them being accessed</li>
<li>Common things to look for;<ul>
<li>Trailing commas in create properties MUST be removed</li>
<li>Missing commas in the same</li>
<li>Not using { and } when using if&#x2F;else if&#x2F;else, whilst not strictly needed, can easily get confused when shrinking (and IMHO a bad code structure)</li>
<li>Missing semi-colons</li>
<li>Use of = when you should have used == or === as a comparison</li>
<li>Same for !=, !==</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jslint.com&#x2F;">jslint.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>jslint</strong> will be your friend, but will feel like an enemy to start, some tips on making it a bit easier</p>
<ul>
<li>Add the following to the big white box (globals) at the bottom, three words with spaces); <strong>Ti Titanium alert</strong></li>
<li>missing &#39;use strict&#39; pragma = true</li>
<li>many var statements per function = true</li>
<li>messy white space = true</li>
<li>Safe Subset = true</li>
<li>Verify ADsafe = false</li>
</ul>
<p>Then paste your code into the big white box at the top and run the test, do one file at a time.  Be aware you may need to add some extras to the globals box.  Look for things like error, ignore things like indentation, join vars etc</p>
<p>Have fun.</p>

										<p><p>Just FYI, it was a comma after the last property of an object literal. </p>
<p>Too bad Eclipse doesn&#39;t spot this common mistake, a lot of others (netbeans, webstorm, etc) do.</p>

										<p><p>FWIW, the 3.0.0.GA will report the error in a massive stack dump in the middle of the build output, but you need to set the –log-level to trace and ignore the fact that it says it built successfully.</p>
<p>The good news is this is all fixed in the upcoming 3.0.2 release!</p>
