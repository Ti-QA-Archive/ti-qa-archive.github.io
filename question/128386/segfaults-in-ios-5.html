			<h1>Segfaults in iOS 5</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Our app works fine on iOS 4 devices, but segfaults like crazy on iOS 5 devices.  I don&#39;t think these are application errors, but some sort of issue with Titanium&#39;s memory management.  </p>
<p>On a hunch, I went through the source code of the XCode project generated by Appcelerator and replaced every single &quot;release&quot; with a &quot;retain&quot; and deleted a few which this wouldn&#39;t work for.  This fixed all of the crashes I had been getting, meaning some sort of Titanium&#x2F;iOS 5 conflict is leading to free&#39;s which shouldn&#39;t be happening, but obviously this isn&#39;t something I&#39;m going to use as a production fix (and the hackish nature of the experiment led to a couple of different issues).</p>
<p>Has anyone encountered anything similar, and are there any general things to look for to fix my app?  I even tried copy&#x2F;pasting all of my JS into a single file after reading something about multiple js instances causing an issue but that made no difference.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Dan</p>

							<div><p>I don&#39;t know if I am having similar issues, but … I have noticed the memory management in Titanium1.7.5&#x2F;iOS5 combination isn&#39;t as plush as it used to be, I feel. I recommend using the XCode Instruments for your memory debugging.  Have you tried this?</p>

							<div><p>After the session at CodeStrong on memory management, I&#39;ve become a bit aggressive in killing off my unused objects.</p>
<p>Paul&#39;s recommendation of using Instruments to hunt for your mem leaks is spot on.</p>
<p>Take a look at Blalock&#39;s CODESTRONG video, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeopro.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;codestrong-2011&#x2F;video&#x2F;29804284">Your Apps are Leaking</a></p>
