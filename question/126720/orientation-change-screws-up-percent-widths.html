			<h1>Orientation change screws up percent widths</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve got a tabGroup, and inside the windows, I have buttons with a width of 90%. On Android at least (emulator and device), when you change the screen orientation, everything rotates appropriately, but the button widths are still 90% of the portrait width, rather then the landscape width.</p>
<p>If you then switch to another tab, and come back to the tab you were on, the buttons have redrawn correctly. Now, if you rotate back to portrait, you have the same problem in reverse. The buttons are much too wide, but, again, if you switch back and forth between tabs, everything redraws correctly.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried to force a redraw on orientation change by setting up an event listener, and then programatically switching to a new tab and then switching back to the current tab, but it didn&#39;t force a redraw of the elements. I also tried adjusting the button width to a different percentage, and then back, but that didn&#39;t work either. Anyone have a workaround for this?</p>

							<p>You can lock orientation. :D</p>
<p>I think JIRA ticket for this exists for iOS (try to find it and watch it to support it), Android had similar issue, I&#39;m not sure was that fixed since I locked orientation. :)</p>
<p>Anyway, one workaround that could work is to remove all elements from window and add them again. It seems to me that the problem is that window does not re-render correctly and does not recalculate percentage-based dimensions. I haven&#39;t try this approach yet, but I think it could work.</p>

							<p>Here&#39;s what I finally landed on to force the system to redraw all views in the application. This does assume that you have a tabGroup open. I tried doing it with currentWindow, but it crashed.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> waiting = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> tabs = Titanium.UI.createTabGroup();

Ti.Gesture.addEventListener(
    <span class="hljs-string">'orientationchange'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span></span>{<span class="hljs-comment">// force asset redraw to corrrect % widths in all windows</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(waiting){<span class="hljs-comment">// check to see if we're already waiting on a timeout</span>
            clearTimeout(waiting);
        }
        tabs.visible = <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>;
        waiting = setTimeout(redraw,<span class="hljs-number">250</span>);<span class="hljs-comment">// your milage may vary, but this was as low as I could go and still have it work every time</span>
    }
);

<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">redraw</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span>{
        tabs.visible = <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>;
        clearTimeout(waiting);
}
