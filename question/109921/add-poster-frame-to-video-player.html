			<h1>Add Poster Frame to Video Player?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>I was just wondering does anyone know if you can add a poster frame to the Titanium.Media.VideoPlayer? Currently when the video is loaded and it hasn&#39;t been played yet it appears black. I would like to have a still frame or image there instead.</p>
<p>I know I could just overlay another imageView on top of the video player and listen for a click event to play the video but wanted to see if there was something built in before I went down that route.</p>
<p>I&#39;m building an iPad app using Titanium 1.5.1 on iOS SDK 4.2.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Pat</p>

							<p>I would do this (and have done) by using an imageView of the thumbnail (possibly with a play button imageView centered on top of it) as you said.</p>
<p>Then add an eventListener to the play button so that when it&#39;s clicked I then create the videoPlayer over&#x2F;in place of the thumbnail&#x2F;poster image and button (hiding them too)</p>
<p>Once the video is played, you can then remove it and display the image&#x2F;button again.</p>
<p>A simpler way might be (depending on how you want your app to work) is to use a webView and the HTML5 video tag, which will let you set the poster image as you would in a browser. But then you wouldn&#39;t have as much control over the playback&#x2F;state of the movie wrt the app (withouth some extra JS shenanigans ;) ) </p>

										<p><p>Cheers, that&#39;s what I thought. Just wanted to be sure. I&#39;ll be going with your first suggestion as I&#39;d rather take advantage of the native player than mess about with webviews.</p>
