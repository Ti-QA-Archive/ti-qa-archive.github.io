			<h1>Give the user the ability to choose language</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve got some questions concerning changing the language of my app. Is short, the app I&#39;m building is a city guide specifically made for (foreign)students who are studying in Antwerp in Belgium.The user should be able to choose what language they want the app to be in, either dutch of english, when the app fires up. I don&#39;t want the language of the app be dependable on location or what language the phone is set to. For instance, Belgium has both dutch speaking as well as french speaking residence. Both live in Belgium and both use the Belgian app store, yet, a dutch person might prefer to have the app in dutch, while a french speaking person might prefer to have the app in English, or vice versa. Some dutch people might have their phone language set to english, but might like to have the app in dutch. Hence why I want the language select to be something the user can choose himself&#x2F;herself.<br>In addition, I would like the phone to save the language the person picked. For instance, when the user choses the app to be in dutch, it should still be in dutch the next time this person fires up the app.</p>
<p>I was thinking about having a popup message appear right after the Splash screen has disappeared, before the app.js is loaded. If, for instance, a person chooses the app to be in dutch, only the dutch content is fetched from the database.</p>
<p>Is this something that would be possible at all? If so, could someone point me in the right direction?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>This can be relatively easy with a little planning.</p>
<p>What you could do is create a series of language files where each one serves a single language and uses a key&#x2F;value pair arrangement.</p>
<p>You could use JSON as the basis for this (more on why in a bit) and save each data set as a single file, <strong>en.js</strong>, <strong>be.js</strong>, <strong>de.js</strong> and so on.</p>
<p>The structure could be as simple as;</p>
<p><strong>fr.js</strong></p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[
    { <span class="hljs-string">original:</span> <span class="hljs-string">'hello'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">translated:</span> <span class="hljs-string">'bonjour'</span> },
    { <span class="hljs-string">original:</span> <span class="hljs-string">'goodbye'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">translated:</span> <span class="hljs-string">'au revoir'</span> },
    ...
]
</code></pre><p>Fill this as required then create a CommonJS app where you pass in the language choice, which loads the file ready for the call to obtain the translation.  </p>
<p>This example is simple and lacks any simple method other than looping to find matched words.  SO you can tweak it as follows;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-rules">{
    <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">hello</span>:<span class="hljs-value"> <span class="hljs-string">'bonjour'</span>,
    goodbye: <span class="hljs-string">'au revoir'</span>,
    ...
</span></span></span>}
</code></pre><p>Now you can easily access the words by simply calling the retrieve data and accessing use <strong>json.hello</strong>, you can manage this as you see fit.</p>
<p>Given your use of the language files within your app you may want to go further and group common elements, this would make managing section easier and allow for conflicts such as in Japanese where numbers have different words depending on what is being counted;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-rules">{
    <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">greetings</span>:<span class="hljs-value"> {
        hello: <span class="hljs-string">'bonjour'</span>,
        goodbye: <span class="hljs-string">'au revoir'</span>,
        ...
    </span></span></span>},
    <span class="hljs-tag">numbers</span>: <span class="hljs-rules">{
        <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">items</span>:<span class="hljs-value"> {
            one: <span class="hljs-string">'un'</span>,
            two: <span class="hljs-string">'deux'</span>,
            ...
        </span></span></span>}
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Then you could access this as <strong>json.greetings.hello</strong> and <strong>json.numbers.items.one</strong>.  BTW this assumes you hold the language data in an object called json - you call it what you want.</p>
<p>At the start of the app use whatever interface elements best suits the number of languages you are going to provide, save this as a property and pass it into the CommonJS file ready for use.</p>
<p>The other benefit of this method is that you can then allow &quot;in app purchases&quot; (IaP) to provide more languages after the app goes live as you simply download the file after successful payment and the user has more value within the app.</p>
<p>This is one of many ways to solve your problem - but possibly a simple, quick and easy to implement one.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Malcolm, thank you for answering my question. Sorry for my late reply.<br>I could be wrong, but I think your method won&#39;t fully solve my problem.</p>
<p>In short, the app I&#39;m building is to inform people about all the great locations people can visit in the city of Antwerp in Belgium. In my sqlite database file I have a table called <strong>places</strong> containing all the locations people can visit. There are close to 400 locations inside my database file. These are some of the columns I&#39;ve got inside the <strong>places</strong> table.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>id</strong></li>
<li><strong>name</strong> (name of the location)</li>
<li><strong>address</strong> (location&#39;s address)</li>
<li><strong>descriptionNL</strong> (description in dutch)</li>
<li><strong>descriptionEN</strong> (description in english)</li>
</ul>
<p>What I want is, when the user chooses the app to be in dutch, the app should only fetch the content inside the <strong>descriptionNL</strong> column. Same goes for when choosing the app to be in English. It should only fetch content from <strong>descriptionEN</strong> column.</p>
<p>Additionally, I need to find a way to provide the user with a language select option before everything in my app.js file is loaded (it&#39;s a tabbed navigation app).</p>
