		<section>
			<p>Hello, I have been building apps with PhoneGap&#x2F;Xcode for a while and I am interested in switching to Titanium Studio.  I am trying to test the development workflow by simply running an app on my test device (iPhone 5 iOS 7), using the &quot;HTML-based Application&quot; template from the TI Dashboard &quot;Develop&quot; tab.</p>
<p>No matter what I do, I keep getting the following errors when I try to run on my iPhone:</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-error-error-details-code-sign-error-no-codesigning-identities-found-no-codesigning-identities-i-e-certificate-and-private-key-pairs-that-match-the-provisioning-profile-specified-in-your-build-settings-homeoffice-profile-were-found-">[ERROR] :  Error details: Code Sign error: No codesigning identities found: No codesigning identities (i.e. certificate and private key pairs) that match the provisioning profile specified in your build settings (“HomeOffice Profile”) were found.</h2>
<hr>
<h2 id="-error-error-details-codesign-error-code-signing-is-required-for-product-type-39-application-39-in-sdk-39-ios-7-0-39-">[ERROR] :  Error details: CodeSign error: code signing is required for product type &#39;Application&#39; in SDK &#39;iOS 7.0&#39;</h2>
<p>This makes no sense to me.  My profiles and certificates are valid, and I can switch over to Xcode from Titanium and run an app using the same cert&#x2F;profile&#x2F;device.  I have tried various combinations of the following several times</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove cert&#x2F;profile from my keychain</li>
<li>Restart computer</li>
<li>Reinstall cert&#x2F;profile</li>
</ul>
<p>Any time I do this, Xcode can successfully build apps, but never Titanium Studio.  From Titanium Studio, I can only run apps in the iPhone&#x2F;iPad simulator, but this is useless to me since the first app I will be building has a lot of real-world GPS scenarios and I want to test outside of the simulator environment.</p>
<p>Here is the other info from the requested list for support tickets:</p>
<ol>
<li>Application type: mobile </li>
<li>Titanium SDK: Titanium SDK version 3.1.1.GA</li>
<li>Platform &amp; version: iOS 7.0</li>
<li>Host Operating System: OSX 10.8.4</li>
<li>Titanium Studio: Titanium Studio, build: 3.1.1.201306112235</li>
<li>a simple test case: Build any app to iOS device (I have tried several, including blank templates from the &quot;Develop&quot; tab in the dashboard)</li>
<li>Logs: See next</li>
<li>Android and iOS Development: duplicated from earlier:</li>
</ol>

<p>Please help!  I like the look of the studio and would like to be able to really test the workflow and capabilities!</p>

							<div><p>Xcode 5-DP3.  iOS 7 is not available in any lower version, though I do also have 4.6.2 installed on my machine.  OS X doesn&#39;t have any problem running both versions of Xcode since 5 is a developer preview, and all other iOS developers that I have spoken to are running both.</p>
<p>I am finding more and more threads that suggest that others are compiling to iOS 7, for example, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;153484&#x2F;ios-7-compatibility-with-titanium-app">this link</a>.  I would appreciate help from anyone out there who is compiling to iOS 7, or anyone who has no issue with certificate&#x2F;profile combinations in Xcode, but does have trouble with them in Titanium for any reason.</p>

							<p>OK, I thought I&#39;d take the time to post a workaround that I discovered today as courtesy to anyone else out there who wants to use Titanium for some development, but is also testing development for iOS 7 in other SDKs.<br>As Stephen Feather said, you cannot currently publish to the iOS 7 SDK.  However, if you have already installed, don&#39;t waste your time asking questions and getting downvoted for it, just do the following:  </p>
<hr>
<h2 id="sudo-xcode-select-switch-x2f-applications-x2f-xcode-app-x2f-contents-x2f-developer">sudo xcode-select –switch &#x2F;Applications&#x2F;Xcode.app&#x2F;Contents&#x2F;Developer</h2>
<p>Then restart Titanium Studio.  This switches you back to the previous version of Xcode&#39;s SDK, provided that you didn&#39;t uninstall it.</p>
<p>If you want to switch back to Xcode 5 for testing iOS 7 development in other SDKs, reverse the command:</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="sudo-xcode-select-switch-x2f-applications-x2f-xcode5-dp3-app-x2f-contents-x2f-developer">sudo xcode-select –switch &#x2F;Applications&#x2F;Xcode5-DP3.app&#x2F;Contents&#x2F;Developer</h2>
<p>Note that switching to Xcode.app only allows you to publish to iOS 6.1 and lower, but I successfully published to an iOS 7 device and it worked just fine, it just doesn&#39;t have the new UI.</p>

							<p>Really?  I am confused by the other reading I have done about developing for iOS 7 within this SDK then:</p>
<p>Quoting <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2013&#x2F;06&#x2F;support-for-ios-7.html">this link</a>, &quot;We have already downloaded the beta and have successfully recompiled and run a few simple apps on top of it&quot; - reading on, several user comments that refer to testing that they are doing in iOS 7.</p>
<p>The same article points to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;secure&#x2F;IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&amp;jqlQuery=labels+%3D+ios7">this JIRA issue tracker</a>, which outlines a host of issues that are being tested by other users in iOS 7.  Are these being created by a closed-user group within Titanium&#x2F;Appcellerator?</p>
<p>My goal was to develop and prepare for my app for the market immediately following the release of iOS 7 in the fall.  Will this not be possible with Titanium&#x2F;Appcellerator?  Or to ask another way, is development for iOS 7 going to be closed to the public in this SDK until iOS 7 is also available to the public?</p>
