			<h1>How to prevent keyboard open in scroll view on Android?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m working on an App that has textFields on a scrollView inside a window.  Everything works great except that, on Android, when the screen is first displayed the first text field receives focus and the virtual keyboard is opened. </p>
<p>On iPhone the keyboard doesn&#39;t open until the user touches the field in order to edit it. If the scrollView is removed and the testFields are put directly in the window, then it does the same thing (not opening the keyboard until the textField receives focus) on Android.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s some test code that illustrates this behavior:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> win = Ti.UI.createWindow();
win.open();

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> scrolly = Titanium.UI.createScrollView({contentHeight:<span class="hljs-string">'auto'</span>});
win.add(scrolly);

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> aField = Ti.UI.createTextField({
    <span class="hljs-keyword">value</span>:<span class="hljs-string">'Some Text'</span>,
    top:<span class="hljs-number">50</span>,
    left:<span class="hljs-number">10</span>,
    backgroundColor:<span class="hljs-string">'#ffffff'</span>
});

scrolly.add(aField);
</code></pre><p>The above code will open the keyboard as soon as the screen is displayed on Android, but not on iPhone.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the same code with the scrollView removed:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">win</span> = Ti.UI.createWindow();
<span class="hljs-keyword">win</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>();

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> aField = Ti.UI.createTextField({
    value:'Some Text',
    top:50,
    left:10,
    backgroundColor:'#ffffff'
});

<span class="hljs-keyword">win</span>.add(aField);
</code></pre><p>The above code works the same on Android and iPhone - it doesn&#39;t open the keyboard until the user taps the field, but I need the scollView so this is not a solution. (I only include this to illustrate that it&#39;s the scrollView that seems to be the issue.)</p>
<p>Does anyone know how I can PREVENT the virtual keyboard from opening when the screen with the scrollView is first presented on Android?</p>

							<p>Found a solution for this one!  It can only be done with SDK 2.0.0 or later because the required event was not implemented in older versions.  Interestingly enough I didn&#39;t have this problem with my particular layout UNTIL I updated to the latest SDK.</p>
<p>What worked for me was to add the view to the window in the <strong>postlayout</strong> window event.  the &#39;open&#39; event and the &#39;focus&#39; event both occur before the Titanium bug screws it up so they can&#39;t be used.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> aField = Ti.UI.createTextField({
    value:<span class="hljs-string">'Some Text'</span>,
    top:<span class="hljs-number">50</span>,
    left:<span class="hljs-number">10</span>,
    backgroundColor:<span class="hljs-string">'#ffffff'</span>
});

win.addEventHandler(<span class="hljs-string">'postlayout'</span> <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
    win.add(aField);
});

										<p><p>Simply brilliant! I&#39;ve been banging my head against the wall for a couple of hours over this bug. Wish I had searched here earlier. In my case, I had four text fields in a scrollview in a window. I added the scrollview to the window in the postlayout event. I mention this because that&#39;s what your text says to do, but your code demonstrates adding just the field.</p>

										<p><p>Careful not to create an endless loop with postlayout. When you add the field, a new postlayout event will be fired. Maybe adding an event on &#39;open&#39; would be better….</p>

							<p>Use this property when you create the window:<br> windowSoftInputMode = Ti.UI.Android.SOFT_INPUT_STATE_HIDDEN;</p>
<p>It has to be specified on window create, take a look at http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.UI.Window</p>

							<p>Try maybe setting the textField&#39;s enabled property to false until you&#39;&#39;re happy the window is ready. Then set aField.enabled = true </p>
<p>You could do this with a setTimeout or maybe the window&#39;s &#39;focus&#39; event.</p>

										<p><p>I started testing this approach. As a first step I set enabled to false but didn&#39;t implement code to turn it back on. I installed and ran this app on my HTC Inspire. To my surprise, the keyboard STILL opened even though the field was NOT enabled. Weird. </p>

							<p>Can&#39;t replicate using your exact code on sdk 1.7.0 &#x2F; android emulator 2.3.3.  The textbox has focus on startup, but keyboard is not shown until clicking on the textbox.  What versions are you building with&#x2F;running on?</p>

							<p>the solution is to add an eventListener to the opening of the window, in that listener, call a blur event on your text field, that will keep the keyboard from showing</p>

										<p><p>I actually tried this before I posted the question. It works…sort of. The problem is that, at least on the HTC Inspire I was testing on the keyboard still opens and then immediately closes. It happens reply quickly but still looks kludgy. My hope is to find a method that actually prevents the keyboard from piping up to begin with.</p>
