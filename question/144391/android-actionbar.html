		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve noticed that the ActionBar is already implemented but not yet released. There&#39;s a <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-2371">fixed ticket</a> for it, planned for the 3.0.0 Release. So far, so good.<br>BUT the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB&#x2F;fixforversion&#x2F;13505">3.0 Release</a> looks due some weeks ago. When will it be released?</p>

										<p><p>Not that I&#39;m defending AppC in this case. But it is my guess that almost all their effort went into iOS 6. And only no, they are getting back to it.</p>

										<p><p>yeah, that&#39;s reasonable, although I still think it&#39;s quite rude to make us wait too long for the new Android interface. But as you said, not defending Appcelerator :P</p>

										<p><p>You are so right.</p>
<p>It is <strong>RUDE</strong> of those louses at Appcelerator to release its Titanium Mobile SDK for <strong>FREE</strong> as <strong>OPEN SOURCE</strong> software that is extendable through a module system that allows <strong>USERS</strong> to create modules to meet their own needs. </p>
<p>Politeness prevents me from really telling you what I think of you and your attitude in this forum, Igor.</p>
<p>So, how about you take that chip on your shoulder and find another place to sling it around.  When you contribute something of value, then you can complain as ignorantly as you have been.</p>

										<p><p>It&#39;s very nice to say that it&#39;s open source when, in one year, no one have really implemented that and released to anyone to use. There&#39;s only one incomplete attempt.<br>I don&#39;t care (at this point) if it&#39;s open or closed source, but I do notice that there&#39;s a company taking care of the code and they are quite outdated. There&#39;s more than one year that Google have launched the all new UI and they keep making us wait for it.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve started now with Titanium and  - as I have seen a lot of other posts out there -  I&#39;m quite lost, trying to create an app for Android with the current Google guidelines. I didn&#39;t create this post to complain about how awful is Appcelerator (what I really don&#39;t think they are) or whatever, but to get HELP on what to do to get this to work. You are not helping, just getting angry about something that wasn&#39;t even really a complaint! I was just agreeing with the last user that they could have launched it before, but have yet taken care of iOS. THAT&#39;S IT. No need to struggle with the new users. C&#39;mon.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll never be able to contribute something of value if there&#39;s trolls like you out there spending their time making me unconfortable even to start in the community. Go review your community values (and also the way you read what others write, please).</p>

										<p><p>just noticed that you were the first one to give that clean answer. have you seen that I added a comment to my question (as I&#39;m not able to edit it)? Again, I didn&#39;t come here to be a troll and say &quot;c&#39;mon appcelerator is horrible&quot;, but to ask &quot;I&#39;ve seen it&#39;s done but not released, how can I use it?&quot;</p>

										<p><p>Couple of thoughts:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The action bar was released with honeycomb and at the time, the idea from Google was that it was to be a tablet only design.  Then magically it is to be the new UI direction on all devices.  So a form factor only solution to a platform solution.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Actionbar is a lot more difficult to implement with Titanium than you might be aware.  Titanium was designed to be built upon an established theme and structure, and upon it we add our native elements.  Actionbar must be declared before that, which means the way Titanium generates its app foundation had to change.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Backwards compatibility is a problem as old android versions must be supported and as such their theme&#x2F;foundation is considerably different than the way an Actionbar is implemented.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you take the time to go through the JIRA, you will find that most of these concerns HAVE been discussed in the comments and with Appc engineers no less.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Google is again looking to change the way its UI works, and this means another modification.</p>
</li>
</ol>

										<p><p>thanks so much for the patience (:<br>I think that Titanium is only an envelope through Android Java &#x2F; iOS Obj-C, but sometimes we focus too much on the upper level and forget that what&#39;s under the hoods rarely is easy as the top level. Thanks for the explanation.</p>
<p>I&#39;m still getting my way through JIRA, and I discovered a way to install the CI builds before you tell me how. It&#39;s working fine for now, I&#39;m just missing some features that are still being worked on - and following their tickets&#x2F;PRs.</p>
