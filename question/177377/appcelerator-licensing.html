			<h1>Appcelerator licensing</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have explored other hybrid framework such as Sencha, Ionic, etc. I want to try out Appcelerator, but have read much about licensing confusion. I saw those post were quite old, and want to know the status now. Other framework&#39;s website pricing is clearly stated, but I noticed Appcelerator only have &quot;Free&quot; and &quot;Enterprise&quot; (without price given). I guess I may have been confused by other older posts, and in order not to waste my time exploring this framework that eventually going to be costly, I would appreciate some confirmation regarding pricing. I may develop app using appcelerator and put in appstore.</p>

							<p>A quick answer.</p>
<p>If there is just you or a few, then you can use Appcelerator for free. You do not need to worry and there is a good load of API calls and Push notifications available from the ACS, within this free package</p>
<p>If you are a corporate customer, you may wish to consider an enterprise account, but these are quite expensive, and being honest if you have an app which requires the enterprise facilities then you will be able to afford it.</p>
<p>If as you say, you want to develop an app then go ahead and do it, using the Titanium Studio and free licenses.</p>
<p>hope this helps</p>
<p>T.</p>

							<p>Hi Trevor,</p>
<p>Thanks for your prompt reply. That is very helpful. I have another situation: if I were to develop app using Appcelerator for my customer who potentially could be corporate client, what kind of licensing will it apply? Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>the same applies.</p>
<p>You can use the free version, but the client may want to get an enterprise version themselves. The client may also want to use the free version.</p>
<p>You have to look at each case in turn, but there are no restrictions on the size of company using the free version.</p>
<p>T.</p>
