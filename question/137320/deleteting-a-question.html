							<div><p>Hi Goppi, This rights is only with the admin of the forum, he can only delete the questions from the backend. Usually admin delete the Spam questions from the backend, I think you can also even email at community@appcelerator.com and ask them to do the same for you.</p>
<p>Secondly we should think twice before sending the questions to forum, if you find the answer or solution to problem on your own then its the responsibility of us to put the answer to the query and mark questions as lock. This will help other peoples on forum, if they face same type of problem in near future.</p>
