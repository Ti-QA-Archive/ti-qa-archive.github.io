			<h1>Performance of Titanium 3.x on Android Tablet</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am developing an app for online stock trade on Android Tablet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alloy 1.x</li>
<li>Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1</li>
<li>Android 4.1</li>
</ul>
<p>After building the app using Titanium, the app is not smooth enough. I am wondering what course the performance. I am thinking of re-writing the app with better performance. Would someone provide some information or experience. So that I can take into consideration before I start to re-build:</p>
<ol>
<li>Performance is good enough of Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 vs other tablet</li>
<li>Performance of building app using Titanium 3.x vs Alloy</li>
<li>Performance of tablet apps built by Titanium vs Native Android app</li>
</ol>
<p>The stock trade app has many information on one screen. Any other considerations or technique to enhance the performance?</p>

							<div><p>There is no way anyone is going to be able to give you actionable information with what you&#39;ve provided. You may get vague, high-level tips at best. You need to narrow down exactly what sections of your app are encountering performance issues and show some of the code that you suspect is causing the issue. It would be even better if you could boil down your performance issues into small test cases so that others can reproduce them, which would make helping you so much easier. </p>
<p>Without details you won&#39;t get much help.</p>
