			<h1>How much cross over btw Mobile App and Windows App?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi - I need an App that will run both Android and Windows based.  How much of the work is common to both platforms - I know it&#39;s not 100%, but I&#39;d rather not have to code the App twice.  Does anyone have experience with doing an app in both platforms, and if so, how much does appcelerator do for you in that case?</p>

							<p>You mean mobile(android) and desktop(windows) ?<br>If yes the cross-platform percent in this case is almost 0 (there are similarities in the syntax but too few).</p>
<p>The paradigms between the two platforms are too different so I don&#39;t think is even possible to create something like this.</p>

							<p>Thanks for the input Dan and Yes, I do mean mobile(android) and desktop(windows).  It&#39;s unfortunate, but not unexpected.  Now, to switch over to Appcelerator, I have to look at re doing my application twice.  That may be too much work to make it an effective solution…</p>

										<p><p>Is not that bad, if you organize yourself a little and taking in account it that Titanium speeds up the development of an app with 50% or even more</p>
<ol>
<li>Make modules for everything is platform agnostic(backend stuff usually) so you will be able to reuse the code across the platforms.</li>
<li>For desktop use a framework build with webkit in mind to keep it as light as possible (zepto.js is one of them) but any other one will do it.</li>
<li>If your app is not heavy you can try to use a webview on the mobile side too. But I STRONGLY don&#39;t recommend it cause you&#39;ll get into performance issue very fast, especially on android.</li>
