			<h1>App working on Android but not iPhone</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I don&#39;t have iPhone SDK, so I developed the app on Android emulator and it works absolutely fine on it, but when my client tried it on iPhone, the visuals were messed up, form elements weren&#39;t properly stacked and nothing was working as expected!</p>
<p>I thought Titanium was fully cross-platform; idea being, if it works on one platform it should work on the other one as well, but it doesn&#39;t! Or am I missing some crucial step which needs to be taken for iPhone testing&#x2F;deployment?</p>
<p>Oh and I&#39;m not using any Android-specific code, just basic Titanium code, which presumably should be cross-platform (as it says on the API docs)!</p>

							<p>Titanium is cross platform, but you Will always need to test and implement platform specific code in your app. There are UI differences in the way that android and iPhone display element and therefore you can not expect it to just work out of the box</p>

							<p>There are several differences with the UI that has to be taken into consideration.  Android renders things differently than the iPhone. Especially with where things are placed on the screen and where the taskbar is located.</p>
