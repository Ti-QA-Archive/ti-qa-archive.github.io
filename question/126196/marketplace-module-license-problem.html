			<h1>Marketplace Module License problem</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi everybody,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve just purchased Custom Video Module from indianic.com from Appcelerator Marketplace.</p>
<p>After copying it to the right location and adding it to the right location in tiapp.xml I get a license error as below.</p>
<p>2011-09-29 17:28:01.588 custom video test[31572:13a03] [ERROR] License violation detected. Unlicensed module(s) detected.  You must be a subscriber to use one or more of the modules included with this project.. Please contact Appcelerator Support.</p>
<p>I&#39;m online, and for example since I&#39;m an INDIE customer I can use their Titanium + modules without any problem, so there shouldn&#39;t be an issue in authentication with Appcelerator.</p>
<p>Also, in the marketplace under my products, this module is assigned to me without any problems.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve contacted indianic.com but they are not willing to help since they call it an issue with Appcelerator not them.</p>
<p>Is anyone experiencing similar problem with this module or any other modules bought from the marketplace?</p>
<p>Since I&#39;m an INDIE I can not go to helpdest and create a ticket for this, which is a shame, they should support the products that they charge us for!!!</p>
<p>Let this be a warning to anyone who is considering using the marketplace and&#x2F;or indianic.com modules.</p>
<p>Tony</p>

							<p>Tony - I am very sorry to hear your having issues with the marketplace&#x2F;the module you purchased. </p>
<p>First off I would like to check to make sure the account you bought the module with is the same account your logged into studio with. If this is the case then I will ask you to please email marketplace-support@appcelerator.com with your issue, and the marketplace team will help you with this issue.</p>
<p>If your not using the same login, please try logging in as the same user that bought the module.</p>
<p>Let me know how it goes!</p>

							<p>Yes, the accounts are the same, I&#39;ve sent a message to marketplace support email you mentioned. It would have been nice to see that email on the marketplace section.</p>

							<p>This is the answer I&#39;m getting which I already confirmed in my post… And the funny thing is that I can not reply to the support ticket because I&#39;m an INDIE!!!</p>
<p>You should be getting provisioned automatically.  Please confirm you have used the same account to purchase the module as you are developing with.  If not, the module will not work.  The account you login to the marketplace with needs to be the same account you login to Titanium Studio.  You can log out by clicking your name in the bottom right hand corner of TiStudio: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;screencast.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;cIDnm2Mw</p>
