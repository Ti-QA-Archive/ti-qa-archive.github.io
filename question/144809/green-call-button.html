							<p>Actually <strong>IT IS</strong> an image in the Apple&#39;s apps :)</p>
<p>Download this project and run it with xcode against the simulator, then do a search in the results for green, you will see a condensed artwork (suitable for background set with backgroundLeftCap )</p>

										<p><p>Too bad. Even providing a standard image in the iOS SDK and then using it to create an API method to create a button would be better than this, and it would solve the rendering problem.</p>

							<p>I know that,</p>
<p>what i meant was without using designer techniques. It has to have a way, I wouldn&#39;t believe that iPhone creators made a designer implement a new image every time they need the call button. It would be wise to have an option in the API to recreate it (and also RED call reject button).</p>

										<p><p>Could you please show me in code example how you would recreate <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;shawnblanc.net&#x2F;images&#x2F;img-0007-1.png">that green button</a>?</p>
<p>Because the only way I managed to do this, was by adding backgroundImage.</p>
<p>Also, i tried using backgroundColor, but instead of filling the button, it filled the corners of the rounded (borderRadius =10;) button that i made. So, I am also having a problem with this backgroundColor property.</p>

							<p>Really now? That is not a good practice in my opinion. Call buttons are pretty common in mobile apps and should be part of the API.</p>
<p>Thanks for the answer though. How do you extract artwork from this UIKit you referenced? It seems useful and I would like to learn how to use it. Can you please explain to me HOW-TO use it?</p>

										<p><p>Just run the project with xcode against the simulator as I said, you will have a button &quot;save&quot; that will save on the desktop. both artwork and emojis.</p>
<p>Run it with retina to get both normal and @2x images.</p>

										<p><p>Using an image is cheaper for the CPU that to render a gradient. I think that was why Apple decided to do it this way.</p>

							<p>Thank you so much. I can&#39;t do it right now, but I believe you checked this out before posting it so I will flag your answer as the best answer since it helped most.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
