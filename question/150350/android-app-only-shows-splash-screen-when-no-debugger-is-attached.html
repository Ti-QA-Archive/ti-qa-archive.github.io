			<h1>Android app only shows splash screen when no debugger is attached</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>When I run my Titanium app without the debugger attached, it shows the splash screen and never progresses past it. </p>
<p>Thinking this was my code, I created a brand new project, made no changes to it and ran that. When the debugger is attached, it runs fine and I see the Hello World view correctly. As soon as I stop the debugger, the application shows the splash screen. After killing the app, and then relaunching it, it only shows the Titanium splash screen.</p>
<p>I tried this with both a classic Titanium app, as well as a Titanium Alloy app. I tried it running both on my actual device (Samsung Galaxy SIII, Android 4.2.1) as well as the emulator (4.2.1, and 4.2.2). I am running Titanium Studio build 3.0.2.201302191606</p>
<p>Since I realize Titanium works quite well for everyone else (and has for me in the past), I can&#39;t imagine what the problem could be. I have searched over Google extensively, and looked at many options (including several related to the android 2727 bug) but nothing I have found has helped.</p>
<p>I would be extremely grateful if someone out there recognizes the problem and can point me to the solution, or even would like to help troubleshoot to find out what the problem is.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Scott</p>

										<p><p>I have to admit, that worked for me too. I&#39;m a little dumbfounded that it worked, honestly.</p>
<p>In the mean time, so much else has changed too (completely uninstalled titanium, installed 3.2 yesterday to test this fix) that I can&#39;t be totally sure it is the fix, but I can confirm that I can reproduce the problem with one app id still, and changing the app id to something else makes the problem go away.</p>

										<p><p>It&#39;s a pleasure for me to help you!</p>
<p>But unfortunately it&#39;s a temporary solution. After same time the problem may repeat for your new app ID.<br>Like more correct solution try to restore backup from point before installation your app or a factory reset your device. RTFM: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wikihow.com&#x2F;Reset-Your-Android-Phone. Make backup before!</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know a root the problem, but it seem relevant for Samsung devices only.</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve the same problem. But only on the mobile device Samsung Fame (GT-S6810). When I run the app on the Samsung Tablet2 (GT-P3110) everything works fine. I am quite sure that I never run the app in debug modus on the tablet and I don&#39;t want to try it because of this problem. But on the mobile phone with changing the app-id in tiapp.xml the app starts. Now I&#39;ve the proble that I&#39;m using the google.maps module an therefor you need to create a key with your app-id. So changing the app-id is no option for me. I&#39;ll try to find out what&#39;s going on on the Samsung device and let you know as soon as I&#39;ve found a solution.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ve found a solution that works fine for me.<br>Once you run your app with debug mode on your Samsung device, there will be a folder created on your device named as your app-id. I&#39;ve started the android filetransfer app on my Mac and found this folder directly in the root. After removing this folder you can start your app as usual.</p>
<p>(by the way: be sure to stop your app which is still running from the debug mode befor you start the app again)</p>

							<p>Hello Scott,</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about your problems.  I&#39;ll try to help you.  First off, I&#39;m thinking that there&#39;s a breakpoint somewhere.  To make sure this is not the case, go to RUN&gt;Remove all breakpoints and try the debugger again.</p>
<p>Let us know how it goes!</p>

										<p><p>Hi Ricardo. I appreciate your help.</p>
<p>The application works fine when I debug it. It loads up just like it is supposed to. The problem exhibits when I exit the program (rather than minimize it via the home button). When I relaunch it, it does not get past the splash screen.</p>
<p>Additionally, I created a brand new project. I did not make any changes to it. It is the standard Hello, World single window app project that Titanium ships. I did not add any breakpoints to the project.</p>
<p>When I run it through Titanium Studio in the emulator (or on my device) it loads the red titanium splash screen, and then shows the Hello World screen. Once I exit (back button, or via android task manager) and then open it again (via the app tray, or a shortcut in the launcher) it does not go past the red titanium splash screen.</p>
<p>Are you still thinking that breakpoints could cause this?</p>

										<p><p>Scott,</p>
<p>I&#39;m not being able to reproduce the problem…it works as expected.</p>
<p>Try cleaning your project: Project &gt; Clean and relaunch.</p>
<p>Also you could open the Android monitor.  Look for it in [[androidsdk_folder]]&#x2F;tools and it&#39;s called &quot;monitor&quot;.  Select the emulator under Devices, select LogCat and the Threads tab.  Then launch your App and watch the log.  Watch closely for RED items.</p>

										<p><p>I have not. Without any mailice intended - I have all but given up on using Titanium (and switching to Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.IOS) because of this issue.</p>
<p>Foremost, I would note that when the boilerplate sample project won&#39;t run, it does not reflect well for the platform as a whole - and being told to purchase a support agreement costing thousands of dollars to get that boilerplate sample running is <em>not</em> acceptable.</p>
<p>Ricardo was really trying to help, and I appreciate that - I just don&#39;t think that the back-and-forth between us was getting anywhere - I couldn&#39;t get the application to reliabily run in my emulator after the last message. It would probably take an interactive session to nail down the problem, but that isn&#39;t about to happen without a very expensive support contract.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not a rookie application developer - I have an app in Google Play store developed with native Java - I know that Titanium can work, because I have seen apps built with it work, I&#39;ve even had it working on a different computer for quite some time - but I can&#39;t move forward to create my application with it if the apps I build won&#39;t run now!</p>
<p>Again - I say all this with no malice intended - it is just the facts as they have fallen for me.</p>
<p>If you happen to figure out how to solve your problem, I would <strong>love</strong> to hear the solution. I genuinely do like Titanium, and have invested over 200 hours creating a custom framework for a new product, and would <em>really</em> like to not have to start over.</p>

										<p><p>Scott, sorry to hear you&#39;re still having problems. A situation like the one you describe is very difficult to diagnose using a forum. You know, as a developer, that there&#39;s not just one way of approaching a debugging process. I&#39;m still interested in getting you up and running and back on track, but perhaps I&#39;ll need to have access to your project and rule out any incompatibility or misconfiguration on your local environment.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>R</p>

										<p><p>Ricardo,</p>
<p>I definitely understand that it is difficult to diagnose. I certainly appreciate the efforts you have gone to in order to try to find the problem. </p>
<p>I was pretty sure that <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dropbox.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;u3v5d5l6ipe2sw9&#x2F;Automobic%20Demo.zip">the project you looked at on dropbox</a> already worked for you in your environment… </p>
<p>Please let me know if you would like a different project - I will see what I can do with regards to providing my fully fledged project rather than the boilerplate sample one.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Scott</p>

							<p>Hi, today I got the same problem. After changing the id in TiApp.xml the app works on the andoird&#x2F;samsung-galaxy S-II. After changing the id back to the older one … the application seems to stop at the start screen.<br>I don&#39;t think it has something to do with breakpoints, but the error occured only after I started the first time the debugger on this andoird-device. I just ry it again with the new id … yep, after I started with the new id (TiApp.xml) one time the debugger … the app is not working anymore in the normal run-mode. I can start the app directly on the android device an it seems to stuck at the start (of course also not connected to the developer-pc). I deinstalled the app and reinstalled it. The same: app still stuck at the start. Even after rebooting the android device it&#39;s not working … well I have no ideas anymore …</p>

										<p><p>Found a Work Around for this . Till Appcelerator fixes this .<br>0)Unistall your app via App Manager<br>1) Next ul need a file manager installed on your phone . i use ES File Explorer which is quite popular on playStore and it helps u search from the root<br>2) Search for your app id &#x2F; package id .(com.app.xxxx) via the search option of ES File Explorer<br>3)Delete the folder and now reinstall ur app<br>Hope it works . It worked in my case</p>

							<p>I suggest delete <strong>app.json</strong> and <strong>index.json</strong> from <em>{Workspace}{project}\build\android\bin\assets</em> perchance remove all files from <strong>bin</strong> directory. :)</p>
