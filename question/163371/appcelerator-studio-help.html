		<section>
			<p>I am using purchased version of accelerator studio for my company. I expected it to be better than the titanium studio. I don&#39;t see much difference in the code assist feature. its very bad or am i not turning on anything in the preference. I have added the Alloy&#x2F;moment module but when i type moment it does not prompt anything at all. I have to go back to the moment.js site a dig for the methods that it has. This is so annoying after you have purchased the paided version of the studio</p>
<p>Could anyone help me on this.</p>

							<p>Backing up Stephen&#39;s answer, There really isn&#39;t any difference between the two studios, for developing the application. The paid for version does allow some additional features but not in coding.</p>
<p>So to answer your question, pressing ctrl+space will give you code completion.</p>
<p>I have tried moment in the editor and it works by default, however moment.js is a third party module, not part of the Titanium tools.</p>
<p>Appcelerator Studio is a customised version of the eclipse IDE, and has built in code snippets which should appear at the bottom left of the IDE. If its not then from the top menu select window-&gt;Show View and the snippets &amp; samples options are there.</p>
<p>When asking a question please follow the guidelines and let us know what platform and version of the tooling your using. As you may have something setup wrong but from the info you have provided, we cannot guess.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>T.</p>

							<p>Think you are under a bit of a misconception here.  </p>
<p>You are talking as though its Titanium Studio vs Appcelerator Studio that was paid for.</p>
<p>Its not.  Its free Titanium vs Appcelerator PLATFORM.</p>

<p>Yet - The title of the question simply states &#39;appcelerator studio help&#39;</p>
<p>Yet - You start off expecting more from appcelerator studio because you paid for it.</p>
<p>Yet - You bring up moment (assuming here you expect all the moment stuff to magically pop up in your autocomplete</p>
<p>Yet - You finish off ranting about paying for appcelerator studio</p>
<p>So, a REASONABLE person, who has READ the guidelines for posting a question, would understand WHY there might be some confusion regarding the nature and intent of your &quot;question&quot;.</p>

							<p>Thank you for the answers. I was just trying to understand how best I can use the studio in terms of setting or preferences.  I totally understand the appcelerator platform and the studio&#39;s features.</p>
