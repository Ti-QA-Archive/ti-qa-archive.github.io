		<section>
			<p>Hello, I&#39;m about to build a new Titanium mobile app. This app will feature a product catalog and I want to build some kind of &quot;update contents functionality&quot;. Whenever the connectivity is available it will check for contents updates and in case it will download. When no connectivity is available the most up to date downloaded contents will be shown.<br>What&#39;s your design strategy for this kind of feature within Titanium mobile?<br>Thanks</p>

							<p>I would use an sqlite database file to store all the info you need. This would be the best data store to use for products.</p>
<p>On first run, get your app to download a db file and store it in the App data folder then open&#x2F;use it. </p>
<p>Then your app can check when it needs to and compare the date stamp of the db file to see how old is is and it it needs updating. You could also use a version number of the db file itself and compare that instead. </p>
<p>When it needs a new one, simply download it and replace the old one. </p>
<p>If you didn&#39;t want to use sqlite, you could also use a large JSON file to do the same thing.</p>

							<p>I am assuming here the contents you want to update relate to the products, as opposed to updating the app per se (i.e. features or UI or whatever).  Apps published in the Apple App Store are prohibited from self updating because it sidesteps Apple&#39;s mandate to review all applications and updates before allowing in their app store.</p>
<p>In one of my client applications which has product data (a sales force automation system), I store everything but the images in a SQLite database.  I download and completely the replace the database at least once a day to have fairly current inventory levels or estimated ship dates, pricing &#x2F; sales promotion updates, etc.  I have a server pre-build a SQLite database, including various indexes for query optimizations, then zip that and store it on a server.  Mobile devices close their existing database, download the new zip file, extract it to the folder where Titanium expects it, then opens the database again.  Completely eliminates the need to perform inserts or updates on rows, rebuild indexes, etc.   With a wifi connection, I can completely update all product data for many thousands of products in literally seconds.  The corporate server prebuilds new databases a few times a day.  Sales reps tend to request updates each morning, then as desired during the day if they want to recheck stock levels or ship date revisions before (or during) a given sales call.  It literally takes seconds, when they have internet connectivity.  But it continues to run just fine when they don&#39;t.</p>
<p>For images, I keep individual jpg&#39;s of each product in a folder on the device, but also track the timestamp of the lastest image file previously downloaded.  To get image updates, I do a POST operation to a server page which accepts that timestamp, then dynamically produces a zip file of any images on the server newer than the timestamp requested.  The zip file gets downloaded, extracted to the image folder, and I update the value to be passed the next time around.</p>
<p>But like all things in app development, the design strategy which works best in a given scenario will depend on many factors.  I&#39;m just answering the &quot;What&#39;s your design strategy for this kind of feature…?&quot; for one of my apps which includes a product catalog.</p>
<p>YMMV.</p>

										<p><p>Sounds good… I have to admit I didn&#39;t think about downloading the a sqlite db file. I like this. How about the zip file with updated images… how do you manage to unzip?? I spent some time looking for this kind of function in Titanium but only found it in the Titanium Deskop.<br>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>you could try using a zipfile module I forked and updated here : https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kosso&#x2F;ZipFile</p>

										<p><p>It allows the fastest method for me to swap out the data en masse.  Instantly inserts new products, updates existing products, and removes retired products without performing and import steps or maintenance on multiple indexes to optimize queries.   Works very well for my scenario.</p>
<p>I only need unzip for iOS, so I use <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;TermiT&#x2F;ZipFile">this</a> module, which has been around a long time.  I see the Titanium Marketplace lists a couple of other choices <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;1355?1181494960">here</a> (for iOS only) and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;774?586019716">here</a> (for iOS and Android but not free).</p>
<p>Using zip reduces the size of the db nicely, which makes it download faster.  For images, zipping a set of jpg&#39;s has very little space saving.  It more just acts as a container so I can pull all the images needed in one HTTP POST operation.</p>
