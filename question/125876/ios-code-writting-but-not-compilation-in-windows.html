			<h1>iOS Code Writting (but not compilation) in Windows?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am considering the use of Titanium for a small cross-platform mobile app with some fellow students, and we&#39;re wondering whether it will be possible for code written on a Windows installation (with only the Android SDK installed) to be compiled for iOS on a different machine running OSX. The problem is in that not all of our group has access to a mac, and we are unsure of how much pre-compiling integration is handled by Titanium itself. Ideally, we would be able to edit and test the android distribution in Windows, and then also compile the same base code for iOS after the fact on OSX machines, but it&#39;s unclear whether this will work. Thanks!</p>

							<p>Maybe this is just a matter of opinion, but I have in fact seen this done successfully. Its not ideal, but can in fact be done with reasonably good results. Titanium after all is simply python build scripts and studio just calls these scripts. You could simply create a process (using python, bash…) that would &quot;build&quot; your app by copying the files you are working on over the network to a Mac and then call our build scripts. Again, its not 100% ideal, and the construction of these extra scripts is not something Appcelerator can provide or support, but just wanted to give you an idea of how this has been, and could be done in your case.</p>

							<p>Well, when you are in front of your code, titanium studio is the same for mac, linux or win. So, there is not any real difference editing code between these platforms. Of course, is not they best way to do it, but if you avoid use specific platforms API and features and you edit tiapp.xml to support both platforms, I think you should be able to open the same project in both systems, at least, to have an idea of how it looks on screen, you know what I mean. For any serious project this way will probably fail, since there is no way to test nor debug the app for iOs on windows and will be very frustrating.</p>
