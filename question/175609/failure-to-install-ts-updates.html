		<section>
			<p>I am new to Titanium.  I have just downloaded and installed the latest version and I am trying to start the program.</p>
<p>During the initial start sequence of Titanium Studio, the update sequence fails because the user password is not accepted.</p>
<p>I am running on a MacBook Pro, with OS 10.9.3.  The TS version is:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Titanium Studio, build: <span class="hljs-number">3.2</span><span class="hljs-number">.3</span><span class="hljs-number">.201404181442</span>

<p>The reason for the failure is that the password asked for is for the wrong user.  And the user cannot be changed.</p>
<p>TS is detecting a name of the current, privileged user, according to the name of the folder in the Users directory, &quot;Me&quot;.  However that is not the name of the user, &quot;Colin Griffiths&quot;.  The name of the user cannot be changed to Me, nor can the name of the folder be changed to Colin Griffiths.</p>
<p>Any hints as to how to resolve this?  Stymied with TS until I can update!</p>

							<p>Hello Colin Griffiths,</p>
<p>Which password are you entering? You need to put your user&#39;s password, not Appcelerator&#39;s one. After that you can follow the following steps:</p>
<p>After installing NodeJS manually  just type following into the terminal.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">sudo npm <span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">install</span> -<span class="hljs-keyword">g</span> alloy titanium</span>
</code></pre><p>For more information about the Installation <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Setting_up_Studio">Link</a> . You also can see the Titanium Command-Line Interface Reference via <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Titanium_Command-Line_Interface_Reference">Link</a>. Please let me know if you have any query. Thank you</p>

										<p><p>Tx, Fazlul, for the response.</p>
<p>FYI, you provided a hint, but not the answer to the problem.</p>
<p>There was no issue with the password that I was using.</p>
<p>What was the problem was the fact that &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local&#x2F; had not been declared as writable by all.  The password was correct, but after three attempts to write to the directory failed, the entire update failed.</p>
<p>Once the sudo command to unlock the directory had been issued the update ran AOK.  I had installed Node.js manually, but I don&#39;t think that influenced things.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I have no idea what:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Make sure that /usr/local/bin is <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> your <span class="hljs-variable">$PATH</span>
</code></pre><p>means, the final message on running the install for node.js.  I have developed for Macs for 20 years, and a return to using DOS gobblydegook is not progress.  The same goes of course with using a sudo command.  But, hey, we can take the rough with the smooth.</p>

										<p><p>Tx again Fazlul.</p>
<p>I would note that none of the comments really nail this issue.  And I note further that the topic occurs many times, over an extended period of time.</p>
<p>The solution to the problem I encountered (failure to accept the user&#39;s Mac password during the update sequence) is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure you are running as the administrator.  Not just any administrator, but THE administrator of the machine you are installing on.  i.e. the first declared administrator and typically the owner of the machine.</li>
<li>Ensure you have write privileges on usr&#x2F;local&#x2F;bin&#x2F;</li>
</ol>
<p>I now have a further problem that I am not apparently installing the Android SDK, even though the download and install processes appear to run to completion: I am told that it is not configured correctly and proceed on prompt to download and install yet again!  I will check for and post separately.</p>
