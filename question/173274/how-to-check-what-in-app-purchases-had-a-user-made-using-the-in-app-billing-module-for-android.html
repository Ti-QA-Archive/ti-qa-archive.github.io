			<h1>How to check what in-app purchases had a user made using the In-App Billing Module for Android?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Our app makes use of managed purchases in Google Play Store, we use the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;776#!overview">In-App Billing free module from the market</a> and we were able to implement its functionality into our project with no problem. That was until a question arose: How do we check for these managed purchases?</p>
<p>Natively, the In-App Billing library access the Play Store app and checks the purchases made by the user, but we checked the documentation and example for this module and there&#39;s no exposed method to make this check, so how can we check what purchases a user has made? </p>
<p>This is important since if a user purchases, for example, a Basic skin, the user must be able to see this skin in every device he owns with the app installed in it and logged to the same account that has the product marked as purchased.</p>
<p>In short, how can I check for the managed purchases a user has made from the Play Store? Can it be done using the In-App Billing module? In case the module can&#39;t do it, can it be done at all? </p>
<p>We&#39;re using Titanium SDK 3.2.0.GA, Studio 3.2.0.201312191547 and testing on Moto G with Android 4.4 and Xperia Acro S with Android 4.1.2.</p>
