			<p>Hi guys!</p>
<p>I have this weird problem where I have a main window with multiple views inside the window. However, there is this one view which is not rendered but it&#39;s actually added into the window because the event listener is working when I tap at the view&#39;s place. The mechanics work perfectly but only that the view is not rendered. </p>
<p>The problem happened when I added Activity Indicator into the app but they are totally in different scripts and modules, both of them don&#39;t affect each other. The un-rendered view is in the main window and the Activity Indicator I added is in another window. I also added global custom event listeners (the global event listener was added in another module as well) before the problem appeared but I don&#39;t see any relation of adding global event listener with rendering view.</p>
<p>I tried installing the app in multiple devices and it&#39;s not working only in device with iOS 5. I&#39;m using Titanium SDK 1.8.1, is there any bug related to my problem? I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s something to do with iOS 5 because nothing goes wrong in iOS 4.3</p>
<p>The tested devices are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>iPhone 3GS with iOS 4.3 = works perfectly</p>
</li>
<li><p>iPhone 4S with iOS 4.3 = works perfectly</p>
</li>
<li><p>iPhone 3GS with iOS 5 = the particular view not rendered</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks in advance! =)</p>
