			<h1>Need an advice about BlackBerry preview</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>One of my customers wants a BlackBerry application. As I have a professional account, I know I can try to do it with the BlackBerry SDK Preview.<br>But I would like first to have your advice about BB stability.<br>The application is not really complicated (at least for iOS and Android), but can someone tell me if everything should work also for BB ?</p>
<ul>
<li>install small database and sometimes overwrite it with a new version (when I publish a new version of the application)</li>
<li>sqlite queries</li>
<li>geolocation (not very precise, a few kilometers is enough)</li>
<li>webview in order to show html news from a RSS&#x2F;JSON feed</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, what about notifications (I will use UrbanAirship for the iOS and Android versions). Is there a solution ?</p>
<p>Thank you for your answers.</p>
<p>Joel</p>

							<p>I tried to build a Blackberry application a few months ago using Titanium and found it impossible, basic functionality didn&#39;t work right and I found it to be unusable. The impression I get is that Appcelerator isn&#39;t focused on improving BB, as we haven&#39;t heard any new news of improvements in a long time. If you are sure you want to build a BB app, then I&#39;d avoid using Titanium for it.</p>
<p>That being said, you could advise your client on the rapid decline of RIM and BB, and could maybe suggest that they go a different direction like iOS and Android. Maybe they&#39;re set on building a BB app, but it&#39;s worth a shot.</p>

							<p>I had a different outcome. I was able to successfully build and release a client application. It was usable, but it definitely was a challenge.</p>
<p>I successfully implemented everything you have listed except for the push notifications</p>

										<p><p>Thank you for this advice. I already thought to contact you if I get a problem with BlackBerry. The official answer from Appcelerator is &quot;don&#39;t use it in production, it&#39;s still in beta&quot;.</p>
<p>But first of all, I don&#39;t know if my customer will accept my proposition…<br>Stay tuned…</p>

										<p><p>My biggest issue when I tried to build a BB app was with the mapping control, and then when I couldn&#39;t get that to work I tried the BB Kitchen Sink. When I found a lot of bugs in that, I just assumed that it&#39;d be impossible and gave up. Props to you for making it work.</p>

							<p>In my case, I had to forgo even trying the preview because it did not support the range of Blackberry OS versions I needed for the potential project.  I don&#39;t remember now – and am not finding quickly – what versions it does support but it was a show stopper for me.  Thus I never went far enough to even try the SDK.</p>
<p>I only gave up supporting OS 4.x on my (native) Blackberry projects last month.  I need to continue to support 5.x for the foreseeable future, as well as still run correctly on 6.x and now 7.x devices.</p>
<p>Before you get too invested in a Blackberry project, consider your end user device requirements.</p>
<p>I&#39;d love for my appcelerator projects to also port to blackberry, but last I checked it did not cover my requirements.</p>
<p>YMMV.</p>
