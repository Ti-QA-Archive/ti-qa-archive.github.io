			<h1>Why do a Titanium App look Android 2.2 on an Android 4.0?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been working on comparison project comparing PhoneGap&#x2F;jQuery Mobile vs Appcelerator Titanium.</p>
<p>From the start I&#39;ve been very excited about the speed of Titanium compared to the other… And though I experienced in stability and crashes I had high hope that Titanium was the answer for me to build a nice native UX guideline true apps for both iOS and Android in one process..</p>
<p>I started of building for Android 2.3 because that is what I had… But now my wife got an Android 4.0. Running my app on her phone I was disappointed that native UI elements doesn&#39;t look at all Android 4.0… For instance the modal date picker has Android 2.2 buttons (though) they have a darker color….</p>
<p>I thought the hole idea of Titanium compared to the other is that it uses native UI elements!?</p>
<p>So why doesn&#39;t I get a native Android 4.0 modal date picker running the app on a Android 4.0???</p>
<p>Also where are all the new fancy Android 3.0+ UI elements like an Action Bar? Searching the web I find that it&#39;s being considered for Titanium 2.2…. It was presented on Google I&#x2F;O 2010!!!</p>
<p>Is the focus of Appcelerator mainly iOS? Look for Android 4.0 widgets for Appcelerator I stumble upon http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.androiduipatterns.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;03&#x2F;multi-platform-frameworks-destroy.html . Apparently other share by disappointment with Titanium…</p>
<p>Apparently all Titanium Android apps are reimplemented with real native Android api… Can any share links for a Titanium Android apps which do follow the native UX guidelines and is good enough for the developer to wanting to share them on Google Play???</p>
<p>&#x2F;Christian</p>

							<p>It&#39;s because you didn&#39;t read Google&#39;s docs on android development. :) <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;guide&#x2F;topics&#x2F;manifest&#x2F;uses-sdk-element.html">uses-sdk</a></p>
<p>In order to get newer UI elements, you have to change your manifest so Android knows that&#39;s what you want to do.</p>

										<p><p>I confess I didn&#39;t read that doc! I was hoping Ti would take a way the hassle of reading Android (and iOS) docs :)</p>

							<p>I can&#39;t speak to the date picker, but I have not noticed that the UI in general looks so different from other native apps under android 4.0.</p>
<p>As for newer features, I think that the Appcelerator team has probably been stretched a bit thin over the past 12-18 months with things like Titanium Studio, their cloud services, mobile web support, etc.  If anything, I wish they&#39;d address bugs&#x2F;api holes in the current code rather than continuing to reach out for new platforms.  But I can certainly see why they haven&#39;t implemented an Action Bar.  I can&#39;t speak for them, but I think they&#39;re trying to cover the most commonly used components so you can build cross-platform apps that have more or less the same functionality on various platforms.  If you want to build a bad-ass, cutting-edge android app that utilizes everything in the android UI toolkit, this isn&#39;t the right tool for you.</p>
<p>The author of that blog post is not really looking deep enough at the product to make those generalizations.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure there are a lot of bad attempts at cross-platform apps with Titanium Mobile.  I would attribute that to a number of problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>lack of platform parity (there are still many parts of the API that don&#39;t work on Android, but do work on iOS; it&#39;s quite buggy and poorly documented in that regard)</p>
</li>
<li><p>a bit of an &quot;iphone first&quot; mentality within the Appcelerator organization; as an outsider, I&#39;m only guessing, but in my estimation, the docs and examples have had an iOS bias.  That&#39;s probably a holdover from years past, when that was probably justified.  Today, though, anybody who underestimates the importance of android vs. iOS is making a big mistake.</p>
</li>
<li><p>devs who build an entire app for iOS because they either think &quot;iphone first&quot; or the simulator is easier to use, and then try to port the whole thing over to android, resulting in a myriad of bugs and issues they&#39;d never considered, like building interfaces for different screen sizes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I have written native Android apps – let me tell you that most of the problems people face in writing Ti Mobile apps for android are still there if you go native – you can&#39;t get away from the fact that there are different devices with different sized screens; it makes android development more complex than iOS development.  I don&#39;t think a lot of Ti Mobile devs are prepared for that, or properly consider it in their app design&#x2F;development.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s an example of an app that we launched a couple of weeks ago for iOS and android:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.cbcnewmedia.oaa&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5jYmNuZXdtZWRpYS5vYWEiXQ..">Out &amp; About for android</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunes.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;wral-out-about&#x2F;id546058259?mt=8">Out &amp; About for iOS</a></p>
</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>BTW – any generalizations I make about the Ti Mobile development community are based on my observations in the Q&amp;A forums, where I see a lot of bad practices exposed.  I suspect there are a lot of great developers out there that we never hear from because they&#39;re too busy building great cross-platform apps… :-)</p>

										<p><p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>Your apps do look very nice and stable.. Pity I&#39;m not living in Raleigh :) </p>
<p>It&#39;s a long way from Denmark :)</p>
<p>Thanks for getting my hopes towards making a rock solid Ti Mobile app!</p>

										<p><p>Great post Jason, I concur totally</p>
<p>The &#39;iOS&#39; first mentality and the tonnes of bugs are a pain, but I don&#39;t see any hindrance for doing &#39;native&#39; feel for both iOS and android.</p>
<p>&quot;As for newer features, I think that the Appcelerator team has probably been stretched a bit thin over the past 12-18 months with things like Titanium Studio, their cloud services, mobile web support, etc. If anything, I wish they&#39;d address bugs&#x2F;api holes in the current code rather than continuing to reach out for new platforms.&quot;</p>
<p>Also the horrible build process - right now every second build on iOS fails for me. On Android things are a little better, I can do 2 or 3 successful builds before TiStudio stops launching properly. Then I have to restart studio (resetting ADB and all that does not work). But they&#39;re doing a whole new build system AFAIK - and in javascript too :)</p>

							<p>By the way, you are correct about the Action Bar not being implemented yet. Follow this JIRA ticket to get updated on when it&#39;s done: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-2371">JIRA: Action Bar</a></p>
