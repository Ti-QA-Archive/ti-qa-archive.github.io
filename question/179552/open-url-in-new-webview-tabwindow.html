			<h1>Open URL in new webview tab/window</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I am trying to get an online payment working in my app.</p>
<p>The problem is some online banking systems will open a webpage in a new tab&#x2F;window. The WebView in Titanium only works in a single instance so instead of opening a new WebView, it will proceed within the WebView. This becomes a problem as the online banking system does not allow of navigating back and will log the user out of the system (which is expected). The problem now is the user will be stuck in that temporary &quot;notice&quot; webpage and can&#39;t continue to complete the transaction.</p>
<p>I have searched for workaround for this and nothing so far. I&#39;ve learned to know that you can&#39;t do much you are dealing with remote HTML because you can&#39;t add event listeners to remote HTML.</p>
<p>I have tried to retrieve the returned HTML from the web page and detect the &quot;keywords&quot; of each webpage. However, I can&#39;t prevent the system from going to the temporary &quot;notice&quot; page and stuck in the page without being able to go back without causing error in the system.</p>
<p>I have also tried using <code>Ti.Platform.openURL</code> but the online banking system will show a navigation error since I am opening the webpage in different instance. Besides, it is not really an option for me in the beginning because everything should be handled inside the app.</p>
<p>The only way I can think of now is to find a module that allows me to run a normal browser than can open new tab&#x2F;window inside Titanium, but I haven&#39;t seen anything similar so far.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Steven</p>

							<div><p>After further testing, I found out that WebView in Android will open a new Activity just for the new web page alone. It is not exactly pretty but it works, because the Action Bar will be in the new openly Activity and there is no way to control it from the app.</p>
<p>However, I notice that the WebView in iOS is different. A new window will be treated in a single WebView instance while some other apps will open a WebView in another window. I&#39;m not sure what is exactly the reason behind this because I don&#39;t have knowledge in native iOS development but I think it is something to do with the integration of iOS UIWebView in Titanium.</p>

							<p>Hi Steven, </p>
<p>you could add a &quot;beforeload&quot; eventlistener to the webView. parse the given url, call the stopLoading method of the webview and open that url in a new Window with a Webview.</p>
<p>here is a small example:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">beforeload</span>(<span class="hljs-params">e</span>) </span>{
        <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="hljs-string">"beforeload: "</span> + <span class="hljs-built_in">JSON</span>.stringify(e));

        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (e.url == args.rootUrl) {
            <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span>;
        }
        webView.stopLoading();

        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> WebWindow = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'WebWindow'</span>);
        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> webWindow = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> WebWindow({
            rootUrl: e.url
        });
        webWindow.open();
    }

    webView.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'beforeload'</span>, beforeload);
</code></pre><p>hope this helps</p>

										<p><p>Hi Moritz,</p>
<p>I tried it but it didn&#39;t work in my case. The problem is I can&#39;t get the URL of the pressed link in the website, since the returned URL from the <code>beforeload</code> event is the URL of the displayed page, not the selected link.</p>
<p>If I put <code>stopLoading()</code> when it uses the URL from <code>beforeload</code> event, then it means whatever link selected in that webpage will not work, since the returned URL from the event will be always the currently displayed page.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Steven</p>
