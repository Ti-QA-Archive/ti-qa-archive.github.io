			<h1>Titanium Studio not recognizing that Android SDK is installed</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>When I try to run a sample hello world project, I get this error: <strong>An Android SDK is missing. Titanium requires Android platform 2.2.</strong></p>
<p>I click on the <strong>Install or Update Android SDK</strong> button, and the Android SDK Manager pops up, and spends about an hour downloading and installing a bunch of packages.  The finished result looks like the image below.  </p>
<p>But Titanium Studio doesn&#39;t recognize the install.  I still get the same error message, and if a restart Titanium Studio it simply goes through the whole process again, re-downloading everything.  I&#39;ve done this cyle 3 times now with no success.  </p>
<p>How can I get studio to recognize the android SDK?  I am using the most recent 2.0 version on win7.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Jonah</p>

							<p>If you are using windows 7 you have to rename paths in your computer properties and have the paths go there.  It is a little bit more tedious at the beginning, but well worth it once you get it up and going.  I too had the same issue, but moving real smooth.  Where as on a mac you do a one button install and you are off and coding.</p>

										<p><p>One more thought, you then have to make sure you install those in the correct paths&#x2F;directories.  Once you do that, I would go back out to Java and download JDK 1.6.0_29.  Make sure you get that specific one, and not the most up to date java file.</p>

										<p><p>Paul, I have now made all of the above changes, exactly.  I still get the same error.  Also, I corrected &#39;%ANDROID_SDK%&#x2F;platform&#39; to &#39;%ANDROID_SDK%&#x2F;platforms&#39; (plural) since that was the correct directory name.  I also tried adding &#39;platform-tools&#39; and the root %ANDROID_SDK% directory to my PATH, all to no avail.  Any other ideas?</p>

										<p><p>I think maybe also adding %ANDROID_SDK% to your PATH might help (in addition to  %ANDROID_SDK%&#x2F;tools;%ANDROID_SDK%&#x2F;platform-tools). I was getting error on winXP until I added this.</p>

							<p>Had the same Problem with titanium 3.4 and windows 7</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried so many things:</p>
<ul>
<li>reinstall titanium</li>
<li>reinstall android sdks</li>
<li>reinstall nodejs</li>
<li>setting environment paths</li>
<li>reinstall java</li>
</ul>
<p>what finally helped was removing nodejs (i had the newest version 10.32) completely (also from path) and install Titanium. Titanium then installs node version 10.13 and after that I install the android sdk and they were correctly detected by titanium.</p>

							<p>Hi Jonah,<br>Wow, I&#39;m suprised that after you added those path directories that it didn&#39;t start working.  I have done that with both of my computers and they run on Win7 as well.<br>I hate to have you give the guys a call at appcelerator, but that might be your best option at this point.<br>I know they were working on an easier install for us Win7 users.  They might have that done at this point.  Ian Howarth is a good point of contact with this problem not installing correctly.  See if you can get ahold of Ian and see what he says.  He is with appcelerator.  Just call that main 1-877-909-4589.here is Ian&#39;s email: ihowarth@appcelerator.com.  Goood Luck.  Keep me posted!</p>

							<p>To anyone out there who still has this problem.</p>
<p>I struggled with it for about two weeks. Even tried it on Ubuntu, still the very same problem. Just found a solution. Edit your USER environment variables in windows. Not system, user. Add the location to your android tools, platform and platform-tools to the PATH directory IN USER. Everything worked like a charm from then on.</p>
<p>As an addition, make sure that in your SYSTEM environment variables, specifically in PATH, you have the bin directories for node, python and java.</p>

							<p>uninstall the previous SDK files as well as the Java files and and then restart titanium.  After you have done that, go in and reinstall.  I had to do that as well.  I will get with Ian, to see if he can write a manual for windows users - he was the one that developed appcelerator.  hope that helps!</p>

							<p>just from what I was able to find out.  I don&#39;t know the exact reason, but I had an issue and talked with the head developer for the appcelerator program to get mine to work.  He just said I had to go with that - and I really didn&#39;t ask why, probably should have, but just excitied to get running and programming.  good luck!</p>
