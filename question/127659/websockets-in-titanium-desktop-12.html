			<h1>Websockets in Titanium Desktop 1.2?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>There is already a 1 year old question about this but Appcelerator didn&#39;t react on it, so I thought I bring it up again. Node.JS, Socket.IO and NowJS have made it remarkably eays to use sockets. On Windows TiDesktop is falling back to XHR-polling. Beside of connecting rather slowly XHR-polling is causing trouble with permanently changing client-IDs and handshake warnings.</p>
<p>We will see a lot of apps using websockets in the near future and with Ti Desktop web-apps are expected to work the same on the desktop as they work on the browser. To have websocket-support is just a matter of not disabling it in WebKit.</p>
<p>Before spending  a lot of time in using the in-build TCPSocket I would need to know NOW, if TiDesktop 1.2 will have websockets enabled?</p>

							<div><p>Websockets are enabled in the Mac-version of TiDesktop, so for tests I&#39;m just using my Mac mini. For some reason no one from Appcelerator can give a simple yes or no if websockets will be enabled in TiDesktop 1.2 for Windows too!? If yes you simply have to wait, but they don&#39;t have a timeline for the next GA release. Of course all this is open source: If you are an experienced C++&#x2F;Python-developer you can make your own version. As far as I know enabling websockets is just an option when compiling WebKit.</p>
<p>For now I just see 2 possibilities here: Always check the latest version of SocketIO and hope it overcomes the flaws coming with falling back to polling. Or: Give your Windows-version a special treatment and dive into Socket.IO. It should be possible to add a transport using the native TiDesktop-sockets.</p>

<p>In the future we plan to swap out the webkit with Chromium Embedded on desktop, and when that happens we will move node.js into desktop at that time.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, I&#39;ve seen this. What I don&#39;t see is how this prevents me from having to rewrite TCP-connection-functionality for TiDesktop. In NowJS you call serverside functions as if they were clientside and the other way round. I don&#39;t want this to work completely different in TiDesktop. Having Node.JS clientside doesn&#39;t help here. I just would like to know if in the next release of TiDesktop WebSockets are working?</p>
