			<h1>View containing a ScrollableView containing buttons</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>So, I  have a View (&quot;categories&quot;), which containes 2 ImageViews (for more left and more right images), and a ScrollableView with 2 views containing 3 buttons each. Each of the buttons is for a &quot;category&quot;. This is all created in a &quot;utils,js&quot; file, which is included in every other javascript file in the project.</p>
<p>So, on the main window have Tabs on the top. Each Tab has a window associated with it, calling its own javascript file. The &quot;categories&quot; view is created on every page, and in the respective Javascript file, there is a &quot;categories.addEventListener(…) method added, to load the respective data for the selected Category.</p>
<p>So, the problem is that somehow, when I click on a particular category or change it, the event listener is not triggered, though the &quot;selected Category&quot; index is updated. </p>
<p>The categories.addEventListener(…) is called only when I click on the More Right and More Left images. </p>
<p>I tried recreating the views in different ways, but still the same result. Is it because the buttons are not on the Categories View directly? This same code works in iOS.</p>
<p>Can someone help me or give me a hint, please? I can post code if needed.</p>
<p>Sri</p>

							<div><p>I think some code would be helpful. Use gitpaste or something similar.</p>
<p>Also think about using namespaces to save having to include a file everywhere, just to use a common function.</p>

							<div><p>I got it to work. The code in the pastie.</p>
<p>The &quot;bottom:0&quot; for the views is the trick. </p>
<p>Also, on the calling page, the view had a top:30, which was causing a band of height 30, above the data view, which made me this that it was this. </p>
<p>The third thing that did it was - on the calling page, add the data view first and then the categories. Earlier, I was adding categories first and then the data view, so even after you change bottom:0, you still cant see the categories, as the data view covers them. I could figure this out only when I gave different colors to the windows and views.</p>
<p>Hope this helps someone!</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Sri</p>
