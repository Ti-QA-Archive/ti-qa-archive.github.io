			<h1>POST method in the httpClient object appends POST data of all the previous requests.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Since we can&#39;t save all the cookies in the android devices – &quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;49401&#x2F;cookies-problem&quot;, I am using the same httpClient object for multiple POST method call on the server so that I don&#39;t loose the session cookies.</p>
<p>The problem that I am facing now is that if I use the same httpClient object for multiple requests it keeps on appending POST data of all the previous POST requests. Therefore, I end up POSTing the parameters that are not supported by server and subsequently the request is rejected.</p>
<p>Is there is work around for this?</p>

							<p>I would be careful reusing the same object as I&#39;ve had all kinds of problems including the response data being corrupted or unusable when downloading files. </p>
<p>Sessions are so 2008. Use token authentication and rid yourself of this beast. What I&#39;ve done is to receive a token for authentication after login, and re-use that token. You can do it one way for further security (every successful request generates and passed back a new token and old ones are invalid). </p>
<p>Using token auth would eliminate the need for sessions, but perhaps you&#39;re stuck with sessions. In that case, I&#39;d try to &#39;initialize&#39; your HTTP request object each time, like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>run &#39;abort&#39; on the request before you start a new one, for starters.</li>
<li>Try doing something like changing the mode to &#39;GET&#39; and sending a dummy request and then redoing it. </li>
<li>Use a newly instantiated string object for each set of POST data, in other words, if you used variable foo = &quot;my post data&quot;; and then send using foo, try making a new variable bar = &quot;new post data&quot;; and send using that. </li>
</ol>
<p>If none of that works I&#39;m out of answers.</p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t have the control on the server side, so, yes I am stuck with the sessions and cookies. I was already running multiple GET in between POSTs, although not dummy. I tried to run &#39;abort&#39; before running the next POST but same results. I can&#39;t use different variable names since, again, I don&#39;t have control on the server. Looks like I am running out of options. If you can think of any other work around, it would be greatly helpful. Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>I was more talking about your code using different variables for post data. Example:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">count =<span class="hljs-number">0</span>; // global
myPostDataArray = <span class="hljs-string">[]</span>; // global

var myFunction = function(newData)
{
var xhr = Ti.Network.createHTTPClient();

var newPostString = newData.postStr // or however you're building this

myPostDataArray<span class="hljs-string">[count]</span> = newPostString;

xhr.open(<span class="hljs-string">"<span class="hljs-keyword">POST</span>"</span>,myPostDataArray<span class="hljs-string">[count]</span>);
xhr.send();

count++;
}
</code></pre><p>So this way you are creating a new reference to a brand new variable whenever you are re-using the HTTP Client, you are NOT re-using the same variable reference. I&#39;m not sure if this will work, just a suggestion</p>

										<p><p>I am doing something like following:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">client.open(<span class="hljs-string">"<span class="hljs-keyword">POST</span>"</span>, URL1);
// client header setting/re-setting
client.send(params1);

...

client.open(<span class="hljs-string">"<span class="hljs-keyword">POST</span>"</span>, URL2);
// client header setting/re-setting
client.send(params2);
</code></pre><p>Each time the param variable is entirely new. But http proxy shows that parameters in the second call to POST contains the all the previous parameter i.e. param2 on the wire goes like param1 + param2. So, I guess your previous suggestion won&#39;t work. Unlucky me.</p>

										<p><p>Yeah basically you already doing my suggestion. Sorry that didn&#39;t help. This is a pretty tough problem since it&#39;s a known issue with Titanium.</p>
<p>What about trying to work around the backend problem? Does the backend support user&#x2F;password authentication on every request? In other words can you send full auth information with each request just like the first one and get what you re are looking for?</p>

										<p><p>Well, I thought about that but the problem is that the login too is performed using the POST call, so, even if I do the login each time, the login credentials would also be passed each time. Fortunately, the login parameters currently don&#39;t clash with the subsequent parameters. I am currently working on it even though it&#39;s highly, highly inefficient.</p>
