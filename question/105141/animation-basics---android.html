			<h1>Animation Basics - Android</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been playing with code and reviewing the Tweetanium code and am a bit confused on animations for Android.  Specifically I&#39;m looking to do some basic sliding in and out of windows and views.</p>
<p>In the Tweetanium code I see a lot of <code>view.animate()</code> calls.  However I don&#39;t see any definition of what the animation is.  The docs on animation talk alot about 2d&#x2F;3rd matrices and transforms, but I don&#39;t see that in the Tweetanium code so I&#39;m having some trouble putting the picture together.</p>
<p>Also I&#39;m having trouble understanding when I can&#x2F;should call animations.  My simplest example is where I have an event that should open a new window that I&#39;d like to &quot;slide in&quot; - I tried the following code - no luck.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">newwin = <span class="hljs-type">Titanium</span>.<span class="hljs-type">UI</span>.createWindow({
    url:<span class="hljs-symbol">'placepage</span>.js',
    title:e.rowData.title,
});    
<span class="hljs-type">Titanium</span>.<span class="hljs-type">UI</span>.currentTab.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>(newwin,{animated:<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>});
</code></pre><p>Any docs, samples or guidance is appreciated.</p>

<p>Have you seen the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;animations_in_action.html">Animations in Action</a> guide, which is pretty cool. Download the code from the link at the end of the guide and run it to see what it looks like (and how well it works) before you try to understand it. The reason is that, in the past, Titanium&#39;s Android support for animations has lagged behind iOS, so some animations would not work. That said, there have been a lot of enhancements in that area lately, so try it with the 1.6 branch of the latest <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;continuous_builds.html">Continuous Build</a> first before trying 1.5.X.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>I appreciate the link (I hadn&#39;t seen it), but it seems to be jumping to more advanced animations where I&#39;m looking to understand better simple window to window animations.  At a minimum I&#39;m trying to understand how the Tweetanium code seems to just work.</p>

										<p><p>I think you are referring to basic window transitions. This simply requires that you set the &#39;animated&#39; property to true when you open it. See <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;ui_design.html#animation">Animation</a> in the &quot;Designing the User Interface&quot; guide, and <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;en&#x2F;ui_design.html#window_animation">Window animation</a> in particular. As I said before, there may be limited android support for this right now.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks - I guess that&#39;s part of the confusion I dont know what is supposed to work vs. what isn&#39;t so I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m doing something wrong.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ve poked around with KS - first, the animations are all hidden for Android. I enabled them as to test.  While some animation works nothing related to transitions or window animation seems to work.  I may continue building the app w&#x2F;o animations and maybe by then 1.6 will be out with better support.</p>
