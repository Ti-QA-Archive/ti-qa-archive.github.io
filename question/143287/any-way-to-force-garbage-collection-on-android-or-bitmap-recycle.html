			<h1>Any way to &#34;force&#34; Garbage Collection on Android, or Bitmap recycle?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m using a lot of high-res images in my Android app (with custom tabs, different view for each), including one tab for remote Instagram photos.  I notice that most of the time, my app will function fine, but there are times when it doesn&#39;t garbage collect before going to another tab (I&#39;ve tried the setTimeouts, and they work to a certain extent) it will crash OR only display some of the images. </p>
<p>If my app doesn&#39;t crash due to memory, and only some of the images are showing, if I switch tabs (which will free up memory from previous view, and reallocate another view),and then go back to it, all of the images will display.  </p>
<p>So, I&#39;m wondering is there a way I can force GC in Titanium, or at least &quot;bitmap recycle&quot; on Android.</p>

							<div><p>Are you nulling out variables?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve recently rewritten one of my apps as commonjs single context app and have a create shutdown() prototype, that I call on tab change or window destruction to cause GC, but removing all event listeners, removing all objects from views and then nulling out all objects.</p>

							<div><p>Thanks guys.  Yeah I am…  I even downloaded a module to get it to GC native…  </p>
<p>I talked to one of the Android developers at Codestrong this year, and he said there&#39;s 2 GC&#39;s – one native, and one for V8, and sometimes the V8 one can be slow…  that&#39;s what I was experiencing, I think.</p>

							<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I would like to recommend to you a module that I have recently published that calls the native java garbage collection:</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;7916?restoreSearch=true</p>
<p>It will not explicitly clean bitmap object but will clear what java allows it.</p>
<p>I use this technique quite a lot in my apps.</p>
<p>hope that helps :)</p>
