			<h1>Getting a bug fixed with Titanium Professional?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I reported a very annoying bug (the endless spinning activity indicator) in Ti Mobile, but I see that it isn’t even planned for the near future to be solved.</p>
<p>If I sign up to Titanium Professional, do I get that bug earlier fixed? Normally I do not need any support, but I need a faster reaction on surely small, but annoying bugs.</p>
<p>Appcelerator, thanks for the information!</p>
<p>P.S.: Here is the Lighthouse ticket:</p>

							<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;plans-pricing&#x2F;">You can check out our pricing&#x2F;plans for what you get with each subscription</a>, but the Enterprise plan is the only plan with guaranteed critical issue resolution.  That said, tickets going through the premium support helpdesk do, informally, tend to get processed sooner simply because our support engineers will triage the issue and make sure developers are aware of the problem.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve updated the ticket with the tags we usually use for routing and sorting purposes.  Also, if you can attach a test case which reproduces the issue, the developers are more likely to pick it off the stack and work on it if they have time, since they don&#39;t have to do the extra leg work to reproduce the problem.  Thanks for the report, and we&#39;ll try and get to it ASAP.</p>

<p>I cannot comment on behalf of Appcelerator, but while I can empathise with your frustration, I can also see it from the developers&#39; perspective. While the activity indicator is a trivial part of titanium&#39;s functionality, and hence appears to be a &quot;small&quot; bug, this does not necessarily translate precisely to a small fix.</p>
<p>There have been tickets describing &quot;small&quot; bugs that have caused me problems too, and I would like them prioritised ahead of your spinning activity bug. How shall you and I resolve this between us?</p>
<p>It&#39;s unfortunate but, as an order of priorities is unavoidable, some will inherently fall lower in that queue than others. The important thing is to ensure that the critical bugs affecting the most people are being dealt with near the top of the queue.  I can see from your activity indicator ticket that only two people are interested enough in its fix to watch it.</p>
<p>While personally this would be my approach to deciding the order of importance, there is also some logic in Appcelerator&#39;s paying customers taking priority. With Appcerlator&#39;s current pricing plan, it is likely that their customers will either be relatively high-profile in themselves, or be working on high-profile projects. Both of these could arguably help the product gain traction, and in the long run this increased business could fund more developers and faster development.</p>
<p>Again, I can sympathise, but I&#39;m afraid I feel it&#39;s just an inherent issue of product development in general.</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s why I asked. I just need a statement by Appcelerator if it&#39;s possible to get bugs sooner fixed as a paying user.</p>

										<p><p>Good point! ;) It&#39;s good that you brought the subject up, because I wasn&#39;t aware of Appcel&#39;s internal process, and hence I read Kevin&#39;s subsequent reply with interest.</p>
