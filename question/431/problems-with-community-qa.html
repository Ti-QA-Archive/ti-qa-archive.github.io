			<p>Hi,<br>I just noticed that the Community Forum seems to only list 20 items and is not displaying the latest posts at all.<br>For example, there&#39;s a question about Bluetooth (found using the tags) that is newer than the 20 posts that I have listed but does not show up in lists at all.<br>The unanswered list is also not returning results.<br>Regards<br>Mark</p>

							<p>i agree.<br>this q&amp;a should look more like the old support forum. each question is taking up far to much room on the screen, there&#39;s no real need for an excerpt of the question, the title is sufficient.</p>
<p>you&#39;re right about the votes, apparently 1 + 1 = 1 ;)</p>

							<p>this is really bugging me now.<br>it seems almost impossible to find answers now. you can&#39;t bump your own question. if you get an answer then it by the time you try it out and if it doesn&#39;t work your question is on page 10 and there is no return!</p>
<p>the ironic thing is, the thread explaining the problem will never be read because of the problem :(</p>

							<p>Hi Sam,</p>
<p>Whilst it may be a little frustrating to navigate this forum it does keep the Titanium community in one place. I&#39;ve used other forums where users have decided to create their own offshoot … it becomes even more frustrating because now there are more places to look for answers.</p>
<p>Whilst the idea of a separate forum may at first seem a good idea (I&#39;d considered it myself), it will only serve to split the community and make it even more difficult for users of Titanium to get the answers they are looking for.</p>
<p>The guys at Appcelerator are very unlikely to have the time to provide support on anything other than their own forum. And personally, I wouldn&#39;t expect them to. They have worked hard to get where they are now to bring the Titanium platform to us, to build their own community of users and provide answers on this forum.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Mark</p>
