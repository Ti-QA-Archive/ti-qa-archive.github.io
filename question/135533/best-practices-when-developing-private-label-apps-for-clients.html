			<h1>Best practices when developing private label apps for clients?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Boss man wants to develop an app for multiple clients. We will basically update the tiapp file for each client so it has custom bundleid, app name, icons, splash screens, in addition to having a couple clients wanting some extra stuff added from time-to-time. In an effort to keep from jumping out a window out of frustration while managing all theses private label apps I have been trying to come up with a plan on how to manage them in Titanium.</p>
<p>At this point I&#39;m thinking of building the Master app, the core, then creating a repository, pulling that down into projects, importing the project into Titanium on a per client bases, then making the wanted changes, compiling and submitting it to the App store. That way the customers always get custom build if they want and I get to not have to do hundreds of the same updates to each and every clients copy when we make a change to the core product.</p>
<p>Sounds good or have a better idea?</p>

							<p>Levi,  thats essentially what we have.  One master code base that is sent up to a repository via git.  Each client then is a fork of that project.  We have a clientconfig.js file that holds most of the client customizations in it. Using a modularized code structure and commonjs, we can load different modules depending on the client&#39;s needs.  I think you are headed in the right direction.</p>
