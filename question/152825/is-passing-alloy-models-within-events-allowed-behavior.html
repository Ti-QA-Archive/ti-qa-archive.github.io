		<section>
			<p>Hi all-</p>
<p>I am curious…is it valid to pass a model between to controllers via an event?  I am doing the following:</p>
<p>I have two views&#x2F;controllers, one which sets up a form where the user can generate the input needed for a model.  The second is a &quot;preview&quot;, which allows the user to verify the input of the model prior to sending the model to the server to be saved.  I perform a flip animation between the two views.</p>
<p>Now, I know the model is generated correctly, and I have validated this.  When attempting to preview the user request I do the following:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">function</span> <span class="hljs-tag">preview</span>() {
  <span class="hljs-tag">if</span> (userModel.<span class="hljs-function">isValid</span>())
    <span class="hljs-tag">Ti</span><span class="hljs-class">.App</span><span class="hljs-class">.fireEvent</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'previewInput'</span>, {
        <span class="hljs-attribute">userModel</span>:  userModel
    }
}
</code></pre><p>…within my preview view then, I have a listener to capture the model, and setup a view to allow the user to preview the information, and process the information if desired, or return to the input form, as such:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">previewEvt</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{

  userModel = e.userModel;

  <span class="hljs-comment">// HERE IS THE ISSUE</span>

}

Ti.App.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'previewInput'</span>, previewEvt);
</code></pre><p>What I am finding is that the data itself passes correctly within the event, but the models methods are all lost within the event, so if I attempt to perform a userModel.get(&#39;value&#39;), or userModel.has(&#39;value&#39;), or any other valid Backbone&#39;esque model methods, they fail.  Under the debugger, I do see that the model, with all of my data has passed through, and in my attributes, I see that the attributes come through, but no methods.</p>
<p>Am I allowed to pass a model within an event?  If not, how can I pass a model between a view and access my model&#39;s methods&#x2F;data?  </p>
<p>Thanks for any help<br>Chris</p>

							<p>No, event days must be JSON serializable, which obviously functions are not. You can pass the attributes of the model with the toJSON() function.</p>

										<p><p>Cool…and like I mentioned, I did see the (and have passed regular JSON serializable objects) with events in the past, and that does work successfully.</p>
<p>Is there a suggested way to share a model between controllers?  Put it in the Global space?  I didn&#39;t want to cloud my Global space to much with a model I am eventually going to destroy as I destroy this controller.  At the end, I wanted access to the attribs, but the functionality as well..</p>
<p>Thanks again<br>Chris</p>

										<p><p>I would pass the attributes via toJSON() and then hydrate a fresh model in the handler.</p>

										<p><p>Totally would work.  I wasn&#39;t sure if there was another means to pass the model, but I can definitely hydrate the new model….no prob.</p>
<p>Talk soon</p>
