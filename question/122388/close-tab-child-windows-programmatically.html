			<h1>Close tab child windows programmatically</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I need to close any currently open child windows of a tab (tab1) while a different tab (tab2) is active.</p>
<p>There are various threads about this out there that suggest to maintain your own stack of tab child windows:</p>
<ul>
<li>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;nwu4k9</li>
<li>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;pb525C</li>
</ul>
<p>The docs state that a Ti.UI.Tab maintains a stack of tab windows. However, it does not seem to be possible to actually access this stack, but rather, you have to maintain it on your own. Seems a bit backwards.</p>
<p>The reason I need this is that one tab in my app displays a tableview of records in a database. Each record is clickable and opens a child window. In some cases the detail offers more drill-downs.</p>
<p>A second tab lets the user pull a new version of the database from the backend, which might invalidate some or all of the child windows. Even if I refresh the table view in the root window, any child windows that the user has drilled down into remain open and show potentially stale data.</p>
<p>My concern is that it would be possible for the user to return to the search tab (tab1) that is displaying a child window and request additional details that actually no longer exists in the db, which would then most likely lead to unexpected behavior or potentially a crash.</p>
<p>What is the best way to programmatically back out of all child windows and make the root window the current window?</p>

							<p>It sounds like this would happen because when you open your results window, you can still see the tabs of your tabgroup. Try opening your results window full screen and providing a close button. This way, they can drill down as far as they&#39;d like via your provided windows or navgroups but still have to return to the results window to close or hide it before making the tabs available again.</p>

										<p><p>Anthony, thanks for the suggestion. This would definitely work, but does not fit with the application UI design. I do not want to force the user to perform extra clicks (close one or more windows) before he can access a different tab. It seems unnecessarily disruptive to the work flow. The intention is that all tabs are accessible at all times.</p>
<p>Like I said, it would &quot;solve&quot; (work around) my technical problem, but at the expense of user experience. I would rather solve my technical problem by simply backing the user down to the root window if that is what is needed for maintaining data integrity.</p>

										<p><p>I understand what you are saying, and it seems that it is your UX flow that is backward to your data flow, not the way that the Titanium UI handles your display stack. </p>
<p>So like you&#39;ve probably already read, the best way to workaround your issue would be to handle the stack yourself. This wasn&#39;t my first answer because it sounded as though you wanted a built in method for handling this, but to work with your existing flow, you&#39;d have to push your child windows onto an array as you open them, then shift them off as you close them. On the blur event of the tab that contains those children, flip through the array closing any existing windows or views that are open.</p>
<p>Your second option is to create a window outside of your tabgroup, and adding any new windows to that. When you want to switch or remove all of the added windows, just close the one window outside of the tabgroup and everything else will close with it.</p>
<p>So, while they may not be a native way to do what you want, they are 2 different ways to handle your issue, both fairly simple in design and execution.</p>

										<p><p>Anthony, thanks for getting back to me. I just needed to confirm that it is indeed not possible to simply grab the internal stack of a tab. And maybe you are right in the fact that my UX flow should be different - will think that one over.</p>
<p>Since posting this I have been working on implementing my own stack and have run into a rather strange issue:</p>
<p>When I create the tab I also create an empty array and add it as a property of the tab so it lives for the duration of the tabs life. I then pass the array as a parameter to each of the child window creation functions where I push the window instance onto the array.</p>
<p>However, it seems as if the array is immutable because after the push operation the array length is still 0.<br>If I push a test object onto the array right after creating the array the size is 1.</p>
<p>Is it not possible to add properties to native UI objects?</p>

										<p><p>This is possible, however you&#39;d have to attach that custom variable to the window which is attached to the tab, not that actual tab itself, ie:<br><code>var win1 = Ti.UI.createWindow({stack:[]});</code><br>(I belive you can see an example of this in the KS demo). Though this may prove to be a bit cumbersome the way you are doing it. I&#39;d suggest rather than passing that array around, you create a function that responds to an app level event listener to handle the stack. You can still attach that custom variable to the tab window if you like, or you can create a global variable as well, but you dont have to pass it around, you can simply fire off a custom event that says push or shift that stack and handle accordingly. This will create a level of abstraction that is simply and easily controlled by you.</p>
