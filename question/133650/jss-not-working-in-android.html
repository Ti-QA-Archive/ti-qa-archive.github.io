			<h1>JSS Not working in Android</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi guys, I have been trying to get my JSS Styling to work, but for whatever reason I cannot get it to work. I have tried using class Names (className: tag) and I have tried to get the styling to work using the id.  I am developing an Android Application using the latest Titanium Build (Version 1.8.2).  I am testing on Windows using the Android emulator.</p>
<p>I have tried creating a file called app.js, with no luck. I have tried creating files called &#39;app.android.jss&#39;&#x2F;&#39;app.iphone.jss&#39; all with no luck.  But both of these files seem to be being ignored.  Should I be using a require tag in the app.js?</p>
<p>I am very familiar with CSS, so I thought that this would be a simple approach, but I even find variation in the selectors that I see.  Sometimes in the Q&amp;A it seems to be the same as standard CSS (font-weight:bold), but other times I see that the following selector is used (fontWeight:&#39;bold&#39;) - which is correct?</p>
<p>Is there more detailed documentation for JSS Styling?</p>

							<p>There doesn&#39;t seem to be any information for JSS styling - it seems to be very much a work in progress feature at the moment.</p>
<p>What I have discovered is that className and class-based styling doesn&#39;t work, but Id-based styling does. For me, that doesn&#39;t make it much use!  Although it all sounds like a fantastic idea to use JSS, I would avoid it and figure out a different method for styling your objects.</p>

							<p>I know this is an old thread, but one thing I noticed when using JSS is that for iOS it didn&#39;t seem to matter whether I called my file app.jss or global.jss, both worked, but for Android only global.jss worked in my project. The styles just weren&#39;t picked up by Android when my jss file was app.jss even though my bootstrap file was app.js, and it didn&#39;t matter whether I used names or id&#39;s.</p>
