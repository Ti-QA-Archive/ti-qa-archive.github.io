			<h1>Cleaning up Modal Windows with Navigation Groups in Alloy Applications</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all-</p>
<p>I have an application which launches a modal window.  This modal window contains a form, and within the form, I have a NavigationGroup which a user can navigate between fields to select multiselect options within other views.  The form also contains a cancel button, and the onClick handler performs the following:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">$<span class="hljs-class">.myForm</span><span class="hljs-class">.close</span>()
</code></pre><p>Here is the question…since the modal, and children windows of the NavigationGroup, contain eventlisteners, windows, models, etc, how much cleanup is necessary to do manually, or does closing the modal window close all children of the modal, inclusive of listeners?  If not, would is there a suggested way on a close to traverse windows and unsubscribe from listeners, close children windows of a NavigationGroup?</p>
<p>I noticed that the form essentially creates a new model, and on launching the form multiple times, after close, the former listeners are in fact still hanging around and not closed from simply closing the modal window parent.  I had presumed closing a parent closed children of that parent incorrectly, so just looking for best practices here on cleaning up windows and children&#x2F;handlers from a window so I don&#39;t spin out of control with memory leaks.</p>
<p>Thanks for any guidance.<br>Chris</p>

										<p><p>Very…I am assuming this goes for events as well then.  This makes sense.  I open my modal as an event handler in a menu…but since that is not out of scope, that modal would still be scoped and referenced, and never released from memory.</p>
