			<p>How do I run an app in Titanium Studio (in the emulator or simulator) and only get the INFO, instead of the DEBUG mode stuff.</p>
<p>I have an event firing every few seconds, which makes it difficult to read along with the logs. I tried creating a custom run config with the log level set to INFO and I&#39;m still getting back all of the DEBUG log level data.</p>
<p>Ideas?</p>

							<p>I asked this very question during the Titanium Webcast. The answer was &quot;If you use the debugger, the console in Ti Studio only shows what your app logs.&quot;<br>Personally, I have not purchased the Indie developer and find it ridiculous I would have to have it to filter out debug info. I asked a followup question for those of us that didn&#39;t purchase the India plan and could not use the debugger, but they never answered it.</p>
<p>I believe this is one of the things that was not thought of when they created Ti Studio, or at least before someone decided to charge before debugging. So personally, I&#39;m still running the old Titanium Developer.</p>

							<p>Hi Alex.</p>
<p>Have you tried Dalvik Debug Monitor? In it you can create filters and filter out all unnecessary data.</p>
<p>It&#39;s located under &quot;android-sdk&#x2F;tools&#x2F;ddms.bat&quot; on Windows XP. After you run it, you can easily create filter (green &quot;+&quot;) by log tag (&quot;TiAPI&quot;). Now you&#39;ll have only output that is printed from your application. Additionally, you can filter by log level (INFO, DEBUG, …).</p>

							<p>In Ti Studio you should right click the main Project name in the project explorer. This will give you a menu that should have a <strong>Properties</strong> option at the bottom.</p>
<p>Select this option should show you a Properties dialog. You should select the <strong>Run&#x2F;Debug Settings</strong> option from the list show. This will show you ALL the currently set up run settings for all the projects (don&#39;t know why this is).</p>
<p>But anyway, select the option that applies to your project, probably something like</p>
<p><strong>Titanium iPhone Simulator - {projectname}</strong></p>
<p>You can now select the <strong>edit</strong> button , select the <strong>Log Level</strong> you want (on the <strong>Main</strong> tab) and click apply.</p>
<p>The next time you run your project it should use the new settings.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
