			<h1>To Appcelerate or not?!</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi<br>I am pondering over whether to use Appcelerator for the apps we are planning(iOS and Android) or to find contractors to get it done. What is your suggestion if you have experience with Titanium? Can I develop an app by myself in Titanium with minimal coding required? Or will I need a lot of coding even for a simple app? I have checked out the Kitchen Sink and saw the &quot;templates&quot; or &quot;samples&quot; we can use. But what more work is required?</p>
<p>Update: Since a couple of people have asked for more info on what I plan to make. Being vague about it… A simple app is let us say a &quot;to-do&quot; list app (not what i have in mind) or an app that shows data that the user needs with links to relevant data (like a mini browser, only it shows relevant data and not just browsing).</p>

							<div><p>Just depends on how good you are.  If you know javascript and a little CSS you&#39;ll be fine.</p>
<p>Keep in mind though that you&#39;re not going to be developing an Angry Birds with it.  And Android is horrible</p>

							<p>You asked: &quot;Can I develop an app by myself in Titanium with minimal coding required? Or will I need a lot of coding even for a simple app?&quot;</p>
<p>I think the problem with the question is the vagueness of &quot;simple app&quot; and &quot;minimal coding&quot;.  What is &quot;simple&quot; to an experienced developer may be worlds apart from somebody with little experience on other platforms.  Ditto for interpreting &quot;minimal coding&quot;.</p>
<p>Titanium is NOT a graphical designer where you drop widgets in an IDE and select some macro or action from a predefined list.  There <em>will be</em> coding involved.  But is it &quot;simple&quot; and &quot;minimal&quot;?  That&#39;s in the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p>YMMV.</p>

							<p>It&#39;s all dependent on the complexity of your app. You haven&#39;t really provided any detail other than &#39;I need an app&#39; which isn&#39;t much to go on. </p>

							<p>I&#39;ve worked for half a year with Titanium and am quite impressed what can be done in a short time. But still, you should give an example of what you&#39;re going to build?</p>

							<p>it&#39;s hard to say in such general terms. i have spent a lot of time finding out what i needed to do to solve problems. forum posts, digging through the docs, etc. Ti is still very new, and they (and we) are still working lots of kinks out. i can honestly say i just released my first full featured app built with TiStudio. it took me about 3 months to design, code, test, debug, and release. <em>IMHO</em> Ti is ready for real world use, but they (the devs) need to keep it going and keep making it better.</p>
