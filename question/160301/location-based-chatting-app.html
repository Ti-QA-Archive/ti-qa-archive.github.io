							<p>The simplest way to do this is NOT TO DO IT.<br>It&#39;s obviously that once you are asking for code snippets you don&#39;t really wanna do this, but somebody else to work for you.</p>

										<p><p>The way you started suggests exactly this. You need first to know what your app does, then split it coponents and each component split it in small modules.<br>Something like this:</p>
<p><strong>Geolocation chat app.</strong></p>
<p>This will need a <strong>central server</strong> and <strong>the mobile clients</strong> (the app itself).</p>
<p><strong>The mobile client</strong> will need a way to detect the <strong>location</strong>, to <strong>identify itself</strong> (what user it&#39;s using it) and to <strong>communicate with the server</strong></p>
<p><strong>the location</strong>-  <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Geolocation">solution </a></p>
<p><strong>identify itself</strong> -  this needs to be splited even more - login, sign in, logout, the UI of this forms and the communication with the server, etc</p>
<p><strong>communication with the server</strong> - <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Network.HTTPClient">solution</a></p>
<p>etc…</p>
<p>So as you see, if you split your idea in small bits, you will find yourself what you need to do and even pretty easy. Then your problems will be very specific and you will be able to ask very clear questions but of course only after you tried yourself to fix it.</p>
<p>So DON&#39;T ask for code, DON&#39;T ask for ready made solutions, but ask HOW your problem can be solved AFTER you tried yourself and SAYING what you tried to do.</p>
