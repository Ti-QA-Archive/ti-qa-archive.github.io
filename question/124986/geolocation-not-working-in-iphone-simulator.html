			<h1>Geolocation not working in iPhone simulator</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi. The app I was developing, which utilises geolocation, was working fine. I then upgraded to the latest version of Titanium (1.7.2) and now I cannot get geolocation working when testing on the app but it works fine if I install it on my iPhone - in addition, it doesn&#39;t work in the KitchenSink example now as well (says that GPS needs to be enabled in the settings). I&#39;m building for version 4 of iPhone and to be clear, I didn&#39;t change my code - one day it was working, then I upgraded and the geolocation was disabled and unable to be used on the simulator.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried deleting the project and rebuilding but it doesn&#39;t make a difference. Help please?</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

							<p>If you are running Xcode 4.1 and are using OSX Lion, this is a known issue for Apple. This is an issue for all devs using iOS native, Titanium, or otherwise.</p>

										<p><p>At the moment I recommend using an if statement checking if your using the simulator, and if so use a hardcoded location like so:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">if</span>(Ti.Platform.model == <span class="hljs-string">'iPhone Simulator'</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">// fake location</span>
} <span class="hljs-tag">else</span> {

							<p>Hi. Yes it is enabled but there is no apps listed underneath (and I thought apps that recently requested a location would appear here).</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ve also just tried uninstalling and reinstalling Titanium Studio and the same thing happens. There is no error message, it just says that I need to enable the geolocation functionality - it always returns false when I use this method Ti.Geolocation.locationServicesEnabled.</p>

										<p><p>Just checking here… Did you download from the mac app store? because if so you still need to install it. Also, it must be installed to the default install location, not as a second install. I am just checking as this catches a lot of people…</p>

										<p><p>As Matt said, installing Xcode update from the app-Store does not install the update, it just downloads the installer app. You have to look for &quot;install xcode.app&quot; in your application directory an then run it manually.</p>
