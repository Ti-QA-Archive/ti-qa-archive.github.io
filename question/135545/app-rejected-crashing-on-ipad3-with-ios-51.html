			<h1>App Rejected, Crashing on iPad3 with iOS 5.1</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am trying to submit my app to the Apple App Store, however I keep getting rejected as they say my app is crashing on launch on iPad3 running iOS5.1 (it is an iPhone app). I have loaded my app successfully to the iPad3 simulator as well as an iPad3 device and cannot reproduce the error. </p>
<p>The app is built on Titanium SDK 1.8.2.</p>
<p>Below is the symbolicated crash log. Any help would be much appreciated as I am completely stumped.</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve had a rejection similar to this where the app was stuck on the splash screen.  To reproduce it I opened the project in Xcode and ran it in the simulator and saw the same behaviour that the reviewer reported.   </p>
<p>I had to clean the build directory and rebuild the project.  Then opened it up in Xcode and verified that actually ran.  Once I resubmitted it the app was approved.</p>

										<p><p>I have run the build from Xcode and have not incurred any crashes. Can you elaborate on what your build settings were within the Xcode environment to duplicate Apple&#39;s issue?</p>
