			<h1>Background service stop running.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi All,<br>Basically I am building application which report location to server every 5 mins  as well as on distance changed by 300 meters. To send location on every 5 mins I am creating background service with interval of 5 minutes and it working perfectly fine when my application in foreground or even after certain time duration once application goes in background.  But in case I start any other application in parallel which required some memory (like game) my background service stop sending location information. When I check running application in Android &gt;&gt; Setting &gt;&gt; Running application stat it show 1 service and 0 processes Restarting.. After certain time my process restarted and background service start reporting location.</p>
<p>I have this issue with Android only since on iPhone I can run application in background just setting one property in plist. Is there anyway even process go in restarting stage still my background service keep running or any other solution? I know some of application where geolocation keep running or media player keep playing song even other application running.</p>
<p>I appreciate your help.</p>
<p>Thanks<br>Pritesh</p>

							<div><p>Pritesh,</p>
<p>That&#39;s the behavior of Android and nothing can be done in Titanium to prevent it. Also, creating service in Titanium is not that good as it is only a interval service and not that reliable as Android native service.</p>
<p>What i would suggest is to create a service in a Titanium module and call your Titanium service from the module service, this will improve the behavior but would not guarantee that your service will not be killed by Android.</p>
<p>I hope this helps</p>
