			<h1>App uses Development phase in titanium cloud</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am making use of ACS. Now i want my app to use the production phase but it seems to use the development side always. I have set <code>Cloud.debug=false</code> but with no success. I am running it on a real device. Tried indirectly running the build too.</p>

<p>You mean no success, other than turning off debugging?  I mean, thats what that command is for.  Its not like its <code>Cloud.enableProduction = true</code> or anything.</p>

<p>So put in your production keys, and make a production build.  In your &#39;&#39;question&quot; you haven&#39;t mentioned any of the steps you have taken that have failed, well, other than the <code>debug=false</code> thing which obviously makes no kind of sense.</p>

										<p><p>As Stephen implies, you&#39;ll start using the production environment once you do a production build (build for the iTunes App Store or Google Play Market). In any other build type (simulator&#x2F;emulator, device, etc.) you&#39;ll use the development environment.</p>

										<p><p>ok both my keys development as well as production are present in tiapp.xml so wanted to know whether there is any way in code that we could differentiate between these two?<br>So what you are suggesting is just keep one set of keys development or production? is it?</p>
