			<h1>New apps created in studio does not show up at my apps at appcelerator.com</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve logged into titanium studio with my appcelerator account.</p>
<p>If i create a new app in studio, the app does not show up in https:&#x2F;&#x2F;my.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps<br>This causes validation errors for purchased modules etc, since the app is probably not registered at appcelerator!?</p>
<p>Now, if we click the button enable cloud in studio for the app. It will show up at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;my.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps. The thing is, in the list it is listed with a &quot;cloud&quot; icon in front of it. Most our other apps created in studio have titanium icons in front of them. So it seems like somehow the studio apps does not get correctly added as titanium apps into our appcelerator account, which causes all our purchased modules etc to not work and get license validation errors…</p>
<p>How do we fix this?</p>

							<div><p>Ohh crap now i see what is happening. Even though we&#39;ve logged into our appcelerator account, some old login must be active and not the new one. So all apps we have created recently has been added into the other account… this is very troublesome.</p>
<p>Is there anyway to move apps from one account to another or delete them?</p>

							<p>You will need to open a ticket on the JIRA and wait for them to give you a hand.  The volunteers here don&#39;t have that access.  And I&#39;m not sure this falls under &#39;free&#39; support.</p>
