			<h1>Why the keystore file i create doesn&#39;t work at all?</h1>

		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m building an android app and it has no error and i can debug it both on emulator and device without any problem. When i try to get the package with a keystore created with in titanium sdk using android keystore generator, the APK is failed to install on on device. For now i&#39;m using (Default Dev - Keystore)[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;123704&#x2F;what-keystore-does-titanium-studio-use-to-build-android-app-during-development] in titanium for distribution. I&#39;m sure i gave 30 years validity and fill all required fileds then even check it on command line. Everything with keystore seems fine. But the APK built with that keystore is not installed on any device. When i open the APK on device it shows the permission window and when i press intall it tries to install and says &quot;[Application-Name] is not installed&quot;. Any idea about this issue?</p>

							<div><p>Hi Manoj,</p>
<p>Did you solve this? I seem to be having a similar problem!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve finally been able to actually make an apk for distribution - that was a mission in and of itself) instead of using keytool to sign it, I&#39;m using the feature in TiStudio to make a keystore. I also had to &#39;donwgrade&#39; my JDK from 1.7 to 1.6.</p>
<p>Now I actually get an APK at the other end of the process but it won&#39;t install on my device - it goes all the way through the installation procedure and when it would normally say complete it simply says &quot;Application not installed&quot;</p>
<p>It fails when I attempt to upload it to google play dev console too.</p>
<p>I have checked it with jarsigner and that believes it is verified with every entry being rated as &quot;SM&quot; - shuold they be K and I too? Is that the problem? </p>
<p>Any suggestions would be gratefully received.</p>
