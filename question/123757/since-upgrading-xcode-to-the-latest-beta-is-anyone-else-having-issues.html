			<h1>Since upgrading XCode to the latest beta is anyone else having issues?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m having a complete pain in the ass with just about everything today. I have the latest Titanium SDK, the latest XCode (including the iOS 5 beta) but I&#39;m still only building apps against iOS 4.3 and I&#39;m seeing more errors throw up in the console while building than ever.</p>
<p>This is really ruining my day. So much stuff which used to work has broken and I can&#39;t for the life of me find out why.</p>
<p>I&#39;m getting a bit tired of these &#39;moving targets&#39;.</p>
<p>Sorry for the rant. But it anyone else experiencing issues?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried searching here in Q&amp;A for things, but since it orders results in the most ridiculous way, putting posts from over a year ago at the top, I&#39;m kind if losing my patience. </p>
<p>Grrr.</p>
<p>&#x2F;rant.</p>

							<div><p>Hi Jon:</p>
<p>Are you also using Titanium Studio? I definitely had problems with the latest build&#39;s parsing of JS. Finding syntax errors where there were none. I don&#39;t know if there were the regressions typical of a one of this days when everything goes wrong, but I think at some point the compiled code wasn&#39;t even evaluating try-catch on Android, among other things…</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ve tried both Studio and the older (and much preferred) Ti Developer. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried older TiSDKs and rebuilds and just about everything I can think of so far. </p>
<p>I&#39;m seeing &#39;Session did end with error (null)&#39; a lot, which is about as useful as a chocolate teapot.</p>

										<p><p>Is it possible to just reinstall the previous version of XCode and remove the iOS5 beta SDK, do you know?</p>

										<p><p>Well, I&#39;ve just realized that I haven&#39;t install the latest XCode yet, only downloaded and forgotten. I&#39;ve have reverted XCode in the past (also due to Titanium having trouble with it). Just fully uninstalled latest version and reinstalled previous one from a dmg. Wonder how that will work out now with the app installed from the App Store…</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m just trying to roll back to XCode 4.0.2 (on Snow Leopard) now.<br>I wanted to try out the newer version, since it was the only way I could see any console output on one device I have with the iOS5 beta on it. </p>
<p>Next time, I&#39;m just not going to bother with betas. They cause far too many problems.</p>
<p>Hopefully I can get back to actually testing apps again later! :)</p>

										<p><p>So. It turns out that totally uninstalling XCode (which you have to do via the command line tool) and reinstalling the older version has fixed the issue.</p>
<p>I really hope we don&#39;t have all these issues once the final version of iOS5 and XCode come out.</p>

										<p><p>Hmm … iOS 5 Beta works for me. Not with Titanium Studio (which I dislike anyways) but works with Titanium Developer.  Terrible you had such bad luck, I too hope no one else does.</p>
