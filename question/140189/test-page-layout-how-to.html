							<p>Well, it all depends, </p>
<ul>
<li>If you want a native look and feel, you will have to re-create your interface using Titanium native controls.</li>
<li>If you want to keep that &quot;web page&quot; look and feel, you can embed your page in a webview.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind though, that if you go the webview route, you will have a more limited set of features since your code will be <em> sandboxed</em> in the WebView.</p>

							<p>I think that is a bit difficult to made same layout, spacing and so like a web page..( I know better HTML5&#x2F;CSS3  and so ). If a windows has a view with a lot of text like a mangazine, How Do I format it in native mode?<br>My idea is to made a native app and wrapper into it, the webviews…but I&#39;m not convinced.<br>How Do you suggest?<br>Which is the strategy used for the apps like Facebook,Twitter and Flipboard?</p>

										<p><p>Apps like Facebook are native and use rich labels.<br>(there is <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;790?1462522544">free a module for that</a>)</p>
<p>You can also use webviews (much like a button or an image) in cases where you want to display formatted text. Although you cannot use them too intensively since the performance hit will be too big.</p>
<p>But my best advice to you when developing a mobile application. Don&#39;t try to make it look like a website, make it look like an application. If users want to look at something that looks like a site, they will just go to the actual site.</p>
<p>While it is a nice &quot;edge&quot; that you are very familiar with HTML5 and CSS3 and all that. But forcing to apply those same principles will be more of a handicap in this case.</p>

										<p><p>Good news of rich labels. I&#39;ll try it.<br>I don&#39;t want made a website, but I wish that the look and feel of app will be as the web site for colours, style and so…May be that a solution will be a webapp with Sencha &#x2F; PhoneGap or PhoneGap&#x2F;Jquery + HTML5&#x2F;CSS3?<br>What&#39;s your opinion on that?</p>

										<p><p>You should at least give it a try with Titanium and see if can match your needs.</p>
<p>If it doesn&#39;t , you can also go the Hybrid route with Titanium, while the functionality set will be more limited.  The PhoneGap route is probably a little closer to what you are trying to achieve though. </p>
<p>But one other key aspect you must keep in mind before choosing any mobile development platform is: What kind of features will the application offer? To me, the look&amp;feel must not be to tthe detriment of the user experience.</p>
<p>Hope this give enough info to work with and Code Strong!</p>
