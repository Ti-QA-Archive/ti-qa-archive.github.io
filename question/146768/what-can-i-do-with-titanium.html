			<h1>What can I do with Titanium</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I would like to use Titanium to develop an application for all platform. I still have some question:<br>Q1: If I run titanium on windows XP, I know I can&#39;t develop application for iOS. But if I want to develop application for Win8 mobile, Android and iOS on which operating system should I run Titanium? (I read Win8 will be available on half 2013)<br>Q2: Can I develop applications for desktop such as Windows or Linux or Mac?<br>Q3: Can I develop applications for Windows 7.5 mobile</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance for your feed back.</p>

										<p><p>Christian, Windows Mobile 7.5 may have a metro interface but Microsoft have essentially deprecated it by not allowing Windows Mobile 8 as an upgrade and Windows Mobile 8 apps cannot run on 7.5, with so few handsets (by percentage in anyway you count it) the hope is on Windows Mobile 8.</p>
<p>So as sad as this statement is &quot;Windows Mobile 7.x is a forgotten branch&quot; it is still statistically true and even more so for anyone who has not jumped on the Windows mobile platform now.</p>
<p>If Appcelerator are able to include it as a platform choice then it is worth jumping in, otherwise the cost to develop is too high to too little return and so little interest.</p>

<p>No VM under mac.  Under mac you can do native iOS and native Android.  VM was tied to your windows mobile question.</p>

							<p>Thank you very much for your answers.<br>I need to develop an application which target most of platform and with performance; it&#39;s because I think appccelerator titanium is best choice for me. Because I want to reduce development cost I hesitate between full web app and cross-platform development.</p>
<p>The solution I have if I understand, it&#39;s to develop a cross-platform application under mac VM which target Android and iOS for mobiles and tablet, and an application in C# for desktop PC. Then I should target most users.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Sébastien</p>
