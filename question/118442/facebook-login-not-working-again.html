			<h1>Facebook login not working, again?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>The facebook login button&#x2F;functionality seems to not be working.  I have tried both 1.6.1 and 1.7.0.  Cleaned my iPhone build directory.  Have the property in my tiapp.xml and have set the Titanium.Facebook.appid.</p>
<p>It seems to work fine but now it is not working.  No error are in the log file.  I have tried both the authorize function and the facebook button.</p>
<p>The app is redirecting to facebook in Safari and I am authenticated.  It asks me to click the &quot;Okay&quot; button to authorize.  I do that, then it switches back to my app but still says it is not logged in.</p>
<p>Any clue on what is going on?</p>

							<p>I had some weird issues earlier today with the Facebook connection stuff. Then it went away. I assume there was an issue at Facebook&#39;s end.</p>
<p>Have you tried the KichenSink examples?</p>
<p>With the latest SDK version from github, it&#39;s possible to set if you want to use the &#39;old&#39; version of the pop-up window instead of going out of the application to Safari and back again - which I much prefer.</p>

							<p>Ok, thanks for the follow up I figured it our and it was not Titanium.  I was using a facebook test account and it was not logging it in.  I was not getting a username&#x2F;password error it would just finish as if everything was ok.  I need to see if facebook changed how you can use test accounts.</p>
