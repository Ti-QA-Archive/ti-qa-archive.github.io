			<h1>Rounded corners and borderColor killing performance.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve seen a few posts here where people have commented about the performance hit with rounded corners, but only a few small comments about it (from what I&#39;ve found so far). I&#39;m experiencing huge performance problems when using either borderRadius or borderColor on a view, and even worse performance when combining the two. This is on the iPhone 4 with Titanium 1.7.x. Windows containing views with these property sets feel sluggish when scrolling or when alerts pop up over them. This is not the case, however, when rendering tables with the &quot;GROUPED&quot; style, which automatically come with rounded corners. These render perfectly smooth. Is anyone else experiencing similar issues? If so, are there any solutions (besides avoiding rounded corners and borderColor, of course)?</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m not referring to tableViews here, just simple views on a window. Rounded corners and border color seems to really kill performance.</p>

										<p><p>It&#39;s somehow normal.<br>The device has to process all the view containing pixels with opacity or transparent in a final image, and this happens each time the screen needs to be repainted(like on touchmove or when an alert pops up).</p>
<p>I do see performance slowing down on my 3GS but not in such a way to render the app unusable. Maybe combining the views you need to move at once in a single wrapper which will be moved instead will make it better. I think you have to experiment :)</p>
