			<h1>ACS Push Pricing</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have just seen the pricing for ACS Push:</p>
<p>$99 &#x2F; month &#x2F; 101 - 5,000 Active devices<br>$160 &#x2F; month &#x2F; 5,001 - 10,000 Active devices<br>$320 &#x2F; month &#x2F; 10,001 - 25,000 Active devices<br>$480 &#x2F; month &#x2F; 25,001 - 50,000 Active devices<br>$640 &#x2F; month &#x2F; 50,001 - 75,000 Active devices<br>$800 &#x2F; month &#x2F; 75,001 - 100,000 Active devices</p>
<p>But http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;plans-pricing shows that there is a &quot;free extended trial&quot;. So does ACS Push already stops working for new devices if I don&#39;t upgrade my account now?</p>
<p>My iOS App has already over 150.000 active users (using urbanairship btw), I was hoping that ACS Push for Android wouldn&#39;t be so expensive, guess wrong.</p>
<p>Best<br>Danny</p>

							<div><p>Our push and email has been on a free extended trial since ACS went public. But now we&#39;re in the process of rolling out pricing for those. Existing users will receive an email about it soon, and http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;plans-pricing will be updated.</p>
<p>Our push pricing for iOS and Android differs from Urban Airship in two major ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>We will charge only for the number of devices actually pushed to during the month. Urban Airship charges for every registered device, whether or not they are pushed to at all during the month.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Once your usage exceed&#39;s Urban Airship&#39;s free tier, our pricing is a fraction of theirs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The new limits and pricing will start being enforced at the end of September. However, developers have a month&#39;s grace period before they must start paying for it.</p>

							<div><p>I cannot see the prices either.  Confused.</p>
<p>Kinvey.com has a deal with UrbanAirship, costs only done on API calls.  No extras for push notifications, see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;console.kinvey.com&#x2F;#pricing">here</a> for pricing <strong>remember its the non-native option</strong>.</p>

							<p>Pooshwoosh has some nice plans for unlimited pushes. The drawback is they don&#39;t have the android module ready yet.</p>
<p>With this number of users you could setup a nodejs server for pushes yourself, why don&#39;t you do it ?</p>

										<p><p>How can I use a nodejs server to push notifications to Android devices while using ACS as cloud service?</p>
<p>BTW: does anyone has experiences with pyapns for iOS (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;samuraisam&#x2F;pyapns) ?</p>

										<p><p>It&#39;s certainly possible to setup and maintain your own push notification server. It&#39;s just a choice of how much time and money you want to put into it versus using an existing service like ACS Push Notifications.</p>
<p>We&#39;re currently in beta with our Node.js hosting solution on ACS. Once that&#39;s released you could write a connector between ACS and the push service you setup on your own.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m actually quite shocked at the new pricing structure. Let me provide some calculations…</p>
<p>If I have just under 25,000 downloads of my app(not unreasonable) which is based on 0.69p the total (before tax but with Apples 30% taken is) £12075 total. Push with ACS over 4 years to support this App would be £9532.</p>
<p>Now am I missing something here because, based on my calculations above, its darn expensive… I don&#39;t know too much about Urban Airship but it appears they have up to 1 million per month which does not cost anything. And even if you do go over 1 million the costs are still not that bad.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>
<p>Steven</p>
