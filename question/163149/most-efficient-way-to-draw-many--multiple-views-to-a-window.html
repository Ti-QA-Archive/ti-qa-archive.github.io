			<h1>Most Efficient Way to Draw Many / Multiple Views to a Window</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My app is very visual, it can often have a large scrollview and then many child views as PNGs with transparency added to it, the end result is kind of like Google maps visually.</p>
<p>I was wondering if anyone had any advise how I can draw many views to the screen quicker. At the moment, I get the data required from the database, load the main background image and then loop through and add all of the child views, there can be a few hundred say max 400. This as you can imagine takes quite a few seconds to render on a device like the iPad Mini (for Android I could only achieve this functionality with a web view).</p>
<p>I was wondering with the new(ish) postLayout() functions and newer SDKs and efforts like the ListView controls to address performance that there might be a more efficient way of achieving this. For example does creating the view hidden and then at the last moment showing it have an effect, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>I was hoping to get some advise before carving my code up completely trying new things… </p>
<p>Cheers,<br>Mark</p>
