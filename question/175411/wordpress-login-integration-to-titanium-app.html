							<p>Hi</p>
<p>As with your previous question;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;175406">Integration with WordPress</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It looks like you are still trying to connect to the WordPress API. You asked if you could connect to WordPress via external APIs which you can as explained in the previous question.</p>
<p>My concern is that you do not understand the basics of what you have to achieve, ignoring the basics of an app, it looks like you do not understand how XHR works or how APIS work.  This is something you have to understand the logic of before you start trying to code them into your app.</p>
<p>You have not provided any code to show what you have tried so far, this would help us to determine if the fault in your code is;</p>
<ul>
<li>A typo</li>
<li>A misunderstanding of how things work</li>
<li>A library that is not compatible with your needs</li>
</ul>
<p>So I am left thinking that your wish to create an app that you explain as;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;I am developing a application for iPad from which my user will post data to his&#x2F;her wordpress blog.&quot;</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>Actually means you hope to create an app to achieve this - but currently have no idea where to start beyond a link to an API you do not understand.</p>
<p>There is NOTHING wrong with that, but you have to admit to yourself that you need to understand each part first before trying to go to the next part.</p>
<p>If you did understand that you would have experimented with the httpClient library I hared in the previous question and understood that it can very easily send and receive data, also in the same call to an API.  So with out experimenting and trying things to explore what can be done and how you can work with that - you have decided to create an app that you simply have no understanding of how it would actually work.</p>
<p>You are not the developer if you do not understand what you are doing and how it fits together.  You have to fix that part first.</p>
<p>BTW if I am wrong and you have actually written some code of your own that tries but fails to connect to WordPress API then shar e it and I will happily review it.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Malcolm and Rainer, Thanks for your quick reply. After posting my previous question i found solution for connecting WordPress and Titanium, here connecting in the sence sending data from titanium app to WordPress site. By using JSON API plugin in WordPress I&#39;ve achieved this. We will send an request including post data from titanium app using <code>HTTPClient</code> to the JSON API plugin in WordPress, then in return to our request that plugin will collect the data and send it back to the application in JSON format where we can parse the data using <code>JSON.parse()</code> method in Titanium. But other than posting the data I also want my user to be logged in with his&#x2F;her WordPress credentials, so I did&#39;nt found any resource regarding login in JSON API plugin. So here I am asking whether is there any way for WordPress login.</p>

										<p><p>Are you now saying your entire question was how to get WordPress to send out JSON data? Your question asked &quot;how to connect WordPress to Titanium&quot; - not &quot;this is just a WordPress problem&quot;.</p>
<p>I ask that you spend time wording your future questions to include ALL relevant information and if they are even related to Titanium and what parts you have&#x2F;have not resolved.</p>
<p>I am not sure I have the patience to try and assist you the next time you ask.</p>
