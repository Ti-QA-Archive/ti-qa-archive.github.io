			<h1>Attempting to create iOS version from Android version of an app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m helping out a friend who developed an Android app using Titanium develop the iOS version of his app. I&#39;m reasonably familiar with the iOS development process but for some reason Titanium is throwing me off. </p>
<p>My understanding of the process was that I could take the Android code, cut and paste it into a new project that&#39;s configured to output iOS apps, and voila I&#39;d have a near-copy of the Android app. Unfortunately, this has not been my experience. Many small differences on each tab of this tabbed view app are… off. Spacing and alignment is wonky, buttons are missing, etc.</p>
<p>Any idea what&#39;s up? Maybe if my exact problem sounds a little hard to diagnose, you could give me an overview of how one would go about the process I&#39;m attempting (i.e. take a working Android app in Titanium and get it up and running on iOS).</p>

<p>An individual project can be configured to output both. Aint no one got time for cut and pasting.</p>
<p><code>buttons are missing</code></p>
<p>iOS 7 buttons are flat, so you tend to just get the button text and no outlines.  Set some of the button params.</p>
<p><code>Spacing and alignment is wonky</code></p>
<p>Until recently, iOS only had one form factor for handhelds.  Everything lived nicely inside of a 320x480 frame.  Then it got tall with the iPhone 5, and some adjustments had to be made. </p>
<p>Depending on how well your friend layout out his android app, the transition shouldnt be too bad.  If he hard coded all his heights&#x2F;widths&#x2F;lefts&#x2F;rights&#x2F;tops&#x2F;bottoms&#x2F;etc then, well, not so easy.</p>
