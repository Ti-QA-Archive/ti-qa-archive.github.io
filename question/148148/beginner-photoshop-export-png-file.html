			<h1>[Beginner] Photoshop export PNG file</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi , I am a beginner for apps design. I have got a problem when I export some layer to image in photoshop. First , My document is set to 1136 x 640 and 326 pixel&#x2F;inch for 4 inch retina iphone. </p>
<p>I use the photoshop to export the image : File&gt;Scripts&gt;Export Layers to Files&gt; PNG-8</p>
<p>And then , When I positioned a image in titanium , the image size and position is totally mismatched in the simulator. The image seems larger than that in photoshop. It is nothing wrong with the iOS version and hardware config.</p>
<p>Can someone help me to figure out this problem? Thanks !</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Firstly you do not need to set the DPI that high, 72 DPI is fine.</p>
<p>The second problem is WHERE you are using the image.  The iPhone 5 does have a resolution of 640 x 1136 (portrait), but this is only important if you have a full screen window with no; status bar, navigation&#x2F;title bar or tab bar.</p>
<p>Also the images you supply are actually based on two resolutions with a naming convention.  Which even if you are not targeting devices less than the iPhone 5 you HAVE to provide if you want the app in the app store.</p>
<p>Example naming conventions;</p>
<ul>
<li>back.png [320x568]</li>
<li>back@2x.png [640x1136]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>back.png</strong> and <strong>back@2x.png</strong> are the same image but with two resolutions.  You only ever reference <strong>back.png</strong> and iOS will automatically use the higher resolution image if available.</p>
<p>This is because the iPhone uses a device width of 320 when laying things out.  You can address every pixel (640) if you need but for most apps that is not required and inhibits the ability to support non-retina devices.  Retina devices will gain the correct imagery when supplied with a <strong>@2x</strong> suffix and fonts will look much better automatically.</p>
<p>If your image is going to be displayed as the background to a window and remain fixed in-place, you must determine the internal space.</p>
<p>So subtract (if you have each);</p>
<ul>
<li>status bar [20&#x2F;40]</li>
<li>navigation&#x2F;title bar [44&#x2F;88]</li>
<li>tab bar [50&#x2F;100]</li>
</ul>
<p>So the height would be;</p>
<ul>
<li>iPhone = 480 - 20 - 44 - 50 = 366</li>
<li>iPhone Retina = 960 - 40 - 88 - 100 = 732</li>
<li>iPhone Retina Tall = 1136 - 40 - 88 - 100 = 908</li>
</ul>
<p>Assuming the original filename is <strong>back.png</strong> these &quot;should&quot; be named as;</p>
<ul>
<li>back.png</li>
<li>back@2x.png</li>
<li>back-568h@2x.png</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that support for <strong>back-568h@2x.png</strong> is not available until Titanium SDK 3.1 which is due out within the next week.</p>
