			<h1>garbage collection in functions</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi everyone.</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to get my head around how garbage collection works in functions.</p>
<p>If I have code such as:<br>(of course, this is just sort of pseudocode; please don&#39;t worry about any syntax issues)</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">blahFunction</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> blahView=createView();
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> blahLabel=createLabel();

    blahView.add(blahLabel);

    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> blahView;
};

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> testView=blahFunction();
</code></pre><p>Do I need to explicitly set anything to null, or do I need to call blahView.remove()?<br>Or do blahView and blahLabel automatically get cleaned up once the function finishes?</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Your example is a good one as it is a common misunderstanding as to what will happen here.</p>
<p>Keep in mid this is NIT a garbage collection summary, that is a very long and complicated subject - this is understanding this specific question.</p>
<p>Assuming that <em>blahFunction<strong> is the function referred to in the question then - no, those variable will not be cleaned up when the function finishes.  The reason for this that javascript uses references to manage passing variables.  When you call the function and it returns a value then </strong>testView*</em> now has the view and label assigned to it, call it again and now there are two sets in memory.</p>
<p>Whilst <strong>blahFunction</strong> has processed the work it performed is now available outside the function! thus the memory associated with that function persists.</p>
<p>You can set <strong>testView</strong> to null! ideally you would have removed this from the window first though.</p>
<p>However unless you need to reduce the amount if in use memory inside this window, the need to manually null things is low.  When the window closes any variables (memory) used will automatically be released and added to the garbage collection routine - this will then choose the best time later to free up this assignments - all done behind the scenes - nothing for you to worry about.  Perfect, easy, not quite (nothing is ever this easy).</p>
<p>Whilst everything is freed up automatically as I said - that only goes for things that have no persisting references that have not been cleaned.  If you have of those one, many or all if the memory in that window will persist depending on what and where the persisting references are assigned to.</p>
<p>Adding event listeners can mean the thing they are attached to will not be freed up, setInterval and setTimeout are MASSIVE reference issues.  These should always be nulled&#x2F;cleared on window (or function level  if memory intensive) close.</p>
<p>Garbage collection is a topic that has differing opinions as to what where and when of it all.  So there may be comments to this answer - which are welcomed.</p>
<p>If you are lucky enough to be developing an iOS app, the you can use Xcode to run your titanium compiled app tso that you can see the instruments panel, this tells you what persists and what does not as you traverse your app.  It will also show you how sometimes it is instant and sometimes it takes a few minutes - if you are into this sort of thing then your apps will be better for it.</p>

										<p><p>You do not need to null the <strong>blahView</strong> and <strong>blahLabel</strong> variables in this example as once the window is closed their references will expire so will the memory allocation.  Keep in mind they would then be out of scope - as they are in a function you would not have access to them unless you create root level variables and handled it that way just to gain a reference later on.  Whilst root level variables have their place (I use them all the time) they should ONLY be used when required.</p>
<p>This obviously assumes anything else that could persist in the memory has been handles specifically or automatically of course.</p>
<p><strong>example.js</strong></p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// this is what I mean by root level</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> blahView;
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> blahLabel;

    blahLabel=createLabel();

    blahView.add(blahLabel);

							<p>Thank you <em>so</em> much, that is a fantastic bunch of information!<br>It will prove very helpful to me, and likely lots of others as well.</p>
<p>Quick question - do blahView or blahLabel themselves need to be nulled inside the function (as the last lines)?</p>
