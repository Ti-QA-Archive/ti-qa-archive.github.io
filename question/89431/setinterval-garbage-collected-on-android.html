			<h1>setInterval garbage collected on Android?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Having successfully completed my first iPhone app I am trying to &#39;port&#39; it for the Android platform. I know it wasn&#39;t going to easy but I&#39;m finding even the simplest thing - a setInterval to poll every second - is failing.</p>
<p>It seems to work for two, sometimes three, cycles and then stops. The &#39;Trace&#39; window on Titanium Builder mentions &#39;GC_FOR_MALLOC freed&#39; quite a lot so I am wondering if it&#39;s being garbage collected.</p>
<p>I did try setting my setInterval to a global variable to stop it being marked for garbage collection, but no joy.</p>
<p>This also seems to happen with setTimeout too. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Please post your Google and Titanium SDK versions (as you always should), and also some code so that we can understand how the script works. If you can replicate the problem in a blank project, it would be ideal.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Hal - I did try and put the API version (APIs 2.2), but the forum formatter thought they were two separate tags. And I&#39;m on the Titanium SDK 1.5 - freshly installed today.</p>
<p>But - I&#39;ve think I&#39;ve found out what&#39;s going on with this timer. If I attempt to start it in the global namespace i.e. at the bottom of the script, it will run one or twice and die. But if I kick it off from a button listener it will keep on running! Previously my original method of &#39;kick-off&#39; worked fine on the iPhone, so a difference somewhere.</p>

							<p>I have done all what is expected getting a full Android activity on my window. Open a new Window with its own .js file:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> win = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
    title: <span class="hljs-string">'digitalguide'</span>,
    url: <span class="hljs-string">'main.js'</span>,
    backgroundColor: <span class="hljs-string">'#000000'</span>,
    top: <span class="hljs-number">0</span>,
    left: <span class="hljs-number">0</span>,
    opacity: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>,
    backgroundImage: appBg,
    navBarHidden:<span class="hljs-literal">false</span>,
     exitOnClose:<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
});
</code></pre><p>Same problem as you describe still persists in 1.6.0. </p>
<p>in main.js:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> appWin = Titanium.UI.currentWindow;
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">doLoop</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span>{
    Titanium.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">"Loop is looping"</span>);
}
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> interValHandle = setInterval(doLoop, <span class="hljs-number">2000</span>);
</code></pre><p>It fires once or twice before it dies. On iPhone it starts without any problems and setInterval works perfectly.</p>
<p>I solved my problem triggering the setInterval loop on the user clicking an item in the Android menu. After that it loops on forever.</p>
<p>Luckily I did not need the interval running before the user provided input, but some times this is not the case. I was able to pull it off this way even if this is not suitable for all projects.</p>
<p>I have tried with navBarHidden:true and navBarHidden:false without getting much difference. I have even tried to add the intervalhandle to the windows activity (appWin.activity) with no joy. For me this appears as a bug, and the scope where the intervalHandle is created is outside the activity scope for some reason.</p>
<p>I havent tried with setting the window fullscreen, since this was not applicable on my project</p>
<p>Hope this helps<br>Harald</p>

										<p><p>Do you think its too much of a hassle to use a setTimeout which calls itself repeatedly instead of a setInterval method?</p>

										<p><p>Can work the same actually, there is slight differences however which one need to be aware of.</p>
<p>The setInterval function delays for a specified time before triggering the execution of a function over and over agin in a specific interval span. Which means it does not wait for the function which it setIntervalled, to complete. The setTimeout will complete the whole function before it setIntervals itself again.</p>
<p>Timers in javascript (read Titanium) is not very predictable after all, so for gaming one probably need another timer anyway. I have seen looping a one second MP3 used as timer for example. </p>
<p>But if you wish to make a clock function, setInterval would be my choice. But in many cases setTimer perfectly will do the job to loop your code, it is however a victim of the code execution time.</p>
