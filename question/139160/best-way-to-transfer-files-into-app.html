			<h1>Best way to transfer files into app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;m building an iPad app that manages photos. I&#39;ve got two questions about importing files&#x2F;photos into an app once it has been published.</p>
<p>Q1: Is it possible to implement an FTP server within the app to facilitate transfer of photos from a client such as FileZilla (or any FTP client for that matter)?</p>
<p>Q2: Apple don&#39;t really help out when selecting photos from the inbuilt photo library. It seems only one photo can be selected at a time. Is there any way to select more than one photo?</p>
<p>This is my first app in Titanium, but I have to say, so far I&#39;ve been very impressed by its capabilities.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your answers.</p>

							<p>You have a lot of possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>ftp (not easy you have to write a ftp client)</li>
<li>https (easy, because there is a xhr method)</li>
<li>using of cloud acs</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your answer Rainer, I do have some questions thought…</p>
<ul>
<li><p>ftp … wouldn&#39;t it be an FTP server I would have to write, as I need to receive files? Do you have any ideas on how I would go about this? Do I need to write a Objective-C plugin for Titanium?</p>
</li>
<li><p>https … I&#39;m struggling to see how to use xhr in this context. Is there a way to setup xhr in a &quot;server&quot; situation? It would need to be able to respond to files arriving on demand as this would be done at the whim of the user.</p>
</li>
<li><p>ACS … Again, I struggle to see how this solves the problem of  my customers importing their photos into my app.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The app needs to be able to receive, and store, photos. I want to be able to offer more than one solution to my customers, enabling them to load their photos into the app via the method most convenient to them.</p>
<p>I want to offer the following…</p>
<ul>
<li><p>iTunes loading (done and working great)</p>
</li>
<li><p>FTP</p>
</li>
<li><p>Camera roll (but I need to be able to select more than one photo at a time for this to be useful)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Take a photo with the device camera</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe I&#39;m missing something and there are better ways of doing this.</p>
