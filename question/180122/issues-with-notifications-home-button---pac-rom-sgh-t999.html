			<h1>Issues with notifications, home button - PAC ROM, SGH-T999</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey y&#39;all! First of all, thanks for the forum, I am using a T-Mobile SGH-T999.</p>
<p>Second of all, I&#39;m having some issues with my recent install of PAC Man ROM (pac_d2lte-release-20141231.zip with gapps4.4.4). The first issue I&#39;m experiencing has to do with the notification drop-down. After I restore from Titanium Backup, I cannot see the tiles or notifications under the notification drop-down. I&#39;ve browsed through the PAC Settings pretty extensively and have not found a solution to my issue. I did find the tile ribbon that I can activate but it is still inadequate, especially when it comes to notifications.</p>
<p>I do not know if this is a related issue to the one above but, after restoring from Titanium, I do not get a lock screen unless it is on the first boot; after that point, I can make the screen go black with the power button but, when pressed to wake up, the lock screen doesn&#39;t come back. Prior to restoring the backup from Titanium, I have no problem getting to the lock screen.</p>
<p>The final issue I am dealing with has to do with the &#39;home&#39; button on the device. I first thought perhaps it was a hardware issue but, after turning on PIE controls and the navigation buttons, it seems that pressing &#39;home&#39; does nothing at all.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for reading this post, please let me know if I can be of any further information.</p>
