			<p>I&#39;m curious what the &quot;policy&quot; at appcelerator is in regards to supporting both the iPhone as well as Android devices.</p>
<p>It seems as if iOS is the preferred platform (and I don&#39;t blame you since I prefer that platform as well), but I&#39;d like to make sure that, going forward, Android doesn&#39;t fall by the wayside.</p>
<p>I recently released the first version of our app for the iPhone, and I have since started the process of porting it over to Android, only to learn that there are a heap of issues. Several things that worked on iOS just don&#39;t work on Android - and I&#39;m not talking about functionality that is only available on the iPhone obviously.</p>
<p>So I&#39;m left wondering whether appcelerator is committed to providing the same quality of support to Android as it does to iOS?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>iOS and Android are currently and will continue to remain first class citizens. This will not change. Some people think that we prefer iOS, but the truth is iOS prefers us (figuratively speaking). With iOS the incidentals are always the same. Hardware, firmware, screen size, etc etc. It is not as hard to maintain as a system with hundreds of variants in hardware requirements, software, and screen sizes like Android. We put forth full effort into covering all these bases, but the fact of the matter is, there are tons of them. But you can rest assured that Android and iOS will continue to be full priorities.</p>

										<p><p>OK, that is good to know. I completely understand why iOS is easier, maybe you guys should allocate more resources to Android then?</p>
<p>Maybe it&#39;s just my observation, but it definitely seems like Android is not as advanced as the iOS in regards to Titanium.</p>
<p>Thanks for the quick reply.</p>

										<p><p>Before about 1.6, Titanium offered even <em>less</em> support for Android, Ingmar. Since then, they have been putting huge amounts of time, effort, and resources into bringing Android &quot;up-to-par&quot; with iOS. I have seen more Blog Posts about Android in the past couple months than I have seen this whole year.</p>
<p>Android support used to be horrible; Atleast now with fastdev and the layout updates and better support you can actually <strong>do</strong> something with Android. Before it was just… There.</p>
<p>So 1.6 and 1.7 have done some wondrous things with Android, and I suspect more updates and features and optimization for Android is coming in the future. You just have to be patient as this small little company tries to do everything at once at the demand of hundreds of thousands of developers all wanting to do their own thing.</p>

							<p>One thing that needs to be sorted out asap IMO is the enabling of Flash in the Webviews. And I agree, porting is a real nightmare but if you create a few functions to create in example pickers and buttonbars for both system you definitely can speed up the process.</p>
