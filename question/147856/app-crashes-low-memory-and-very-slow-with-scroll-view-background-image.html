			<h1>App crashes low memory and very slow with scroll view background image</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi experts,<br>I&#39;m trying to build a view like the iBooks app.</p>
<p>So I combined a scrollable view with several scrollviews.<br>In order to have a background I first tried to set a background to the scrollable view but this didn&#39;t work because then the background is fixed.<br>So I put a background image to each of my scrollviews (with repeat = true). That made the app horrible slow.</p>
<p>The next idea was to put normal views in the background, each with one tile of the background image.<br>This gave a reasonable speed for the app.<br>But now if I open one of the associated pdf files within a web view, the app crashes sometimes because of low memory.</p>
<p>The background image is not very big, just 120k of jpeg-image.<br>Without any image the app is very fast and doesn&#39;t crash.</p>
<p>What am I doing wrong?<br>Why does the app get so slow if I use a tiled background?</p>
<p>I tried with SDK 2.1.4 and SDK 3.0.0 but that makes no difference.</p>
<p>TIA Stephan</p>

							<p>HI Stephen, can  you provide your code snippet here, so that i can have a look to help you better.</p>
<p>one generic suggestion is, just use the module approach if possible and then do all your image processing there.</p>
<p>few days back one guy posted his module solution for same kind of problem.</p>
<p>so you can search the forum, if i get that answer again. then i will post it here too.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your answer.<br>But now I found out that I made the mistake to add my Background view every time I draw a thumbnail of a PDF. That ended up in having 20 views on Top of each other :(<br>After that was fixed the app now works fine.</p>
