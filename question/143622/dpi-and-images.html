			<h1>dpi and images</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey all,</p>
<p>i&#39;d like to get a <em>full</em> understanding of dpi and images.</p>
<p>I notice  that titanium has folders - hdpi, ldpi etc etc, and i&#39;d like to know:</p>
<p>what is the point of this?</p>
<p>When i make an image - say, an all white background - does it matter what <em>size</em> i make it, or what  dpi i make it? Or both?</p>
<p>And if i want an image that is for a device that is, say, 320 * 480, how big should i make the image? And what resolution should i set this image for?<br>And now that i want this image used in all different devices, what do i do? Do i resize the image? Do i add resolution to it?<br>Also, is it better to downgrade or upgrade an image&#39;s resolution?</p>
<p>I guess what I am asking for is either a really thorough explanation of what i need to do to make an all-sizes consistent app from an <em>image</em> point of view.</p>

							<div><p>i guess what i am asking is not &quot;why are there folders&quot;, because everybody knows why - in case you do not, it is to hold different sized images.<br>What <em>i</em> was trying to ask is <em>how do you size the images</em> and <em>is there some sort of rule&#x2F;guidelines when making the images regarding sizing?</em></p>
<p>This is more a graphics  question - think of it as &quot;how does a developer explain to his graphics guy what sized images he needs for different resolutions&quot;</p>

							<div><p>? when did i twice declare?<br>What undesirable outcome am i experiencing my code works fine, I&#39;m trying to make sure that images aren&#39;t too big or wasteful.</p>
<p> I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;m very confused by your comment. </p>
<p>I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t quite have a handle on this, and that my initial question wasn&#39;t clear on what I wanted (and hence the misplaced answer).<br>You&#39;ve obviously built some apps - why not let me in on the secret about image sizes, dpi and folders?</p>

							<p>It is a deep subject - not something that can be full explained here.  If you are looking for graphics sizes &#x2F; resolutions to tell your graphics guy what sizes you need for each folder, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.titaniumdevelopment.com.au&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2012&#x2F;10&#x2F;03&#x2F;density-specific-resources-for-appcelerator-titanium-in-the-real-world&#x2F;">I blogged a little about it last week</a>.  This isn&#39;t a complete explaination, but with this and the link Anthony provided, it might be enough for you to get on the right track. </p>

										<p><p>cheers for this. I suppose my question was a bit off from what i wanted - and it doesn&#39;t help that there  are ppl like Stephen Feather who cannot count or make meaningful replies honking all over the place - but check out SO anybody who needs the kind of &quot;sort of deep&quot; explanation that I wanted!</p>

							<p>We don&#39;t just make this stuff up, there are folders for different devices and densities because that is how Android deals with their many form factors. If you want a thorough explanation on this, the best place to start is usually the Android Docs for <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;guide&#x2F;practices&#x2F;screens_support.html">Supporting Multiple Screens</a></p>

							<p>To have a <strong>full</strong> understanding of the subject (as you mentioned yourself). You must understand all the implications of supporting multiple screen densities. Since there are so many devices and many resolutions, your design have to take this into consideration when creating images and other resources.</p>
<p>The most comprehensive explanation on this subject can be fount <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;guide&#x2F;practices&#x2F;screens_support.html">on the Android Developer Website</a>. While the explanation covers Android native development, the same principles apply here with Titanium.</p>

										<p><p>i&#39;d mark this up id i could for  the link, but i cannot. I guess i mis-represented my question - i really wanted an explanation that tied in all the stuff about images and folders to the actual image in question!<br>But you&#39;re right, the link given is great for understanding how android handles images.</p>
