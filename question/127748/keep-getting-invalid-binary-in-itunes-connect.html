			<h1>Keep getting invalid binary in itunes connect...</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I validated the project just fine, and uploaded just fine. but later on, I find that itunes connected says &quot;Invalid Binary&quot;. In the email I got:</p>
<p>&quot;Invalid Signature - Make sure you have signed your application with a distribution certificate, not an ad hoc certificate or a development certificate. Verify that the code signing settings in Xcode are correct at the target level (which override any values at the project level). Additionally, make sure the bundle you are uploading was built using a Release target in Xcode, not a Simulator target. If you are certain your code signing settings are correct, choose &quot;Clean All&quot; in Xcode, delete the &quot;build&quot; directory in the Finder, and rebuild your release target.&quot;</p>
<p>I have verified I&#39;m using the distribution certificate, and that I user RELEASE as the build option… how can I overcome this?</p>

							<p>Yaniv,</p>
<p>I don&#39;t work on mobile, but I think it&#39;s similar to desktop. I think you need to have the &quot;Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certification Authority&quot; certificate, if you don&#39;t have that. Essentially your keys are not setup correctly.</p>

										<p><p>Alan, I already have it installed in my Keychain…<br>I&#39;m soooo frustrated right now, I&#39;ve created it for a client, and now - I can&#39;t get it to a review! Itunes connect rejected it twice already…</p>

										<p><p>So, I&#39;ve let Titanium build it, and XCode archive it. in XCode, I define the icons and identity, and my bundle id is without the 10 digit prefix. When I validate it, it detects the app in itunes connect, and I can set its identity, but the validation fails saying I need to add the prefix.. When I DO add the prefix, I can&#39;t sign the app through the Validation process… </p>
<p>What is happening here? :(</p>

										<p><p>Yaniv,</p>
<p>My experience is that the Keychain is VERY difficult to get setup properly. Until you get it setup properly, it will not be able to sign properly. I feel your frustration, or shall I say I have felt it before! :-(</p>
<p>It might have to do with being or not being root certificates, seems I recall that something needs to be a root cert to work properly and be able to sign.</p>
<p>I know you need your developer cert which is signed by Apple, as well as the Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certificate. Also, there is something about the triangles inside the Keychain Assistant, you should see them next to the certs when you look in the Keychain Assistant.</p>
<p>My best suggestion is to go to the Apple Developer site and search for the doc on setting up the keys and follow it closely, after removing the keys you have in place already. I don&#39;t know if there is a way to get it working with the keys you have in place, there might be.</p>
<p>Maybe one of the mobile guys will jump in with some info on setting up the keys. I know it&#39;s tricky, as I mentioned above.</p>

										<p><p>Alan, thing is I already succeeded in installing it on the device, and even use testflight with AdHoc, so I guess my certificates are in order…</p>
<p>I&#39;m just unable to get it to a point I&#39;m using the identifier (com.ok2go.closk2go) AND let it validate properly. adding the 10 digit prefix won&#39;t let me choose identity when validating…</p>

<p>That app ID looks ok, but I still think something is wrong in the keys.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a page on the Apple site that could help:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;ios&#x2F;#featuredarticles&#x2F;FA_Wireless_Enterprise_App_Distribution&#x2F;Introduction&#x2F;Introduction.html">Introduction to Distribution</a></p>
<p>Here&#39;s another site that has some info:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;udn.epicgames.com&#x2F;Three&#x2F;AppleiOSProvisioning.html">Apple IOS Provisioning</a></p>
<p>This looks the most promising:</p>

							<p>I had a similar problem, and I had to disable iCloud in my provisioning profile to get the binary to work. However, I was getting a different error than you, so this may not help. For what it&#39;s worth:</p>

<p>Your problem is the keys, IMO, but I could be wrong.</p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t use iCloud either. The strange thing is that it was checked by default for some reason and that caused my binary to be rejected. However, if you say it&#39;s not checked for you then that&#39;s not the issue.</p>
