			<p>I came accross this post on DZone and I thought I could share.<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dzone.com&#x2F;links&#x2F;run_html5_app_natively_with_titanium4j.html. It shows how to use Titanium as an alternative to PhoneGap to wrap existing HTML5 applications. Cheers, Franz</p>

							<p>I Agree that going full native is better. But sometimes you already have an existing HTML5 based app and you just want to add native capabilities to it. A complete rewrite is not always possible. The question is in that case what should one use ? Titanium or PhoneGap ?</p>

										<p><p>What do you mean &quot;Tooling&quot; ? Last time I checked doesnt not ship with a tooling for HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS. You can use whatever tool you like. I think the article makes good point about the advantages of Titanium over PhoneGap even for hybrid applications.</p>

										<p><p>Just looking at that link - Its for Titanium4J and not native Titanium anyway.  Only of interest to the java boys and girls out there IMHO</p>

										<p><p>I dont think a lot of PhoneGap developers use Adobe Creative Suite for their PG apps. True that The framework uses GWT(Java) but the principle stays the same as GWT compiles to JS. Meaning one could write JS by hand and not use GWT(Titanium4j) at all. Beyong their framework is the arguments they have about Titanium beeing better than PhoneGap even for Hybrid app that I found interesting.</p>

										<p><p>Actually, an awful lots of Designers use phonegap via creative studio to build and publish apps. The tooling keeps them in their comfort zone</p>

										<p><p>Yeah most of people dont like to get out of their comfort zone I think :) I def. think that the article has a point about Cordova vs Titanium for Hybrid mobile apps. Now doing it in Java is another story. The one will like the others wont.</p>

							<p>Why bother ?  Titanium gives you access to native controls at almost native performance. If you just want a webview app (meh) then stick with phonegap IMHO</p>
