			<h1>ADB.EXE not working, again.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been trying to get Titanium Developer to work with Android for 5 days now. I&#39;ve done all the Windows disgnostics, checked paths, updated Google APIs but adb.exe is still crashing. Titanium itself sometimes crashes &#x2F; closes, as does the Android SDK Manager. All very frustrating as I&#39;m keen to get developing with Titanium, and have recommended it at work (before I discovered the Android headache).</p>
<p>If you have any ideas, they will be gratefully appraciated.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a common error message, if it gets that far: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;ZArmA5eb">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;ZArmA5eb</a></p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>Rob, I haven&#39;t seen those errors, and you&#39;ve probably tried all these steps. But just in case…</p>
<p>Empty the your_project&#x2F;build&#x2F;android directory (but leave the android directory there)</p>
<p>Remove your virtual devices and let TiDeveloper re-create them</p>
<p>Kill adb.exe, though I would assume over 5 days you did a shutdown&#x2F;restart. The process hangs fairly frequently for me and has to be killed.</p>
<p>Try creating a new project, don&#39;t change anything, and build it. Does that work? If so, maybe it&#39;s something in your code?</p>

										<p><p>Hi Tim, thanks for your reply. I tried your suggestions, but I&#39;m still get the same errors (with a test project too). I&#39;m using processingjs in my original project so though it might be that, but alas no. Seems to be a general problem with Android. Although Titanium crashes a lot as well, so maybe it&#39;s something else. I don&#39;t have this problem running anything else on my computer, so I&#39;m at a loss as to what it might be.</p>

										<p><p>Finally! I got it to work. I have 64bit Linux on dual boot. Switched to that, and it&#39;s all running sweetly now. Who would&#39;ve thought ditching Windows would&#39;ve solved all my problems?</p>
