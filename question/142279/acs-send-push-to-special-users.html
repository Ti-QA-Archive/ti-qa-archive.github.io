							<p>what i would suggest is that you create a special channel and just subscribe the users to that specific channel</p>

										<p><p>you really need to describe the use case… the <strong>what</strong> you are trying to accomplish and then look for a suggestion on <strong>how</strong> it can be solved</p>
<p><strong><em>I would like to send push only for some users.</em></strong></p>
<p>is vague…. therefore the answers you get will not be the exact answer you want and then we have to do this back and forth slowly pulling out the details of what you are REALLY trying to accomplish instead of you just giving all of the information and making this a much less painful process for everyone involved.</p>

										<p><p>The user ID is created and sent back in the payload when a new user is created, you need that ID.  Log in to the ACS control panel and you will see the user ID for the user with username: xxxxx</p>

										<p><p>ok sorry.</p>
<p>i have an application with persons who are looking for job and company..</p>
<p>the applications allows for company to create offers (internship, job, …) and when a job is published for example in computer science..only users which are in computer science and who are interested in job are notified…</p>
<p>that why it is better to user : to_ids property.</p>
<p>thanks</p>

										<p><p>no. you need the id of the user. when you query for the username, grab the id as well, then you will have a username AND an id, then you can use the to_ids property that you want to use.</p>
<p>I was feeling left out of all this fun.</p>
