			<h1>Launch Titanium Developer in small resolution</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to run Titanium Developer on Mac that runs in 1024 x 576 resolution.</p>
<p>The app doesn&#39;t scale to this resolution and goes out of my screen. I cannot access the toolbar buttons so I can&#39;t really use it at all.</p>
<p>Why haven&#39;t you included the new project, import project, perspectives and update actions to the app main toolbar? That way it could at least be used somehow on smaller screens.</p>
<p>Is there any way to launch Titanium Developer in smaller size? Is it possible to use it fully from console? </p>
<p>Currently it cannot compile Android or iPhone at all, because it loaded just 1.0.0 sdk, so the new Android and iPhone sdk&#39;s aren&#39;t supported. It would have been nice for it to install the latest titanium sdk on first install, but it got 1.0.0 instead.</p>
<p>Any help for us with small screens and resolutions?</p>

							<p>The Titanium Developer app can easily be resized if you have access to the bottom right corner.  It seems to tolerate small sizes well, scrolling the middle contents and keeping necessary controls visible.</p>
<p>If you can&#39;t reach that corner look for a third party tool that will let you resize windows with the keyboard.  Found this in a quick search but have not tried it:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mindflow.dk&#x2F;software&#x2F;windowwrangler&#x2F;</p>
<p>Since TI doesn&#39;t appear to save size or position you&#39;ll need to do this on every launch if there isn&#39;t another way to change the startup size.</p>

										<p><p>Yea, the problem is that when Titanium Developer opens, it is centered to my screen. All sides go off from my screen, so I can&#39;t access the green plus icon in the top left corner or the resize area in bottom right corner.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll try that Window Wrangler, thanks for the hint! I&#39;ll report back the results.</p>

										<p><p>Window Wrangler worked perfect! Thanks a lot David for that, it&#39;ll be useful for other apps too with this small screen. Have to donate to the developer!</p>
<p>I just hope that in future Titanium Developer would scale automatically so that it wouldn&#39;t go out of bounds with small resolutions on first start. And also remember the window size and position on restart.</p>

							<p>Try clicking the green plus button in the top left corner. That should set the application to your full screen size. </p>
