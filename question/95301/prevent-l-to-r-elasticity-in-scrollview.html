			<h1>Prevent l-to-r elasticity in scrollView</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello all,<br>I have a scrollView with one view added to it. In portrait mode they are both 737px wide and the inner view doesn&#39;t move l-to-r which is the desired behavior.</p>
<p>When flip to landscape I need the views to be 652 wide but any width under 725 makes the inner view bounce around inside the scrollView.</p>
<p>I whittled the widths down from 737 to 724 and that&#39;s when the elasticity starts.</p>
<p>Anyone know what&#39;s going on or a workaround? Thx!</p>
<p>[edit] Hals answer below made me realize its not really about the elasticity, its just the l-to-r movement that occurs once you get less than 725 wide.</p>

							<p>Hi Kelly</p>
<p>I think it may be the <code>disableBounce</code> property of <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;latest&#x2F;Titanium.UI.ScrollView-object">Ti.UI.ScrollView</a> that you need.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Hal, that def stops the bounce but it still moves around when it&#39;s width is less than 724.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m not really sure what you mean, then. Are you able to take a video of the behavior?</p>

										<p><p>Yeah I don&#39;t know what it going on. If I take the same code I&#39;m using for my View and ScrollView and compile it outside of my app everything works fine at any width. I don&#39;t know how something in my app could be affecting them b&#x2F;c I thot everything was absolutely positioned. I tried creating a simple app.js file but my Ti is all of sudden is just refusing to build new files with 1.4.2 sdk and 1.5.1 is giving me some fatal error. so i&#39;m kinda dead in the water right now.</p>

										<p><p>ok seems to be a problem with the orientation change. if i make the all the widths the same for both orientations everything works fine, but when i tell it to change widths it&#39;s like it miscalculates something even tho all the widths are being changed proportionately. Orientation changes seems to be the only difference between the working version and non-working.</p>
