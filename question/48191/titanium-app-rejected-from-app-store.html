			<h1>Titanium app rejected from App Store</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve spent the last two months building an app in Titanium that I finally submitted to the app store last week.  The submission was built with Titanium 1.3.3 for SDK 4.0.  It was rejected with the following message:</p>
<p>&gt;Thank you for submitting Real Estate Sales Exam High Score Kit to the App Store.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;We&#39;ve completed the review of your application; however, because no audible content is played when the application is in the background, we cannot post this version to the App Store. We have included additional details below to help explain the issue. We hope you’ll consider revising and resubmitting your application.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;While your app has declared support for audio in the UIBackgroundModes key in your Info.plist, no audio is played when users switches to another application. The audio background mode is meant for applications with audio streams; like radio applications. You&#39;ll need to provide audible content to the user while the app is in the background or remove the &quot;audio&quot; setting from the UIBackgroundModes key.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;In addition, your application does not provide any functionality that requires persistent location, we cannot post this version to the App Store. We have included additional details below to help explain the issue.  We hope you’ll consider revising and resubmitting your application.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Your app has declared support for location in the UIBackgroundModes key in your Info.plist. Your app will need features that require location updates while the app is in the background or remove the &quot;location&quot; setting from the UIBackgroundModes key. You may want to refer to the section &quot;Executing Code in the Background&quot; found in the iPhone OS Reference Library &lt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;prerelease&#x2F;library&#x2F;navigation&#x2F;index.html&gt;.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;If you have any questions about this information, please feel free to reply to this email.  We look forward to reviewing your revised application.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Sincerely,<br>&gt;<br>&gt;App Review Team</p>
<p>So my question is this: How do I remove the &quot;audio&quot; and &quot;location&quot; settings from the UIBackgroundModes key so I can get my app approved? Can anyone tell me if this is something that has been fixed in 1.4?</p>
<p>P.S. – I <em>love</em> Titanium. Thanks for building such a great product!</p>

							<p>Nevermind. I think I found the answer in the release notes of 1.4 here:</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apidoc&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;1.4&#x2F;changelog.html</p>
<p>I&#39;ll play around with a custom Info.plist and see if that does the trick.</p>

							<p>They mentioned fix in 1.4. If you want to be sure, right click on your packaged app, select &quot;Show Package Contents&quot; and see your info.plist key nodes. </p>
