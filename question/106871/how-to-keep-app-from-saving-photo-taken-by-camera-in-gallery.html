			<h1>How to keep app from saving photo taken by camera in gallery</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve got an app for android, where I use the camera to take a photo, then load the photo into a view for use in the app. I don&#39;t need to save this photo once it&#39;s been used in the view.<br>I noticed however, that if I go into the gallery on the phone (outside of my app), that it is saving all of these photos into the gallery.  Potentially, the app could use all the memory by doing this.<br><em>*</em> How do I keep the app from saving these photos to the gallery?</p>
<p>I want to be able to take a photo, use it in a view, then discard the photo (and not save it to the gallery).  How is this accomplished?</p>

							<p>You didn&#39;t show us your code, but I suspect that among your properties inside the Titanium.Media.showCamera() method you are including:</p>
<p><code>saveToPhotoGallery: true</code></p>
<p>Either specify false, or leave the property out.  You should also look at some kitchen sink examples such as <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;KitchenSink&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;KitchenSink&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;examples&#x2F;camera_file.js">this</a> which saves the image to a file but not the gallery.  Or <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;KitchenSink&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;KitchenSink&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;examples&#x2F;camera_overlay.js">this</a> which takes a picture and loads it into an ImageView without saving it anywhere.  The second may be closest to what your current app is trying to accomplish.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you for the response.<br>I&#39;ve played with putting the &#39;saveToPhotoGallery:true&#39; vs &#39;saveToPhotoGallery:false&#39; in and this is what happens.<br>When I have this set to TRUE, the image is saved in my gallery under &#39;Camera Pictures&#39;, &#39;Camera Media&#39;, and &#39;All Pictures&#39;.<br>When I set it to FALSE, the image is still saved in my gallery but in different areas. They&#39;re saved under &#39;MyApplicationName&#39;, and &#39;All Pictures&#39;.  </p>
<p>I played around with the 2nd code snippet you linked to from kitchen sink that is supposed to take a picture, load it into an ImageView without saving it anywhere.  But it still saves it in the gallery under the appName and all pictures, the same as if I use &#39;saveToPhotoGallery:false&#39;.  </p>
<p>The problem, is that it&#39;s still saving these pics, and the end user will have to go in and manually delete them - otherwise risk running out of memory&#x2F;storage.</p>

										<p><p>Sorry, I didn&#39;t notice you had posted a reply because I did not subscribe to the thread, and comments don&#39;t make the question float back to the top of the list.  :(</p>
<p>If it is still getting saved to the gallery, then I think you need to show us the complete code.  Something is happening somewhere, because that should not be the default behavior.  For example, try the kitchen sink examples and they do NOT save to the gallery (except for the ones designed to do so of course).</p>
<p>At a minimum, do a search for &quot;gallery&quot; across all the *.js files used in the project (even if by include instead of the window context directly).  I really think you will find something buried somewhere.</p>
<p>Also, can you tell us what SDK level you are using, and which iOS version is being used on the device?</p>

							<p>Same problem with SDK 2.0.1 on Htc Sensation running Android 4.0.3 and Motorola Milestone running on Android 2.3.7.<br>The only difference is, that if saveToPhotoGallery is true the photo is saved in a folder named Camera.<br>If saveToPhotoGallery is set to false it is saved to a folder named like the project name.</p>
