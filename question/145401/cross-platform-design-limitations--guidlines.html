		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have been playing with Titanium for a week now. I am going to work on an application shortly, this application is supposed to be working on both android and ios.</p>
<p>Since I have little to no experience with creating apps (this will be my first) I was wondering about design limitations. The designer wants the app on both ios and android looking almost identically (which I can imagine won&#39;t be possible).</p>
<p>Is there any list available of &quot;designer do&#39;s and dont&#39;s&quot;?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

							<p>Well, what strikes me the most in your statement is the part where it says: <strong>The designer wants the app on both ios and android looking almost identically</strong>.</p>
<p>It makes little to no sense to have a native application that uses the native functionality and trying to <em>shoehorn</em> one way of doing thing into another platform. (for example, navigation on iOS is completely different that on Android) And making an Android behave like an iOS app will feel odd and out of place.</p>
<p>Now don&#39;t get me wrong though, there are a lot of commons things you can reuse between the two. And you can also give them a common look and feel that clearly identifies the application.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your response, that is why I was hoping if there is a list of some sorts somewhere where these differences are shown. I think it is best if I just tell the designer both apps won&#39;t be identicall but can have the same look and feel. Do you perhaps know the most comming cross platform mistakes designers make or something?</p>
