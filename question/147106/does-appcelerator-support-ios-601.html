							<p>Hi</p>
<p>You have not provided enough detail to provide a full answer yet but here is what I can provide;</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes; Appcelerator apps will and do work on iOS 6.01</li>
<li>Apple are shortly going to release iOS 6.1, you should be testing on that</li>
<li>iOS 6.1 is not currently officially supported by Appcelerator yet, but I doubt there is anything that different that anything more than minor tweaks will require from 6.x to 6.1.</li>
<li>Your statement about &quot;…without going to iOS 4 or iOS 5…&quot; is confusing as iOS 6 is higher.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on when you created your app you may find that you are UNABLE to compile using your previous SDK as it may not be new enough to actually support iOS 6 compatible xcode.</p>
<p>If this is the case you will need to upgrade the SDK your app was developed against, test in the simulator and any issues fixed.  Depending on which SDK your app was built against issues will be anything from small layout changes required to modules no longer compatible.</p>
