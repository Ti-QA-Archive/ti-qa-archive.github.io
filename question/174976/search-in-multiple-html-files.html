							<p>Yes it can be doable locally also with titanium Filesystem API, but this will consume lot of device memory, and can take lot of time in search and even application may get crash. Instead of this what i will suggest you is if possible than  implement this feature on your server  end.</p>
<p>Second option is store the file name and the keyword on the basis of which you want search in database, and on the basis of user input you can find the name in the database using select query and can provide file to the user. </p>
<p>So this 2 are the approaches which you can follow for better application performance.</p>
