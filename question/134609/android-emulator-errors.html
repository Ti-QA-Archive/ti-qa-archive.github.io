			<h1>Android Emulator Errors</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am new to Titanium and have a very generic question about Android Emulator. </p>
<p>I have installed Titanium Studio 1.8.2 and Android SDK 1.7. The Android Emulator presents errors<br>and they are not the same.</p>
<p>Sometimes we stay waiting for the application to start and … nothing. Then you run it again<br>without making any change and it runs. </p>
<p>I would like to know if there is some kind of guide and essential steps we must take to have<br>a reliable android development environment.</p>
<p>What must I do ???? Where should I look for information</p>
<p>Thenks in advance</p>

							<p>There is some sensors in android that are not present in emulator so it gives error or there is a a process that ended and called so it generate error.</p>
<p>regarding about the delay so when memory card installed get ready then your application runs in your emulator. When emulator runs first time it take more time to initialized when initialized properly then there is a FAST DEVELOPMENT is available for android emulator. It reduce process compile time and run your faster in android development.</p>

							<p>Unfortunately the Android emulator isn&#39;t very reliable. I personally would recommend using a device instead, because no matter how perfect your app works on the emulator, it will most likely behave slightly differently on an actual device (even if you select the same properties to emulate). </p>
<p>This is only what I have observed from my personal experience with Android, I would highly recommend to get a physical device instead. It runs much faster and gives you more accurate results. Sometimes you will have a runtime error on the device, which you won&#39;t get on the emulator. </p>
<p>But to answer your question about the long loading time when starting the emulator, this sometimes happens to me, too. You just to go back into TiStudio and re-run the app, without closing down the emulator itself. You sometimes just have to play around, before the emulator decides to work. I have no idea myself why this happens. I would assume the emulator is waiting on a process that already has been executed, because it took too long for the emulator to boot up, but I can&#39;t say that for 100% certainty.. just a guess.. </p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
