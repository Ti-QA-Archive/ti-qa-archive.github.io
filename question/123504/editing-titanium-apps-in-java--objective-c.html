			<h1>Editing Titanium apps in Java / Objective C</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Is it possible to start an app in Titanium, compile it and then work on it later in the native Java&#x2F;Objective C environments?  Would this be easy to do or does much of the code remain in Javascript?</p>

							<p>Aside from how feasible it is, this strikes me as making future project maintenance incredibly more complicated than necessary.  If you want to do this so that you can incorporate things you can do in the native environment which the Titanium SDK does not yet expose, then IMHO a <strong>far</strong> better alternative is to code just those functions in a native module which you call from your Titanium project.</p>
<p>You should read more about creating native <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Module+Developer+Guide+for+iOS">ios</a> and <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Module+Developer+Guide+for+Android">android</a> modules.</p>
<p>To more directly answer your question, no it would not be easy to do.  It is a common misconception that all of the javascript gets converted into native code for each platform.  That isn&#39;t quite the way it works.  Two of the best explanations I have seen are <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;2444001&#x2F;how-does-appcelerator-titanium-mobile-work&#x2F;2471774#2471774">here</a> and <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;4217551&#x2F;what-happens-to-javascript-code-after-app-is-compiled-using-titanium-mobile">here</a>.</p>
<p>I suggest you build both an iOS and android distribution build for a project, then go look at the respective build folders and examine the source produced.  Yes, you <strong>can</strong> edit it and use the .&#x2F;build.py script to recompile.  But I really don&#39;t think you want to go there.</p>
<p>If the intent is to accomplish things you can&#39;t in the current Titanium SDKs, I strongly suggest you instead consider putting those in custom modules.</p>
<p>YMMV.</p>

										<p><p>The reason I was asking is that a potential client is interested in having thprototype &#x2F; mock UI built up for an app.  They would then take over and develop further (they develop in native Java).</p>
<p>Thanks for the info, maybe best for them to develop it all.</p>

										<p><p>If the prototype does not need to be fully functional but just present mock pages, it may still be a quick way to produce a demonstration of the proposed UI.  But I would not suggest using the prototype&#39;s java output as the starting point for a native project.</p>
<p>IMHO.  YMMV.</p>
