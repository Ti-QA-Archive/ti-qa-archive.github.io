		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m looking for tutorials that actually walk through coding in appcelerator, which aren&#39;t in absolutely random order, and&#x2F;or only about summing up the basic capabilities of the program. </p>
<p>Any pointers in the right direction would be appreciated.<br>This seems to be a good series of examples of what I&#39;m looking for:<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;playlist?list=PLB23080FAF7A135EC&amp;feature=plcp</p>
<p>Any other tuts out there for a novice?</p>
<p>I&#39;m also not at all interested in using cloud, just the raw code.</p>

										<p><p>Then don&#39;t take months to do it. That&#39;s the materials they use in the instructor-led training, which all together is only 8 full days. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;training.appcelerator.com&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;training.appcelerator.com&#x2F;</a></p>

										<p><p>Nine bucks might sound small to you, but imagine if you had to fly to these classes too, and doing so cut off your main source of income for a few months, held back your degree a few months and most assuredly lost you the internship that started you on this trek in the first place. You&#39;d probably want something a little more practical than a class in Canada when you live in Oregon.</p>
<p>Really, I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re supposed to advertise this stuff, but I can&#39;t use it.</p>

										<p><p>You have seriously misunderstood something. I&#39;ll try one last time, then you&#39;re on your own.</p>
<p>Appcelerator took the materials from their instructor-led classes, which normally cost <em>thousands</em> of dollars, and decided to make them available for free, on github. So, instead of paying anything, you can just use them yourself for free. There&#39;s no &quot;nine bucks&quot;, flying, or months of time involved. Go download them, and you can probably get through them in 1-2 weeks. For free.</p>

										<p><p>I guess there is something I don&#39;t understand. I&#39;m looking at github and I really don&#39;t understand what I&#39;m looking at. I downloaded one of the zip files, the one for reveal.js, but can&#39;t install anything. Windows can recognize a few things, but not the actual files. I&#39;m guessing this is supposed to be for apple computers. Anything for a windows user? Sorry for accusing you of advertising, though I didn&#39;t say it to be mean. Yes, I skimmed the article, sorry, I found links to github a site I didn&#39;t understand, a guy who read like a sales person and links to live classes.</p>

										<p><p>Wow, Shannon was really just trying to help you out and point you in the right direction David. The Titanium community is extremely helpful and really are not out to sell anything. The link alone should have told you that when it says &quot;open source training&quot; that isn&#39;t a paid course.</p>
<p>There are some great directions at the bottom of the Github page that can get you going. To that end, i understand that you are just starting out, trust me, i was there not long ago, and much of this did not make sense at all, but i hunkered down and learned what i could with the resources available. What Shannon told you about is a great resource along with the training videos that are on <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;training.appcelerator.com&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;training.appcelerator.com&#x2F;</a> which Shannon also pointed out. </p>
<p>Also there is a good training series on Lynda.com except you have to pay which you seem to be completely against. But these are your options at this point.</p>

										<p><p>Never said I was against paying money, just that I was against going to Canada for a week plus and more than likely losing a month of school and the entire internship that landed me on this path. That was all based on a misunderstanding and I will not debate the point. That being said, I might look at Lynda.com now that you said something. </p>
<p>I&#39;m sorry, but looking at the instructions on</p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hakimel&#x2F;reveal.js&#x2F;</p>
<p>not only are they targeted at the code savvy, but also they&#39;re not installation instructions, they&#39;re usage instructions. Finally, thanks, but I&#39;m aware of the training videos, in fact I watched the overview series for about five hours before I finally gave up on them realizing they never touch on anything but theory and basic product capability. Are there any where someone actually steps through an actual or simulated program and explain how it was put together, especially WITHOUT switching to power point slides covering up the screen so I can&#39;t see the code?</p>
