			<h1>Installation failed - behind corporate firewall</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve seen a lot of questions about the same thing, but none have been answered. I&#39;m behind a corporate firewall, and installation fails with the message &quot;Could not find query info&quot;.  </p>
<p>Is there an offline installer that I can download?</p>
<p>I&#39;m about to make a decision whether to use Adobe Air or Titanium, and this unfortunately looks like it is going to be the decider for me…</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Paul</p>

							<p>Really upset. I got the same issue. Without a offline installer is quite unfriendly. It tooks me almost 2 days for installing the titanium developer. </p>
<p>The solution is to setup a route to the download server of appcelerator. For windows, you should add following two lines to your windows&#x2F;system32&#x2F;drivers&#x2F;etc&#x2F;hosts:</p>
<p>75.101.138.225 api.appcelerator.net</p>
<p>216.137.39.113 cloud2.appcelerator.net</p>
<p>For api.appcelerator.net, it use fixed ip. This one should work.<br>For cloud2.appcelerator.net, it use dynamic ip as it is probably on amazon&#39;s s3, so the ip here maybe not work, you should try to get the correct ip first.</p>

							<p>I realized that any question that deals with offline installation is completely ignored in this Q&amp;A. Many people that are seriously interested in knowing Titanium are annoyed but this. I can not think of any known open source application that uses exclusively offline installers :-(</p>
<p>I presume that there is some high level decision in the company to not address this issue within the community. If not, why not just comment on those questions?</p>
<p>By the way, I have also had to make a decision between Titanium and Adobe AIR. I think i will take AIR…</p>

							<p>I travel a lot and I am frustrated by the lack of offline functionality.  Today I have spent a little time poking inside Titanium Developer and I think it can be run offline with some code changes.  If I am successful I will upload a version for people to try.</p>

							<p>I would think it&#39;s simple.  They want to track installations so they can show potential investors &quot;Look at how many installs we have.&quot;</p>
