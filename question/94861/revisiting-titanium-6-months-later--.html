			<h1>Revisiting titanium 6 months later :-( </h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have outlined in a different post how frustrating it is to revisit titanium after 4-5 months and see that the old problems are still there. </p>
<p>Would like to sum some of these up here (as of December 29th 2010) and like to see these get solved as soon as possible. </p>
<p>I am developing for Android with titanium developer 1.2.2 and mobile SDK 1.5.1 - on a fast laptop. Windows 7. </p>
<p>(1) Update function of Ti Dev. This works only in a row - when you get back to Titanium after some months Ti Dev prompts for the installation of the latest Desktop SDK first, then eventually (after several minutes) the installation of the latest mobile SDK and again after tenths of minuts the installation of the next version of Ti Developer itself. This works, but on each restart of Ti Developer the download process is repeated for unknown reason. This has been the same problem in previous releases, as I vaguely remember. I&#39;m not getting into this again, there might be something in Q&#x2F;A, but I don&#39;t care.  Don&#39;t post a workaround on some hidden Q&#x2F;A place - solve it !</p>
<p>If you click on the right upper titanium button (it seems to be one) in Ti Developer nothing happens. There should be an immediate output saying &#39;all up-to-date&#39; or &#39;New SDK&#39;s available&#39;….</p>
<p>Ti Dev is slower than 6 months ago - just not very responsive. Clicking the links or the images is cumbersome. </p>
<p>(2) &#39;Compiling&#39; for the emulators takes way too long. Compilation of a small project with two *.js files takes between 2-3 minutes, sometimes longer, sometimes hangs, which can only get solved by pressing &#39;Launch&#39; again. &#39;Stop&#39; sometimes works, sometimes it is greyed out. </p>
<p>(3) APK Installation. Installation of an apk on the emulator by TI Dev is a matter of luck. somtimes it works, other times it hangs. Restarting of Ti Dev and the emulator  helps but is not professional. </p>
<p>(4) Website</p>
<p>There is still (!) no permanent login to the website. A cookie that is recognized preventing that you have to login all over again each day. Could somebody tell me one time why this is not done ? Implementation takes about 15 minutes. Let me do it for you :-) </p>
<p>Q&#x2F;A has not changed much. You neeed to put the posts in logical order (!) within a question. latest posts at the end.<br>Q&#x2F;A without categories is not useful at all. This post is a good example. It should not be on top of all posts, because it is negative (although constructive) feedback to your product, which could keep off potential pro customers. This post should go into a category &#39;suggestions&#39; and stay away from the rest. Pls go and create categories ! </p>
<p>API documentation is sparse. I miss working, complete code examples. </p>
<p>And: I just do NOT want to look at your kitchensink example. When do you get over this ? You want us to download it again and again in the 24th version just to find out ourself what has changed ? No way …</p>
<p>Feel free to add to this list !</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>rudolf</p>

No. This way, if you install KS on your phone, you would be notified of KS updates whenever substantial new stuff has been added. You could update KS, try it out, and if you need any of the new functions in your project you could go and download KS sources.

							<div><p>Android emulator is actually not titanium software, it comes from the Android SDK. It is a well known fact that you need to kill all atb.exe processes running from previous emulators for Android. If you run Eclipse or Titanium makes no difference… Kill all atb.exe in processmanager, and start emulator first, and keep it running. It solves a lot of the problems described above.</p>

							<p>Rudolf,</p>
<p>Might I simply state that I am not having the issues you state, however that being said I am using OS X not windows 7.</p>
<p>I do agree that the docs are too limited, and needing to DL the Kitchen Sink is not cool, but its an open source project, so you or anyone could update te docs at any time, so clearly although it sucs, it clearly does not suck enough for anyone to take action. The same goes for any other aspect of the issues you or anyone has. </p>
<p>If you do not feel qualified to take action to fix these items yourself, then we always have the option of submitting a bug report in appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com, as the Q  and A section is not the best place to file a bug as its almost imposable to track fr the devs.</p>
<p>I am not trying to attack you, but simply wish to assist you in your endeavors to improve Titanium :)</p>
<p>Regards,<br>Matt</p>

							<p>Hello R B and thanks for checking out Titanium again.</p>
<p>So, there are three main issues that you&#39;re raising - Developer, Q&amp;A, and Docs.  Our focus during the period you describe (for that matter, 2010) has been on building out the core API set.  The release notes for each version show the major improvements in the API… and they are material.  On the PC, this is especially true for Android.  I&#39;d certainly encourage you to look at the most recent release notes for Android as that&#39;s been a major investment&#x2F;focus area.</p>
<p>On Developer, well, that experience can be improved.  All I can say on that one is that we&#39;ll be making some significant announcements in January that will go a long way to resolve those issues.</p>
<p>As for Q&amp;A&#x2F;login, those are good suggestions and we are looking to refresh Q&amp;A in Q1.</p>
<p>Finally, on docs, I&#39;d certainly encourage you to check out our new Titanium Guides section.  It has over 30 new guides on all areas of Titanium development.  We can do more, but this too is an area we&#39;re working on.</p>
<p>In any case, thanks for coming back and we look forward to seeing what cool new app you come up with ;-)</p>

							<p>Thanks, Scott, for your comments. Sounds like good news. </p>
<p>I have noticed in fact that Ti API has improved very much and some of the older problems have resolved. On the other hand, new have added (f.e. I cant fire the touchend event from a normal button in 1.5.1).</p>
<p>I think appcelerator titanium is an amazing project and I would really like to see it growing. The new Tutorial section is great. </p>
<p>If I or we can be of any help please let us know. I&#39;ll add to my comment list from time (which will not push this post up in the Q&#x2F;A list) to time if I find something which would really be worth fixing. </p>
<p>May you and your team have a good new year. </p>
<p>rudolf</p>

							<p>I&#39;m new to Appcelerator&#x2F;iPhone development&#x2F;Mac world having spent a life time coding .Net and other environments. However I would say that appcelerator had enabled me to get iphone apps up and running very quickly. is it perfect?….no, the documentation is good enough to help me get through some questions and the kitchensink app helped me a lot…it is a good reference source. My long term aim is to develop apps using Unity3d however this is requiring a longer investment in time. Appcelerator allows me to get some of some of my more standard iphone apps running quickly and for free!! for this I can forgive some of its short comings.</p>
