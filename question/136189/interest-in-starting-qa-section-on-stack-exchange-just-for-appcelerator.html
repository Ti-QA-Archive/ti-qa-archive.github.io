			<h1>Interest in starting Q&amp;A section on Stack Exchange just for Appcelerator</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Is there any interest in starting a Q&amp;A section on  Stack Exchange (SE) just for Appcelerator?</p>
<p>Reason I ask is that the functionality and community support within this Q&amp;A section in my opinion is holding back the community.</p>
<p>Examples include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inline code support within answer is malformed</li>
<li>It is not possible to delete a question</li>
<li>It is not possible to flag a question</li>
<li>It is not possible to answer you own question and select it as the answer</li>
<li>Users often confuse answers and comments</li>
<li>It is not easy to see the users community score within their answer</li>
<li>The system does not appear to have an inbox system to get messages about updates to your own questions, answers, comments – or comments to you.</li>
<li>Question and answers can not be edited after being posted, though SE allows edits, shows a notice when&#x2F;who edited them, and links to a wiki of the edits. </li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly, I&#39;m a little biased, since I already use SE, and there&#39;s really no reason both Q&amp;A section can&#39;t exist, though I believe the community would greatly benefit from switching to that platform, and since the context would be &quot;community commons&quot;  – there would be nothing to stop Appcelerator from creating a local static index of the content with links to the live SE question.</p>
<p><strong>Any thoughts?</strong></p>
<p>Here are some examples of questions that are tagged on the main coding Q&amp;A site for Stack Exchange already, if a Appcelerator Q&amp;A site was created, these questions would just be ported to the new Appcelerator only site on Stack Exchange. </p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;tagged&#x2F;appcelerator">Appcelerator</a> (595 questions with tag)<br><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;tagged&#x2F;titanium">Titanium</a> (1,169) <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;tagged&#x2F;aptana">Aptana</a> (980)</p>
<p>Also, to be clear, while I do use SE, I&#39;m not officially or unofficially related to them, I just am finding the functional lags in this Q&amp;A site to be unneeded and in my opinion, easily addressed by switching the platform for the Appcelerator Dev Q&amp;A section. Also, more to the point, I&#39;ve been very impressed by how friendly, knowledgeable, and responsive the community is – which is all the more reason why I believe the switch would make a huge difference.  </p>

							<p><strong>Site:</strong> Okay, I&#39;ve created a <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;area51.stackexchange.com&#x2F;proposals&#x2F;40242&#x2F;appcelerator">beta site for an Appceletor only Q&amp;A</a> site on Stack Exchange(SE). </p>
<p><strong>Launch Process:</strong> Stack Exchange requires that the site go through a review&#x2F;commit process before it&#39;s live to the public. See the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;area51.stackexchange.com&#x2F;faq">site proposal FAQs</a> for more info.</p>
<p><strong>Joining:</strong> Anyone is welcome to join, if you have any problems setting up an account, or taking part in moving the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;area51.stackexchange.com&#x2F;proposals&#x2F;40242&#x2F;appcelerator">beta site for an Appceletor only Q&amp;A</a> – just comment, or email me at: appc.mentor@gmail.com</p>
<p><strong>Existing SE users:</strong> If you&#39;re currently an SE user, 35 more sample questions need to be posted (I&#39;ve already posted 5) – and then each of those questions needs to get 10 upvotes; which translates to we only need 11 users to sign-up and then upvote the the 40 questions posted to move it onto the next stage in the review process.</p>
<p><strong>What are good questions to post:</strong> Just the the main <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;faq">FAQ on the subject on StackOverflow</a> – and just a heads up that most of the sub-sections on that page have more information about each sub-section if you click &quot;show more&quot; within the sub-section.</p>
<p><strong>Finding Good Questions to Post:</strong> If you understand what a good question is on SE, meaning it&#39;s possible to objectively answer the question, it&#39;s super easy to quickly find questions to post. Just to the <a href="developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;most-votes">Most Votes</a> on Appcelerator Q&amp;A and look for good questions, or the questions with the most votes on SE site for coding, StackOverflow, and look at the questions with the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;tagged&#x2F;titanium?sort=votes&amp;pagesize=15">most votes</a>. Please do take the time to edit the questions to make sure you belief they&#39;re as great of a question as possible, which will help the process move much faster. </p>
<p><strong>Thanks:</strong> Thanks, and if you have any questions. Let me know!</p>

							<p>Yes definitely. We also need a place that can compile a list of all modules, gists, example apps on githhub with hopefully someway or discussing reviewing them. Any ideas?</p>
<p>I would particularly like a place where we collaborate on commonjs modules for common functionality like authentication, forms, syncing, geolocation etc.</p>

										<p><p>Great, thanks for posting an answer supporting the effort!!  <strong>(1)</strong> If you have the 3-mins, please visit the site (<a href="bitly.com&#x2F;AppcMentor">bitly.com&#x2F;AppcMentor</a>) and just click the &quot;Follow It!&quot; button; creating a quick account would be of HUGE help at the point, since currently we need 60 followers to move on to the next stage. <strong>(2)</strong> After doing that, if you&#39;re got 1-min more, upvote the existing questions that are ontopic, since we need 10-question with 10-upvotes too. <strong>(3)</strong> If you&#39;ve got 10-mins after that, please post the 5-sample-questions you&#39;re allowed to post, and I&#39;ll upvote every single on you post that&#39;s ontopic. <strong>(4)</strong> REQUEST Just a heads up that if you get to the point of posting questions, StackExchange is requiring the site to prove it&#39;s worth having it&#39;s own site, and not just sending people to StackOverflow instead. Per their suggestion, to do this, the sample questions must be about Appcelerator install&#x2F;config topics; reason being that on StackOverflow these type questions would be offtopic, and by us including these type question StackExchange should allow us to push the site through the red-tape that current exist. Feel free to email me at appc.mentor@gmail.com if you need sample questions to post, I&#39;d be happy to send you five. <strong>(5)</strong> Important updates are being posting to (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;AppcMentor">twitter.com&#x2F;AppcMentor</a>) – and if you need a tinyurl to share, feel free to use this one (<a href="bitly.com&#x2F;AppcMentor">bitly.com&#x2F;AppcMentor</a>) – Again, thanks!!</p>

										<p><p>Also, just a heads-up that after the Q&amp;A site is past the proposal phase, it would be easy to just add community-wiki page for the indexes of resources that you&#39;re talking about, plus it not knowing to much about the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;dashboard.action">Appcelerator Wiki</a> policies it&#39;s possible they could go there too. I&#39;ll have to take a look at the reddit page you linked to, looks awesome… :-)</p>
