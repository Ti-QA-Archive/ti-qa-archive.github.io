			<h1>Why alloy?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi <em>,<br>I&#39;am working since long time with this awesome framework named titanium in classic form.<br>Since 3.</em> we have this MVC-framework alloy.  The advantage: separating of view oand model. Now a designer can create the view.</p>
<p>I know, alloy generates a &quot;normal&quot; TiProject. Thats why I cannot create other things as in old school.</p>
<p>My question: if I try  to build my next projects with alloy: I&#39;am afraid about limitations of functionality and flexibility. This Q&amp;A is full of problems …</p>
<p>Is it worth it to upgrade to? Are there limitations?</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Rainer</p>

							<p>Hello Rainer,</p>
<p>Here are my two cents. While Alloy is the main direction Appcelerator wants the Framework to go. There is absolutely nothing stopping you from using <em>classic Titanium</em> as your code base. Keep in mind that while it is easy to create mobile applications using Titanium, it is also very easy to generate bad code that don&#39;t abide by any design pattern. It is my understanding that Alloy, by forcing developers to follow a certain path, can do some of the heavy lifting for you. (releasing objects from memory, generate requireJS code, etc.) Hence being a huge gain for medium to low-level developers.</p>
<p>Of course, for developers like you who have deep knowledge of the framework, Alloy brings much less value to the table. That&#39;s kind of the same old debate between managed code (like Java or .NET) and native code (C or C++). Both approaches have their advantages and their faults. For example, native code might perform better, but it is more prone to memory leaks and bugs if the developer is not highly skilled. (you see where I&#39;m going with this…) </p>
<p>In conclusion, I think that Alloy might actually improve the overall quality of many applications since not all developers are highly proficient with Titanium (as you are in this case). But I think that using the <em>classic</em> approach (that will always be available btw) will always provide more flexibility since you have full control over the code base.</p>
<p>As I said, that&#39;s my two cents</p>

										<p><p>As I said, it is clear that you really know your stuff. There is an old saying <em>&quot;If it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it!&quot;</em>. So you can continue going forward with the way you develop your apps.</p>
<p>But you really should have a look (even from a far) at Alloy. I sure know I was skeptical at first. My now, I&#39;m starting to see some real value into this…</p>

										<p><p>Christian impressed with your detail answer but i have one question the ios simulator is not dealing much good with alloy app.It is taking 2-3 minutes to load the app and then finally saying emulator time delayed what do you want to say about these are these problem going to be solved or this would continue</p>

										<p><p>Muhammad, if the iOS sim is taking 2-3 minutes to load your app, there&#39;s something wrong with your setup. I&#39;ve never heard of this issue and in mine and many others&#39; experiences, this should be only a couple seconds, basically the same as traditional titanium development. How can we possible unreported issues that we have not encountered?</p>
<p>Also, don&#39;t you think this very specific issue would be better resolved in its own question? There&#39;s a whole lot of relevant information not included in your question and this isn&#39;t the appropriate venue for it.</p>

										<p><p>I come from a Flash &#x2F; Flex background. I see a lot of parallels (development wise) between Alloy and Flex. Both are XML-based languages that are easy to understand and use, and have compilers that generate the &quot;real&quot; code for the platform… Javascript for Alloy&#x2F;Ti, Actionscript for Flex&#x2F;Flash.</p>
<p>Eventually it became obvious that if you wanted the best performance, needed to build a larger, more complex application, or needed precision, you would have to leave the comfort of Flex and write some native, low-level Actionscript. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll find, over time, that Alloy has similar handicaps.</p>
<p>Now, like Christian eluded to, if your low-level code is crap, your application will still be crap. &quot;Using Javascript&quot; or &quot;Using Alloy&quot; are irrelevant if you are not a developer with a good understanding of development fundamentals, and an understanding of what is happening in Native land for any particular block of code.</p>
<p>Spoiler Alert: Eventually it came to pass that best practice for Flex was to not use XML for anything other than the View level… and even then it was only if your views were simple. The generated Actionscript was never as good as good, developer-written Actionscript.</p>

										<p><p>Shannon, you well know where I draw much of my inspiration for Alloy. But to be fair, in Flash&#x2F;Flex, performance was much more of a concern as Flash was limited by the constraints of the runtime and the fact that it was known for chewing up all available resources like a hog. Alloy, via Titanium, is not so tightly constrained as was Flex, via Flash, since its API maps to native calls, not ones in an intermediate runtime. </p>
<p>I disagree in no way that a highly skilled developer can almost always hand-code a project to fully maximize a platform better than a framework would. I do however disagree with the implication that because using views in Flex was eventually discouraged that the same goes for Alloy. It&#39;s a different playing field.</p>

										<p><p>The traditional Titanium way of development will not be gotten rid of. Alloy, in fact, relies on it. Those comfortable and more adept at traditional Titanium development are welcome to continue down that path and will not be prevented in any way from doing so.</p>

										<p><p>For what it&#39;s worth, my two cents as a Senior Developer in Appcelerator&#39;s Professional Services team… I can&#39;t imagine life, now, without Alloy. The flexibility is enormous, allowing you to let Alloy handle the small and time-consuming tasks, while still giving you the option to dive deeper within the Titanium SDK (I love over-riding some of Alloy&#39;s methods).</p>
<p>The biggest reason I&#39;m loving Alloy, though, has go to be the UI&#x2F;UX development process. UI code that used to take a few days to build out for a complex application now takes a few hours. In fact, yesterday I built an entire application&#39;s UI&#x2F;UX for a major client in 4 hours. 4 HOURS!</p>
<p>The project went from high-risk timeline to no-risk in a single day, and it was all thanks to Alloy.</p>
<p>If you stick with Alloy for a little while you&#39;ll begin to swear by it. It takes some time getting your little starter-library all set up, but afterwards it&#39;s absolutely amazing.</p>

<p>In short, Alloy doesn&#39;t limit you in any way. Anything you can do in traditional Titanium development you can do in Alloy. You can still create things with the old Titanium APIs and use them along with Alloy generated code.</p>

							<p>Hello Rainer,</p>
<p>I think your app is definitely appropriate for alloy, the same things appropriate for Titanium in general work with Alloy. One of the key things to think about is that using Alloy will not necessarily speed up development time. That is not the goal, the goal is to separate the concerns (Model View Controller), and provide cross-platform and multiple form factor support. If you are interested purely in speed of development stick with regular Titanium.</p>
<p>However, where it can speed up dev time is in your persistence strategy, sql integration of models is built in with Alloy. So, if this flashcard app your thinking of creating has the users creating flashcards on their phone, then using them later, I would definitely go with Alloy to take advantage of the model stuff.</p>
<p>Take note that the documentation is kind of sparse, I ported an existing clients project to Alloy and really had to find my own way on a lot of things, but It was not a simple app.</p>
<p>Essentially, if you want to 1) Release to multiple platforms and form factors and not have migraines, 2) Have a built-in easy to use persistence strategy, 3) Be able to maintain your code at a later date, or have other people look at it and be able to tell whats going on, then I would definitely use Alloy.</p>
