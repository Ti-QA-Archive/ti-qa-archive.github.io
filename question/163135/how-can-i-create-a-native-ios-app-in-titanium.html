			<h1>How can I create a native iOS app in Titanium?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have downloaded Titanium_Studio.exe for Windows. I have installed it and I have configured the<br>SDK for android.</p>
<p>I created a new native android app  following the instructions in the following url:<br><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Creating_Your_First_Titanium_App">Create your first Titanium App</a>.</p>
<p>Now I would like to create the same app for iOS using the same javascript code for iOS.<br>My operating system is Windows, what shall i do in order create a native .ipa application?</p>
<p>I would like to create the same hello app for iOS,how can I do that?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>ps. If I have understood well, in Titanium I write Javascript code for native android and iOS apps, right?<br>That means, that I write my code once and I can export a .apk file or an .ida file.<br>I&#39;m new to it and I would like to be sure about that, that I won&#39;t need to write in Objective C<br>after I have already written some code for android app in Javascript.</p>

							<p>You can only develop iOS Apps using a Mac I&#39;m afraid. iOS Apps are built using XCode which is only available on the Mac OS platform. You can also develop Android Apps on a Mac too.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, for replying. That means that </p>
<p>1) I shall find a Mac computer </p>
<p>2)  install Titanium in Mac, </p>
<p>3) download Xcode. </p>
<p>In which IDE am I going to write Javascript for iOS? Titanium or Xcode?<br>Because it&#39;s not clear to me. Why do I have to download Xcode as well since<br>Titanium already provides an IDE.</p>
<p>Am I going to write javascript for iOS in Titanium or in Xcode?<br> As I mentioned above, I have already downloaded the Titanium for Windows, downloaded Android SDK and made my first native android app.</p>

										<p><p>Yes to 1,2 &amp; 3. You can find the full details <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Installing_the_iOS_SDK">here</a>.</p>
<p>You will use Ti Studio (or the text editor of your choice) to write your javascript to implement a cross platform app. The benefit of Ti Studio over a simple text editor is that it includes toolbar options that perform the builds for you (instead of using the Command Line Interface)</p>

										<p><p>Xcode is required because that is what is used to create an ipa. The objective-C code is generated by Titanium and passed to xCode for compilation and packaging</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for replying, I&#39;m new to Titanium and a lot of things are not clear to me.</p>
<p>1) Does &quot;Ti Studio&quot; stand for Titanium Studio?</p>
<p>2) So,I write the Javascript code for iOS in Ti Studio but I can&#39;t compile and build it in Windows, cause I need the iOS SDK that is integrated in Xcode, right?</p>
<p>3)  Can I download the iOS SDK separately in Windows, transform the Javascript code that I have written in Windows to objective-C in Ti Studio and after that, can I work on a MAC computer and import the objective-c code in Xcode in order to take a .ipa app?</p>

										<p><p>1). Yes</p>
<p>2). No, you can ONLY build Android Apps and NOT iOS Apps on Windows. But you can build BOTH on a Mac</p>
<p>3). No, You cant do ANYTHING to do with iOS on Windows.  Its NOT possible. You must do your development for iOS on a Mac</p>
