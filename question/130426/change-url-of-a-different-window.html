			<h1>Change URL of a Different Window</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey Guys,</p>
<p>Ok so this question might be a little weird so I&#39;ll try to say it as simple as possible (sorry if it comes across confusing). </p>
<p>So, my question is whether or not it is possible to change the URL in a different window? I am mainly asking for iPhone but it applies to Android as well.</p>
<p>For example, if you have taken a look at the Facebook app you can see how they have that window with the menu underneath the window with the content (feeds, user profiles, etc.). Well when you click one of those links in that menu it doesn&#39;t just set that button as active, it changes the URL of the content window to point to a different page (ie, from your activity feed to your profile, for example).</p>
<p>The real stumping part is that the header bar never changes it stays right there. It seems almost as though there is a view inside that content window that changes but the window itself doesn&#39;t… anyways, just wondering if anyone have any idea how they do that? May be cool to know for the future.</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;m just implementing something just like that. My answer was to not use a full window for each &quot;content view&quot;.  Just use one main container Window and add&#x2F;remove a separate View for each content item as the left hand nav item is changed.</p>

							<div><p>Nick, thanks for the quick response! So in your setup, if there was a menu behind (similar to facebook) would you have that in a different view, or a different window? Also, so for each of your views you mentioned, would those be URL&#39;s to a different js file, or would literally all of the information be in one file?</p>
