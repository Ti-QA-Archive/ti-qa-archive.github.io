			<h1>Click sound from window</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve got a fullscreen window that contains a fullscreen image and there is a click listener on the window to close it. When on the device there is an audible click noise that is played sounds like typing on the keyboard. Where is this coming from and how can I get rid of it?</p>

							<div><p>copy and pasted the relevant window creation and listeners into a base project and no replication…</p>
<p>So I guess what I need to know is what can cause a click noise? because I&#39;m not doing any sound stuff in the entire app.</p>

							<div><p>I have the same problem&#x2F;question. See the Kitchen Sink &#x2F;  Examples &#x2F; button.js for example. When you run this, any tap anywhere on the screen gets a &quot;tap&quot; sound. I would like to provide a better user experience by providing this audio feedback only on the app&#39;s clickables such as buttons and not on the entire screen.</p>
<p>As there is no documentation, how does a developer control this &quot;tap&quot; sound?</p>

<p>I just ran the button KS example and I hear no clicking sound for any of the buttons. Are you running this on 1.6.2 as well??</p>

							<div><p>Guys - I am compiling with Titanium 1.7.1 SDK as 1.7.2 will not compile iOS for me.  My Android 2.2 phone does play a tap noise everywhere on the button.js screen. My iPad (iOS 4.3) plays no sound at all on the button.js. Note that there is NO audio&#x2F;sound code in button.js.</p>
<p>Really like to have some documentation and cross-platform consistency to be able to control this important UI feature.</p>

							<p>There are no default system sounds that we have access to in Titanium… do you have any sound files at all bundled in your app?</p>

										<p><p>Nope no sounds at all and I&#39;m not trying to play any anywhere in the app. This is definitely the keyboard typing click too.</p>

										<p><p>actually no, we haven&#39;t ported to 1.7 and it breaks lots of things in the app. I&#39;m not sure i can even get to the screen that does it in 1.7 without a crash.</p>

										<p><p>Again, the trouble is on the Android device, iOS not affected. I get the same result on Android device with 1.7.1 or 1.7.2, that every touch sounds a keyboard typing click for any touch anywhere on the Android device screen. We need to be able to control this, I do want the sound on buttons, but nothing else.</p>
