			<h1>How to add 3rd party framework to Titanium module in iOS?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I want know how to add 3rd party frameworks to Titanium module in iOS.</p>
<p>I seen few answers to add frameworks like this below</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">//<span class="hljs-doctag">NOTE:</span> AdStir is the 3rd party library I am trying to link.</span>
OTHER_LDFLAGS =$(inherited) -F<span class="hljs-string">"PATH TO YOUR FRAMEWORK"</span> -framework Foundation -framework QuartzCore -framework SystemConfiguration -framework AdStir
</code></pre><p>But, it is not working for me.</p>
<p>After building module and paste ZIP file to my project and build and run. It showing error.<br>I tried to open in Xcode to find the problem.</p>
<p>I guess, it is not added that  3rd party framework.</p>
<p>Let me know where I am doing mistake and what are the right steps?</p>

							<p>Hi,<br>I am a complete newbie in App development.<br>I have succeeded to build some examples as well as modified one of the tutorial (connection to a WebServer with JSON stream).<br>I would like to add Launchkey Framework (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;launchkey.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;sdk&#x2F;ios&#x2F;) to my App… and I am lost.<br>I inserted the framework into XCode (easy). Is it OK so? If not what should be modified ?<br>Can you please give the whole steps to be performed - it is better to consider me as a complete new guy :-( -?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!<br>Kind regards,<br>Dom</p>

							<p>Hi,</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-constant">OTHER_LDFLAGS</span> =<span class="hljs-variable">$(</span>inherited) -<span class="hljs-constant">F</span><span class="hljs-string">"PATH TO YOUR FRAMEWORK"</span> -framework myFramework
</code></pre><p>PATH TO YOUR FRAMEWORK will be your framework folder path, where your myFramework.framework is residing.<br><strong>example suppose my myFramework.framework is in abc in root directory directory then</strong></p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-string">"PATH TO YOUR FRAMEWORK"</span> will <span class="hljs-keyword">be </span><span class="hljs-string">"/abc"</span>
</code></pre><p>in this case your module will be having reference of the framework and library of it.</p>

										<p><p>As I understand it the OTHER_LDFLAGS is used when the main app is built not the module, so setting to a path will only work on the single developers machine.</p>
<p>Ti - BTW we really need some proper docs on this</p>

										<p><p>Hi Neville, yes you are right, setting OTHER_LDFLAGS will work on single machine. but little modification in concept is that, it takes reference of framework so you have to put the framework in any machine where you are using the module. else take out the library file and header and link them directly that will not require third party framework in other system as they are already consumed in library.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, I placed framework header and lib files directly in my Xcode Project (Module). It seems it works fine in diff systems too.. But, it is ok for now but not prefect solution.</p>

										<p><p>Hi, ok so for your conceptual understanding, when you add library directly then libraries are combined into one product library and when you link as a framework then it just take a reference.</p>
<p>linking like framework is done for Apple provided framework as they are available in the systems, but for custom 3r party framework if you do like framework liking then you have to ship the framework along with your module and tell the developer to place them in the path from where you are linking.<br>That is not a developer would love to do, so better you add them directly.</p>
<p>but again its module developer choice, i say both are ways to do the same task. I prefer which reduces other effort once i am going to don something.</p>

							<p>Hi, Even i am using this method and did not find any issue, you might be missing something. thats the way i use most of the time. but you are facing some problem then can do one thing…<br><strong>Extract the library from framework and add it directly with headers there won&#39;t be linking issue then.</strong><br>try this and let me know if any issue.</p>

										<p><p>I just copied Header, Resource and another files from framework folder to my project it working now… But, I don&#39;t think it is best idea. in above command<br><code>-F&amp;quot;PATH TO YOUR FRAMEWORK&amp;quot;</code> path means folder of the framework or we need to point SomeName.framework in that path?</p>
