			<p>Do I need to have a working Android SDK to build on device for IOS? I ask because I get repeated &#39;Reveal end of document&#39; -  &#39;Internal errors&#39; while trying to build for the iphone and then studio locks up. Everything working fine on the emulator. The only thing I know that isn&#39;t working is the Android SDK. Under &#39;Deployment Targets&#39;, I only have iPhone selected. Been trying to get this to work on and off for 3 days now.</p>

<p>The Android SDK should not be required in order to develop iOS applications, but it may be worth you installing it to confirm this is the case.</p>
<p>Have you tried creating a new project and launching the default app in the simulator?</p>
<p>Would you please add more details about your environment, as per the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Using+Questions+and+Answers#UsingQuestionsandAnswers-Q%26AQuestionChecklist">Q&amp;A Question Checklist</a>?</p>
<p>Then I will try to help you.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>I was able to get it to build and install on the iPhone but Studio still locks up. I guess I didn&#39;t wait long enough for it to start the iTunes install. Also, the manifest file had &quot;#type:ipad&quot; (I just changed that) even though I only had iphone selected under deployment targets in tiapp.xml. The build WAS completing but sticking the .ipa under iPad apps in iTunes. With only my iPhone 4s connected, nothing else happened.</p>
<p>I&#39;m using:<br>Titanium 1.0.7.201111041824 with the 1.7.5 SDK<br>Lion 10.7.2<br>xCode 4.2</p>
<p>I still see 9-10 &quot;Reveal End of Document&quot; errors with error codes of 778,796,781,780,768,479,638,319,756 and 836</p>
<p>Even though Studio appears locked up, I can still get something out of it if I select anything in the File | Edit | View | History | etc … for instance, I can select Run | Run and the app. will build to the simulator. Also, right clicking on the icon in the dock only gives me the option to &#39;Quit&#39; and I don&#39;t see the &#39;Application not Responding&#39; option that I would expect to see. Finally, Studio saves the workspace before shutting down after I select &quot;Quit&quot;. Weird.</p>
<p>So, building for simulator and device does work but I lose all interaction with Studio forcing me to restart it each time I build for the device. </p>
<p>Pheww.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>Only recently I started getting this error when I set the console to a fixed width. Probably related to this <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.eclipse.org&#x2F;bugs&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=243877">eclipse bug</a>. </p>
<p>In short, goto: Preferences &gt; Run&#x2F;Debug &gt; Console<br>Then uncheck: &quot;Fixed width console.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
