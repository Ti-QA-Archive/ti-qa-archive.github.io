			<h1>Photo taking and upload speed</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have an app that needs to allow customers to take pictures in quick succession and upload them to a server.  I have the code working using an overlay to allow customers to take multiple photos however I&#39;ve run into 2 issues:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The picture taking part itself is a little slow.  It seems like it takes a second or two after a user clicks to take a picture for the app to get to the success method.  Is there anything to do to speed that part up?</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the success method I then queue up the photo to upload and try to upload it.  I would love to be able to have the user be taking more photos at this point however the app seems to basically be in a wait state until that success method finishes processing.  Is there anyway to have the stuff in the success method run asynchronously?</p>
</li>
</ol>

							<p>Hello Brad,</p>
<p>For accomplish that, you will need to rethink the process of getting the images&#x2F;pictures from the user and the upload part.</p>
<h2 id="basic-code">Basic Code</h2>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">fireUpTheCamera</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{

        </span>{
            <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> cropRect = event.cropRect;
            <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> image = event.media;

            Ti.API.debug(<span class="hljs-string">'Our type was: '</span>+event.mediaType);
            <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(event.mediaType == Ti.Media.MEDIA_TYPE_PHOTO)
            {
                <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> imageView = Ti.UI.createImageView({

                    image:event.media
                });
                win.add(imageView);
            }

                alert(<span class="hljs-string">"got the wrong type back ="</span>+event.mediaType);
            }
        },
        cancel:<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span>

            <span class="hljs-comment">// set message</span>
            <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (error.code == Titanium.Media.NO_CAMERA)
            {
                a.setMessage(<span class="hljs-string">'Please run this test on device'</span>);
            }
            <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>
            {
                a.setMessage(<span class="hljs-string">'Unexpected error: '</span> + error.code);
            }

            <span class="hljs-comment">// show alert</span>
            a.show();
        },
        saveToPhotoGallery:<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>,
        allowEditing:<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>,
        mediaTypes:[Ti.Media.MEDIA_TYPE_VIDEO,Ti.Media.MEDIA_TYPE_PHOTO]
    });
}
</code></pre><p>From the view, you can save the view&#39;s image, which will be smaller. </p>
<h2 id="uploading">Uploading</h2>
<p>Once you saved the view&#39;s image, you can fire an event for uploading. In the event handler (outside of the camera logic) you will be able to start an upload of the image (this httpclient will have their own thread, so the upload will happen in parallel and won&#39;t affect your image success file). </p>
<p>Let us know how it goes. </p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro</p>

										<p><p>Ok, so I&#39;ve tried implementing something like you suggested but my app keeps crashing (with no error messages – those are the best types).  So…</p>
<p>In showCamera with custom overlay - if I have saveToPhotoGallery set to true on takePicture it&#39;ll crash, even if i have nothing in the success method, etc.</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to see if maybe its some code I have in the custom overlay causing a crash.</p>

										<p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I would invest time into trying to get the several pictures and the uploading process first, instead of adding complexity. That way will be a lot easier and you minimize the distractions (at least for now) related to this. </p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro</p>

										<p><p>Unfortunately iOS can&#39;t take multiple pictures in a row using the normal showCamera UI so an overlay is my only option as far as I know?</p>

										<p><p>I ended up doing a ton of memory management cleanup, making sure I was closing everything appropriately, etc (listeners, views, etc).  After that was all done it stopped crashing.</p>
<p>I used your idea by throwing the image and data into a queue when the photo was taken.  I then created a timer that every few seconds looks to see if there is anything in the queue and if so it then uploads it.  This has sped up photo taking a ton.</p>
<p>I appreciate your input into this question.  It was the last step in either proceeding with Titanium Studio or abandoning it completely and I happy that I&#39;ll now be proceeding with Ti.Studio.</p>
