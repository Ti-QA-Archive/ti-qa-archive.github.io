			<h1>Distribute to store - This bundle does not support one or more of the devices</h1>

			<p>Hi everyone, i made an app via titanium studio and have uploaded it 5 months ago to the app store. </p>
<p>Now i made some changes and needed to make an update. </p>
<p>After finishing development, and perfect device testing,  i tried to distribute to store from studio, but nothing appears in organizer archives of x-code. I figured out where the export file is and it makes me an app.app when it should make an app.ipa? right? I tried to open x-code generated project in build directory and now i always get this error:</p>
<p>&quot;THIS BUNDLE DOES NOT SUPPORT ONE OR MORE DEVICES THAT WERE SUPPORTED IN THE PREVIOUS BUNDLE FOR THIS APP. BUNDLES MUST CONTINUE TO SUPPORT ANY DEVICES PREVIOUSLY SUPPORTED&quot; </p>
<p>Anyone knows what is happening?</p>

							<p>I also faced the same issue.</p>
<p>So what I was doing wrong was that I published my app as <strong>universal</strong> earlier.<br>Then while updating the app I by mistake was publishing the app as <strong>iphone</strong> only.</p>
<p>So I changed all the device target to <strong>universal</strong> and all was fine :)</p>
<p>This might help someone.</p>
