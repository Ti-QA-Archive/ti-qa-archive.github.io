			<h1>AudioPlayer hijacking media buttons?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>My app streams audio using the AudioPlayer API. A user has pointed out that once a stream has been played he can no longer control the Apple Music Player using the device media buttons that pop up at the bottom of the screen. At first I was dismissive as I was under the impression that you can&#39;t access the media buttons from Titanium&#39;s API&#39;s, but on testing I found  this to be the case.</p>
<p>If you view the Apple media buttons (on a device, not the Simulator) while playing a stream from my app the icon changes in tandem with the Start&#x2F;Stop button within my app. But of course clicking them does nothing as Titanium cannot receive RemoteControlEvents commands.</p>
<p>Only on quitting my app will the media buttons be released back to the Apple Music Player.</p>
<p>Has anybody else seen this or have any kind of fix - i.e. so AudioPlayer either has no affect on the media buttons?</p>
<p>I&#39;m running iOS 5 and building with the latest Titanium SDK.</p>

							<div><p>As the tumbleweeds of silence are blowing through my question - I&#39;ll comment that in the end I used the net.cappelleri.bgaudio module which allows the app to receive system events when in the background so you can use the &#39;iPod&#39; media buttons. Works very nicely thank you.</p>
