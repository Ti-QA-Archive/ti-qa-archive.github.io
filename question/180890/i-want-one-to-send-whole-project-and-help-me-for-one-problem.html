							<p>Thats not really how the forum works. You post your question following the guidelines below, and someone answers a very specific question with a very specific answer.</p>
<p>When you move to &#39;please look at my entire project&#39; you are moving from peer assistance into a more client&#x2F;consulting relationship to which fees are connected (unless of course you are an enterprise client of Appcelerator and in such a case, your contact person at your firm should submit a help desk request).</p>
<p>If you are interested in pursuing a client&#x2F;consultant relationship, expect to pay upwards of $200 an hour for that service by an insured, certified, qualified, and experienced development shop.</p>
<hr>
<p>Missing from your question are a number of important pieces of information. I suggest you take a look at the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Using+Questions+and+Answers">Using Questions and Answers</a> article, specifically the Q&amp;A Question Checklist.  The missing information is critical to reproducing problems in a test environment and often indicates other factors that cause the undesirable outcome you are experiencing.</p>
