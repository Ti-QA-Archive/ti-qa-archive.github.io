		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Going through many tutorials and books and then developing apps for Android I encountered a big problem which is nowhere covered.</p>
<p>How to develop (full screen) applications with tablesets, views etc. which will look the same (or similar) on devices with different screen density&#x2F;resolution?</p>
<p>In all the books, elements are created with size set in pixels. It is good if u develop for only one device, but on other it will not look ok.</p>
<p>The other way is to set sizes using percents. It would be ok if all the devices would have the same proportions but they don&#39;t, so if u use images (needs to hold the same proportions) it becomes a big problem. It also cause the problem with fonts size even if u set the size using &#39;sp&#39;.</p>
<p>The other problem with the images is how to use images for devices of different resolutions? Sony Xperia Z is Full HD, so needs images in high resolution, but using the same images for low-resolution (low class) devices can cause problems with insufficent memory or processor speed.</p>
<p>So my question is: what are the best methods to design Android apps or how to avoid the problem of different screen resolutions&#x2F;densities. I will be very thankful for any books or tutorials covering that topic.</p>
