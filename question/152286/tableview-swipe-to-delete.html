			<h1>Tableview swipe to delete</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi guys, </p>
<p>I know that in tableview view, if i set the editable to be true, i can swipe the row i want to delete and the delete button will appear. </p>
<p>But now, I want to know if I can add other button when i swipe? For example, when i swipe the row, instead of just delete button, I want to add another button called &quot;Edit&quot;. </p>
<p>How can i do that? Can provide some simple examples?</p>
<p>I&#39;m building for iPhone and using 3.0.0.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The delete button that appears is system generated and you are not able to add new buttons in the same style to the same action.  You can change the caption of the button, but it must still be related to the removal action (or Apple might not like you).</p>
<p>You can however NOT use the default delete row action and instead use the swipe event to detect the action, then manually add the buttons yourself in a row event.  This is harder to do and harder to maintain and requires adding a function to each custom row you call in the swipe event.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var row = Ti.UI.createTableView({
   height: Ti.UI.SIZE,
   width: Ti.UI.FILL
});
var lbl = Ti.UI.createLabel({
    height: Ti.UI.SIZE,
    left: <span class="hljs-number">10</span>,
    text: 'Row Caption',
    width: Ti.UI.SIZE
});
row.add(lbl);
var btn1 = Ti.UI.createLabel({
    height: <span class="hljs-number">30</span>,
    right: <span class="hljs-number">10</span>,
    title: 'Something',
    visible: false,
    width: Ti.UI.SIZE
});
row.add(btn2);
row.<span class="hljs-keyword">state</span> = false; // hidden
row.showButtons = function (<span class="hljs-keyword">state</span>) {
    btn1.<span class="hljs-built_in">set</span>Visible(<span class="hljs-keyword">state</span>);
};
// add row(s) <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">table</span>

//event listener
tbl.addEventListener('swipe', function (e) {
    e.source.<span class="hljs-keyword">state</span> = !e.source.<span class="hljs-keyword">state</span>;
    e.source.showButtons(e.source.<span class="hljs-keyword">state</span>);
});
</code></pre><p>Something like this - this was a quick example and you will need to make it your own of course to fit your app.</p>

										<p><p>Can you please go to a bit more effort and stop simply writing &quot;check this&quot; or &quot;refer this&quot;.</p>
<p>It is really annoying to see so little done, you have not added any context - which part of the information is relevant or even all of it.</p>
<p>How about provided a little snippet of code to point out what is needed or link directly to documentation but with context.  </p>
<p>Point out the potential problems that this specific question might have.</p>

										<p><p>@Malcolm : if you will checked(or if you have) this post then there is only one answer is there in that post and it&#39;s totally relevant to this question. that&#39;s why i have suggested this link.The main goal is to solve the problem right ? Although i will be careful next time and Thanks for your suggestion.  :)</p>

										<p><p>I guess other people had the same thoughts I did.  This is not the only question you and a small group of others have done this on - which has been going on for some time.</p>
<p>Technically you are correct you did nothing wrong, but you also didn&#39;t do anything right either.</p>
<p>Sometimes you have to give more than a sign post, sometimes you have to require the person to give more information - but each time you should be answering the question and solving the problem.</p>
<p>With this question, it was much more than simply saying use the swipe event, there are reasons why that would not just work with the existing method the author had provided.</p>
<p>Think of it this way, if someone asks where is a building and you point them to the other side of the road, should you also point out the big truck about to run them over whilst they are crossing the road you just told them to cross - yes.</p>
<p>If the question is do I use <strong>text</strong> or <strong>title</strong> with labels - that is fine to just say <strong>text</strong> and nothing more.</p>
<p>This is a community and requires the help of others at all levels, you are part of that community so remember to look out for the big truck as the author may not see it and you should have.</p>

										<p><p>@ Malcolm : yes you are right, but most of times i am providing answers with the code and full detail. but this time( or many times in case of small problems) i just thought that he&#x2F;she will solve problem just by pointing them right direction, so i am doing that.</p>
<p>But i am surely remember to look out for the big truck next time. :) (nice example) </p>
<p>of course, i have learned lot from the community and continuing the same thing and also would like to help community and build better community by solving others problem and also would like to you guide(keep it continue) us with your deep knowledge. (like now you did). Thanks ! :)</p>
