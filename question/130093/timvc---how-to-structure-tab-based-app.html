			<h1>TiMVC - How to structure tab based app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello! </p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to wrap my head around using <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;timvc.com&#x2F;">TiMVC</a> for a tab based app.  Basically, I guess I&#39;m wondering if anybody has an example app using TiMVC where the main structure&#x2F;navigation of the app is tab based rather than list based.</p>
<p>In the demo code that ships with TiMVC, the first screen is a list and it navigates off to other routes.</p>
<p>If I&#39;m creating an app whose main screen is a tab view with 4 tabs, is there a way to do that with 4 separate routes&#x2F;controller actions?  Or do I consider every tab view in my app a single route that loads up 4 functionally different pieces of code?  If it&#39;s the latter, that seems to muddy up my structure.  </p>
<p>Thanks for any ideas!</p>

							<p>It&#39;s worth noting that native tabs will manage their own tab windows. You can use TiMVC to load the window for a tab or a window that contains a tab group. Please see the &quot;tabgroup&quot; action in the &quot;example&quot; Controller (&#x2F;controllers&#x2F;example.js - example&#x2F;tabgroup) from the TiMVC sample zip file. This action loads 3 tabs each via a route.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    <span class="hljs-comment">/**
     * tabgroup action -- loads a tab group ui with the default layout and /mvc/views/example/tabgroup.js view file
     * @param {Object} r json request object sent by routing window
     */</span>
    this.tabgroup = function(r){

        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> tabs = [];

        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> tabWin1 = self.<span class="hljs-keyword">App</span>.util.createWindow('<span class="hljs-keyword">Tab</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">Window</span> 1','<span class="hljs-keyword">tab</span>/window1',{});
        tabs.push({title:<span class="hljs-string">"Tab 1"</span>,<span class="hljs-keyword">window</span>:tabWin1});

        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> tabWin2 = self.<span class="hljs-keyword">App</span>.util.createWindow('<span class="hljs-keyword">Tab</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">Window</span> 2','<span class="hljs-keyword">tab</span>/window2',{});
        tabs.push({title:<span class="hljs-string">"Tab 2"</span>,<span class="hljs-keyword">window</span>:tabWin2});

        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> tabWin3 = self.<span class="hljs-keyword">App</span>.util.createWindow('<span class="hljs-keyword">Tab</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">Window</span> 3','<span class="hljs-keyword">tab</span>/window3',{});
        tabs.push({title:<span class="hljs-string">"Tab 3"</span>,<span class="hljs-keyword">window</span>:tabWin3});

        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> tabGroup = Titanium.UI.createTabGroup({id:'tabGroup1'});
        <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> i=0;i&lt;tabs.length;i++){
            tabGroup.addTab(Titanium.UI.createTab({
                title:tabs[i].title,
                <span class="hljs-keyword">window</span>:tabs[i].<span class="hljs-keyword">window</span>
            }));
        }

        tabGroup.setActiveTab(1);
        tabGroup.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>();
        Ti.<span class="hljs-keyword">App</span>.addEventListener('closeTabs',function(<span class="hljs-keyword">e</span>){
            tabGroup.<span class="hljs-keyword">close</span>();
        });

    }
</code></pre><p>As you know TiMVC will allow you to reuse actions, layouts and views. It&#39;s up to you if you want to use Tabs, Menues, Dashboards, etc for your application windows as TiMVC is not limited to any one view.</p>

							<p>I am also attempting to learn this framework, which looks very promising. To add on to Mike&#39;s question, If creating an app where a TabGroup with individual windows are each its own root, how would you suggest going about creating drill downs in each of the tabs windows.  </p>
<p>IE: I created the tab group in the main&#x2F;home action which creates the tabs and opens the tab group. I have tab 1 with the route &quot;employees&#x2F;list&quot; which runs the action &quot;list&quot; that loads the view &quot;views&#x2F;employees&#x2F;list.js&quot; that creates a table view of all employees. Clicking on employee will go to the route &quot;employees&#x2F;show&quot; which runs the action &quot;show&quot; that loads the view &quot;views&#x2F;employees&#x2F;show&quot; that drills down from employee&#x2F;list to employee&#x2F;show showing the employee information. The employee&#x2F;show will essentially be a new window that is loaded in tab 1.</p>
<p>I have not wrapped my head around the routing in order to achieve this.  If I create the new window using self.App.util.createWindow and then attempt to open the window with self.App.openWindow() it will try to load the window in the navgroup which errors and is not the result I am trying to achieve.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

										<p><p>In it&#39;s current version TiMVC tracks windows using a Nav Group on iOS. Every time a new window is opened a pointer to the parent window is set. Native UI tabs allow each tab to have it&#39;s own window and it&#39;s own resources (thread) which is a wonderful feature that should be taken into consideration based on your mobile application UI flow. E.g. memory limits per window (mainly on Android) </p>
<p>This means in TiMVC&#39;s current version you cannot drill down into a native UI tab using the TiMVC routing more then 1 level. Mainly because TiMVC would need updated with additional code to have knowledge on how to manage native tabs along with nav groups. </p>
<p>However, if you application does not need to take advantage of the native UI tabs threading you can create a tab component class very easily. The main difference is that a component class that replicates tabs may not have the ability to thread. Alternatively you can update the TiMVC core to support native tabs with an hour or less of code.</p>
<p>I&#39;d recommend having a look at the TiMVC core file to get an idea of how the application flows (routes windows) and all of the above will be become evident. What I can tell you is that many applications are live that use tab components and work wonderful on Android and iPhone. You just need to be aware of memory and application flow. </p>
<p>An update for TiMVC may arrive in the future to support native tab window routing deeper than 1 level. For the moment, it&#39;s not on my radar as I would prefer additional contributors join the project first before publishing any additional proprietary feature updates.</p>
