			<h1>Archive Validation Failing Due to Associated Domains Entitlement</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am having trouble getting a new release of my app validated.</p>
<p>I am building with SDK 3.4.0.RC and iOS SDK 8.0.</p>
<p>When I try to validate the package from Xcode Organizer I get an error saying:<br>iTunes Store operation failed.<br>Invalid Code Signing Entitlements. Your application bundle&#39;s signature contains code signing entitelments that are not supported on iOS. Specifically, value &#39;*&#39; for key &#39;com.apple.developer.associated-domains&#39; in &#39;Payload&#x2F;MyAppName.app&#x2F;MyAppName&#39; is not supported.</p>
<p>When I expand the package before validating I can see that &quot;com.apple.developer.associated-domains&quot; has a value of &#39;*&#39;.</p>
<p>I could not find anything in tiapp.xml related to that setting.</p>
<p>How do I fix this?</p>
<p>Thanks for any help!</p>

							<p>I had the same issue. Here is the resolution for anyone else having this problem. I know it was not directly related to Titanium but for other Titanium developers having the same issue this should help.</p>
<ul>
<li>Log into iOS Dev Center and go to Certificates, Identifiers &amp; Profiles.</li>
<li>Go to Identifiers&#x2F;App IDs. </li>
<li>Choose the appropriate ID for your app.</li>
<li>Click on the Edit button at the bottom.</li>
<li>Uncheck Associated Domains and click Done. </li>
</ul>
<p>You will have to regenerate any provisioning files associated with this ID.</p>
<p>I had never selected this for the app last time I submitted my app to the app store. I am guessing that the update to iOS&#x2F;Dev Center may have added it. But I am not exactly sure. All I know is that I am now able to validate my package and submit to the app store.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
