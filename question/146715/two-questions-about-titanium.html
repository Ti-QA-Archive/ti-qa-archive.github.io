			<h1>Two Questions about Titanium</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello everybody,<br>I would like to ask you 2 questions about Titanium</p>
<p>I&#39;ve read an article which contains these two lines:</p>
<p>1)- </p>
<p>&gt; Disadvantages of Titanium:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using HTML or CSS is no longer possible as it doesn&#39;t use Web-View for deploying the application.</li>
<li>Using external Javascript libraries is not possible.&gt;</li>
</ul>
<p>is this correct, specially when I discovered with new SDK (3.0) that we can use the HTML 5 and CSS3, couldn&#39;t we? </p>
<p>2)-<br>&quot;If I am developping an application with Titanium for the Android platform….  if I deceided to deployed it for iOS (with the same Javascript code), will my application run successfully? or should I change something in the code?&quot;</p>
<p>Thank you!!!!</p>

							<p><code>Using external Javascript libraries is not possible.</code></p>
<p>Javascript Libraries that require the DOM of a browser cannot be used in Titanium, TRUE.<br><strong>HOWEVER</strong>, pure javascript libraries seem to work pretty well, including nearly all the node_js modules I have needed.</p>
<p><code>Using HTML or CSS is no longer possible as it doesn&amp;#39;t use Web-View for deploying the application.</code></p>
<p>Wow, your source is REALLY old, because this change took place like <strong>3 years ago</strong>. HTML+CSS can be used within a webview. However, the reason for using Titanium would be access to NATIVE UI objects.  Thus the move so far back away from a Phonegapish mess of an implementation towards native.</p>
