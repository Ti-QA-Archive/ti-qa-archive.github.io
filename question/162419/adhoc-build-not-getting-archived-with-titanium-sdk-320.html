			<h1>AdHoc build not getting archived with Titanium SDK 3.2.0</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have implemented cross platform application using Titanium 3.2.0 but when i try archiving the build for iOS AdHoc distribution, it does not get compiled. It keeps giving error with developer name as mentioned below -<br>Invalid &quot;–distribution-name&quot; value &quot;&lt;Developer Name&gt;&quot;</p>
<p>I tried building from XCode, Titanium UI and over Terminal as well but same error everywhere. I have referred https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TISTUD-5642 and it says that issue is fixed but i still face this issue over every machine updated to 3.2.0 or even when 3.2.0 is installed fresh.</p>
<p>Please help and provide information.</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

<p>I can say, that I can build adHoc with 3.2.0.GA without issue, so we can rule out it being 3.2.0 across the board. In the cases I know of, has been something unique to the devs environment.</p>

							<p>Thanks. But i have checked all settings and have tried a simple project with 3.2.0 over 4 systems. The issue is it works fine on simulator but do not get compiled for device. Would appreciate any clue on what could be wrong. This is not the first time I am using Titanium. It was working great with 3.1.3 but i have faced this issue only after i had updated to 3.2.0. Appreciate any suggestions.</p>

										<p><p>Same issue here… Compilation with CLI 3.2.1 and SDK:</p>
<ul>
<li>3.1.3.GA: OK</li>
<li>3.2.0.GA: KO </li>
<li>3.2.1.GA: KO</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a <strong>critical</strong> issue… Waiting for a fix&#x2F;bypass to be able to release our iOS app</p>
