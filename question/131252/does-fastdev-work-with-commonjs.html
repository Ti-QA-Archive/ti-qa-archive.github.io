							<div><p>thanks for reply; </p>
<p>yeah I do full rebuilds when adding new files basically; </p>
<p>I basically had a project where I was using Ti.include and then moved to require.</p>
<p>now no dice; I do get strange info from fastdev server saying exists: false for some files; </p>
<p>but its good that it works for you; so it must be somewhere;</p>

							<div><p>Hi guys, </p>
<p>Were you able to use commonJS for android apps using a mac (OS X snow leopard) computer? I cannot have this <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator-developer-relations&#x2F;Forging-Titanium&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;ep-002">example</a> working on android emulator and device !! For fastdev, I guess it is set to false in tiapp.xml in case of using commonJS.</p>

							<div><p>by the looks at the fastdev server logs; its obvious that requires are treated relatively so it thinks the file does not exist; perhaps using Titanium.Filesystem.resourcesDirectory in the require will get past this issue in the intrim</p>

							<div><p>I keep getting the same problem, I always use : require(&#39;&#x2F;ui&#x2F;myModule&#39;); so ui is a child folder of the resources folder, but I keep getting exists: false on Lion OSX Android.. V strange! @Richard, did you get it to work using resourcesDirectory() ?</p>
