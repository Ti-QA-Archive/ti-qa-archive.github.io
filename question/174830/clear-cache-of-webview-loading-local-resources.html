			<h1>Clear cache of webview loading local resources</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Titanium SDK version 3.2.3.GA with IOS 7.0</p>
<p>I know many others have asked this question, but it seems most of those people are loading remote urls so they can append a random query string to the end of the url and the webview doesn&#39;t load the cached version.</p>
<p>However with local html files, you can not append a query string or the file fails to load. Or at least I haven&#39;t figured out a way to do this.</p>
<p>I am loading a local html file that has a graph in it (I am using a js graphing framework), and the same webview loads one html file and I pass in different data via an event. </p>
<p>The webview loads the last data that was sent at the last load, which is really frustrating as it is confusing to the user they see a graph from the last window they loaded not the current window. And, if the network connection is slow, it takes forever to refresh.</p>
<p>Any ideas or suggestions on how I can avoid this? </p>
<p>I suppose I could pass in an HTML string to the webview, however, this would be really painful to maintain. I could create the DOM using the executejs function but again, really painful to maintain and I am not sure if that would solve the problem.</p>

							<p>My problem did not end up being that the webview was caching data but the global event I was using to transfer data to the webview was keeping some variables in scope even after the window was destoryed.</p>
<p>I ended up removing the global events and also setting any values I set in the events to null so garbage collections was sure to clean these up:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">$.win.addEventListerner(<span class="hljs-string">"close"</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">e</span>)</span>{
    Ti.removeEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">"eventForWebView"</span>, myCallback);
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Variable defined in event callback</span>
    variableDefined = <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>;
});
</code></pre><p>Then in the webview, I added a function that fired on body ununload to remove any global events:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">&lt;<span class="hljs-tag">body</span> onunload=<span class="hljs-string">"destroy()"</span>&gt;
</code></pre><pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> destroy = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{
    Ti.removeEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">"eventListeningInWebView"</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">callback</span>);
}
</code></pre><p>This resolved all my problems. I am not sure about this, but I don&#39;t think that local webviews cache data especially if your data is added via an event listener.</p>
<p>If you are having problems with data loading before the event is triggered, you probably still have a global event listener that hasn&#39;t been destroyed.</p>
