			<h1>Display Base64 image data on mobileweb</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>My app stores images as base64 data, and decoding them and displaying them on iOS is straightforward:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> blob</span> = Ti.Utils.base64decode(base64String);
<span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> image</span> = Ti.UI.createImageView({image:blob});
</code></pre><p>However, this doesn&#39;t work on mobileweb. I have scoured this forum and other places for an answer, but can&#39;t find a way to do it in mobileweb, just talk about how images are already base64 encoded in the browser.</p>
<p>So: how can I draw an image from a base64 string in mobileweb?</p>

										<p><p>Kosso, thanks for the tip. I&#39;m already doing that– the ugly workaround I mentioned. </p>
<p>But I still have the problem of getting images into base64, for example in iOS I can use view.toImage() then Ti.Utils.base64encode. I&#39;m not aware of any way to do that on mobileweb.</p>

										<p><p>try using the text output of the base64 version and using the HTML syntax.</p>
<p>This is not the same as using an image blob as an image property for an ImageView</p>

										<p><p>Kosso, I don&#39;t think I understand what you are saying. I have a Ti View and want to get its image (that is, take a screen shot of that region) using view.toImage() and store the resulting image in a database using base64 encoding. I can&#39;t see how to do that on mobileweb, because although toImage() works, base64encode() doesn&#39;t work.</p>

										<p><p>Hmm.. OK. If you&#39;re trying to send the data of a toImaged(ed) blob to a webview, are you using how are you trying to do that? EvalJS? </p>
<p>Some code will help.</p>

										<p><p>Kosso, sorry if I&#39;m confusing the issue. The question had two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>display base64 data as an image</li>
<li>generate base64 image data from what is displayed in a Ti view, not a WebView</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#39;m already doing 1. using a data-URI in a WebView.</p>
<p>I want to know how to do 2, which can&#39;t use a WebView because I want to get the image from a Ti View using getImage().</p>

										<p><p>The short answer is that I have an app that works OK on iOS but not on the web. One of its functions is taking a screenshot of a region of the screen and storing that in a database as base64 text, because that&#39;s what the client wants. </p>
<p>The other side is that they want to fetch that image and display it– I have a workaround for that part, but no known way to get base64 text from a screen region in mobileweb.</p>

										<p><p>If the &quot;client&quot; has a database they want you to write to, maybe it might be worth you suggesting they store the actual uploaded file? (as a database blob)</p>
<p>Then they can render it however they like. </p>
<p>I know this doesn&#39;t solve your problem. Because logically it should work (if I understand you correctly).<br>Make sure you check the syntax of the base64 file regarding file type. Also pay special attention to the semi-colons. That tends to trip people up.   Compare with working base64 strings. Also mime-type being served by the server for the particular file type?</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for sticking with it…</p>
<p>The database is a server-hosted NoSQL JSON system, which can&#39;t store binary data, hence the need for base64 encoding. I can&#39;t change that. But that&#39;s not relevant to part 2 of the problem.</p>
<p>The following is simple and works fine in iOS for making an image of a view:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> blob</span> = view.toImage();
<span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> stringForDB</span> = Ti.Utils.base64encode(blob);
</code></pre><p>But in mobileweb, Ti View does not have a toImage() method.</p>
<p>But I still need to get base64 text for an image of that screen region. As far as I can see, it can&#39;t be done. </p>
<p>The client is not happy, because they were sold the Titanium promise of develop once, deploy everywhere.</p>
