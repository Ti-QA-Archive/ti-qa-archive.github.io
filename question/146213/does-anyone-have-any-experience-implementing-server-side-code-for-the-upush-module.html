			<h1>Does anyone have any experience implementing server side code for the uPush Module?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I recently purchased the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;4019?1633740311">uPush</a> module from the appcelerator marketplace. I have been able to use the module in my app successfully, but have not been able to figure out how to make my web server send the push messages to the uPush servers. I have emailed them for support but they say they will not be back in until after the first of the year. </p>
<p>The <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.upush.co.uk&#x2F;docs.aspx">“uPush Web Services”</a> document states on page  3 section 4 that their severs supports either HTTP GET&#x2F;POST or SOAP and requires several mandatory inputs. However when using the POST method from PHP and cURL I only receive a long SOAP error. It might be my inexperience but the documentation does not say how it expects the POST data. I assumed that it was POST variables, but it could be JSON or XML I suppose.</p>
<p>Sorry, I know this is not directly a Titanium related question, but if anyone has done this before I figure it would be a pretty simple matter to let me know what kind of data their server is expecting.</p>

							<p>Hi Jamie, you actually don&#39;t need to use upush server for push notification, all you need to do is have your own server or hosting server, then save the registration ID of the device in you sql database then from your php code send push notification to the stored devices ids using JSON string and http requests.<br>For more details, I have a post in adobe and after digging I answered this question, follow the steps according to their order and you can set up you own GCM push notification server via your upush module.<br><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.adobe.com&#x2F;thread&#x2F;1056675">Here is the link to adobe forum</a>; however it is in CFM but the code is readable and easy and you can convert it to php when you understand it.</p>
