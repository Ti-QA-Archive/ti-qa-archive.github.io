			<h1>Responsive graphics in a Ti project for iOS and Android.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello.<br>I&#39;m a Production Manager that&#39;s been given a job of handling an app that is designed for iOS and Android smartphones - so please accept the fact that I am not someone who understands code..<br>That said, I have a challenge that I hope someone in this community can confirm or deny for me an issue, because it&#39;s causing real problems…<br>Using Ti 2.1.3GA, nodejs and Python 2.7 my app has a page whereby there are several pictures in a scrolling view with captions underneath. The pictures are landscape and portrait and all saved in Photoshop to 720px wide - the idea being that the device would scale them proportionately and place the captions underneath one after the other.<br>This has been a real bane of the job. It would appear (and remember that I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about here, I merely attempt to parrot what I&#39;ve been told by people brighter than me ) that there are &quot;inconsistencies&quot; in Android&#x2F;iOS and in the way Ti handles sizing commands. (&quot;don&#39;t use &#39;auto&#39; for example…?)<br>I have had the text in the right place, but the resolution of the pictures plainly too low<br> I have had the pictures at the right scale, but then the captions are too close - or too far away from the botom of the proceeding picture.<br>I have had perfect text placement, but the pictures are squashed out of proportion so it just looks silly…</p>
<p>Now I accept that what I&#39;m dealing with here is not a responsive HTML page - but that is, in effect what I&#39;m after and I&#39;m terribly confused that what would appear , to the layman so easy and &#39;standard&#39;, is proving so difficult…</p>
<p>So, after all that my question.<br>What am I looking for here? Is there an alternative method of dealing with the page that hasn&#39;t been considered and is easier to implement?<br>All rather difficult without seeing the offending project, but maybe, just maybe, someone can point out the obvious?</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

							<p>If you want your images to stretch to the outside edges of your scrollview, try setting <code>width: TI.UI.FILL</code> on the imageviews, don&#39;t set the height, and height should then be proportional to the width.</p>
<p>In the scrollview, set the <code>layout: vertical</code> and as you add the object to the scrollview, they will be stacked vertically by order of addition. </p>
<p>And yes, difficult to guess at unexposed code.</p>

							<p>Hello.<br>I see this in the relevant .tss</p>
<p>&quot;#gallery&quot;:{<br>contentWidth:Ti.UI.FILL,<br>layout:&#39;vertical&#39;<br>}</p>
<p>It appears &#39;similar except that the command used is &quot;contentWidth&quot; rather than &#39;width&quot; - would this make any difference?<br>Many thanks in advance for any advice. I appreciate it.</p>

							<p>The contentWidth is a separate property of the scrollView that allows you to control the boundaries of the contained object before it starts to scroll, so it must be there for a different purpose. Perhaps adding a width as well may improve things ?</p>
