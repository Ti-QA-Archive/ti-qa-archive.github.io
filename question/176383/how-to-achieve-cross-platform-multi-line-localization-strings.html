			<p>This may be a bug, or a difference in how XCode&#x2F;Mac&#x2F;iOS handles XML parsing from i18n slightly differently from Android&#x2F;JavaSDK. </p>
<p>I&#39;m using Ti Studio 3.3x to build a mobile app. I&#39;ve recently upgraded from iOS only to both iOS and Android. I have also migrated all strings in the UI to be in proper lang file i18n&#x2F;en&#x2F;strings.xml. </p>
<p>A few of my L( ) strings need to span multiple lines. I started out on Android. I put real line breaks into the xml file and it all ran together, so I added \n at the front of each new line… so in effect my strings.xml has some nodes that span multiple lines with actual line breaks, along with backslash-n char combos as well. The content becomes the hintText of a textArea…</p>
<p>Now everything seemed to be working on Android. But when I view it in iOS, the line breaks are preserved as well as the backslash-n&#39;s meaning on iOS my text has twice as many line breaks. </p>
<p>Is it possible to use CDATA without \n explicitly? Or should I be using four separate lang keys to achieve four lines of text in the project? That would seem redundant.</p>
<p>It&#39;s almost like iOS has preserve white space on, while Android does not. Any advice?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>As each platform handles i18n strings their own way, titanium simply parses them into each location for the app.  So this is one of those times that a minor difference shows up.  It is left in place rather than lowest common denominator wins as sometimes you may only be working on one platform and that difference becomes useful.<br>The convention here though is to only use the escape sequence \n as you have noted.  Remove any real line breaks.</p>
<p>The equivalent of crate is not available as the strings were intended for shown captions, so the need to allow for paragraphs was not considered in the definition.  You can put long strings in though as you have noted.</p>
