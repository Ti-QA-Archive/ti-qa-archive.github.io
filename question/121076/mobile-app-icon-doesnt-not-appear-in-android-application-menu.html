			<h1>Mobile app icon doesn&#39;t not appear in android application menu...</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, </p>
<p>I have a little (time consuming problem..)</p>
<p>My mobile app is installed on the android emulator (2.2, or higher), thus I can find it in the menu&#x2F;running applications….</p>
<p>But the application icon is <strong>not existing</strong> in the <strong>home&#x2F;application menu</strong> (dots)…</p>
<p>Therefore I cannot relaunch my app directly from the emulator..I have to build it every time so that it is running…</p>
<p>Just for info I am using mobile sdk 1.7.0 (final release)</p>
<p>Why is this happening ?? Did anyone also get this problem??</p>
<p>As variants, I tried different Android versions…installed the application package using the terminal ADB command….but none worked…</p>
<p>Even more, I can install the Kitchen Sink app (with an icon in the menu), but cannot do mine..</p>
<p>Is there a specific preference to set in Tiapp.xml ??</p>
<p>Thanks for your help</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve never seen that. What if you get the .apk out of build&#x2F;android&#x2F;bin and run it on the device? Does your app show in the applications list then?</p>

							<p>At least you can launch it.  I don&#39;t even get that far.  The Android emulator launches (Android 2.2) fine, but no App runs nor any icon to re-launch.  This issue is the same on Mac OS X 10.6 and Windows 7.  Emulator was failing all together, until I fixed an issue with builder.py on Windows 7 because it was trying to do: -logcat &#39;-d:<em> </em>&#39; : making it not go.</p>
<p>iPhone emulator wise everything is great.</p>

							<p>To fix it there are two things that must be done (from my testing).  This works on Windows 7 and Mac OS X 10.6.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Within Titanium Studio bring up the &quot;TiApp Editor&quot; and be sure to set up the correct naming for Application Id: com.&lt;Company&gt;.&lt;App Name&gt;  – example com.Company.demoapp</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go to your Workspace for the Titanium project you are working on within your computer (Mac Finder or Windows 7 File Explorer) and place the App icon in the following folder: &lt;path to workspace&gt;&#x2F;Titanium Studio Workspace&#x2F;&lt;project name&gt;&#x2F;build&#x2F;android&#x2F;bin&#x2F;assets&#x2F;Resources  (may need backslashes \ for Windows).  I copied the &quot;appicon.png&quot; into that folder and you may have to create that directory.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Re-build&#x2F;Run the application and be patient for it to load the icon into your emulator (it may take up to 40+ secs).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Done.</p>
</li>
</ol>
