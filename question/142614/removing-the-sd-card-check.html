			<p>Hi Guys</p>
<p>I want to speed up the build process. Currently the build delays for 60 seconds searching for an SD card,</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">[INFO] Waiting <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> SDCard <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> become available..
[ERROR] Timed <span class="hljs-keyword">out</span> waiting <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> SDCard <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> become available (<span class="hljs-number">60</span>s)
</code></pre><p>how do I get rid of this delay so that I can go straight to building the app? </p>
<p> Regards, Richard</p>

							<p>Well,</p>
<p>Since ADB copies the package to the SD card of the emulator and then installs it, not sure what you expect to happen that would be positive here…</p>

										<p><p>Thanks you for the information on the mechanics, it was interesting but didn&#39;t answer my question. </p>
<p>I asked on how I can get rid of the 60 seconds delay before the compilation starts. If I have something mis-configured int he emulator, then could you tell me what it is?</p>

										<p><p>Ok, you want an answer to a problem you think you have, that should you resolve will cause a problem later on:</p>
<p><code>you have to modify the python build scripts</code></p>

										<p><p>Ah, I think maybe the title of the question is causing you confusion as I don&#39;t see why you feel the need to be so cute in your answers, really, it isn&#39;t helping. </p>
<p>Let me make my question absolutely clear, when I click &quot;run&quot; there is a delay of 60 seconds while waiting for the SD Card to be initialised on the emulator. This wait is annoying, wasteful of my time and expensive to my company, it is a real problem that is affecting me, so I am asking how it can be removed. </p>
<p>I am <em>not</em> asking to remove the SD Card on the emulator, especially if, as you indicate, it is needed.</p>

										<p><p>Richard,</p>
<p>I&#39;m not the one &#39;confused&#39;.  You see, I&#39;m not the one asking a question.<br>Nor am I being &#39;cute&#39;. I don&#39;t do &#39;cute&#39;.</p>
<p>The script waited UP TO SIXTY SECONDS then told you that an error occurred.</p>
<p>The script did NOT WAIT SIXTY SECOND THEN CHECK for the card, as your question indicates you think is whats happening.</p>
<p>Sure, I could tell you how to make the script only try for 10 seconds then fail. Won&#39;t help you any.</p>

										<p><p>you know, just to make you &#39;happy&#39; and answer your question exactly as you have asked for it to be answered:</p>
<p>Open up the builder.py file in the SDK you are using, find <code>max_wait = 60</code> change it to whatever you want.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Stephen for your reply. I am not suggesting that the it waits 60 seconds before checking the card, I don&#39;t know how you took this from my question. As there is clearly a communications problem here, let me change the question then to try to make it clearer.</p>
<p>The scripts tries for 60 seconds to initalise the SD Card in the emulator, fails, then proceeds <em>with no other problems</em>, so the fact that it waits 60 seconds to fail the card does not impact the performance of the emulator in anyway. </p>
<p>Thus, this behaviour leads me to the assumption that the check&#x2F;delay&#x2F;failure is either something not configured correctly in my environment, or some really shitty user experience from Google. If it was the former then it would be nice to correct it</p>
<p>As it happens your reply, changing the builder.py script, works perfectly. I have reduced the delay and it has no impact in any way at all on the use of the emulator, it still works as it did before.</p>
