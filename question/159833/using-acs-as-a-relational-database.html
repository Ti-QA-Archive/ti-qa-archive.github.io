			<h1>Using ACS as a relational Database</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi everybody,<br>not considering any performance issue, do you think that ACS with custom<br>objects and custom fields can be used as a normal<br>relational database, or do you think, in your experience, it would be a misuse of it and<br>a big pain?</p>
<p>For example, from what I see, It looks like every object must be owned by an user but sometimes<br>this doesn&#39;t make sense and would require the usage of fake users.</p>
<p>For example, think of a restaurant reviewing app. A custom object Restaurant could exist, but<br>it wouldn&#39;t make any sense to say that it is owned by any user, unless we introduce a fake<br>user for that purpose.</p>
<p>I&#39;m asking this because I&#39;d like to use ACS for my application, since it is easy to use and wel integrated, but I wouldn&#39;t like to use it for something it has not been thought for.</p>
<p>Thanks!<br>Daniele</p>

							<p>Well, using ACS as you would a normal relational database would be a very bad idea. This is always the case when you are trying to use something that is created for a purpose and try to force it into what you want it to do.<br>Now that being said, there is no reason what you could store your restaurant review information into ACS and have links between some of your objects. You are also perfectly correct when you say that you will need to use a technical account if you want your information to be shared across all your users. This makes sense for ACS since it was created as a cloud service for users and not as a central server database. But there are a lot of applications out there that use a single user for their entire application and it works like a charm.</p>
<p>Hope this clears this up for you.</p>

										<p><p>It is really case by case. ACS provides a way to link one object to another. However, since ACS is based on mongo, you can&#39; t really do joined query across collections, etc. But it really depends on what your application wants to do and how you design your app.</p>

							<p>You can create an admin user to create all the restaurant objects. the user is needed for access control so that random people can&#39;t delete your restaurant object unless your app gives the user permission to delete.</p>
