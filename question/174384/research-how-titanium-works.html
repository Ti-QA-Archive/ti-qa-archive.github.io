			<h1>Research: how Titanium works</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m doing a small research, to understand how Titanium works. I&#39;ve found some answers on google and merged and edited them together, into one text. I wanted to know whether the text is correct:</p>
<p><em>A Titanium implementation on a mobile platform must provide a JavaScript engine in order for your applications to run along with unique compiled bindings code. Titanium takes your Javascript code, analyzes and preprocesses it and then pre-compiles it into a set of symbols that are resolved based on your application&#39;s uses of Titanium APIs. From this symbol hierarchy we can build an inverse symbol dependency matrix that maps to the underlying Titanium library symbols to understand which APIs (and related dependencies, frameworks, etc) specifically your app needs. These bindings are compiled into source code depending on the platform – it’s native to the environment such as Java for Android and Objective-C for iOS. However, during runtime, a JavaScript engine is still required to provide dynamic evaluation of code, events,etc.</em></p>
<p><em>When your application is launched, a JavaScript execution environment is created in native code, and your application source code is evaluated. Injected into the environment are, so called, “proxy” objects - JavaScript objects with paired objects in native code. These proxy objects wrap the native objects, and communicate with them through a bridge.</em></p>
<p><em>At runtime your application, basically, consists out of three parts:</em></p>
<p><em>1. Your JavaScript source code (inlined into a Java or Objective-C file and compiled as an encoded string)</em></p>
<p><em>2. The platform-specific implementation of the Titanium API in the native programming language</em></p>
<p><em>3. A JavaScript interpreter that will be used to evaluate your code at runtime (V8 (default) or Rhino for Android, or JavaScriptCore for iOS). Except in the browser, of course, where the built-in JavaScript engine will be used.</em></p>
<p><em>In your JavaScript code, when you call a function on the global Titanium or Ti object, such as var buttonX = Ti.UI.createButton({title:&#39;Poke Me&#39;});, that will invoke a native method that will create a native UI object, and create a “proxy” object (buttonX) which exposes properties and methods of the underlying native UI object to JavaScript.</em></p>
<p><em>UI components (view proxies) can be arranged hierarchically to create complex user interfaces. Proxy objects which represent an interface to non-visual APIs (like filesystem I&#x2F;O or database access) execute in native code, and synchronously (or asynchronously for APIs like network access) return a result to JavaScript.</em></p>
<p><em>Hopefully this helps directly address two common misconceptions about Titanium:</em></p>
<p><em>1. At no point does Titanium require the use of a web view component. The developer can create a web view as a native UI widget, but the web view is not used to evaluate Titanium source code.</em></p>
<p><em>2. JavaScript code is not cross-compiled to Objective-C or Java in Titanium. Your JavaScript source is evaluated at runtime. This is necessary because JavaScript is a dynamic language.</em></p>
<p><em>The look and feel of a Titanium application, when using common UI widgets, is also a strength of the platform. There is no visual emulation going on (either through the application of CSS, or rendering of UI widgets using OpenGL or Flash). When you create a NavigationGroup, it is backed by an actual UINavigationController on iOS. The animations and behavior match what a native app user will expect, because you’re using the same UI control.</em></p>
<p>Some questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Did I miss anything?</li>
<li>What is the role of Python files in the SDK, as I understand, they help building the project?</li>
</ol>
