			<h1>Linker error when adding iPad Deployment Target</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m running into an issue where I have an application using a third-party library for credit card swiping. I include this library file into a Titanium module and add this module to my project. When my app&#39;s deployment type is set to iPhone, it compiles and runs fine on my connected iPhone 6. Unfortunately, when adding the iPad Deployment Target the app fails to build with an error:</p>
<p>The following build commands failed:<br>[ERROR] :      Ld build&#x2F;Debug-iphoneos&#x2F;DP\ Mobile.app&#x2F;DP\ Mobile normal armv7</p>
<p>I&#39;m compiling against 3.4.0 GA (3.4.1 produces the same issue). When I remove the module, the app builds for iPhone and iPad without an issue. My minimum OS version is 7.0.</p>
<p>Any thoughts, comments, ideas, etc? I&#39;m stumped on this one.</p>
<p>Rob</p>

							<p>You&#39;re going to need an updated version of this module. It&#39;s not compatible with the architectures of the newer OSes and devices. Additionally, Apple has set the requirement that all apps be 64-bit compatible, which based on the output above, this module is not.</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s what I expected. I know the vendor is working on the drivers for Feb, but I&#39;ve got to get my release out before then. I opened the project in Xcode and was able to build the universal app! It worked without issue on iPhone and (natively) on the iPads. So… is there a setting or something that I can change in the Appcelerator project that could replicate the Xcode environment? I think I can say that it&#39;s obvious Xcode is doing something different with the project.</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply! I&#39;m really enjoying the switch from web-based development in C# to mobile and Titanium. It&#39;s a big change!</p>

										<p><p>Did you try building with our 3.5.0 alpha version, which supports 64-bit builds? Details on <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2014&#x2F;11&#x2F;alpha-version-of-titanium-sdk-64-bit-support-now-available&#x2F;">our blog</a>.</p>
<p>If you have access to the vendor&#39;s source code, you could try rebuilding it for 64-bit yourself. There are steps in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-17928?focusedCommentId=333150&amp;page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-333150">this comment on TIMOB-17928</a> which should help with that.</p>

										<p><p>I haven&#39;t tried that, Tim, but that&#39;s a great idea. Hopefully I&#39;m able to give it a shot this afternoon. I wish I had the source! Unfortunately, this is our payment processing vendors vendor. They won&#39;t even let me talk to the devs. That could have saved me hours of work early on in the project. I didn&#39;t think my first Titanium App would integrate to third party hardware drivers using modules with Objective-C wrappers, a secure payment processing gateway, and a starting point of a working app from the early days of Titanium (i.e. an extremely large app.js)! What happened to Hello, World! :)</p>
<p>I appreciate your help, Tim. So is there a way to change the way Titanium is linking? Why would this work in Xcode and not in Appcelerator? My only guess is the build&#x2F;linking script(s).</p>
