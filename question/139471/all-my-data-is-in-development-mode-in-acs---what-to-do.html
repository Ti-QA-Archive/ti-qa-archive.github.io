			<h1>All my data is in Development mode in ACS - what to do?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello.<br>So I have added alot of things in my development profile with the ACS System, foolishly not considering that when the app is published it is going in production mode (Don&#39;t ask me how, because I dont know).</p>
<p>Does it make any difference to distribute the Application in Development ACS than in Production ACS? Basically its just the keys that are different, right? I mean, shouldn&#39;t it be possible to just overwrite the production keys in tiapp.xml with the developmentkeys? Or am I generally screwed for good here? Thanks.</p>

							<p>It is fine right now. We will provide a tool to migrate data from development to production in future, then it is better to migrate and use production keys</p>

										<p><p>Alright thanks. So it wouldn&#39;t make any difference when the app is distribute to AppStore? Even thoug the keys in the ACS App manager is different from production and development, also after I have change the production keys to the development keys, and all the data is still going in development?</p>
