			<p>1.4.1.1, is this suppose to work with xcode sdk 4.1?<br><strong>Maybe I need to be using an xcode sdk before 4.1?</strong> It does not seem Titanium fully supports xcode 4.1!</p>
<p>I am still having issues with every combination. Am I doing something wrong?</p>
<p>Is there a stable sdk combination between titanium and and xcode sdk that I can use, so that I can get my game out???</p>
<p><em>I have been asking for weeks. ImageView animations, .hide .show .remove .add seem to be giving me issues. Everything else is great!</em></p>
<p>Please Help I just want to release it!!!</p>

							<p>I have asked the same simple questions in 5 different threads.<br>If I am lucky, I get some nice people, saying &quot;try this&quot;…</p>
<p>Well, upgrading did not work. My game was working fine in the Titanium SDK 1.3 with iPhone SDK 3.1. I upgraded to iPhone SDK 4.1 and Titanium 1.4 and the latest 1.4.1.1, and it is horrible.</p>
<p>No one can simply answer my questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is going on with the imageViews animating</li>
<li>Is there a connection between imageViews animating and .hide&#x2F;.show</li>
<li>Should I downgrade to an older SDK version to fix the problem</li>
</ol>
<p>I have literally been waiting 2 1&#x2F;2 weeks to get an answer,… that means something.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you for posting. My biggest question, that might solve all of my problems is:</p>
<p>What is all of the different iPhone SDK versions that Apple is accepting right now to the app store.</p>
<p>Example: iPhoneSDK 4.1 and Titanium 1.4.x are not working for me. So maybe I could downgrade to a older version of iPhoneSDK and Titanium, and get my app to work properly. <strong>What downgraded version would be acceptable?</strong></p>
