			<h1>Fix vertical scrolling inside a table?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a table with lots of rows in it, in my iPad app. Whenever I try to scroll down lower than the default viewable area of the screen, it tries to pop back up to the top. Like someone under water that keeps trying to come up for air. I can sort of scroll down but as soon as I take my finger off the surface, it tries to jump back up to the top. Is there a way for me to tell the table to allow scrolling down and staying down? Or just to stay wherever I&#39;m trying to scroll? Is there a better way to achieve this? Tables and rows seem ideal because I have to create rows in a loop, and then text fields inside each row. It&#39;s basically a grid that scrolls way down.</p>
<p>Any thoughts or advice?</p>

<p>Missing from your question are a number of important pieces of information. I suggest you take a look at the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Using+Questions+and+Answers">Using Questions and Answers</a> article, specifically the Q&amp;A Question Checklist.  The missing information is critical to reproducing problems in a test environment and often indicates other factors that cause the undesirable outcome you are experiencing.</p>

							<p>Seriously? You want me to give the code for my table? I&#39;m guessing the symptom is a feature&#x2F;side effect of tables and somebody knows a better approach.</p>

										<p><p>Try to use the comment feature when commenting on an answer or a previous comment, it makes it easier to track the conversation.</p>
<p>Also, it could be a symptom or a side effect, or it could be your code. Or it could be a side effect of your code. There is no way to know without seeing the code. Its usually easiest to recreate the problem using a very minimal code sample and post that. That way people can easily copy&#x2F;paste it into a new project, load a dev environment to match yours (see the link Stephan posted above) and see exactly what you are seeing.</p>

							<p>Thanks Anthony.</p>
<p>I dug into this some more, and when I load the rows statically, the problem mostly goes away. I was dynamically adding rows based on user action, and it seems as though the app didn&#39;t really know the dynamically added rows were there, and thus kept trying to pop to the top.</p>
