			<h1>iOS Doesn&#39;t Respond to Touch Events While Working</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have an app working on iPhone and Android. When loading a time-consuming screen, I can&#39;t interact with the app until the screen loads. As in, I select an item in the menu. The item starts to load. I have an activity indicator on the screen. I try to open the menu during the three-ish seconds it takes to load the screen. It doesn&#39;t respond. The screen eventually loads after those three-ish seconds. THEN the menu button&#39;s click handler happens and opens the menu again. On Android? The menu is opened right away. I even put console.log(…) calls so I could see when the event handler for opening the menu gets called and when the screen&#39;s external call is returned, etc. I definitely click the button before the call returns, but the console.log literally hangs onto the button click event until the screen renders.</p>
<p>Any ideas? Is there a way to force an event handler to interrupt something? The XHR call I&#39;m making is asynchronous, right? Are they not asynchronous on iOS?</p>

							<div><p>Thank you for calling attention to your question via twitter within 2 minutes of posting. However, this may not be the attention you have desired.</p>
<p>Missing from your question are a number of important pieces of information.

							<div><p>99 times out of 100 none of that matters at all. At all. Ever. And you all obsess over it.  I took to Twitter because NOBODY is on these forums. I wanted to bring attention to it. You literally act like it&#39;s a bad thing.</p>
<p>After all that public admonishing, you don&#39;t even attempt to answer the question.</p>
<p>I&#39;m using the latest version of Titanium Studio. What, 3.2.1?</p>
<p>That said: I figured it out! I need to set the async property on the extraParams in my XHR call to true. Actually, I made it an input parameter that defaults to true. As in:</p>
<p>XHR.prototype.get = function(url, onSuccess, onError, extraParams) {<br>    …<br>    extraParams.async = (extraParams.hasOwnProperty(&#39;async&#39;)) ? extraParams.async : true;</p>

							<div><p>Thank you! I didn&#39;t know that and was wondering about the symptom since iOS7 with one of my apps! I though it would be because of the general Ti-performance! Great that you found the answer!</p>

							<div><p>let me backup Stephen here. you say nobody is on this forum yet over 80% of the questions get answered.</p>
<p>the people who answer these questions work. and we work long hours most as independent contractors or business owners.</p>
<p>we give our time freely. </p>
<p>if you want a quick response to your issue pay for support? it is not really nice to post a question then immediately go on twitter and ask for an answer.</p>
<p>also the request for information is valid? There is no way from your question anybody could have guessed an answer let alone try to work it out.</p>
<p>If you want to stop going at people trying to get this forum working effectively. Then actually spend your time here answering questions for others, instead of just expecting everybody else to do it.</p>

							<div><p>@Vince, saying nobody here answers anything is extremely disrespectful and given as Stephen pointed out your tweet was within minutes of the question being posted means you did not wait even a few minutes for anyone to see the question.</p>
<p>You provided no code to a problem that was YOUR code and obvious lack of documentation being referenced no a library you created.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with asking a question, the problem being a lack of knowledge, failure to read documentation or even simply getting confused.  But disrespect is entirely different.</p>
<p>I am sorry I was walking home in the two minutes between your patient wait of two minutes before you gave up &quot;waiting&quot; and that I could not attend to your question.  I am sorry that Stephen asked you to provide sufficient information in order to help you - especially as no answer could possibly have been provided due to the problem being in the code you did not supply for review and you suggesting was not required.  It turns out that the tooling info was not required but who knew, given it is highly unlikely the problem would have been something as simple as the locking issue was due to your code locking the process.</p>
<p>If you really think that no one will ask your question before then go and<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;top-100-experts"> check the experts list</a> and see where three of the people here are on the list - clearly the community does not help people like yourself!</p>
<p>If you choose to ask another question - try doing so with the decency that is deserved or you will never get an answer.</p>

							<div><p>Just to clarify, is the Network.HTTPClient not performing in an asynchronous manner in 3.2.1 on iOS7? Or is Vince using a different library to perform the XHR call?</p>

							<div><p>@Allen - the httpClient object is asynchronous by default in all versions.  From the documentation;</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Asynchronous vs. Synchronous HTTP Requests</strong> </p>
<p>By default, the HTTPClient makes asynchronous requests. Asynchronous requests do not block the application and use callbacks to process responses when they are received.</p>
<p>Synchronous requests block the execution of the application until it receives a response. On the iOS and Mobile Web platforms, you can make synchronous requests by setting the optional async parameter to false when calling the open method.</p>
<p>The <em>Android platform does not support synchronous requests</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why the &quot;failure&quot; did not occur on Android as sync calls are not supported - so again - wholly down to the code by the author of this question - who had made a concious decision to specifically specify sync that caused all of his problems.</p>
