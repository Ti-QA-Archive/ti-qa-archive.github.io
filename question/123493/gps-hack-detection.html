										<p><p>A 3rd party app on a jailbroken iPhone can hardcode the GPS values &quot;pretending&quot; that a user is at a location that he really isn&#39;t. If you have an app that relies on a users location, this can be exploit I would like to protect against.</p>

							<p>You can&#39;t see what other apps are installed.</p>
<p>All you can work with are the GPS coordinates. You could monitor them (poll regularly) and see if they jump unreasonably, e.g. 10 km in one minute (which is 600 km&#x2F;h).</p>

										<p><p>The problem would be someone would close my app, fire up their 3rd party app to change their location and then open my app which wouldn&#39;t know the difference.</p>

										<p><p>The problem here is that jailbroken phones can have programs perform tasks that a properly sandboxed application cannot do.  I am almost positive you would never truly detect such an exploit from a stock Titanium application.  And I question if you could even pull it off with a custom module using objC code.</p>
<p>That said, Christian may be onto as good as you may be able to reasonably achieve.  However, that will never be 100% foolproof either, as there will be times when the GPS is off for extended periods of time.  If it was off because they were in airplane mode and really traveling, you could have a significant shift in GPS coordinates that is legitimate.</p>

										<p><p>Android has a built in feature called &quot;ALLOW_MOCK_LOCATION&quot; and you can use this to detect if another app is using a mock location feature. I&#39;m at a loss for something clever I could check on the iPhone.</p>
