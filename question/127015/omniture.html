			<h1>Omniture?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>A client of ours wants to sponsor some content in one of our apps.  They were asking if there was an was  for me to integrate an Omniture script (that they would provide) so the could see how many people viewed their screen.</p>
<p>My question is a) is this even possible  b) if so, how and c)are there any implications&#x2F;problems with this from an app approval etc, standpoint?</p>
<p>My app is on iOS 4.x on an iPad only. The app does not need internet connectivity normally, but it does contain hyperlinks.</p>
<hr>
<p>sdk 1.7.2, os 10.7.2, ios 4.x</p>

<li><p>That JS is written for the browser, and requires a DOM, if the clients &quot;page&quot; is HTML, then sure it would work. Otherwise no.</p>
</li>
<li><p>That you would need to ask the developer. I would hope it would quietly fail.</p>

							<p>there are others analytics modules, so I don&#39;t think you will have problems. Have you seen those on the appcelerator market?</p>
