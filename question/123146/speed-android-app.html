		<section>
			<p>Hello</p>
<p>Is it possible that an android app is way slower than an iPhone app?</p>
<p>I am filling a tableView with about 500 rows, which is done very fast on iPhone, but on Android it takes around 20 - 25 seconds.</p>
<p>Is this normal behavior?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Tjeu</p>

							<p>Are you comparing speeds on actual devices, or on the iOS simulator vs the android emulator?  Speed comparison must be done on real devices.  The iOS simulator is very, very fast (MUCH faster than a device).  The android emulator is a dog.  This has nothing to do with Titanium – the same is true of native development tools.</p>
<p>If you are comparing on actual devices and repeating the className property for rows with the same layout, then I&#39;d suggest posting code to see if anyone has a suggestion.  Are you using remote images?</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m comparing on the emulators, is the iPhone&#39;s speed way slower than the device&#39;s? Because I test my iPhone app on my iPad, since I don&#39;t have an iPhone to use.</p>

										<p><p>Speed tests on emulators and simulators are worthless.  They do NOT reflect speeds on devices.  The iphone simulator speed is actually way FASTER than a device, not slower.</p>
<p>The opposite is true on android.  My device is faster than the emulator.</p>
<p>Bottom line is a simulator&#x2F;emulator can be used for test&#x2F;debug cycles, but there is no substitute for performance testing on real devices.</p>

										<p><p>Ok, thank you. I&#39;ve been testing my iPhone app on my iPad. Do you think that speed is similar to the iPhone&#39;s speed? Well, almost similar, because iPad will be bit faster I think? Or will it have a great difference?</p>

										<p><p>It will of course depend on the iphone model used (and for that matter, if you are using an ipad or ipad2).  In the case of the iphone4, the speed should be nominally similar.  A fourth generation ipod touch should be similar as well.  Older devices are naturally slower.</p>

										<p><p>Yeah, I&#39;m using an first generation iPad. I hope it will be similar then. Thanks for your help!</p>

										<p><p>In that case, yes, you are nearly as close as you will get.  The original ipad uses the A4 chip, which is also used in the iphone4 and 4th generation ipod touch.  There are still speed differences though, as the ipod reportedly underclocks the A4 to 800MHz (from 1GHz) and the iphone4 has twice as much RAM as the ipod.</p>
<p>The ipad2 uses the A5 chip; older phones and ipod use slower chips.</p>

							<p>Shouldn&#39;t be (although I&#39;m having similar problem, 500 rows takes about 10 seconds to load). See KithenSink table view performance example, 500 rows loads very quickly.</p>

										<p><p>So, If I get this right, Android will only load a tableview with that amount of rows fast if there aren&#39;t any views in the rows, like in the example. From the moment you use views it becomes really slow?</p>

										<p><p>Well, I haven&#39;t test this much so I really don&#39;t know what the source of slowness in my application. But, for now, it seems to me that adding other components to table view rows instead of just using title property does not impact performance of &quot;setData&quot; (much). I&#39;m using two labels instead of title property to display more complex information. I should test this more to see what&#39;s causing the slowness, but at the time I have more important things to do, so this is on a hold. Try to test yourself (it&#39;s not so hard to do) and post your results here. :)</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ve been stuck at the tableview for a while now, it stays slow, scrolls badly and when I scroll my app crashes. I&#39;m looking for the reason why it crashes, because that&#39;s unclear to me too, it gives an error with indexOutOfBound, I have no idea where to look for that. The weird thing is that it runs smoothly and perfect on my iPhone.</p>
