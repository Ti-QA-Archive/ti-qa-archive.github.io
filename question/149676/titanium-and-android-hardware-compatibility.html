			<h1>Titanium and android hardware compatibility?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve submitted one app to the Google Play store (a very simple one) and i&#39;ve find out that it installs and works on many type of devices (hardware) but in some others it just won&#39;t run.</p>
<p>The app only has a textfield and a label.</p>
<p>Are apps developed through titanium supposed to work in all mobile brands that have android installed or is there any black list of mobile brands that experience any known problems with titanium?</p>
<p>Just asking, and thanks in advance like always ^^</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>There is no easy answer for this one.  Titanium in theory should allow you to create an Android app that will work on standard Android operating systems.</p>
<p>There are several caveats to the response though;</p>
<ul>
<li>They may not have enough local storage space to run the app.</li>
<li>They may not have enough local memory to run the app.</li>
<li>They may not have the hardware requirements defined by Titanium or specifically by your app</li>
<li>They may not have a new enough version of the OS.</li>
<li>They may have an OS version newer than currently supported</li>
<li>You may have specified an API level which then restricts which Android versions are supported</li>
<li>Your Ti SDK version may restrict the earlier Android OS version compatability</li>
<li>The devices may have a skin or base OS that is not strictly Android and thus may restrict usage</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read more about the compatibilities here;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Titanium_Compatibility_Matrix-section-29004837_TitaniumCompatibilityMatrix-Android">Titanium Compatibility Matrix</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There is no full answer to this one as the problem is in part due to the fractured and fragmented Android platform - that is both a strength and a weakness.</p>

										<p><p>Your follow question is also not easy, and for many of the reasons noted above.</p>
<p>However you can solve &quot;some&quot; of the problems and answer the question of which SDK by understanding a newer feature of the Android Market Place.</p>
<p>In the market place you can now provide more than one APK per &quot;application&quot;.  Strange as it might sound each app can actually be made up of different compilations of your app.</p>
<p>With this ability you can actually compile an app targeted to earlier versions and another to newer versions of the SDK.  You can then include images just for smaller screens and code that runs better for smaller versions for earlier versions.  Then you can build again using the same code, but with only the larger graphics, ignoring the smaller ones and specifically targeting the newer SDKs.</p>
<p>You will have to manually play around with files and folders and even some compiler logic and also change the min-sdk values - but this would give the biggest support.</p>
<p>Other than that - simply aim for the lowest version for the most amount of your users.</p>

										<p><p>I really appreciate your response ^^. I&#39;m dealing now with all that information and i also forgot the list of devices that the google play store provides about compatibility. I&#39;ll be checking this for a while also making compilations for different android SDKs. Thanks Malcolm.</p>
