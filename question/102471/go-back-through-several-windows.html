			<h1>Go back through several Windows</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I need to do something that seems simple, but I can&#39;t find a way to do it :</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I have a tabGroup with several Windows.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I navigate from Window to Window opening them with :<br><code>Titanium.UI.currentTab.open(win,{animated:true});</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>I can go back to the previous Window using the back button BUT I want to go several windows back.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How could I achieve that ?</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>I&#39;m working on iOS, but my app will need to be ported to Android soon.</p>
<p>EDIT2:<br>I did something very dirty (and I&#39;m not proud of it):</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">//creation of a new window identical to the first one</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> winNew = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
    url:<span class="hljs-string">'tab2.js'</span>,
    backgroundColor:<span class="hljs-string">'#fff'</span>,
    barColor:<span class="hljs-string">'#fff'</span>
});
Titanium.UI.currentTab.open(winNew);
<span class="hljs-comment">//hiding the back button</span>
winNew.setLeftNavButton(Ti.UI.createView({}));
</code></pre><p>I don&#39;t know how it will behave with memory consumption.<br>I had a lot of answers here telling me to keep the windows I create in an array.<br>This might be a solution to keep the same behavior in android.</p>

							<p>One option would be to pass down a list of windows you have opened (either a name or unique identifier), then from your current window you can fire your own custom event……such as &#39;windowClose&#39; and pass the id of the window you want to close. Each window will have a listener for said event and will close itself if the id provided matches the window id. You may want to do things such as setTimeout() so you aren&#39;t trying to close all of your windows at once.</p>

										<p><p>out of interest, any idea if navgroups work the same on Android as they do on iOS? I had a similar problem recently, which I solved by sorting an array stack of windows which I looped through and closed when I want to get back to the &#39;home&#39; window of a tab</p>

							<p>Adrien,</p>
<p>If you are talking about iphone, then I suggest you start with the code in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.clearlyinnovative.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;1624173028&#x2F;titanium-appcelerator-quickie-navigation-groups">this</a> blog of Aaron&#39;s.  I made a tweak to that which I described in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;81451&#x2F;navigation-group-woes-with-windows-created-using-url-js">this</a> thread which allows me to back up to the home page no matter the nesting level.  You could modify that to only go back as far as you want.</p>
<p>Hats off again to Aaron for the original sample.</p>
