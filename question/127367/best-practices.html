			<h1>Best Practices</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve been reading stuff on best practices and even fell in love with the Tweetanium style of structuring my code, then I watched Rick Blalock&#39;s Codestrong lecture (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;29804284">here</a>) about bad JS memory leaks. Tweetanium falls into one of those massive memory leaks by how it loads EVERYTHING into memory on startup. </p>
<p>What would be a &quot;Best Practice&quot; to adopting the Tweetanium style structure while maintaining leak-free code?</p>

										<p><p>&quot;ToggleBox&quot; example is buggy and not so well explained (some others could be better also).</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">//set up behavior for component</span>
  <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.view.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.setActive(!active);
  });
</code></pre><p>&quot;this&quot; in view event listener references to the view, it&#39;s not the same &quot;this&quot; as in &quot;Toogle&quot; view function. Therefore, &quot;setActive&quot; will not work.</p>
<p>By reading this line:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">onChange.<span class="hljs-built_in">call</span>(instance)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>it seems to me that this example comes from some other, more complex example.</p>
<p>So, I think full working example should be:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var win =<span class="hljs-function"> Ti.UI.createWindow(</span>{
    modal: true,
    backgroundColor: '<span class="hljs-comment">#000'</span>
}<span class="hljs-function">)</span>;

function<span class="hljs-function"> ToggleBox(</span>onChange<span class="hljs-function">)</span> {
  //save current reference of <span class="hljs-string">"this"</span>    
  var<span class="hljs-instruction"> instance </span>= this;

  this.view =<span class="hljs-function"> Ti.UI.createView(</span>{backgroundColor:'red',height:50,width:50}<span class="hljs-function">)</span>;

  //private<span class="hljs-instruction"> instance </span>variable
  var active = false;

  //public<span class="hljs-instruction"> instance </span>functions to update internal state,<span class="hljs-instruction"> execute </span>events
  this.setActive =<span class="hljs-function"> function(</span>_active<span class="hljs-function">)</span> {
    active = !!_active;
    this.view.backgroundColor =<span class="hljs-function"> (</span>active<span class="hljs-function">)</span> ? 'green'<span class="hljs-keyword"> :</span> 'red';
   <span class="hljs-instruction"> if </span>(onChange &amp;&amp; typeof onChange.call == 'function'<span class="hljs-function">)</span> {
   <span class="hljs-function"> onChange.call(</span>instance<span class="hljs-function">)</span>;
    }
  };

  this.isActive =<span class="hljs-function"> function(</span><span class="hljs-function">)</span> {
   <span class="hljs-instruction"> return </span>active;
  };

  //set up behavior for component
 <span class="hljs-function"> this.view.addEventListener(</span>'click',<span class="hljs-function"> function(</span><span class="hljs-function">)</span> {
   <span class="hljs-function"> instance.setActive(</span>!active<span class="hljs-function">)</span>;
  }<span class="hljs-function">)</span>;
}

//must be added via <span class="hljs-string">"view"</span> property
win.add(new<span class="hljs-function"> ToggleBox(</span><span class="hljs-function">)</span>.view<span class="hljs-function">)</span>;

win.open(<span class="hljs-function">)</span>;
</code></pre><p>Of course, it would be better if functions were added to the prototype.</p>

										<p><p>Short of rewriting the entire Tweetanium example to use CommonJS I can&#39;t really use a whole lot of those guides since they revolve around Appcelerator integrating CommonJS into things. I really don&#39;t want to rewrite to accomodate CommonJS but I can if absolutely necessary. </p>
<p>I feel like Appcelerator shouldn&#39;t have released an example like Tweetanium that completely violates Best Practices and could potentially create massive memory leaks.</p>

										<p><p>Well, there is memory leak pattern even in the best practices section. I warn them not to use app-level events, but they don&#39;t seem to listen (enough). :)</p>
<p>Maybe we should write the best practices, hmmm …</p>
<p>Anyway, I would recommend that you rewrite your application so it uses CommonJS approach, it will have benefit later on when your application becomes bigger.</p>

										<p><p>@Logan, I think the Tweetanium code was developed and released before the CommonJS recommended practice came about.  Things are evolving quickly.</p>

										<p><p>What would it take to have Appcelerator or someone else fork it and rewrite it? It would take me forever to rewrite that thing especially since I&#39;d be figuring out CommonJS from scratch and screw it up. Also time constraints are an issue for me</p>

										<p><p>Time constraints are an issue for everyone, including Appcelerator.  As Adam says, the &quot;best practices&quot; is a moving target and a continual rewrite by Appcelerator to &quot;current best practices&quot; ties up resources for them too.  Not that I wouldn&#39;t love to see a non-trivial app kept up to date, with older forks available as comparisons.</p>
<p>Sadly, I don&#39;t think that is reasonable to expect of them.</p>

							<p>There are many answers to this. The first one is probably don&#39;t load everything at runtime.</p>
<p>Create a function which loads the JS files as and when required. CommonJS is probably a good solution. Be aware that TI.include does a lazy load of JS files on Android if you don&#39;t load them in the app.js..</p>
<p>Also keep a track of what is loaded as once it is loaded it stays loaded, and you really don&#39;t want to load files multiple times.</p>
<p>Next is don&#39;t use the url option to load a file on a window… This creates a separate instance and hogs memory.</p>
<p>A final point is keep what data, images etc to a minimum per load. </p>
<p>There is a few pointers, but there are some excellent articles on best practice and using namespaces and anonymous functions.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>T.</p>
