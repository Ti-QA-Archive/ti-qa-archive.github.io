			<h1>Map annotation height</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Similar questions appear to have been asked on this forum but none have got a satisfactory answer.  Briefly, I want to show a fairly biggish image, 50 x 50, as leftImage in a map annotation.  However, try as I might I cannot get the annotation to change its height - the biggest image I can reasonably display is around 30 px in height.  There does not appear to be any way of changing title font size, putting in line breaks in the sub title or anything else.</p>
<p>Or maybe I am missing something.  Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>I should say all of this is for the iPhone,</p>

							<p>You cannot increase the height of the annotation, as the map API provide by appcelerator is not fully mature.<br>The annotation you get on the map is the same annotation you get on native iOS map, but with very limited feature.<br>The only solution you left with is to present a custom view when user taps on the annotation. but this also has a problem, as the map API does not allows us to add map overlays, so you have to add a transparent window on top of your map with your custom view on it.</p>
<p>In short you can only add images, as you said 30px.</p>
