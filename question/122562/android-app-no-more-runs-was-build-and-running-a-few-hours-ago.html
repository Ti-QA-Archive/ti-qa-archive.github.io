<p>I am on Mac OS X 10.6.7 and using SDK 1.7.1, with Android 2.3…</p>
<p>I already tried to remove all the content in <code>build&amp;#x2F;android*</code> and build again<br>I already tried to force a full build by using <code>touch tiapp.xml</code><br>I already tried to close and restart a new Simulator….<br>I already tried to start a new Simulator using the <code>Clean user data</code></p>
<p>Nothing worked yet….<br>And I really don&#39;t see what is causing this and why…</p>

							<div><p>Hi, yes, I tried this too…</p>
<p>In fact I had my project in SVN, and therefore I tried to go to previous versions of the project and I was getting the same error (crash @ app startup) everytime…</p>
<p>I was really depressed, and on the way to giving up, when I decided to completely remove the localization strings folder <code>i18n</code>, and remove the few <code>Ti.Locale.getString()</code> or <code>L()</code> calls I had (4-5 only if I remember well)…<br>And rebuilt the application….and Android version of app worked again…</p>
<p>I really don&#39;t know the reason…</p>
<p>Today I was a little bit stressed when I tried to use one more time the localization strings again….but now it worked…..very weirdo…</p>
<p>And just to mention the change I did yesterday before getting the crashed was simply to rename the string names in <strong>strings.xml</strong>, because it was in the form <strong>name1_name2_name3</strong>, and I simply remove the <em>underscores</em> to get <strong>name1Name2Name3</strong>……and I got the crashed on Android after that…</p>
<p>Very weird error…..and a scary moment for myself…</p>
<p>One more question while we are in the Android topic…</p>
<p>I could not connect the debugger to the Android emulator (I wanted to debug in order to see why it was crashing)…</p>
<p>Each time I launched the debugger, the launch process freezes at 57%, and after 1-2 minute I got an error message saying &quot;Could not connect to debugger, timed out&quot;…</p>
<p>Do you know a solution, advice for these issues ???</p>
<p>Thanks for your help in advance !</p>
