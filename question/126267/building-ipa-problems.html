			<h1>Building .ipa problems</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m new to all this and getting a demo done in a week got dumped on me Monday. I have the thing running - amazingly - but now I can&#39;t find out how to actually get built for the device. </p>
<p>I have a TestFlight account ready to roll but I see mentioned of &quot;build for iOS&quot; here I don&#39;t see any way to do that from within Titanium - is there something I need to install in Titanium to let it build an IPA because I can&#39;t find it anywhere.</p>
<p>Assuming I need to use Xcode to build the IPA, it keeps erroring out about &quot;The identity &#39;iPhone Developer&#39; doesn&#39;t match any valid certificate&#x2F;private key pair in the default keychain&quot;. Does this mean I have no way at all to even <em>build</em> the thing for deployment an app even for testing until Apple approves our paperwork?</p>
<p>Any help is much appreciated as this is way urgent.</p>

<p>that will create the IPA file and open up iTunes. Just copy the file from iTunes and you are all set</p>

							<p>Nope … that requires the Apple Development Cert, etc. as well. Looks like I have to wait on Apple. Damn.</p>
