			<h1>Any info on latency with Titanium.Network.Socket.TCP?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Has anyone compared Titanium.Network.Socket.TCP reading speed to native TCP socket reading speed in Android? I am experiencing high latency when reading from a TCP socket with Titanium. But this may be caused by Titanium, by the smartphone (Android) itself or by the wireless network.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any info!</p>
<p>Regards,<br>Anguel</p>

							<p>TCP sockets will actually be the focus of this coming Wednesday&#39;s <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeopro.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;forging-titanium">Forging Titanium</a> episode. Personally, I&#39;ve not seen latency coming from Titanium itself. The network performance seems to depend largely on the device running it, as well as the amount of data you are attempting to send. You may want to consider restructuring your data to be more compact. Again, depending on the volume of data, you could also see ios running faster than android as the ios JS engine outperforms the android one… for now. When 1.8.0 is officially released with the android v8 engine, the 2 platforms should perform more similarly with this type of processing.</p>

										<p><p>Tony, thank you very much for the info! I also read your other posts and some other blogs discussing Titanium. In the meantime I came to the conclusion to go native because there I know what is happening under the hood. Maybe if the docs become more complete and the &quot;black box&quot; + &quot;expect everything&quot; feeling goes away I will think again about using Titanium. At this stage of the project I simply don&#39;t have the time to experiment further…</p>

										<p><p>You do know that Titanium is open source right? Here&#39;s the link to the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_mobile">github repository</a>. Nothing &quot;black box&quot; about Titanium, you can see everything under the hood.</p>
