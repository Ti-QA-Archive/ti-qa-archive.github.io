			<h1>Alloy Live Code Updating</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>One of the things I love about titanium is I can edit code live. Edit a js file and then navigate to that section of the app and my changes have taken place without a recompile. I think this is a real time saver.</p>
<p>It seems with Alloy you can&#39;t do this because the code is being generated. You can of course modify the generated code but that is not as powerful. </p>
<p>Am I missing something? Is there a way to do live code updates without a recompile?</p>
<p>If not is this on the road map?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I suspect in the past you were using the old method of linking JavaScript files using the window <strong>url</strong> property.  This itself soon lost favour due the requirement of a new JS context for every single window - this was not ideal for many reasons.</p>
<p>The live updating you experienced was not so much live but a side-effect (in your case useful one) of this multi-context JS situation.</p>
<p>CommonJS was and is the favoured approach for creating the modular coding methods that are employed with or without Alloy.  Whilst you may not get the &quot;live updating&quot; you are used to - the CommonJS approach - when implemented correctly gives back much much more.</p>
<p>CommonJS modularisation of code means that you (should be) create small single subject files of related code.  You pick once section of your app and create a single CommonJS module to handle that single thing.  From that point onwards each time you need that &quot;thing&quot; you reference the CommonJS module you created.  This way you get many benefits - one of the biggest is that you focus on creating a solid re-usable module that is not dependant on anything that cannot be passed to it.</p>
<p>Once you have perfected your library of CommonJS modules - you link them together using whatever code framework that suits you best.</p>
<p>Later on you may refine your CommonJS module to; improve speed, increase error handling, better memory management, more features.  But the interaction with your app should be the same or so close on minor tweaks are required.</p>
<p>When you move between projects you can take your re-usable modules to the next project, with all that work done - your next app only need to create the framework and any new modules.</p>
<p>Whilst &quot;live updating&quot; may have given you a sense of speed, it may (often does) have given you a false sense of speed as you will have spent a lot of time tweaking and checking visually - rather than working through the code, running it through in your mind - planning before you start to determine how it will link together.  You will find the pre-planning, focused functions, careful use of variables and then finally testing will actually improve your speed.</p>
<p>I do understand that learning a new MVC like Alloy means it would be better if you could quickly jump in and out but there is so much going on under the hood when converting the Alloy work into the live code - it is just not possible right now.</p>

										<p><p>Great assessment Malcolm. Also, You may want to look at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dbankier&#x2F;TiShadow">TiShadow</a> for live code updating, which supports Alloy. Also, Appcelerator in the near future will be releasing some technology in Appcelerator Studio that allows for live code updating.</p>

										<p><p>Not sure I am in the past. I use lots of CommonJS. </p>
<p>I think maybe you are talking about a single window design vs. multi window?</p>
<p>For example. My app starts. It lands on some landing screen. From there we have buttons to dive deeper into the app. </p>
<p>When you go to the next screen by clicking on one of the buttons we open a new window using navigations groups. Now when I open that new window my javascript is run. If I go back to the home screen. Make some changes to the code. Go back into the second window the new code is running. </p>
<p>For example if I am trying to tweak the location of some element. I can go back to the home screen. Make the tweak and then go back into the second screen deep and the updates took place. No recompile needed.</p>

										<p><p>I meant no offence, can you confirm that your window creates used the URL property prior to your use of Alloy?</p>
