							<p>Hi Rainer</p>
<p>Appcelerator added to the release notes of 2.1.1 that Mountain Lion compatibility tests had not been completed and they would update the information as soon as they had checked everything.  Some other people on the Q&amp;A have been having success, some have had some issues.</p>
<p>This thread has more info <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;140185&#x2F;mountain-lion">mountina lion</a> and the promise of a success.</p>

										<p><p>My problem is Android:<br>I&#39;am using 2.1.1 and on device comes the mesage „Sorry, the app is terminated“. In the old OS all is fine.<br>Rainer</p>
<p>OT: I have backup in TimeMashine and I tried to restore the OS version of yesterday. But TM progamm says me: I cannot restore because I need Time mashine … Any ideas? Other ways?</p>

										<p><p>So you are seeing a message suggesting you need a newer version of XCODE but you are only targeting Android?  As you probably have guessed this may not be a positive outcome.</p>
<p>Couple of things to check;</p>
<ol>
<li>Have you used Project menu &gt; Clean - fixes more than you would think.</li>
<li>Changes the project you are working on to use 2.1 not 2.1.1</li>
<li>Make sur eyou project ONLY specifies Android, if any iOS is checked you may be getting the error because the app THINKS you may want iOS.</li>
<li>If you have NO iOS apps, have you tried installing the latest version, you may have a need for pre-requisite - weird but possible. </li>
</ol>
<p>And if all else fails then these two.</p>
<p>a. If you have an external hard drive you could spare - then your Mac should be able to boot from that, you could install the old version on to it and during boot swap to the Lion external for booting.  This is a good way to test as well.  May also let you restore your time machine to the external Lion drive.<br>b. Parallels for Mac allows you to install a virtual operating system and the Mac allows the Lion and higher to be installed in a virtual environment, you could run a virtual mac side by side your actually mac (at the same time).</p>
<p>This way you will have the best of both worlds - albeit with extra hassle right now.</p>

<li><p>I have choose as target only Android and select 2.1.0, clean project I tried it again – the same bad  result</p>
</li>
<li><p>I have MacBookAir and have not external device. Maybe I have a hidden partition. On TM I have enough versions of my mac.</p>
