			<h1>Re-Initialize AudioPlayer Instance</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My app has a music player function. </p>
<p>The user can browse around the app, and listen to music that they&#39;ve selected in a certain tab. It all works well. (its pretty snazzy too, because I got background music to work)</p>
<p>Anyway, if the user goes back into that particular tab where they selected the Mp3 they wanted to listen to, they cannot stop the current mp3 from playing. </p>
<p>They can only play another mp3. So, in effect, what may happen is that they can have 2 or more mp3&#39;s playing simultaneasouly. </p>
<p>And that works fine too except its not really what I wanted. I&#39;m pretty sure no one wants that feature also.</p>
<p>So, how do I make sure all instances of AudioPlayer are initialized if they are active when the user goes back into this tab menu?</p>
<p>Someone told me to issue an audioPlayer = null; command. </p>
<p>He is definitely on the right line, but this command itself does not work. How do I therefore initialize an Audioplayer instance.</p>
<p>It was created as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> audioPlayer</span> = Ti.Media.createAudioPlayer{()};
</code></pre><p>You know like in Unix, you can kill a process that&#39;s running by using its process ID and doing a kill -9 on it? I need something similar for AudioPlayer.</p>
<p>I really appreciate any advise. Believe me, I&#39;ve been working so hard on this, and I&#39;m tired and exhausted.</p>

							<div><p>may I just add that there is a stop mp3 function , and that works well. There&#39;s even a pause too. However, this will not work once the user leaves the window where they selected the mp3. If they go around browsing the app and return back to the mp3 menu, they will not be able to stop that mp3 from playing.</p>
