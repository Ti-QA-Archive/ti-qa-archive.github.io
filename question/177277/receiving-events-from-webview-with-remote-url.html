			<h1>Receiving events from webview with remote url</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>So, it is not possible to call Ti.App code from pages loaded with a remote url in the webview. We&#39;re okay with that to help with security. But we need a way to work around it.</p>
<p>As an example we may have a button in the remote html page that should trigger a certain action in the app. Since we cannot do this directly from javascript in the html we have tried this approach:</p>
<p>In the html javascript we added an array of events to trigger. When the user presses something, the html javascript will push something into this array.</p>
<p>In the app, we added a setInterval for 50 ms that will call the webview with evalJS to fetch an event from the array in the html. Based on the event we then trigger certain actions.</p>
<p>This will make the window holding the webview poll with evalJS with 50ms interval… will this cause any horrible battery or other issues for the app?</p>
<p>AND is there a better way to do this?</p>

							<div><p>it&#39;s a smart idea. I was thinking of using an event listener (click for example) on the webview it self to execute the evalJS but it doesn&#39;t work: the click event prevents the clicks in the html and the webview can not scroll…<br>So the idea of a loop is great. Depending of the delay you accept, I would increase the interval. I don&#39;t need 50ms, even  500ms or 1 s is enough in my case.</p>
