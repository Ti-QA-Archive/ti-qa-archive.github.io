			<h1>CoverFlow Images Load slowly,</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Okay, i have a CoverFlow View, with nearly 300 images in it, around 50mb just images, but when i load the coverflow mode, i) it loads really slow, which i expect, but is there anyway to just load up the first 10 images on startup or something, and load the rest when viewing the coverflow view so the user gets a smooth fast viewing of images? and ii) when loading the ccoverflow, the app half freezes, i can&#39;t press to home or something, and as soon as you exit the image view, and click back on, it loads everything again, is there anyways to cache it or something?<br>Thanks a lot :)</p>

							<p>I haven&#39;t tried it or tested it, but I would look at how you create and manage the array that coverFlow is reading from.  You may need one array to store your list of images and then periodically &#39;feed&#39; or &#39;refresh&#39; the separate array that your coverFlow is reading from.  See the KiSink example of &#39;coverflow_replace.js&#39; - it basically shows resetting the array for the coverFlow.  In addition, especially if you are using remote images, I would look at the example of table_view_dynamic_scroll for ideas on how to dynamically update the data your view is reading from (albeit not a coverFlow example.</p>

										<p><p>Steve - responding to your follow-up (below) - I don&#39;t know if there is a bug, but it may just be difference in logic between the ..replace.js example and what you are attempting to do.  Is there a simplified example of your array creation and update code that you could paste?  I just wonder if the code logic might just be a little off, but hard to tell w&#x2F;o seeing it first.</p>

							<p>Thanks, it looks very good, but ive tried the coverFlow_replace.js file, and it works, except, when i press  change images, it shows the last image, and i have to scroll left through all my next set of images to visit the next image, is this a bug or is something dodgy? :P Thanks</p>
