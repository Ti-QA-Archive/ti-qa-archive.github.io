			<h1>New project has no simulators</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have just started a new project in titanium studio and for some reason I cannot get an iphone simulator to show up in the debug or run options.</p>
<p>I did have this on a previous app I started on, but since I removed that and started another, all I get is the &#39;Debug configurations&#39; and &#39;Run configurations&#39; options and I have no idea what to do in here.</p>
<p>I tried look on Google for answers but have come up with nothing, which is weird. Can someone point me to documentation somewhere on how this is setup?</p>
<p>I have already been here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Quick_Start and that is not what I am after, I have done all that.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>I had a similar problem. The only way I was able to solve it is by changing the Titanium SDK version in config.xml to something else, and then changing it back.</p>
<p>In my case, the run command was disabled for an existing project that I work on regularly. The project is running on SDK 3.2.3. I changed the SDK to 3.4.1 and saved it. The run command then became enabled. I then changed it back to 3.2.3, and saved it. The run command remained enabled.</p>

							<p>This happens from time to time. Sometimes simply clicking the green run button as a button instead of the drop down will create a config for you.  If not:</p>

							<p>While it is not always available from the menu, you can always click the <strong>Run</strong> button from the App Explorer view.</p>
<p><img src="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;09Zn6gF.png" alt="Click run button"></p>
<p>It will then create a new Run configuration (with a Simulator attached to it) automatically if none is found.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

							<p>Go into your project top level, and make sure you have a &quot;build&quot; folder with an &quot;iphone&quot; and &quot;android&quot; one in it.  If not, create it and it should show up.</p>

							<p>For some reason, there are two folders at the same level with similar folder and file structure. These were both created by titanium when I created the project. One is the name of my app and the other is the name in which I originally intended the project to sit in.</p>
<p>The project folder did not have a tiapp.xml but the other folder (the one that is named the same as the project) did.</p>
<p>I copied it across and it worked. So it was the missing tiapp.xml file. Not sure why I get two folders created though. And why they are slightly different. But I have found the problem.</p>
<p>Thanks to all for your answer, I tried everything :)</p>

										<p><p>In addition, the reason behind this (I just tested it out) is when I created the project I have APP_NAME as the folder then in there I have a folder called v0.2.0 which I put the app in, it then put at the same level as v0.2.0 another folder called APP_NAME, so it was like:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">APP_NAME
-<span class="ruby"> <span class="hljs-constant">APP_NAME</span>
</span>-<span class="ruby"> v<span class="hljs-number">0</span>.<span class="hljs-number">2.0</span></span>
</code></pre><p>But when I recreated it, I just used the APP_NAME top level folder to put the project in and it worked fine with simulator.</p>
<p>n00b mistake I am sure, but worth noting for other n00bs coming and looking for answers :):)</p>
