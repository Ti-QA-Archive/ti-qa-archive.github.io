			<p>I know it&#39;s a little late to ask such a question but here it goes:</p>
<p>Why is Titanium the way it is ? Why did it depend on a shipped Javascript engine instead of translating javascript code to native source code that does not depend on an external framework that may suffer from performance issues and has a bigger footprint ?</p>

							<p>Historically, it was because writing an interpreter is hard, a compiler is harder, and it&#39;s tough enough just using someone else&#39;s. Javascript is very dynamic, which is a nice way of saying it doesn&#39;t map well to pure machin code.</p>
<p>It turns out that the language can be complex enough that not even that would be immune from reinterpretation as different objects and values are passed, leading to a very minimal ROI. Consider the following function:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Function(<span class="hljs-literal">a</span>, b) {
<span class="hljs-keyword">If</span> (!<span class="hljs-literal">a</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> b<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">Return</span> <span class="hljs-literal">a</span>+b<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
}
</code></pre><p>This function, mapped to machine code, would be over a dozen different functions based on the values and types of a and b. This is part of why JIT is Just in Time, as opposed to compile once: The methods often have to be recompiled based on inputs.</p>
