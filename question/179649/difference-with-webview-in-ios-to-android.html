							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I can see from your code, that you&#39;re passing a URL to your webview and opening on a click event. Nothing significant to cause an issue it would seem.</p>
<p>My first thought is to try another website URL like Google, to see if it is app related or the webpage returning parameters triggering the event?</p>

										<p><p>Hi Luke thanks for your help, i have tried quite a few different articles and not all but quite a lot seem to get this sidebar appearing issue or some kind of issue with the responsive layout of the webpage, thinking now i might try setting the width to 320 for Android just to test see if its to do with the web page responsive design having a certain width.</p>

										<p><p>Ok i am trying to narrow this down.</p>
<p>Setting a width make no difference i am trying to mimic the IOS layout to see if that was the issue.</p>
<p>So it could be.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The actual webpage loaded has some kind of listener specifically for Android that is causing the layouts to load messed up.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Something is happening with the titanium webview different on Android to IOS.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Cant think of anything else someone please give me some more options? thanks</p>

										<p><p>So did you try another website? You mentioned you tried different articles but unsure if this was on a different  website entirely? The reason for this is because of the data that may be coming back and could be firing events we are unaware of.</p>
<p>I doubt the responsiveness of the website itself is causing the issue.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t found anything to indicate that there are any special requirements for Android as opposed to iOS in regards to webviews.</p>
