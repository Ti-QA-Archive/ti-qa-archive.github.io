			<h1>JS code not compiled when running on simulator</h1>

		<section>
			<p>When doing test compiles within TiStudio and running on an iPhone simulator the following comes up.</p>
<p><strong>[INFO] Skipping JS compile, running from simulator</strong></p>
<p>Is there a way (or is it actually possible) to force the simulator execution to also do the compile and run the compiled JS code instead?</p>

							<p>Adam: Actually, I think this is not referring to forcing a full rebuild by touching or editing tiapp.xml, but rather that when running in the iOS simulator the js is not compiled at all.  It is interpreted as it runs.</p>
<p>While I don&#39;t profess to understand much about the Ti paradigm, my SWAG is that this is intentional do speed up the development cycle in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Skip the time otherwise required to compile the js scripts</li>
<li>Allow changes to be picked up dynamically while app is running</li>
</ul>
<p>The second is similar to the new FastDev support for Android, but you have always been able to do this in iOS since I started with Appcelerator.</p>
<p>Steve: AFAIK, there is not a way to do that.  But why do you care?  IMHO, it is actually preferable this way as it speeds up development.  What is your goal here?</p>

										<p><p>Doug: you are correct this is what I was referring to.</p>
<p>The reason I have asked is that I am creating an app for a client and distributing it to them for testing using AD HOC, but they want to use a third party to do some security testing and that third party have asked for the output  code that runs from the simulator (I assume so they can test it within a simulator as well).</p>
<p>As the simulator output does not seem to compile the JS code I am not really comfortable in handing that over. The AD HOC distribution compiles everything to an .app, but not sure if the simulator has the same provisioning restrictions as a real phone?</p>
<p>Maybe a better question is can the iPhone simulator run a compiled AD HOC .app if is is set up for AD HOC distribution? - maybe I should do some testing.</p>

										<p><p>OK, now I understand the goal better.  The simulator has no provisioning restrictions at all, to my knowledge.</p>
<p>If I am not mistaken, the .app folder or .ipa compiled for a device is not compatible with the simulator because of CPU differences.  I believe XCode outputs entirely different instruction streams.</p>
<p>And I think Ti is outputting different contents in the xcode project based on whether you are running the simulator or distributing to a device.  Therefore, if you want to experiment with this, I would say the starting point would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Ti, compile for distribution to create an xcode project</li>
<li>In XCode, load the distribution project and use it to start the simulator</li>
</ul>
<p>This may end up creating a .app folder you can distribute to third party testers you can&#39;t&#x2F;won&#39;t use a read device with an ad hoc profile.</p>
<p>If that does not work for you, I would suggest obfuscating your js as a partial security by obscurity type of attempt.</p>

										<p><p>Sorry wanted to &quot;re-open&quot; this.</p>
<p>Even doing a compile using XCode (unless I have an incorrect setting somewhere) the whole thing still does not work. I can run the app OK on my set up with XCode in the emulator and compile it etc.  But for it to run on the emulator it still does not include the javascript that was coded up. </p>
<p>This works OK on my machine as the code is there, but on another the app will run up but the first thing it says it can&#39;t find is the app.js.  So actually have not found a solution  and at the moment I don&#39;t think there will be one (apart from a source code NDA).</p>
<p>Reading this <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;4217551&#x2F;what-happens-to-javascript-code-after-app-is-compiled-using-titanium-mobile&#x2F;4798547#4798547">StackOverFlow article</a> it seems that the iOS javascript for deployment is base64&#39;d and the Android JS is compiled.The android code also appears to have a switch that allows for JS compile during development ,I guess what I need is a similar switch or way of doing the same thing for iOS - basically I need the JS to be base64&#39;d and in-lined when the simulator code is generated.</p>
<p>Could really do with a JS compile on iOS with a switch to do this during development as well then I could hand over the simulator output.</p>
<p>Next step is to look at javascript obscurity, if it is actually practical, so if anyone has examples or pointer that would be great.</p>

										<p><p>Well, sorry if I led you on a wild goose chase.  I was just trying to think of something that might work based on my (very) limited knowledge of what Ti does during the project build phase.</p>

										<p><p>Doug: actually your suggestions were very insightful, it has certainly broadened my knowledge of the whole process and has given me a good grounding in where to start and solve my  problem. I just wanted to add a bit more as a knowledge base in case anyone else came across similar circumstances. And of course if I do find an answer&#x2F;workaround I will update here.</p>
<p>This Q&amp;A after all is only as good as the content  and I use it all the time, so I think its good to try and add my own feedback.</p>

							<p>I believe editing tiapp.xml forces a recompile, or if that doesn&#39;t work, empty the projectname&#x2F;build&#x2F;iphone or &#x2F;android directory.</p>
