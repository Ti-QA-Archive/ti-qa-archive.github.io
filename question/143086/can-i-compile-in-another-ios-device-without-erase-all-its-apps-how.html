			<h1>Can i compile in another ios device without erase all it&#39;s app&#39;s, ¿¿¿how???</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hi all, i&#39;m developing an app for my web app, and i got a problem. My boss want to try this app in his ipad, so i have created a new provisioning profile in dev.apple.com, etc… and finally i run from ios device in titanium studio, but the problem is i have to sincronize in itunes in order to have this app in another ios device, and if i sincronize my app via itunes it will erase all my boss apps, and you can imagine what will happen to me if i do this… so anybody know any solution for my problem???</p>

							<p>You can sync the build to the ipad using  Organizer utility in Xcode You open the organizer via the tool bar of Xcode in Window option and also you can use iphone configuration utility to install on ipad and iphone. This utility is available for mac and windows also. Enjoy :) .</p>

										<p><p>Yes test flight is also the option but in that you have to register your boss device to test flight i think he will not be happy to register his device UDiD to some where else , Even you can tell about the iphone Configuration utility by which he can do the work by itself.</p>

							<p>Hi tabe, <strong>there is simple solution around it</strong>, you <strong>create a build for say iPad simulator</strong> and <strong>open that build using X-Code</strong>. now no need to sync your boss iPad with iTunes and just <strong>add the developer profile in your boss iPad</strong> then <strong>deploy app using X-Code directly</strong>.</p>

										<p><p>Hi tabe, ok so here are the things you do,</p>
<p>1: you run your project for iPad simulator from the run menu.</p>
<p>2: Then go to your project directory and there you will find a build folder.</p>
<p>3: go in that and you will see a X-Code project there.</p>
<p>4: Open that project using X-Code and deploy it into your boss iPad.</p>
<p>is this solved your problem?</p>

										<p><p>But then he&#39;ll have to keep plugging his boss device in.  If he just uses Testflight he can just email the link</p>

										<p><p>he does not have to keep plugging, he just need to deploy once and thats it. but yes Testflight option can be another solution… its tabe call, whatever he choose and fit his requirement.</p>
