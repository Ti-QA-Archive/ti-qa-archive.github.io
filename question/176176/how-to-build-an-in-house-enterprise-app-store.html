			<h1>How to build an in-house enterprise app store</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I have a requirement to build an in-house enterprise app store for a client of mine. They need a main CRM app that in turn downloads other apps that we build, stores them inside the main app and runs them from a &#39;launcher&#39; screen within it, similar to another CRM app on the market. </p>
<p>I&#39;m happy building enterprise apps etc, but wondered how I would go about the &#39;app within an app&#39; requirement and whether anyone had faced a similar challenge. For example is it best to accomplish this using in-app purchasing or is there any other method I could use?</p>
<p>Any advice would be much appreciated as I&#39;ve been racking my (limited) brains for a while now!</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Andy</p>

							<p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>you need a SSL-webserver with a real SSL-certificat. Then you load IPA and manifest files on server. Thats all!<br>The format of manifest you find with program &#39;BetaBuilder for OSX&#39;.</p>

										<p><p><strong>iOS:</strong> </p>
<p>it is only allowed, if you have an enterprice Cert from Apple and you restrict the usage with login&#x2F;password or IP-range or other things</p>
<p><strong>Android:</strong> </p>
<p>you can do, what you want, but you cannot force intsallation, you can only let download. The user has to install manually.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Rainer, thanks for the link. Deploying OTA isn&#39;t a problem, my main question was how do I go about effectively storing a downloaded app WITHIN the main app and then running it from within the main app? What I don&#39;t want is multiple apps on the user&#39;s home screen that they could essentially mess with&#x2F;delete inadvertently&#x2F;etc. Cheers, Andy</p>

										<p><p>Yes, but neither of those are on option in this case unfortunately.If the apps can be downloaded to somewhere within the main app then I wouldn&#39;t have to worry about it. The client also wants one centralised app, not multiple apps.</p>

										<p><p>You mean one app and this app has a dynamic dashboard. Customer can install apps inside? Is it possible to program an own operating system for this?</p>
<p>In non-itunes-app you can start remote javascript files. There is a module on market place. I will looking for.</p>

										<p><p>If it helps you, please mark the question as solved.<br>With this devil module you can start remote code, what you need is starting of code from app folder. In this case you can add (=install) code.</p>

										<p><p>I think the best idea is to build an app with all functions. At start the most sub apps are hidden. After &quot;installing&quot; this sub app will be visible. If you have new functions you force a update with a versions reminder or push notification.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Rainer, that module you suggested, am I right in saying that it&#39;s executing .js code remotely and then viewing that through a window in the app? Ideally what I was after was something that would actually download the sub app, although are you saying that would be possible as well? Sorry about all this, appreciate the help!</p>

										<p><p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>what you mean with &quot;sub app&quot;? I think a new window. And I think you think about a dashboard in your main app. Every dashboard item can start a sub app.</p>
<p>I see different solutions:</p>
<ol>
<li>using of webviews as &quot;sub app&quot; (bad idea)</li>
<li>creating of special script language. This interpreter interpretes JSON, maybe you can use the evil JS command &#39;evalJS&#39;. In this case you can download new JS-code and start by evalJS</li>
<li>all sub apps are part of main app. You simulate a download (spinner) and makes a dashboard item visible.</li>
</ol>
<p>Clients has crazy ideas …</p>

										<p><p>Haha - yeah you&#39;re right there!! I don&#39;t think option 3 above is going to be a possibility as they&#39;ll be releasing and updating apps all the time, so to make the user download the main app every time will become cumbersome.</p>

										<p><p>You can use a versions reminder. In my cases the module looks to playstore, grabs the version number on HTML page and tests. In your case (private delivery) you must copy a little file  into web space … </p>
<p>In an other client project the content was a big collection of PDFs. In this case on web space was a list of all assets with md5 hash and the app has self sync the PDFs. In your case you can solve similar. If a new module is avaliable you can force update with a fine spinner and&#x2F;or progressbar …</p>

							<p>Hi Andy, </p>
<p>instead of reinventing the wheel (building an enterprise app store), you could also use a commercial ready-made solution.</p>
<p>There are plenty so called MDM products at the market. A MDM solution (Mobile Device Management) gives you many features including an enterprise app store.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apptec360.com&#x2F;en_emm_feature_description.html">APPTEC360 Enterprise Mobile Manager</a></p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.air-watch.com&#x2F;pricing">AirWatch by vmware</a></p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.citrix.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;xenmobile&#x2F;overview.html">XenMobile by Citrix</a></p>
<p>and many more…</p>
