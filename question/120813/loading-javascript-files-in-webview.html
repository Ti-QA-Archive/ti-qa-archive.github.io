			<h1>Loading javascript files in WebView</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am trying to load a javascript library (dojo) inside a webview. The base of the library loads (dojo base) but the webview can not load additional files from the library so I can use additional components such as charting. If I load the library from an external web site instead of the local file system it works fine, but I don&#39; want to download the library everytime I run the webview. Any ideas (nice to see this forum is using dojo) ?</p>

							<p>Ahhh, who doesn&#39;t love Dojo. Ok, so as you know, Dojo has some slick wizardry going on with their package&#x2F;module&#x2F;dependency management, so if you are getting any errors, exceptions, debug messages, core dumps, etc, those will be essential in getting to the bottom of your issue.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, remember that Dojo loads everything based on where dojo is &#39;installed&#39; (where dojo.js lives). Of course, this is relative to the applications webroot. I&#39;m willing to bet that Dojo and a native webview don&#39;t necessarily agree on that location. That is why the external lib works just fine.</p>
<p>If that is the issue, you can go about dealing with it in a couple different ways. You can consult Dojo Mobile and see what it can do for you (package is dojox.mobile), or you can grab yourself a copy of the Dojo source and create a custom build. Your custom build will be nicely packaged and compressed into a single file, which means you only need to know the location of 1 file rather than 20.</p>
<p>I&#39;m partial to custom builds myself, all the code you need, none of the code you don&#39;t, no worries about what files live where according to which application.</p>

							<p>Thanks for the quick response. I am using a custom build and it works fine in the simulator but not on the actual iPhone. The custom build still required the dojox&#x2F;gfx library files to be placed on the file system because they apparently lazy load when they hit the dojo.require. I included the gfx library in my custom build but it didnt help. It would be nice to know what the local path absolutes are when loading a webview. I have placed the dojox&#x2F;gfx library in every directory from Resources down. Maybe something doesn&#39;t get copied to the build directory. Still not sure.</p>

										<p><p>A custom build should handle this problem without issue. Would you mind posting the contents of your builds profile.js file?</p>

										<p><p>I noticed when I looked at my app package contents the dojox&#x2F;gfx directory contains no .js files, not sure why they don&#39;t get copied. I used the dojo web builder to build my dojo.js file so I do not have a profile.js. If I search the contents of my dojo.js that I include the gfx  modules in I can see the gfx objects provided. I can provide you the dojo.js files (with gfx and without) but they are pretty cryptic ?</p>

										<p><p>If you are using the web builder, then everything should be included in your download unless a module is required that wasn&#39;t included in the build. Also, the web builder should only give you a single file (dojo.js), so there would be no need for a dojox&#x2F;gfx directory in your package contents.</p>
<p>Have you tried running your webview in a normal browser to see if everything gets loaded correctly? Obviously you would need to comment any Titanium code, but you would be able to verify everything is working correctly.</p>
<p>If you test in a browser and everything loads correctly, then I can take a look at your files if you&#39;d like. You can put them up on GitHub or shoot me a DevMail if you would rather email me directly.</p>
