			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am creating an application where I have a large form capturing over 100 fields split into multiple screens.</p>
<p>Currently I am using a window for each screen (each containing the form fields).</p>
<p>Can someone direct me what would is the best practice to link up each of these forms</p>
<ol>
<li>Is it ok to open a window for each form or is it better to action via views?</li>
<li>Should the last step close all forms via code or is it better to close each previous window as we proceed?</li>
<li>I prefer not to use tab groups but open to the same, when we move from one tab group to another, do all open screens under the tab group release memory? </li>
</ol>
<p>Working on Android, 2.0 APIs, 1.6 Titanium SDK</p>

							<p>personally i would set up each step as a function. my flow would be step 1, step 2… I would wrap each of the forms in a function with a number in the function name, so I can then set a variable, say i=1. Then with each &quot;next step button&quot; click call i++; and then call function step_[i].</p>
<p>function step_1() { clear and set UI elements }<br>function step_2() { clear and set UI Elements }</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>This would help memory as you are only rendering one form at a time, not all at once.<br>To get really clever with it, I would call a script to send and store the data in a DB after each step, so the user could return, or if there is a break in service, the user wont lose all the data.</p>
<p>no right or wrong ways here, just good and bad.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Corey, thanks for the reply. In your recommendation therefore, are you suggesting I stay on one window and then keep hiding unhiding views with the functions?</p>
<p>I did try the method of calling 1 window from another and that worked really well from a UI perspective, but I can see a memory leak of 2 MB everytime I fill the entire set of forms and reach the menu again….</p>

										<p><p>Yes, I am saying to stay on one window with hide() show(). However not with a window, but with a view.</p>
<p>Or if your input fields are the same throughout each step, maybe just changing the label will work.</p>
<p>keep swinging that axe. post if you find some cool way to do it. might help someone.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Corey,</p>
<p>I went ahead with dedicating a window to each step ie. 1 form 1 window. Each form is very different. It worked well where in I allow the user to input data into the form and on clicking the save button, destroy the current window and open a new window with the next form.</p>
<p>I am seeing some memory leaks but investigating the same (some are reported items to be cleared in the 1.7 release list). I will keep you posted of the end result!</p>

							<p>I&#39;d also rethink the whole &quot;100 fields&quot; thing.  I doubt people are going to fill out that many fields on a touchscreen device.</p>
