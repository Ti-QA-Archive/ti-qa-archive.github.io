			<h1>Pricing for overages on App EXPLORE Cloud</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve been looking everywhere but can&#39;t find this information.<br>What is the overage pricing for App EXPLORE Cloud accounts. </p>
<p>How much do I get charged once I go over any of these quotas:<br>5,000,000 Push Notifications<br>5,000,000 API Calls<br>20GB Storage<br>100,000 Emails</p>
<p>Don&#39;t understand why is this information not clearly displayed, every other MBAAS provider clearly states their overages.<br>I don&#39;t want to use something If I don&#39;t know the potential cost of it.</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;ve had a friend follow up his inquiry and he said that what the sales guy came back with is, that they do not have an overage pricing. You only get what you get originally and if you go over you either get capped or you need to convert to their premium plan. And he was also not clear how much more you get additionally with their premium plans. </p>
<p>Pretty much whole pricing system is very murky and unknown.</p>

							<div><p>Thanks for following up. This is very worrying that something like this is missing.<br>Looking at the premium plan, it has the exact amount of resources as the other paid ones, so there is no resource increment there.</p>
<p>Can some from Appcelerator chime in and clear this for us? This post has been up for 3 days and no response from them, not a good sign.</p>

							<div><p>Hi Faruk, any luck finding out the overages prices? Plans &amp; Pricing page doesn&#39;t answer much and it suggests after you go over your monthly quota the only solution to increase it is by joining the enterprise plan $999&#x2F;user&#x2F;month. This price may be fine for medium&#x2F;large companies but for an individual or a startup it&#39;s pretty steep.</p>

							<p>Yes but that page doesn&#39;t answer the question about overages :)<br>I was hoping to avoid numerous sales calls just to get some basic info at this early stage of evaluation of a product.</p>

										<p><p>yes you are right in that link its mention that :</p>
<h4 id="additional-increments-are-charged-based-upon-the-usage-above-your-plan-limit-and-will-be-billed-at-the-end-of-the-month-">Additional increments are charged based upon the usage above your plan limit and will be billed at the end of the month.</h4>
<p>And you should contact with sales team to get latest updated plan of ACS.</p>

										<p><p>My buddy contacted the sales and after 2 sales guys  and  2 phones calls and numerous emails he still could not get an answer on the overage.  So I am trying to avoid the same faith.  Appcelerator  system looks cool and free allowance is generous but I think that making this overage cost so hard to find raises concerns and tarnishes the image of the company, at least in my eyes.  I am generally weary of companies which have hidden pricing structures. It&#39;s just a natural reaction, hope you understand.</p>
