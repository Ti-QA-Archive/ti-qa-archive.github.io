			<h1>How are you managing Dev and Prod version of you app?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m trying to figure out a best practice for keeping a dev and production version of the app. As far as I know, to get 2 versions of the same app on a phone, they have to have a different name. In order to get that from Titanium, they need to be two different projects.</p>
<p>Here is what I&#39;m currently doing, but it seems a little kludgey. </p>
<p>Create two projects, WTFAYdev and WTFAY. I&#39;m using the same app id for both (com.wtfay.wtfay). I do my development in the WTFAYdev project. When I&#39;m ready to submit to the app store, I copy the resources directory to the 2nd project and build&#x2F;submit from there. </p>
<p>After the app is in the store, I can then have both versions on my iphone. My dev to prod migration is manual, but I plan to use git in a smarter way to manage both projects. </p>
<p>Anyone have a better way of doing this?</p>
<p>I won&#39;t complicate this by talking about push credential management, but I&#39;ve also got Urban Airship integrated into the app.</p>

							<p>If I were you, I would just keep a single version of the project, but version control your source code with SVN or Git. Make thorough comments when you check code in so you can view your progress in a version log. You can export (branch) versions of your code, rollback when needed, and keep new development moving forward without having duplicate code everywhere.</p>
<p>Just my two cents. Good luck!</p>

										<p><p>Normally, I would agree with your approach, but with your solution, you can&#39;t get two different versions of the app on you phone. I want a stable, demo-able version on my phone and also a dev version for development. Are you table to get multiple versions of you app on your phone?</p>

							<p>Is there a switch somewhere to turn off development mode when building to device?  I want to demo this to clients in prod mode and not get verbose errors?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
