			<h1>Problems Publishing to Google Play After Reverting From Java 7 to Java 6</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have been having many problems uploading my app to Google Play, all of which seem to be related to Java 7 which I didn&#39;t know was a problem until after I started having issues. After much reading I reverted my Mac back to Java 6. I recompiled the app but continued to get &quot;package not signed correctly&quot; errors when attempting to install from the Play store, but I think that was due to my keystore being created under Java 7. I now have a new keystore file created under Java 6, I have recompiled the app, but now I can&#39;t get it uploaded to Google Play. When I try I get &quot;You uploaded an APK that is signed with a different certificate to your previous APKs.&quot; And that is true, however you cannot delete the old APKs. It is simply not an option that I have found. Because this is a new app, I don&#39;t have any issue just deleting this app from Google Play and starting over. That also does not seem to be an option. I unpublished the old app and created a new app, but because the old one still exists, when I try to upload the new APK I get an error stating that the application ID is already in use by another application which is also true, but only because I cannot delete it. So, I cannot upload the new APK to either the old application or the new application. The easy fix (I guess) is to create a new application ID and just move on. Before I do that I wanted to see if anyone else had gone through this and was able to get around any of these obsticles or if anyone had any advice. And, if I do need to change the application ID, does it just need to be changed in tiapp and AndroidManifest, or are there some other less obvious locations that I need to update?</p>
<p>If it matters at all, I am using Titanium Studio and SDK 3.2.0GA. Java is 1.6.0. Android SDK is Android 2.3.3. OSX 10.9.1.</p>

							<p>I dont think there&#39;s any way around it.  The Android docs <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.google.com&#x2F;appengine&#x2F;docs&#x2F;java&#x2F;gettingstarted&#x2F;uploading">here</a> say</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Note: Once you register an <span class="hljs-type">application</span> ID, you can delete <span class="hljs-keyword">it</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">but</span> you can't re-register <span class="hljs-keyword">that</span> same <span class="hljs-type">application</span> ID <span class="hljs-keyword">after</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">it</span> has been deleted. You can skip these next steps <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> you don't want <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> register an ID <span class="hljs-keyword">at</span> this <span class="hljs-property">time</span>.
