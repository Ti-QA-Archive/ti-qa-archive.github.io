			<p>Question about image sizes with retina displays.</p>
<p>I know you can do the thing where you save two versions of a file. </p>
<p>my_image.png &amp; my_image@2x.png</p>
<p>Of course the &quot;@2x&quot; version is shown if you have a retina display.</p>
<p>So for example my_image.png is 100x100 &amp; my_image@2x.png is 200x200. </p>
<p>I often do not bother with the my_image@2x.png version. I just save my_image.png as 200x200. Then in my code I do this.</p>
<p><code>Ti.UI.createImageView({
    width: &amp;#39;100dp&amp;#39;,
    height: &amp;#39;100dp&amp;#39;
});</code></p>
<p>I realize there could be a performance issue on non-retina displays. As it has to load an image that is twice as big and scale it down.</p>
<p>Other than that is there any reason I am missing to save 2 versions of the file instead of one image twice as big?</p>
<p>Really a question to learn more about how and why to see if I am doing anything wrong.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>Besides performance, there&#39;s also a visual penalty for image reduction. Having the ability to fine-tune your image is nice, if you care about what your app looks like on those devices.</p>
<p>Also, Android is more stingy memory, and high-res images on devices that don&#39;t need them could run you into trouble.</p>
<p>The only code feedback I have is that you should set <code>hires:true</code> too, if a single image is your approach.</p>

							<p>The problem comes from a misunderstanding of the value of retina displays.</p>
<p>Retina support is NOT creating 2x sized images and then cutting their resolution in half for the other devices.</p>
<p>Nor is it taking your standard graphics and doubling the resolution.</p>
<p>It is about creating graphics whose resolution is appropriate for the target platform.</p>
<p><strong>It is about offering retina users a better experience with enhanced graphics, more details, sharper lines, better shades.</strong></p>

										<p><p>So let&#39;s tweak Spicer&#39;s procedure just a little bit – rather than just upscaling his 100x100 and saving as 200x200, what if he started with a true 200x200 image and then used the </p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">Ti</span><span class="hljs-class">.UI</span><span class="hljs-class">.createImageView</span>(<span class="hljs-rules">{
    <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">width</span>:<span class="hljs-value"> <span class="hljs-string">'100dp'</span>,
    height: <span class="hljs-string">'100dp'</span>
</span></span></span>});
</code></pre><p>technique to make it the right physical size on screen.  On a retina display, 100x100dp would show the full 200x200 pixels.  On a non-retina display, presumably, the device would downsample the image automatically.</p>
<p>Assuming that this image looked good scaled down (and many images look just fine, while some fine-lined artwork might look terrible), what sort of penalty would be incurred in that situation?</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the thoughtful response. </p>
<p>Yep. That is what I am doing. Starting with graphic that was designed to 200x200. More or less in photoshop our canvas as 640x960.</p>

										<p><p>Jason, exactly, and in case my bold seemed like &#39;yelling&#39; that wasn&#39;t the intent, but to show the summary point of the post.  </p>
<p>If you are doing x-platform, as Shannon mentioned, Android is a beast at times.  Also, to lower your package size, if you decide to use  @2x images, put them in the iphone directory so they don&#39;t get packaged for android and share the regular sized images x-platform.</p>
