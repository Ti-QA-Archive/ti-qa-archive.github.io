							<p>Simply set it to the root of the Android SDK installation. (it requires a directory, not an executable)</p>
<p>Also, make sure you have the <code>2.3.3</code> package installed as well as one of the latest ones <code>4.2.2</code> or <code>4.3</code>. The old one is required for compatibility reasons. The latest one is to have access to the latest features.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

										<p><p>To to give you a little more detail.</p>
<p>You can only set one SDK in Studio, usually, that is the latest one. But in order for everything to work, you <strong>have to have 2.2.3 installed</strong>. Whether you use it or not.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m having this same issue now. It was working fine before updating Studio today.</p>
<p>I&#39;m getting &quot;[Android SDK Home] No Android SDKs were found under the specified SDK location&quot; - when I do have the SDK pointing to &#x2F;opt&#x2F;android-sdk and I do have at least 2.3.x installed  (up to 4.3)</p>

										<p><p>I had upgraded my CLI to 3.2.0. </p>
<p>Downgrading to 3.1.2 has fixed it. But now I can&#39;t try the 3.2.0 Ti SDK.</p>
