			<h1>Object reference between windows, in different files</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Ok guys i&#39;ll try to make this clear, i have tried a lot before asking.</p>
<p>What i want to do: get a object ( createActivityIndicator ) refence between files, so i can access it&#39;s properties in the other file.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a example:<br>(in default.js)</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">

<span class="actionscript">
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> act = Ti.UI.createActivityIndicator();
act.show();

buttonEnterWindow.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{

    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> windowService = Titanium.UI.createWindow({        
        url : <span class="hljs-string">'/windows/service.js'</span>,    
    });
    windowService.open();

});</span>
</code></pre><p>(and in service.js i WANT to get the act and hide() it)</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">//act<span class="hljs-instruction"> instance </span>from default.js
act.hide(<span class="hljs-function">)</span>;
</code></pre><p>Question:<br>is it possible?</p>

							<p>Don&#39;t use app-level events. :)</p>
<p>Use &quot;windowService&quot; &quot;open&quot; event to hide activity indicator:</p>

										<p><p>i&#39;m testing both ways, actually the program is kinda medium-size. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve created a lot of object refences attaching to lists rows, but never like this, ill mark the best soon as i test. thanks guys!</p>

										<p><p>Neither is setting the property on each window, as you could have many properties and it becomes cumbersome attaching them to each new window that you create. </p>
<p>The real answer is what Lucian suggested, using a framework like CommonJS or Tweetanium and having a single master context to handle shared classes&#x2F;functions&#x2F;objects rather than using the Kitchen Sink model. However I&#39;ve gotten sick of suggesting that in every single answer that I post. :)</p>

										<p><p>Justin, CommonJS modules have similar problems, modules creates new JS context and everything you did needs to be re-required or passed as parameter. </p>
<p>Single context &amp; CommonJS is definitely a way to go in a long term, but sometimes it&#39;s just impossible to re-write whole app.</p>
<p>Anyway, Marlom, just remember that app-level events are global events and they suffer from similar problems as global variables. If you don&#39;t understand them, the best is to avoid them.</p>

										<p><p>Single context aside, I just feel like suggesting that passing in an activity indicator into every single window in an app isn&#39;t better advice than having app level events for sharing something application-wide.</p>
<p>At least with the app level events you only have to declare in one place (most likely app.js or some file included in app.js), and then you fire the event to show&#x2F;hide the activity indicator from each window.</p>
<p>With your suggestion and a 10 window app, you have to manually pass in the activity indicator object into each of the 10 windows, which will cause a lot of extra code and is more error prone. I would suggest setting the objects on the window for other scenarios though where it&#39;s not something application-wide, and this is how I used to do things before I switched to Tweetanium and single context.</p>
<p>Marlom learned two ways to skin a cat, and that&#39;s the important thing though.</p>

										<p><p>Actually i learned three ways, the solution in the comment, passing the object as reference to the other window is a lot better, because i want to set a timeout there, hope this post help others. Thanks you both!</p>

										<p><p>Justin, passing parameters between contexts in multicontext environment in the way that I said (notice that my original answer was not that), is official advice like it or not … I dislike it for similar reasons you give here, but my feelings are not important, it is important to give advice to the man that solves his problem in domain of his problem.</p>
<p>app-level events are not official way of solving this kind of problem because they can easily cause memory leaks if they are not used property. You can like them because they are simple and handy to use, but they come at cost. By just giving that advice, you showed one side of the coin to the man, you should explain the other side also, so he can understand what are potential troubles with app-level events and how to avoid them.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

							<p>Hi,</p>
<p>You can do this by using app wide events: Ti.App.addEventListener. But I don&#39;t think this is the best approach to creating an App. You should take a look at CommonJS modules first. Good luck.</p>

							<p>It&#39;s possible. Here&#39;s one way you could do it.</p>
<p>Default.js:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> act = Ti.UI.createActivityIndicator();
act.show();

Ti.App.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">"showProgress"</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
  act.show();
});

Ti.App.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">"hideProgress"</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
  act.hide();
});

buttonEnterWindow.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{

    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> windowService = Titanium.UI.createWindow({      
        url : <span class="hljs-string">'/windows/service.js'</span>,    
    });
    windowService.open();

});
</code></pre><p>services.js:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">Ti</span><span class="hljs-class">.App</span><span class="hljs-class">.fireEvent</span>("<span class="hljs-tag">hideProgress</span>");
