			<p>Hello.<br>I&#39;m developping for android mobile in windows xp. Today, after some weeks of development and apparently without any special reason, when I try to launch my app in the android emulator, it stays stucked after the info message &quot;Copying project resources..&quot;.<br>After searching online without understand why this stopped to work, I&#39;ve uninstalled both titanium and android SDK and emulator and, after cleaing up my system, reinstalled from scratch.<br>At this moment, after reinstallation, the same thing is happening: I&#39;m getting stuck when I launch the compiler and emulator after the same message.<br>Checking the trace log, I found that it stays repeating forever a cycle of this trace:</p>
<p>&lt;script src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;820996.js&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;script&gt;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve lost almost all my work day trying to fix this… unsucsessfully.</p>
<p>Does anybody knows a solution?</p>
<p>Many thanks<br>Alberto</p>

<p>What happens when you using Titanium SDK 1.4 rather than 1.5+?  If it works, then you have probably encountered a common problem between java and Windows XP.</p>
<p>Java requires contiguous (non-fragmented) memory (and Titanium 1.5 needs 1GB, as opposed to 1.4 which only needs 512MB) while Windows XP has very poor memory management capabilities exacerbated by a memory limit of 2GB (less overhead) for applications. </p>
<p>The ideal solution would be for you to upgrade to Windows 7, which manages memory better. If this is not possible, you need to clean up your runtime memory, by preventing unnecessary applications and services from running at startup (it&#39;s not sufficient to stop them after the OS has loaded, because this may not necessarily free memory properly).</p>
<p>It would be interesting to know how you get on with this.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Your system was configured correctly, which is why it worked up until now. There was no need for you to reinstall java or set any environment variables, and in doing so you may well have introduced new problems.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t worry about the &quot;Error Loading Preferences&quot; message; it can safely be ignored, as it does not cause any issues. The same happens on my system.</p>
<p>Again, please tell me what happens when you launch your app using Titnaium SDK 1.4.3.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

										<p><p>Thanks again, Paul.<br>I&#39;ve made a run with Titanium SDK 1.4.3 and it happened the same. I&#39;ll attach the trace log here.</p>
<p>gist here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;822357</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&#39;ll try to understand what&#39;s happened with this installation.<br>A.</p>

										<p><p>Please follow the instructions at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.appcelerator.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;installing_on_windows.html#install_diagnostics_for_windows">Install Diagnostics for Windows</a>.   Copy the <em>output</em> and paste it to your preferred pastebin service. It&#39;s important that you do not modify it <strong>in any way</strong>, as this could mask problems with your configuration. Do <strong>NOT</strong> paste it here! This is because the system will change the formatting.</p>
<p>Please create and share a screenshot of your android installed packages.</p>
<p>Also, state the processor and RAM installed to your system.</p>
<p>Then I will help you further.</p>

							<p>Thanks, Paul, for your answer.<br>It&#39;s strange that you refer a memory problem, as I&#39;ve already made a lot of runs with titanium and android emulator even with a lot of programs - photoshop, picasa, browser … - opened simultaneously and it worked.<br>Today, I&#39;ve reinstalled all java.<br>It seems that is a &quot;java provlem&quot;. I&#39;ve checked and corrected the environment variables (java_home, classpath and path) to point to the correct directory; i&#39;ve checked for existing copies of the java executables and everything looks fine.<br>At this moment, I&#39;m getting a message &quot;Java Error Loading Preferences&quot; on the 3rd java window that opens and close immediatelly when launching the android emulator and I&#39;m trying to get a solution for this.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you have any other suggestion regarding this new &quot;clues&quot;, please, let me know.</p>
<p>A.</p>
