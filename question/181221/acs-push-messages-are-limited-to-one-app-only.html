			<h1>ACS Push messages are limited to one app only</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, you can only provide one Apple Development Push Certificate to ACS Node and Apple requires a different Certificate for each app. I have a light and a pro version of an app. There seems to be no way that both apps can receive push certificates from the same server.</p>

							<p>I believe that is true.  But the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;cloud&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;rest">restful API</a> is so easy to use that you could easily build some code around the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;cloud&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;PushNotifications-method-notify">push_notifications.notify</a> call to send the same thing to two different apps.</p>

										<p><p>I have no experience with restful API. I still do not understand how it can help me. I see in the documentation that you can provide a key=&lt;APP_KEY&gt; but this is not enough. The node.acs server needs to handle two push certificates for iOS. If you think this is possible could you maybe provide some code or pseudo code or at least some key points how to do this? Thanks</p>

										<p><p>An app is still only going to handle one APNs cert.  So you would need two apps defined in ACS (I&#39;m guessing that the two versions of your app have different bundle IDs, right?).</p>
<p>So you define two apps in ACS, give each one the appropriate APNs cert that is tied to that bundle ID at apple, and then when it&#39;s time to send a notification, you use the ACS API to send it to each of the apps.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if your push notifications are generated by automation software or if you send them manually.</p>
<p>If you send them manually, you might have to build yourself a simple web app somewhere that takes the text of the notification from a web form and sends it via the ACS API to each app.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re sending via automation, just add the appropriate HTTP calls to your automation code.</p>
<p>In the answer to <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;140589&#x2F;how-to-send-push-notifiaction-to-android-using-php-controled-acs-">this question</a> is an example of using the API to send a push notification.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, I am having two apps with different bundle ID. I have a Node.ACS server which sends a push notification automated to a group of users. I guess the clue is that in the rest API I can set the app id and in the Titanium SDK I can not?</p>
