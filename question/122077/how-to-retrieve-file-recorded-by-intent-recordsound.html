			<h1>How to retrieve file recorded by intent RECORD_SOUND</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I succeed in launching app for recording in android since there is no straight method in TI yet using the blog here:<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;02&#x2F;launching-activities-and-using-content-uris-in-android.html</p>
<p>It records fine but I am unable to retrieve file to save it in SD card. It seems that the activity store the result in a file in the root of the sdcard which I cannot read from my function in Titanium. </p>
<p>So is there a way:</p>
<p>to request the intent to store the result inside the SD card application folder ?</p>
<p>to access file for uploading to server ?</p>

							<div><p>Abdul,</p>
<p>Just so I am clear here, you are launching the built-in Android audio recorder from within your app, and you want the recorded file to be available for upload from your original application? Is this correct?</p>
