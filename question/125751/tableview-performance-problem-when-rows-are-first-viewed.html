			<h1>TableView performance problem when rows are first viewed.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m having a surprisingly difficult time with the performance of a TableView in my iPhone app. It looks like I&#39;m not the only one, and I&#39;ve found a few suggestions that have helped, like adding class names and avoiding auto width and height. </p>
<p>However, I&#39;m still having a lot of trouble with my table performance the first time a row comes in to view. It&#39;s very jumpy on my iPhone 4 as I scroll down an view rows for the first time. Once all the rows have appeared on the screen once the table is smooth, so it seems to be only the first time. Has anyone ever experienced this?</p>

							<div><p>Well, the intent of this question was not so much to get people to look through my my source code and solve my problem. I&#39;m mainly trying to see if others have had problems similar to me. This is an intentionally general question. I will, however, create a stripped down test application and see if I can replicate the slow-ness. If I do I&#39;ll post some code.</p>

							<p>yup. I have the same issue. The performance is really bad (choppy) till scroll down to the last row, only then performance is enhanced. If i didn&#39;t reach the last row, performance is still choppy. (jumpy, jaggy, etc…)</p>

										<p><p>It almost feels like some kind of caching issue. As if IOS or Titanium are trying to save memory by only rendering the rows as they come in to view. I&#39;m not sure what to do, but as I said in my comment above, I&#39;m going to try to run some generic tests soon to see if I can nail down the problem.</p>
