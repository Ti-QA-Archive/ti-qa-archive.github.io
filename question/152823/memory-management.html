			<h1>Memory Management</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello, I have created an app that simulates a decision tree. When one section is chosen, its children are then loaded into the view.</p>
<p>The app creates new views to display on each selection and then destroys the previous views no longer needed. </p>
<p>My question is : I have created an object pool to keep all the created views and then reuse them and repopulate them on each selection. However, I am not sure if this now creates a memory overhead instead. </p>
<p>Is it better to create and destroy, rather than reuse? Am I saving memory by having less objects within memory, but then am I slowing the app down by having to continuously create and destroy elements?</p>
<p>Any help is much appreciated. Thanks</p>

							<div><p>Basically, I have two options, nullify each view element when its no longer shown, creating new view elements every time I need them, or, to simply empty the views of content and return them to a &#39;Pool&#39; , not nullifying them and reusing them again by populating them, instead of instantiating new views…</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the link, What I am trying to ascertain though, is is it better to have reusable objects or to destroy and create new objects and views as and when they are needed. For example if using AIR for mobile devices, its CPU intensive to create and destroy views and children, so its better to create and reuse hiding objects and showing them when needed.</p>
<p>I wanted to know if its better not to destroy objects as it might slow my app constantly creating new views, or if the app does this easily and instead suffers from having too many objects in memory.</p>

										<p><p>Well it depends upon the situation as you would see in  this video that he is saying that if the resource is being used again and again you could avoid to remove it but if it is being used rarely then you could delete it and regenerate it.It totally depends upon the situation dear</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
