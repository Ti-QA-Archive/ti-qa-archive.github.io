			<h1>Window Hierarchy</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>According to the iOS human interface guidelines, an app only has one window and then different views that change within that window. In the tutorials I have done for titanium it always mentioned to create a different window and then add other views to that new window when moving between screens, closing old windows as necessary to reduce memory consumption. Is this just a naming difference where a window in Titanium is similar to a view in iOS and the app itself is that iOS main window? Basically, will this be a problem once I try to publish an app having multiple windows?</p>
<p>Taken from <em>iOS Human Interface Guidelines</em>:</p>
<p><em>&quot;An iOS app includes a window. But—unlike a window in a computer app—an iOS window has no visible parts and it can’t be moved to another location on the display. Most iOS apps contain only one window; apps that support an external display can have more than one.&quot;</em></p>

							<p>Well, what they&#39;re talking about is more along the lines of don&#39;t try to create a UI with an <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Multiple_document_interface">MDI</a> interface, in other words, separate resizable content areas with borders &amp; UI controls (title bars, scroll bars, etc) that users interact with. Users won&#39;t Tile or Cascade the portions of your app, like they might on a Windows desktop.</p>
<p>But you can&#39;t take this HIG rule too literally. Most apps have multiple areas via which you interact with the app. Tool-areas where there are buttons &amp; controls to click and content areas. Often they&#39;re bordered areas. Sometimes there are scrollbars, etc. </p>
<p>Apple&#39;s own apps fail to follow this guideline literally. Safari has tabs (which are separate windows). Mail has multiple panes (mail list &amp; mail content). Settings has a split window UI with actions grouped and separated by type of function.</p>
<p>With Titanium, you can create tabbed interfaces, splitwindows, or single-window apps. Depending on the which of those you use, new windows open either within the tab&#x2F;splitwindow or over the top of the existing window. None of those things are breaking Apple&#39;s guideline on their own. I suppose you could bend them to do so.</p>
