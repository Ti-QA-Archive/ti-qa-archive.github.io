			<h1>setting volume in audio streaming</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m trying to build a radio streaming app, but there&#39;s no way to set the volume at an audio stream.</p>
<p>I would be very happy if anybody could provide a MPVolumeView workaround or whatever hack &#x2F; fix that could make me assign volume to a slider using a stream.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

							<p>the volume property is for the Sound object, AudioPlayer objects don&#39;t have a volume property and the Ti.Media.volume doesn&#39;t work…</p>
<p>Thanks for the try anyway.</p>
<p>Any other guess?</p>

							<p>Pablo is correct there is no volume control for streaming audio, the app user must use the hardware volume buttons to control the volume level.</p>
<p>It turns out this issue was for some reason missed but the powers that be have now found this issue again and to my understanding they have agreed this is an inconsistency and wrong and a fix is planned for the 1.6 release, whenever that may be.</p>
<p>Personally someone needs to take a good look at the streaming as it pretty much doesn&#39;t work in Android and I have been waiting almost a year now for a fix, so much so I have had to investigate writing native code to make my apps work, which totally defeats the purpose of Appcelerator. I have having the same issue with iPhone also, again defeating the whole purpose of Appcelerator.</p>
