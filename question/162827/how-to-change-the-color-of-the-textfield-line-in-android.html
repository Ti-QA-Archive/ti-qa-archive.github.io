			<h1>How to change the color of the TextField line in Android?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I was wondering if there is any way to change the color of the line in the TextField to be something other than the default blue in Android. I&#39;m working with Titanium 3.2.0, Mac OS X 10.9.1 and a Nexus 4 for debugging. I&#39;ve tried doing it <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;11485595&#x2F;change-edittext-border-color">this way</a> by replacing all the relevant drawables with the newly colored ones in the android SDK folders but it didn&#39;t work.</p>

							<div><p>In order to help you, you need to provide some code example of what you want, what you have and what you&#39;ve tried. Also, what do you mean when you say &quot;change the color of the line in the TextField&quot;? There is no line-related property for the TextField view.</p>

							<div><p>Sorry about that. I don&#39;t have any code examples because I&#39;m not even sure if it is possible to do this in Titanium which was the reason I asked in the first place. I believe I have mentioned what I have tried already (there is a link in the question). It is because there is no line-related property in TextField that I&#39;m asking this question. The line I&#39;m talking about is that blue one under the text that we input as can be seen in this image: <img src="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;eclipsesource.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2012&#x2F;02&#x2F;image03.png" alt="to see image click here"> If you go to your android-sdk-macosx folder then platforms –&gt; android-&lt;version#&gt; –&gt; data –&gt; res –&gt; drawable-mdpi, you can see drawables (9Patches) such as textfield_activated_holo_light.9.png. This is what I tried to change before (by changing the color in the image itself) but it had no effect on my app. I simply want to change the color of the blue line to some other color (although at this point it doesn&#39;t seem like a very simple task). Does this clarify things?</p>

							<p>Have you tried just setting a backgroundImage for the TextField? Something like <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;img42.com&#x2F;fPJnb">this</a></p>

							<p>Take a look at this <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;adampaxton.com&#x2F;custom-android-action-bar-and-holo-themes-in-titanium.aspx">blog post</a> by Adam Paxton. Its a good start for getting custom themes working in your project.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Ken Corcoran. I have read that post before and I already have a custom theme but it didn&#39;t do anything to change the TextField view. I&#39;ve also read posts on changing themes of widgets such as Android&#39;s EditText which is what I tried following the link I posted in my question. But that didn&#39;t work either. Do you have any other ideas?</p>

							<p>In addition to backgroundImage, setting backgroundFocusedColor and backgroundFocusedImage also worked for me.</p>
