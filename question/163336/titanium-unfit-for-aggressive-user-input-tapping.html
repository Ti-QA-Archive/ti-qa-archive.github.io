			<h1>Titanium unfit for &#39;aggressive&#39; user input (tapping)?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I just started developing with Titanium Studio using Alloy for Android. For now I&#39;m just creating a tableview with some data from a model. When tapping on a row, another window will open with some text displayed.</p>
<p>I noticed that when the app is loading on my android device and I &#39;aggressively&#39; start to tap the screen to the point where the tableview is being shown. The app will crash… (device notifies: The application has stopped working.) and you have to kill the process.<br>Or sometimes if I aggressively tap the screen up to the point where the tableview is being shown; the app wont crash and the new window actually opened… but it opened twice!</p>
<p>On normal circumstances i.e. I &#39;calmly&#39; wait for the app being loaded and I&#39;m not tapping the screen all the time, everything is fine. It seems like the Alloy framework cant keep up when quickly tapping the screen. (Tries to submit the user input while the table is still loading which results in a crash?)</p>
<p>Do more people have this issue? Should I use something else than tableview for displaying data?<br>I just want my app to work fine, also for user who are more &#39;aggressive&#39; with tapping the screen…<br>Maybe I can put a delay for when the app is allowed to process user input? But I wouldn&#39;t know how to do it.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance and excuse me for my english :),<br>Chris</p>

							<p>You can add a variable to set if a row was tapped, you execute the function in the event listener only in case no rows were tapped before, but you&#39;ll need to add a function to reset the variable once the child window is open.</p>

										<p><p>I agree with Hani Hamadeh, the toggle is the best approach.</p>
<p>What you see as a bug is a design feature, you can receive multiple events for every view even if you think your app should only receive one.  The reason it crashes is because you are not handling what should happen or managing exceptions to your needs.</p>
<p>You can explore the best way to reset the flag mentioned above, this will depend on how you designed this section of code.</p>
<p>BTW good job in aggressively testing, whilst it may sound odd to some, testing to force a fail is a sign of a good developer.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your time and suggestion!<br>I think I understand what is happening now. Will try a toggle to fix the problem</p>
