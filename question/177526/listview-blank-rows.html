			<p>SDK Ver. 3.3.0</p>
<p>Problem with ListView:<br>I have a ListView with complex views (images, titles atc.)<br>On the first time the ListView is shown its works perfect, even if I  reloading (multiple times) the data&#x2F;rows all works well.</p>
<p>But, when removing the view that contain the ListView, and returning back, the first, second or third row (in every set of 3 rows) is blank, when setting different data to the list, the disappear row change (but always it&#39;s the first, second or third on every 3 rows).<br>when waiting 15 seconds idle, and resetting the data&#x2F;rows all rows are shown.</p>
<p>the problem occurs on SDK 3.3.0 (iPhone)<br>SDK version 3.2.0 was okay.</p>

							<div><p>This is exactly what I am experiencing on my iOS app as well. When you see these blank rows, and you scroll down and up for a bit, the empty row is a different row than before. I tried to detect what it was with styling and such, but nothing appeared to be these blank rows from my own code. I could make a vimeo later on and post it here.</p>

							<div><h2 id="problem-">Problem:</h2>
<p>So here&#39;s what I am experiencing: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;105630553">iOS ListView showing empty rows - Ti SDK 3.3.0</a></p>
<p>When the listview is first opened everything is fine. Using the marker event to dynamically load more rows works fine.</p>
<p>The ListView itself is placed in a View, that is a page in a scrollable view. When scrolling back and forth in this scrollableview, these empty rows appear. Scrolling down adding extra items the problem persists. When using the refresh control the problem persists as well</p>
<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>I am not using any data collection. I programmatically add items to each row, because I use rows with columns (As you see in the video).</li>
<li>When switching a page in the scrollable view, and return to the original page, does not always cause this problem. It&#39;s a random thing.</li>
<li>When started filming the problem already existed.</li>
<li>Styling a list item, list section, my own custom views inside the row, with a background color did not work. It&#39;s not any of those views and thus is caused by something else</li>
<li>All rows that are supposed to be in the ListView are there, the ListView&#39;s contentHeight is just enlarged by these empty rows.</li>
<li>When scrolling up and down once these empty rows appear, changes the order of these empty rows sometimes. For example: Before scrolling down the empty row is the 3rd row, scrolling down and back up again, the empty row is the 2nd row. Very weird behaviour.</li>
<li>Providing test code is almost not doable in my case, due to the complicity. Maybe Israel Weisman could provide his example?</li>
</ul>
