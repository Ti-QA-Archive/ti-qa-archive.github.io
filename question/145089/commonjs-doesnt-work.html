			<h1>CommonJS doesn&#39;t work</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, there</p>
<p>I have some troubles using CommonJS in my app. It is totally okay with other projects in my Titanium Studio. I followed all the instructions and included commonJS module in the tiapp.xml according to the Appcelerator doc here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;CommonJS_Modules_in_Titanium  But still failed. The iOS Simulator keeps saying cannot find the variable: module at xxx.js </p>
<p>Does anyone know what&#39;s the reason for this? Thanks!<br>Best,<br>Phil</p>

<p>Missing from your question are a number of important pieces of information. I suggest you take a look at the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Using+Questions+and+Answers">Using Questions and Answers</a> article, specifically the Q&amp;A Question Checklist.  The missing information is critical to reproducing problems in a test environment and often indicates other factors that cause the undesirable outcome you are experiencing.</p>

							<div><p>When posting a question like this, you really must provide all necessary information about your dev environment, and a code sample. If you have questions about the info you need to provide, see the details on the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;ask">Ask A Question Page</a>. With the code sample, simply post the simplest code that is failing so that it is easy to copy&#x2F;paste into a new project for someone to test.</p>

							<div><p>Just a suggestion here, but why do you have to downvote a question that might actually be a useful one for many people, just because the person that asked it did not do it correctly?</p>
<p>I think votes should reflect if the question is totally irrelevant or if in some cases the question is like: &quot;please provide code to do this thing&quot;</p>
<p>I do not disagree with your stock answer Stephen, but I totally disagree with the downvoting.</p>
<p>Again, it is just my opinion.</p>

							<div><p>Most of the time the people that downvote are NOT the people that comment on the answer. I personally never downvote a question, and as you can see, there are 5 downvotes and only 2 comments. While none should disagree with your opinion, it is based on the assumption that Stephen started the downvote, or even downvoted at all. Maybe he did and maybe he didn&#39;t, but the assumption that he did and in doing so caused 4 other people to come along and do so as well seems to require knowing for sure.</p>
<p>In the end, the community controls the tone. The great thing about that is, if the tone is not acceptable, anyone can be a voice of change.</p>
