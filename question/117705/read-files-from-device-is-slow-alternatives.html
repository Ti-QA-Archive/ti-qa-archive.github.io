			<h1>Read files from device is slow, alternatives?</h1>

		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve built an application that gets an XML file using a XHR request. The XML is stored on the devices file system so a request isn&#39;t needed everytime the app needs to look at this data.</p>
<p>The problem is, even if the file is just a few kb, it takes about 1 second to load. It&#39;s just enough for the user to notice the delay..</p>
<p>Is there any faster way than to store the XML file and read it when needed. Is there some sort of memory or cache that  is faster and could be used for this?</p>
<p>Example code for reading:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">file</span>.exists()){
   <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> content = <span class="hljs-keyword">file</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">read</span>();
}
</code></pre><p>Thank you</p>

							<p>Did you ever find the cause or a solution to this? </p>
<p>I ran into similar problems a year ago where my app was trying to download large xml content from various web services I had set up. Everything ran smoothly in the emulator but when I deployed the app to my mobile devices (a 2nd gen iphone and Nexus) it took ages for both to process the streamed XML. </p>
<p>In the end I had no choice but to give up and ended up updating the webservice to return CSV. This made a world of difference performance wise but returning CSV from a WS is frankly a horrid great design.</p>

										<p><p>No I did not find a solution to this.<br>CSV is a good suggestion and I&#39;m glad you got it to work faster. It&#39;s sad though that you have to give up XML for this.</p>
<p>Since I did not ask for a way to improve performance for XML, but an alternative your answer is the best one :) Thank you</p>

<p>Have you tested this on a physical device? There may be a difference in performance for some actions.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>Paul,<br>It&#39;s actually very fast on the simulator, no delay there at all.<br>On iPhone 4 it&#39;s slow, I can only assume it could be even worse on a 3g&#x2F;3gs.</p>
