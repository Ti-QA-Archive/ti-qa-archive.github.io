			<h1>Appcelerator no longer free??</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>With the new Appcelerator 4.0 (post-Titanium), I was informed that I could get on the &quot;Indie Plan&quot; which is 1 seat for 1 developer, and it continues to be free for my personal use. 2 weeks ago I was able to Package&#x2F;Distribute my app to Apple for review, no problems. But NOW (June 13, 2015) when I attempt this, Appcelerator Studio refuses to package my app, and I am taken to the dashboard where it says I have to buy the product. Confusingly, it acknowledges that my Indie Plan is valid, and that&#39;s what I have. But it won&#39;t create a package for apple store.</p>
<p>After upgrading to the newest Appcelerator (4.0.1) just now, it pretends to go through the motions of creating a package, but then fails with the error &quot;Your current login session is not entitled to package mobile app. Please login to a different organization with entitlements or upgrade to a plan that supports production builds&quot;.</p>
<p>What is going on? I am terrified that Appcelerator is no longer be free for ANYONE, because their pricing for 1 developer is outrageous: $468 per year.</p>
<p>I have spent MONTHS working on my app, and now I suddenly can&#39;t deploy it. Is there any way I can package and submit to itunes store?</p>

							<div><p>It gets worse: I attempted to go down the road of buying the $39 per month plan, and it doesn&#39;t even work. There&#39;s some kind of infinite loop and no way I can find to actually make the purchase. What on earth is Appcelerator doing? Also, would it kill them to charge Indies something reasonable like $10 per month? What they&#39;re doing seems exploitive, such a steep amount for small independant developers.</p>

							<p>Looks like it was just a bug in Appcelerator Studio (or more likely a bug on the server behind the scenes that checks permissions, etc). I logged out of Studio and back in – problem solved! This really stressed me out. 1 ulcer and 5 gray hairs!!</p>
