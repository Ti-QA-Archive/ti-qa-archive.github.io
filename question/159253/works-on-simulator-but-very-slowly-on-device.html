			<h1>Works on simulator but very slowly on device</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m trying to make an code that have an touch effect… when I touch and hold an objectA another 3 objects appears objectB objectC objectE them when I move my finger to each object it animate an label and that object.</p>
<p>the problem is that on simulator it works perfect but when I run into my device( iPhone 4 ) it take so long to make the animations… maybe is something wrong with the animations or something that are slowing my code and make it freeze… someone can help me with that?</p>
<p>here&#39;s my code: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DHennrich&#x2F;TouchAndMove&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;menu.js">code</a></p>
<p>ps: don&#39;t need to use the <code>xpng</code> library right now… only need to fix this slowly animations on touch&#39;s moves</p>
<p>Thanks <code>3.1.3 ga</code> <code>iOS</code> <code>Android</code></p>

							<p>There are two things you must keep in mind during your tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>The simulator does not reflect the speed of an actual device (ever). It is safe to assume that something running on a powerful pc with a lot more memory than a phone will run a lot faster. So you will have to always test on an actual device to make sure that your code works.</li>
<li>Animations will always be slower on Android with Titanium. This seem to be a general fact, so keep that in mind.</li>
<li>Also, iPhone 4 is probably the lowest common denominator you could find on iOS right now. So it is logical to assume </li>
</ul>
<p>As for your code, I noticed that you are calling the <code>animate</code> function 23 times. This is quite a lot of animations, especially for <code>touchmove</code> events where they can be triggered hundreds of times just by barely moving your finger on the view.</p>
<p>A better approach for this would be to create a function that runs every 300 milliseconds (arbitrary value) and move move your items in this function.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">setInterval<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">moveMyStuffAround</span>, <span class="hljs-number">300</span>)</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>In this <code>moveMyStuffAround</code> function, you basically do all the operation you were already doing in the <code>touchmove</code> event, except that this time, it won&#39;t be triggered thousands of times. (just once every 300 milliseconds)<br>This will allow you to limit the number of occurrences your animations are run. </p>
<p>Than all you need to do is to use some sort of <em>&quot;flag&quot;</em> to check if your user is touching the view of not.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">vicky.addEventListener( <span class="hljs-string">'touchstart'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span></span>{
    ...
    isTouching = <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>;
}

vicky.addEventListener( <span class="hljs-string">'touchend'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span></span>{
    ...
    isTouching = <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>;
}
</code></pre><p>Finally, in your <code>moveMyStuffAround</code> funciton, you just run the code only the the <em>&quot;flag&quot;</em> is set to true.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">moveMyStuffAround</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (isTouching) {
        <span class="hljs-comment">// All your animations here</span>
    }
}
</code></pre><p>This should reduce the number of times your animations are called by hundreds to thousands of times and should give your device enough time to process them without saturating your memory.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

										<p><p>so I need to put this <code>moveMyStuffAround</code>  function them inside this function I call the <code>touchmove</code> event? </p>
<p>because I don&#39;t want to move all my objects when I move my finger… I only want to move an specific object that my finger are going to</p>
