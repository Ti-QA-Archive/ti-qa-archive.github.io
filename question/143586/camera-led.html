							<div><p>Missing from your question are a number of important pieces of information. I suggest you take a look at the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Using+Questions+and+Answers">Using Questions and Answers</a> article, specifically the Q&amp;A Question Checklist.  The missing information is critical to reproducing problems in a test environment and often indicates other factors that cause the undesirable outcome you are experiencing.</p>

							<div><p>And, had you actually &#39;already read it&#39; as you claimed, then you would have known you need to post things about your environment, and about your tools, and about your code.</p>
<p>Of the EIGHT things on the checklist you posted ZERO of them.</p>
<p>Additionally, you are in a hurry to build a flashlight app for a mobile device.  Now, there could be some reasons for this lighting emergency:</p>
<ol>
<li>Timmy has fallen down the well and needs help but you are out of D batteries for your flashlight.</li>
<li>There is a snake in Woodie&#39;s boot and you need to find it.</li>
<li>You are in an episode of Revolution on NBC and yours is the last computer system operating in a dark dark world.</li>
<li>You have a homework assignment, downloaded code from the internet, want a quick way to build it for your uni work and hoped we would do it for you.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#39;m leaning towards #4</p>
