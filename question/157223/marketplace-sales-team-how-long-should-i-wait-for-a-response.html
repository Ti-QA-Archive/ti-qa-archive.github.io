			<h1>Marketplace Sales Team: how long should I wait for a response?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>My company is really interested in purchasing the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;5881?1621448760">Encrypted Database Module</a> and the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;1882?1248701322">Crypto Module</a>, and would like to know more about them.</p>
<p>I did what I was asked to, I clicked on the Contact Sales button and filled the form. Didn&#39;t receive any news for days, until I emailed the Marketplace support and asked for info. They said that they had reached out to the sales team for me and that I should&#39;ve heard back from them soon. That was 8 days ago. Total waiting: 12 days. No emails, no phone calls.</p>
<p>How long should I wait before someone will reply to my enquire?</p>
<p>We use Titanium a lot, and we bought several modules int the past few years, and this is a little disappointing. I understand everything, but taking so much time for a simple response is too long for our standards.</p>

							<div><p>seriously, this is a joke.<br>After this post I received an email saying that I was in the Sales high priority queue.. and guess what? that was exactly 7 days ago. Total waiting so far: <strong>19</strong> days. Just to get some info on those freaking modules.</p>

							<p>So I waited a whole month to have someone from AppC tell me that those modules are just for the Enterprise developers (and you have to pay another additional fee for the Crypto module). ONE MONTH, to have this information. Honestly, this is awful customer service. </p>
<p>So, if you want to know what the Contact Sales button is there for,it&#39;s simple… it&#39;s for having them asking you if you want to upgrade your plan.</p>
