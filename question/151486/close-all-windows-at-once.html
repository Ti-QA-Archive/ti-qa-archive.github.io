			<h1>Close All Windows At Once</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>In iOS there is a default behaviour, when you navigate more than one level in a window that is assigned on a tab as its main window, and then click on the tab, it goes right to the main window of this tab (no matter how deep you have navigated.</p>
<p>I am trying to achieve this to android and although I can close all windows one by one, I do not want to do it because you can see the animation of each tab (even if you do not assign any animation on close) and it is pretty ugly.</p>
<p>Is there any default functionality in ANDROID that does this? If not, any thoughts on how to do this without this ugly animations ruining my application?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

							<p>I believe you said it best when you said: <code>In iOS there is a default behavior...</code> </p>
<p>Android does not have the same default behavior so it would be counter productive to go against the native platform itself.</p>
<p>That being said, if you really insist on going that route, you could always <strong>hide</strong> your windows before closing them. That would prevent the animations from being seen.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for this suggestion but even though I agree that  it usually is counter productive to go against the platform, in this issue, most great applications with tabs DO, simply because the platform has not put a great deal of though in this one.</p>

							<p>Actually I agree with Christian that it usually is counter productive to go against the platform, but most great applications with tabs DO, simply because the platform has not put a great deal of though in this one.</p>
<p>But, what I did and works fine is closing them starting from the 2nd to the last (leaving the first one that is the main window on the tab). No animation issues this way and no hiding which also does an ugly flicker. Only animation that you can see is the normal animation of the last window (the one you are viewing the time you want to close all of them [the last one on the line]) when it closes.</p>

										<p><p>thank you very much for your help though.. It would be the next thing I would try if what I did had not worked.. Just because you tried to help me, and because your answer is a correct way to do it even though not optimal, I will flag your answer as BEST.</p>
