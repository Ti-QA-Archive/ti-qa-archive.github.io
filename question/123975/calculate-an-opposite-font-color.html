			<h1>Calculate an opposite font color</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello</p>
<p>I am wondering, is there a way to calculate or get an opposite font color from a given color? Well, not really an opposite color, but when you have a dark background color you&#39;ll get a bright font color and visa versa.</p>

							<p>Not an opposite color, that would be complementary color (blue &amp; yellow). </p>
<p>Anyway, first you need to transform RGB color value to HSB color value (Google how to do that) and then increase brightness. That should work I think. :)</p>

										<p><p>Just increasing brightness won&#39;t work if you have any channel already towards 255 (i.e. white, pure red &#x2F; green or blue). <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.codeproject.com&#x2F;KB&#x2F;GDI-plus&#x2F;IdealTextColor.aspx">This</a> gives a somewhat reasonable approach, basically using a threshold figure out if your colour is light or dark and use black or white for text depending on the outcome. Anything else using pure calculation would probably give some pretty ugly results.  </p>
<p>Another approach if you want more than black or white text would be to create a table mapping background colours to their appropriate foreground colour then scanning it to find the closest to your background colour and selecting it&#39;s foreground colour. This would let you pick pretty good contrasting colours (hopefully by a decent graphic designer who has a clue about these things).</p>

										<p><p>Right. I didn&#39;t ever try to solve this kind of problem, maybe this edge cases can be solved algorithmically somehow (by involving desaturation maybe) - it&#39;s nice problem for someone who likes to solve difficult problems. :)</p>
<p>As for your solution, it seems nice solution to me, but in general I don&#39;t like to &quot;hard-code&quot; things (although if Tjeu has small number of colors, this can be achieved easily).</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ll do it with the calculation. The numbers of colors depend, so I still can choose. Thanks!</p>

										<p><p>Agree hard coding in the general case is a bad idea but this is an aesthetic problem and generally I have found that when it comes to try and remove the artists and use an algorithm instead you spend far far much more time creating a solution that works most of the time but fails in weird cases than it would have taken a skilled art dude to do the leg work. Coming up with a table of a 2 - 3 dozen background -&gt; foreground options would take no time and you&#39;d be much more guaranteed of an aesthetically pleasing result.</p>
