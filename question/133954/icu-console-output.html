			<h1>ICU Console Output</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This may be a stupid question but I have just come across something that worries me slightly.</p>
<p>I have an app that is being tested and distributed ad-hoc at the moment and I have been loading it on the phones using the iPhone Configuration Utility.</p>
<p>Someone reported an error so I used the ICU console output to see what was happening.</p>
<p>I noticed that as well as finding the exception that caused the error ALL the info and debug outputs in my code were also being printed in the console.</p>
<p>My question is:</p>
<p>Is there anyway of stopping this ? I would have thought that the info&#x2F;debug statements would have been removed when running the Deploy to Store build option, but it appears not. This seems to me to present a security risk as it may show data, passwords, keys etc. that need to be seen during testing and debugging, but should not be available on a Deployed app (ad-hoc, enterprise or otherwise).</p>
<p>Or am I just missing a config option in the Deploy scenario that I have missed? - I don&#39;t really want to search my code and remove all the info and debug statements just for a deploy-able build.</p>
<p>Any insight on this or a point in the right direction would be welcome, even if it is a RTFM :-)</p>

										<p><p>Ouch!…caveat emptor (or something like that)</p>
<p>To me this is a major security risk (potentially) for any app, at least if like me you were not aware of this behaviour. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not just me that puts all sorts of info and data in these statements to help with debugging and re-factoring.</p>
<ol>
<li>Can we have a future build of Titanium that will switch this bit off automatically?</li>
<li>Will have to refactor my code and process all info&#x2F;debug through a single function that I can turn off</li>
</ol>
<p>thanks.</p>

										<p><p>The debugging tools like this that output to your console are tied to things like NSLog on the native side… They are designed to not only help with debugging when building your app but to also output debug info on released apps… All apps native and not output some things to the log, but yes you do need to be careful what you output.</p>
<p>As for a future release not outputting to the console when released, that will never happen as m any debs rely on this to debug released apps too.</p>
<p>It has it&#39;s reasons to exist as it does, very good reasons in fact.</p>
<p>There will always be APIs that when used incorrectly can get you into trouble. (see for example the &quot;path&quot; app for ios and the way they used the contacts API on iOS)</p>
<p>Could it be more clearly documented, sure… :) maybe file a JIRA ticket for that?</p>

										<p><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I fully acknowledge that it is probably my ignorance, I just wanted to point it out as I am sure I&#39;m not the only ignorant one, this after all is partly what the Q&amp;A is for.</p>
<p>Not sure I would agree with terming it an incorrect usage of that particular API call, incorrect preparation for deployment perhaps.</p>
<p>Also understand that not outputting to the console is never going to happen, and again fully understand the reasons why not. </p>
<p>What I was suggesting is a compiler switch, perhaps in tiapp.xml that gave you the choice to specify the removal of the logging when doing a deploy build (even the ability to specify the level at which it was ignored). This is not unusual in other compilers, and certainly from my POV would be a useful addition. </p>
<p>Anyway must get back to my refactoring exercise,</p>

										<p><p>If I came off a tad harsh I am sorry… I guess my point was that thats not really the job of the SDK, no more then it is for native developers. I agree that its a highly useful ability but one more suited for a framework in the JS side of things</p>
