			<h1>XHR image upload - First try fails, second works, third fails</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>What&#39;s the deal here?  I&#39;ve basically cloned the Twitpic example.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first time my server never receives the request and the xhr times out.</li>
<li>Second time works like a <em>champ</em></li>
<li>Third time and on it sends incorrect data and my server barfs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The code:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;private&#x2F;es0n7db5fkggg4bflm7zmq</p>
<p>This code is in a new window - so whenever I .close and reopen it, it should be a completely new instance right?  This is why I don&#39;t understand this 1st, 2nd, 3rd thing.</p>
<p>I&#39;m about to lose my brain!</p>

							<p>Daniel - I <em>still</em> haven&#39;t figured it out!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve read that onload sometimes doesn&#39;t fire as well, but I&#39;ve found that declaring the onload before the open&#x2F;send seems to work just fine in my case.</p>
<p>I have at least 10 XHR calls in the app that work just fine, but it&#39;s just this one with the image.  It&#39;s holding up the launch of this app and driving me crazy.</p>
<p>Not to mention this is the most annoying thing to test having to sync with iTunes every time you make a guess.</p>

							<p>Hard to tell without seeing the server script being used to process the upload, as well as knowing what scripting language you&#39;re using on your end)  </p>
<p>I notice you&#39;re using a &#39;PUT&#39; method instead of a &#39;POST&#39; in your call.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve done a few uploaders (and am in the middle of doing a new one now, as it happens) - I use PHP and POST. </p>

							<p>Kosso - yeah it&#39;s definitely something to check out server side, but the code it&#39;s using is the same code that&#39;s used to upload on the main website.  I&#39;m a server-side guy coming to Ti, so for that to be wrong would be a huge oversight on my part.</p>
<p>Why I&#39;ve currently marked the server as a non-issue, is that my apache logs aren&#39;t even stating that a request was made to the server <em>at all</em>.  So Ruby doesn&#39;t even have a chance to look at it.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also changed it to POST, but all the REST verbs seem to work fine, I&#39;m doing PUT&#39;s all over the place to update data.</p>
<p>This is my first uploader though.  And if you&#39;re saying the code above is correct, then I guess I gotta start looking in other places.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

										<p><p>You could also try moving&#x2F;putting the upload function outside the camera&#39;s success event. Which would also be useful for you if you want to do the same for a photo picked from the gallery&#x2F;album too ;)</p>
