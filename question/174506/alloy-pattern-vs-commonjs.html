			<h1>Alloy Pattern V/S Common.js</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Every one can put there views on this Question that what architecture  is more better to use in application either alloy pattern or common.js ?</p>
<p>It may be the case in some of the application developer finds more suitable to use common.js pattern as compare to alloy and may be wise versa….</p>
<p>So it would be great if we find views from different developers what they think, so that we can reach to conclusion that which pattern to follow in depending on the type or functionality of application which we are going to made.</p>
<p>So it will be great if we find views from as much as developer to find the approach to use for creating the application.</p>
<p>Thanks !</p>

							<p>Hi Moiz</p>
<p>I tackled a very similar question a while ago;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;162302&#x2F;confused-on-using-commonjs-module-structure-with-titanium-alloy">Confused on using CommonJS module structure with Titanium Alloy</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Take a look at that while I come up with some other thoughts.</p>

									<li class="comment">
										<p><p>Firstly - yes great question.  One that must be on many developers minds that have not used Alloy.</p>
<p><strong>Alloy vs CommonJS</strong></p>
<p>This is easy, they are not equal in purpose.  Alloy apps can and should make extensive use of CommonJS.  Titanium has evolved since it first appeared.</p>
<ul>
<li>Any code anywhere</li>
<li>Multiple Contexts</li>
<li>Name spaces</li>
<li>CommonJS</li>
<li>Alloy + CommonJS</li>
</ul>
<p>CommonJS within Alloy is now used to provide &quot;business rules&quot;.  So the code is used to provide logic, functions, calculations.  It no longer provides creates or returns any UI.</p>
<p>There are two things, Alloy is about separation of logic, presentation and layout.  CommonJS provides the ability to create solid,  smart, memory efficient elements of an app.</p>
<p>CommonJS outside of Alloy is often used to create sections of an app, including logic, layout, navigation to other CommonJS functions and style.  Alloy is used to separate everything, not just sections of an app.  A app requiring 50 labels that look the same within a none Alloy using CommonJS (or even without CommonJS - to be fair) will have its presentation defined 50 times.  Alloy will have the layout defined once.  </p>
<p><strong>What is Alloy</strong></p>
<p>Alloy is the name given the MVC framework optionally used by Titanium in the creation of app.  I could spend ages telling you technically what it is - but that is unimportant to the average developer.</p>
<p>Alloy is a way to create apps that are much more manageable, re-suable, focused, lean and fast.</p>
<p><strong>What Alloy is NOT</strong></p>
<p>Alloy is not an alternative to Titanium, it is not a different language.  You are ALWAYS creating Titanium apps using Titanium code.  Whilst Alloy uses style-sheets - Alloy is NOT using HTML.</p>
<p><strong>What are the benefits of us the Titanium with the Alloy framework?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Separation; you no longer use styles within the creation of View, Labels, Buttons etc</li>
<li>Separation, your actual code to create the actual app is away from the structure&#x2F;layout and presentation&#x2F;styles</li>
<li>Separation; your layouts with; Views, Labels, Buttons, Windows and more now focus on the type of thing you need, the style and logic are elsewhere.</li>
<li>This separation might sound confusing, maybe a little annoying when you first hear about it - but it makes creating an app so much faster.</li>
<li>Re-usability, as everything is separate your code is focused on completing the task and if that could be re-utilised elsewhere.</li>
<li>Consistency; the average app might have 5 - 6 styles for labels, so why do we redefine them every single time one is added to the display - Alloy lets you say &quot;my titles look like this&quot;, you then add a Label as say &quot;you are a title&quot; later on you may change what a title looks like - all your &quot;titles&quot; change to suit.  Whilst this might not sound impressive if you come from a HTML background - this single improvement means that your apps look more professional without any effort</li>
<li>Speed of development; I have used Alloy to create both big and small apps, but each one has been MUCH MUCH faster to develop than not using Alloy.</li>
<li>Alloy has built in optimisations; your code gets optimised during the processing stage before the actual compile happens.  Trust me; JavaScript allows for things that most people do not know could occur - sometimes your app logic benefits from some of those extras.</li>
<li>Widgets; these are true separations of entire elements of your app.  You can even build your own re-usable ones that are used in more than one app.</li>
<li>Themes; if you need your app to look and act differently for specific compiles, you can use themes - then change one value in one file and your app now takes over the other persona during compilation.</li>
<li>Models and Collections - you will love these</li>
<li>Data abstraction</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You have to use it to see the difference</strong></p>
<p>I could sit here writing all day explaining the benefits of the Alloy framework - but you will never truly understand until you make your first test app - not a Hello World - something that tests the features you need to work with.</p>
<p><strong>A Modern App</strong></p>
<p> These days a good app has at least these things - and they are all separated;</p>
<ul>
<li>Layout<ul>
<li>Windows, Views, Buttons, Labels, Switches, TableViews…</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Styles<ul>
<li>Rules on how things look, app wide, controller wide or widget wide.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Controlling Code<ul>
<li>Dynamic elements, event handling, app navigation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Business Logic<ul>
<li>CommonJS modules</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Internationalisation<ul>
<li>Strings file - used EVEN if the app will have only one language </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here is another recent question on the subject</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;174022&#x2F;if-alloy-seems-to-be-a-panacea-why-people-can-continue-to-write-in-classic-mode">If Alloy seems to be a panacea, why people can continue to write in classic mode?</a></p>
<p>You have; Stephen Feather, Rick White, Aaron Saunders all agreeing - Alloy is the way to go.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest problem of trying to explain how much better using Titanium with the Alloy framework - is that you have to actually use it to really get the point.  I mean more than an hour or even a day or two - then you understand.  Everything you used to do outside of your actual real code that makes your app yours is faster easier, more manageable, faster on devices and re-usable.</p>
