			<h1>NOOB Wants To Know - Titanium for Web + Mobile + Tablet?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Guys,</p>
<p>I&#39;m a product manager, NOT a developer or architect, so I&#39;m a bit unclear about how to think about the value of Titanium as a tool for building a new cross platform mobile&#x2F;web product we have mind.  Our product plans include the following:</p>
<p>We want to provide highly configurable wizard driven survey forms on both Mobile (iPhone&#x2F;Android), Tablet (iPad&#x2F;Honeycomb) and browser that will be used by a subject matter expert doing facilitated observations.  These guided surveys will be configurable and will allow data capture to feed to a cloud database.  From this database we drive analytics out to both the browser, mobile and tablet with value added alerts, etc.</p>
<p>So in the scenario above, how should I position Titanium as a tool for helping my team build this product?  Mobile&#x2F;Tablet only + a Rails&#x2F;Java browser app feeding a cloud data store?  Or is it possible to deploy Titanium to an HTML5 browser like Chrome as well?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Brad</p>

							<p>I&#39;d usually suggest the HTML5 route, however our HTML5 mobile web sdk is currently in beta. Any paid subscription has access to this beta, though while in beta, we usually advise against using the sdk in production. When this is officially released however, you will be able to build and deploy for mobile&#x2F;tablet and mobile web with minimal code.</p>
<p>Personally, in projects like the one you describe, I will always recommend building the application around a webservice so that you can ultimately deploy to any medium.</p>
