			<h1>FlipBook component</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I&#39;m creating a FlipBook component for Titanium mobile for the iPad.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.dropbox.com&#x2F;u&#x2F;12145036&#x2F;flip.mov">See this in action</a></p>
<p>Is in its first version, and all who wish to use it, have questions or can help me, leave a message here.</p>
<p>You can take the component with an example:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">

							<div><p>This is a <strong>great</strong> component.  I&#39;ve been playing with it using the simulator and it works really well even with a 132 page catalogue!  However, running it on an actual iPad becomes problematic as when you hit next page it appears to flip the page twice.  Running with 5 pages doesn&#39;t have any problems.  I&#39;ve also extended it to have &#39;first page&#39; and &#39;last page&#39; buttons and am going to add a &#39;goto page&#39; but see in you todo list you&#39;re planning to include that.  I&#39;d love to contribute to this, either just testing or with coding too, where would you like any comments?  Here on the appcelerator forum or on github?  Thanks, Lee</p>

							<div><p>Thanks for your great component. To make the app more meaningful for emagazine purpose, just wonder if it&#39;s possible to allow user to zoom in the page with multi touch gesture? and, to keep the text quality, how about displaying each page with pdf format instead of jpg? thx</p>

							<div><p>I tried with a 60 pages document, it runs fine in the simulator, but it&#39;s very unstable on the real device.. like the drag and drop doesn&#39;t work, and it takes quite a while to change the pages if you press the next button. I was quite excited tho.</p>

							<p>Very nice. ;)</p>
<p>With a combination of toImage() and the imageAsCropped() code I added to my SDK, it would be cool to actually to do this on the fly to &#39;flip&#39; the native UI of an app too.</p>

							<p>Holy….damn dude this is a sick container!</p>
<p>I&#39;m looking at it now it&#39;s really clean.</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to add functions to it myself too, but will look at youre updates.<br>By the way some minor question, i&#39;m looking throught the code and have a test label which constantly shows me the available memory.</p>
<p>But how is memory handled? </p>

										<p><p>Yes that&#39;s what I did, memory seems to work nicely.</p>
<p>I&#39;m currently adding a way to add &quot;text&quot; (labels) to each page, so that every page can has its &quot;story&quot;<br>starting to get there.</p>
<p>I was gonna try and help you with the 3D flip but my knowledge stays at the math point, but how to actually output that to Titanium is a mystery to me.</p>
<p>All in all this is an awesome component and should definitly be supported, I&#39;ve been playing with it for a while now, mainly adding functions (story text, audio, extra functionalities I personally need for a project), after that I will share all these functions ofcourse..</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve extended the flipbook component to be able to use pdfs annotated with hyperlinks.  If you go to <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quru.com&#x2F;appcelerator">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quru.com&#x2F;appcelerator</a> you&#39;ll find some instructions on where to download the code from and how to use it.</p>

							<p>hi! </p>
<p>great component, works fine on iOs!!. But, has somebody tried to use on android? It only does not work, but the app crashes without any error message.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t figure out where is the problem, there&#39;s no iphone&#x2F;ipad exclusive APIs, so it should work on android without any major change, isn&#39;t it?</p>
<p>Tested on titanium 1.5.1 and 1.6.0, android emulator and android device (samsung galaxy tab) on mac platform.</p>
<p>thanks!<br>javier </p>

							<p>Hey Adriano!</p>
<p>Did you ever figure out why the flipbook doesn&#39;t load sometimes?<br>The strange thing is this problem occurs for me only on the simulator, it never did on the iPad 1..<br>But now with the iPad 2 it also sometimes hangs on trying to load the flipbook.</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to figure out why it happens too, but maybe you already know</p>
<p>thanks in advance!</p>

							<p>Hello, I simple question. Has anyone tested the app in the Iphone? I&#39;ve try it and it doesn&#39;t work correctly. Works fine in the simulator but when I load the app in the Iphone it just doesnt work. It loads very, very slow and it doesn&#39;t turn pages. Is it the code only for Ipad?</p>

										<p><p>I got it working fine on an iPhone.  However, you&#39;d need to make it support zooming for it to be practical.  Try resizing your images to fit the iPhone screen exactly and turn off pagination and you should fine it is much faster.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for you answer, Lee. I&#39;ve been working with you code from github (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;leebourne&#x2F;FlipBook-Titanium). I&#39;ve resized all the images to 320x480. The shadow pages too. I&#39;ve changed the flipbook.js and resized the pgShadow and pgBright image views to 480, also. But it doesn&#39;t work on my Iphone 3G. I&#39;ve compiled the code with Titanium SDK 1.6 and 1.7 RC1. My Iphone has iOS 3.1.3. Would you be so kind to share you Iphone code? Thank you.</p>

							<p>Got a question, I&#39;ve been working on a story function (like I said earlier) but somehow It never changes the text on the first flip, but starts changing it on the 2nd flip.</p>
<p>I think i&#39;m getting a little confused with the use of flipbook_actualPage</p>
<p>EDIT: The bug you have with loading pages does not occur on the device itself atleast I tried replicating it numerous times but it loads fine</p>
<p>EDIT 2:</p>
<p>I&#39;ve added some stuff but have no idea how Github works so that sucks.</p>
<p>My &#39;add story&#39; functions fails atm, because the string errors out which I don&#39;t know why<br>But I added the option to show and hide a info button in the top right corner.<br>and the function to play a sound and&#x2F;or voiceOver</p>
<p>it creates a player, and if a page is flipped it first stops and release the current player before creating it again, it also release the player when the sound is complete.</p>
<p>the backgroundsound has a setLooping: true&#x2F;false option too.</p>

							<p>Really nice!   </p>
<p>What would you do if, instead of the images, I wanted to use webview.js pages?  AND, when loaded,  I wanted those to Scroll up and down?    SO, like the wired or esquire apps on iTunes App store, you can scroll BETWEEN stories and then to read a story you scroll up and down.   Thanks</p>

							<p>Thanks for this, it&#39;s a great bit of code.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve extended it by writing a script to take a multi-page pdf and split it into separate pages, convert them to jpegs and parse every page for url or email links.  I&#39;ve also modified the code to add hotspots onto the pages so you can navigate to the urls by launching Safari or send an email by clicking on the links in the pages.  I&#39;ve also added first and last page buttons.</p>
<p>Has anyone worked on the ability to zoom or landscape mode?</p>
