			<p>Hi All. I am now ready to distribute to appstore and I have obtained all the necessary certificates and installed them on my computer. But when I hit the distribute button it compiles and at the and comes up with this message: Code Sign error: </p>

							<p>Whatever i am righting here is based on xcode 3.2.3</p>
<p>1) in xcode&#39;s left panel (Header is groups &amp; File), click on your project name. New Window will be open named -    project &quot;your project name&quot; info. In this window you will find General and Build both tab</p>
<ul>
<li>in general tab at the last select iPhone simulator version from drop down which has a label Base SDK for all labels. It will make you project runnable in simulator.</li>
</ul>
<p>and for packaging</p>
<p>2) in build tab you can file option to select code signing identity. Default selection will be iPhone Developer. Select your own certificate which you obtain from apple. After this you can package your app from xcode. </p>
<p>by the way. why you are doing this all ? titanium providing option to build your project for titanium it self.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks! I did try to build from Titanium but it gives me the first error mentioned, above and does not show the project in xCode organizer to distribute to appstore via iTunes… That&#39;s my headache I somehow do not get further with my distribution…. If you have any suggestions to solve this it will be most welcome!</p>

How do I get around this problem? Now I can run the project from xCode (it does distribute it to xCode, just not the archived applications folder) with your guidelines. How can I then take it further from here?</p>

										<p><p>Hi. Yeah, it worked in making the app build and run in the simulator from xCode, but I can still not package it… It will not show up in the archived applications as it should for upload to iTunes connect… How do I do that from xCode?</p>

										<p><p>Have you generated right certificate and provisioning profile ? and have you added both to your key chain and xcode ? If yes than click certificate in your organizer check whether it is showing ant error or not ? I think you have not added provisioning profile. have u ?</p>

										<p><p>Yeah I do have all the right certificates and also they are listed fine in the xCode as well. When I tried to package from Titanium earlier it did prompt me with an approval of some codesign thing. Now it doesn&#39;t and I think that that is what is needed from the xCode now… If this makes sense to any of you?</p>

							<p>There are few things that you have to do to make your titanium project working in xcode.</p>
<p>1) Select the appropriate SDK version from your project property. (This change will make your project runnable in simulator)</p>
<p>2) in project property&#39;s build section select your code signing certificate. By default iPhone Developer will be selected (After that this will allow you to package your app)</p>
