			<h1>Module Is Not Found...But why not???</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am developing a module for android and am receiving the error that the module is not found.  The application type is mobile. Titanium info is Titanium Studio, build: 2.1.2.201208301612<br>(c) Copyright 2012 by Appcelerator, Inc.  All rights reserved.</p>
<p>Build: jenkins-titanium-rcp-master-232 (origin&#x2F;master)<br>Date: 30 August 2012, 16:14:46<br>.  Platform and version Andriod 2.1.1. Host Operating system Windows 7 64-bit. I don&#39;t have a test case to provide you with and was looking for some guidance in generally on what the possible error&#x2F;problem was since I did the same thing I did for the calc tutorial.  Maybe its a bad assumption but should it matter whats in the module if it can&#39;t even be found? I wouldn&#39;t think so but hey wouldn&#39;t be the first time I was wrong. Here is the error:<br>[ERROR][TiJSError(  296)] (main) [336,6627] —– Titanium Javascript Runtime Error —–<br>[ERROR][TiJSError(  296)] (main) [1,6628] - In ti:&#x2F;module.js:372,8<br>[ERROR][TiJSError(  296)] (main) [0,6628] - Message: Uncaught Error: Requested module not found: org.jbr.ASpeaker<br>[ERROR][TiJSError(  296)] (main) [0,6628] - Source:     throw new Error(&quot;Requested module not found: &quot; + request);<br>[ERROR][V8Exception(  296)] Exception occurred at ti:&#x2F;module.js:372: Uncaught Error: Requested module not found: org.jbr.ASpeaker<br>Thanks,</p>

							<p>Hi James, <strong>can you mention the steps taken for that</strong>. generally this type of problem comes when you forget to add module reference in tiapp.xml or made some unnecessary changes in module class.</p>

										<p><p>I used titanium create from the command line to create the module.  Then I imported it into Eclipse and added a Java class (to where I have some android code that isn&#39;t available in titanium) and removed the Property setters and getters from the Module created at the command line fromt the module.  I added a method that uses the Java class that I added and saved everything.  Then I went back to the command line and built using Ant.  I created a new mobile project  and imported the zip file which went into the Modules folder after I added the module node to the tiapp.xml.  I also added the var speaker = require(&quot;org.jbr.aspeaker&quot;) to the js file.  Shoudl I not have removed the getter and setter generated code?</p>

							<p>Hi James, sorry for long time waiting, i was busy somewhere. No its not like you should not delete getter and setter by default, but might be the case you deleted the required property from module.<br><strong>if you copy paste what did you delete, the i can explain in more details.</strong></p>
