			<h1>Building App for multiple iOS versions</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>We&#39;re doing some internal testing using TestFlight. I went to distribute the first build, and TestFlight would only allow me to distribute it to 3 of the 9 people because their iOS versions didn&#39;t match the SDK it was built against (5.1). In one case, not even 5.1.1 worked.</p>
<p>I went to Project -&gt; Run&#x2F;Debug Settings, but only the 5.1 SDK was present. How can I make this so that it can be more widely distributed? Do I need to do something through xCode?</p>

							<div><p>This is odd. Targeting 5.1 means, the app should be installable on 5.1 as well as 5.1.1</p>
<p>Can you confirm if the people, trying to install the app, are in the ad-hoc users list.</p>
