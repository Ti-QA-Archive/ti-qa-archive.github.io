			<h1>In Studio: option to run on iOS device does not appear on &#34;run&#34; button/menu</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve a project that&#39;s been successfully built&#x2F;deployed via Appcelerator Developer. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve now created a new project in Studio and migrated the code over, and can run it in the Simulator, by clicking the &quot;run&quot; button (green &quot;play&quot; button) and selecting a simulator configuration from the menu that drops down from it.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, I see no options there to run on an actual device (even though one is plugged in). This appears to be the case for any&#x2F;all projects I create in Studio.</p>
<p>Any help…?</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance.</p>

							<p>I am seeing quite a few people posting this issue on the forum.</p>
<p>I came across this when I first installed studio and on a couple of projects. have you tried creating a new project and running with the defaults. This should run ok.</p>
<p>Now a thought as I Type. In studio there are two ways to view the contents of a project. One is where you see all projects the other is project specific. I remember that I hit the problem and went into the individual view and the options appeared.</p>
<p>also try opening the tiapp.js file unselecting all the platform options save it, then select the platform options again.</p>
<p>hopefully one of these will solve the issue.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, Trevor. Your &quot;a thought as I type&quot; idea was right on. </p>
<p>I switched to the &quot;individual&quot; view and the option to run on IOS Device appeared. I clicked it, and ran into another problem (build unaccountably failed with no error message).</p>
<p>THEN I tried to click on it again, only to find that the IOS option had disappeared…!</p>
<p>I clicked in&#x2F;around the project view, trying to get it to appear again, which it did. </p>
<p>If I figure out what I&#39;m doing wrong, or how to reproduce it, I&#39;ll add it to this question.</p>
<p>But for now, I can move on to figure out the next problem…</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

										<p><p>Just to follow up on this… I still see errant behavior where the ability to run on the IOS device is missing from the &quot;run&quot; button… and have not been able to figure out why&#x2F;when.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, I have found that if you right-click while in the App Explorer view for your project, the &quot;Install to IOS Device&quot; option is always there…</p>

							<p>I too had this issue, I found that if I right click on my project from the Project explorer tab. There is a properties option, when I clicked on that select the Project Natures option.  I found that somehow the Titanium Mobile Nature was unchecked.  Once I checked that option I was able to see the run on device options again.</p>
