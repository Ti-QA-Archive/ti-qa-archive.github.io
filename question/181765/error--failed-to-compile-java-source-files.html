			<h1>[ERROR] :  Failed to compile Java source files:</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>While building, I am getting this generic error message on the console, as usual with no further details.</p>
<p>[ERROR] :  Failed to compile Java source files:</p>
<p>Searching around for this error, I find posts from various points over the past 5 years that seem to indicate that I need to install java 1.6 instead of 1.7 32 bit.  However, this is a fresh install of Titanium, and Java 1.7 32bit is what Titanium installed itself during the install process.  Is this really still a problem, or do I need to look elsewhere for the issue?  Is there a log or someplace I can get more information to pursue?</p>
<p>Titanium Studio, build: 3.4.1.201410281727<br>Titanium SDK 3.4.1.GA<br>Windows 7<br>Java 1.7.0_40</p>

							<div><p>Did you have success a build before? If that was the case you probably add newest code that create this error (Titanium is not really explicit for some error and when you had some wrong code you could have that kind of error). Could you post your code? Or maybe just try to create a new titanium project and try to launch it for see if that can came from your code or not.</p>

							<p>The problem was that there was a random .ds_store file in one of the module directories, caused by somebody else working on the project with a Mac.  Although this doesn&#39;t cause problems with Titanium on Mac, it does cause Titanium on Windows to fail to build.</p>
