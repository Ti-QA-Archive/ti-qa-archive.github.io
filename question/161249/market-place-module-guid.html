			<h1>Market Place module GUID</h1>

		<section>
			<p>I have a question regarding  downloading updated modules in the market place and the verification process TiVerify in an App.</p>
<p>This follows on from this thread where I posted a comment <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;160130&#x2F;unlicensed-modules-detected">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;160130&#x2F;unlicensed-modules-detected</a></p>
<p>I downloaded and used a module (Scandit Bar code reader)  a while ago at a certain version (I think around 1.2). Now if I want to use the updated module I go to the Marketplace for My Products and download again (this give the latest version).</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it gives an Unlicensed Module error in a compiled App.  This effectively means you cannot use any updates that are published by the module developer (not a good situation) and also means that if you did not keep the original version of the module you downloaded, basically your stuck (unless you create a new Ti account and start again).</p>
<p>So I have found a way around this and thought I would share (btw. I am sure this is not really what should be done but it did work).  </p>
<p>As it seems from the above thread the licensing checks the GUID of your App against the GUID of the module you <strong>originally</strong> obtained from the marketplace (note originally),you need to make sure you have that original GUID from the modules <strong>manifest file</strong> (if you no longer have the version of the module your originally obtained then you may have a problem).</p>
<p>Use the original GUID and update the manifest file for the updated download and replace it with your original. Compile the app and it should now work OK.</p>
<p>My question is , can this be fixed so that when you get an updated module either:</p>
<ol>
<li>It keeps the same module GUID that was originally assigned</li>
<li>The new module GUID is added (not replacing) the list of valid GUID&#39;s for that App&#x2F;GUID  lookup</li>
</ol>
<p>It can&#39;t replace it as this would mean that any existing apps using the original download would then fail.</p>

							<p>Marketplace modules are tracked based on your user id (that you log into Studio&#x2F;DevCenter with) and the module&#39;s GUID. If either changes, you&#39;ll get the unlicensed-module error. I don&#39;t know if or why Scandit would have changed their module&#39;s GUID, but perhaps that&#39;s the case.</p>
<p>(Note: the GUID of your app is generated based on your user id. So, the thread you reference saying a comparison is made between your app&#39;s GUID and the module&#39;s GUID is not wrong, just incomplete.)</p>
<p>Rather than some hackish workaround, I suggest you contact the Marketplace support team (link in Marketplace). Unless there are licensing restrictions placed by the publisher, I imagine that our support team would fix the problem by issuing you a license for the updated module version.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Tim,</p>
<p>I will contact Marketplace Support and see what they say.</p>
<p>The module ID has defiantly changed as I have copies of the original module manifest and the up to date one I have just downloaded.</p>
