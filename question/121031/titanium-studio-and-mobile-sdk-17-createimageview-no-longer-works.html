			<h1>Titanium Studio and Mobile SDK 1.7 createImageView no longer works?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello, I just downloaded the new Titanium Studio IDE and began porting my 1.6 mobile app over to 1.7</p>
<p>Everything seems to work (Other than Blackberry SDK downloads) but my createImageView() call doesn&#39;t display an image.</p>
<p>It&#39;s storing SOMETHING in memory, because I can get the properties that I set on the javascript object (img.image , img.top etc…) but the image doesn&#39;t show up.</p>
<p>It used to with 1.6.2</p>
<p>Heres the code:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> logo = Ti.UI.createImageView({
    image:    <span class="hljs-string">'images/bcbswny_logo_homescreen.gif'</span>,
    top:    getHeightPercent(<span class="hljs-number">5</span>),
    left:    getWidthPercent(<span class="hljs-number">10</span>)
});
</code></pre><p>and I do add it to my window, all my other widgets work, even the ones that use the backgroundImage property.</p>
<p>Testing it on Android 2.2</p>

							<p>Similar problem with ImageView.  I&#39;ve coded an ImageView with an array of PNG files to provide a custom activity indicator&#x2F;spinner&#x2F;hourglass.  It stopped working when I went to Studio, Windows 7 + Android SDK Emulator + Titanium Mobile SDK 1.7.0.  However, my app targets both iOS and Android.  When I build and execute the same thing on my Mac, it works fine.  Let me say that again – it works fine on BOTH the Android emulator and the iOS emulator on my Mac.  I believe the problem lies somewhere in the Android FastDev build implementation on Windows.  Something isn&#39;t right on Windows and it&#39;s probably some kind of pathing, space in the path or other issue.  I&#39;ve removed and reinstalled Titanium, the SDK, the JDK, Android SDK and reinstalled in different places.  Nothing seems to work.  No images in an ImageView.  The same images display fine as a background to a Button.</p>
<p>Bottom line:  I don&#39;t believe this is a problem with your image or your code. I believe this is an issue with Titanium on Windows.  If you have access to a Mac, move your project there and try it.  If it works, that will confirm the issue and the Appecelerator folks need to investigate.  (I know Appcelerator folks prefer Macs but I recommend that you ask your Android team to use Windows so it&#39;s a priority for them.)</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to disable fastdev?  I&#39;ve looked at all the dials and guages in Studio but I cannot find a way to disable it.  I&#39;ve also tried to Install the app on a device and it seems to want a real device.  Does anyone know how to do a build without FastDev?  Then I can manually install and see if my suspicions are correct.  I guess I could borrow a friend&#39;s Android phone, install it there and then move it to the emulator.  Unless there&#39;s a way to test this, I guess my next stop is digging into the labyrinth of Python crap to figuring out a way to get rid of fastdev to see if it&#39;s truly causing the problems.</p>
<p>One last thing, I tried the apk built for my Mac&#39;s Android emulator.  It worked find in the PC emulator.  This further implies a build problem with Studio on Windows.</p>

							<p>Hi everyone!!!…After three days of trying different codes…ImageViews don&#39;t work as they should in 1.7.0. For now on I continue my develop using the ImageView as a backgroundImage instead using the property image. That&#39;s the problem when you don´t have a MAC…haha..</p>
<p>I hope they fix it as soon as they can or the develop is going to be horrible!!!</p>

							<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I am working on Linux with Titanium Mobile 1.7.1, fastdev enabled (developping for Android only).</p>
<p>For me images work perfectly without fastdev, but not when fastdev is enabled.</p>
<p>The application starts and just hangs on the splash screen until Android&#39;s &quot;Application not responding&quot; error appears. I tested with a new blank project and it seems to make no difference if I use <strong>createImageView</strong> or <strong>createView</strong> with <em>backgroundImage</em>. </p>
<p>Both seem to have the same problems. Filename also seems to make no difference, but maybe the <strong>IMAGE SIZE</strong>!!</p>
<p>I was testing with png files (which did not work) and started to resize them (on commandline with ImageMagick&#39;s commandline tool &#39;<em>convert</em>&#39;). I made them smaller and smaller until it suddenly worked.</p>
<p>It did not work with a 270x202 pixel (95929 byzes) file.<br>But when I resized the very same file to 200x150 Pixel (50030 bytes) IT DID WORK.</p>
<p>Same picture, same filename, just different size.</p>
<p>–&gt; <strong>CONCLUSION</strong>:<br>So maybe it&#39;s a (file-)size related problem?</p>

							<p>I have been on this for a couple days and finally found the answer that works for me…I hope it works for you.</p>
<p>set opacity to &quot;1&quot;</p>
<p>for some reason, default is &quot;0&quot; (off)</p>
<p>In my experience, I also used the backgroundImage as well as setting height and width for the image…but &quot;opacity:1&quot; was the kicker for me.</p>

							<p>Thanks Jandro, After banging my head for a few hours i got this working using the backgroundImage property rather than image on windows 7 for Android:<br>Importantly the height and width needs to be specified</p>
<p>var logo = Titanium.UI.createImageView({<br>    backgroundImage:&#39;&#x2F;images&#x2F;client.png&#39;,<br>    height:62,<br>    width:386,<br>    top:0,<br>})</p>

							<p>Try adding a slash to the start of the image url. (I seem to remember there being something with Android that caused me problems without it. If that doesn&#39;t work, try using app:&#x2F;&#x2F;images&#x2F;bcbswny_logo_homescreen.gif  </p>

										<p><p>None of the three worked. If I use the same path to the image as a backgroundImage for a different view it displays correctly so I imaging the path is correct.</p>
<p>It looks like it&#39;s setting the width and height to zero, but if I give them valid numbers I still don&#39;t see anything… top and left are within view too.</p>

										<p><p>Tried adding the dot too, nothing. I managed a workaround by using just a view and setting the background image to the path (which worked) but I have to hard code the image size in for height and width (or else it stretches) I&#39;d still like to know why it didn&#39;t work for imageView though.</p>

							<p>Hi,<br>I just did some very simple tests on Android 2.2 using Ti SDK 1.7 and all image urls worked - eith in the Resources folder, or in an images folder.</p>
<p>Test with a JPG, PNG and even an animated GIF (though the animation did not work, as expected).</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">
<span class="hljs-comment">// very basic app.js</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// test.png in an images folder in Resources</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">win</span> = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
    backgroundColor: <span class="hljs-string">"#FFFFFF"</span>
});

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">test</span> = Ti.UI.createImageView({
    image:'images/<span class="hljs-keyword">test</span>.png',
    width:200,
    height:200,
    top:100

});

<span class="hljs-keyword">win</span>.add(<span class="hljs-keyword">test</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">win</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">open</span>();
</code></pre><p>Could you try using another image? I wonder if your GIF is corrupt in some way?</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ve already tried other urls, the gif isn&#39;t corrupt because it works in every other view, just not image views. No filetype seems to be working in the image view.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been having a rough time with this IDE, randomly crashing or getting bogged down, maybe I&#39;ll uninstall &#x2F; reinstall. Perhaps something bad happened during my install.</p>

							<p>Hello everyone,<br>I got into testing this after reading Robert&#39;s post. I confirm that the 1.7 SDK has some glitches only under Windows. I use Win7 and I can&#39;t see any images compiling with 1.7 (with or without fastdev) but if I switch to OSX, everything works nicely.</p>
<p>I guess I have to work on the Mac for a while.<br>So my next question is: &quot;How do I turn on the fastdev on OSX?&quot;</p>
