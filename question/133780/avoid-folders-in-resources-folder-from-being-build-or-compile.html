			<h1>Avoid folders in Resources folder from being build or compile.</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hi,<br>I have some folders with some .JS files in the Resources folder.<br>The problem I ran into is that I need to exclude some of the folder while building for iphone but those folder are needed in my android build.</p>
<p>I looked into the python files in the SDK folder and found out that there are separate file i.e. <code>builder.py</code> for iphone and android. </p>
<p>As for now, while building for android or ios all of my JS files gets build, which i dont want as it increases my app size.</p>
<p>Can anyone help me in configuring that <code>builder.py</code> so that we can exclude some folders from getting build.</p>

							<p>Anything you put into your Resources&#x2F;iphone folder should only be built for iOS. Anything in the Resources&#x2F;android folder should only be built for Android. </p>
<p>You can use these folders to separate your resources (images, files etc), so there is no reason why you can&#39;t simply put all your iPhone resources in the iPhone folder and Android ones in the Android folder to achieve what you&#39;re trying to do.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Boydlee for your response. I also know the same you said above but it is like i dont want to segregate my JS files. you can call it as a addon which provides some functionality.</p>
<p>As for now i have successfully edited the builder.py file so that it copies the selected folder into my iphone resources folder. It runs fine on simulator but when i tried running on the device i got error saying .js file missing. </p>
<p>I know that my copied .Js files were nor archived,<br>can you help me with that</p>
