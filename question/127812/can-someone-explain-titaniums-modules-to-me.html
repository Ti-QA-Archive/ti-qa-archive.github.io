			<p>Hello, I am new to titanium.  I have developed programs using oop in flash before using AS3, so I do have a little bit of expereince.  I have used js before.</p>
<p>What I am a little confused about is all these modules.  Can you tell me what a module is?  I&#39;m trying to understand it fully before diving in.</p>
<p>Thanks.  Oh and try not to be too technical if you can!</p>

							<p>A module is basically an extension of the Titanium platform. Most of the APIs that are available by default are actually just modules that extend our core platform. We allow you to use that exact same architecture to extend the platform using your own code. This is almost similar to module classes in AS3.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Extending+Titanium">Module Development Guides</a> for each platform for more information.</p>

							<p>I have used AS3, but didn&#39;t ever really understand the classes, I just imported them.  </p>
<p>What is the core platfom is that a module as well?   Plus, there is a platform module isn&#39;t there?  I&#39;m not really understanding what these modules are, what they are for, and what they are in relation to each other.</p>
<p>I clicked your link, and had a little look and something else that confuses me (sorry) is that there is two different modules - ios and android, I thought the point of titanium is you developed it in js and then at runtime, it compiled 2 versions, one for android and one for iOS.</p>
<p>Thanks for explaining this stuff to me.</p>

										<p><p>Modules are primarily written in the native language for each platform. While we do allow for pure js modules to be created, for the most part, modules for iOS are written in Obj-C and modules for Android are written in Java. </p>
<p>If you don&#39;t understand modules classes in your primary language, then its going to be hard to understand modules in another language. Modules simply extend the platform to include functionality that is not already included in the core platform, much like a &#39;plugin&#39; in other languages. For example, we have modules that allow you to add advertising to your apps, or the box2d physics engine to your apps. These things would not be available in Titanium by default, so we allow them to be added as modules. These modules can both be added to an app, but they dont relate to eachother in any way. You can add as many modules as you&#39;d like.</p>
<p>Creating modules is a different story. In the end, module creation is something Titanium offers to advanced developers. For the most part, you need to be someone proficient in a native platform language to create them, and&#x2F;or quite proficient in js to create a native javascript module.</p>
<p>You don&#39;t need to understand modules to use the Titanium platform.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, and sorry for not using the comment functionality.  </p>
<p>Ok, I think I get it.  So the link you added above if for if you want to create your own android or iOS module to add functionality?  </p>
<p>So the modules exist independently of each other, kind of like OOP principles.  Do they not communicate with each other?  So if I want to access the user interface functions, they are wrapped in a module, everything is organised into it&#39;s own bundle of area functionality.  Is that right?</p>

										<p><p>Yes, the link I sent are for module creation.  All modules exist completely independently yes. Modules could possibly communicate with eachother, but that would have to be built in by the developer(s), it doesn&#39;t happen by default. But yes, you&#39;ve got the right idea with your last statement.</p>

							<p>Uh - a module in Ti is what Anthony Decena said, but it can also be a javascript file that is included using the &#39;require&#39; keyword - they are very different from what Anthony is talking about. I&#39;d link to documentation, but I can&#39;t find any …</p>
