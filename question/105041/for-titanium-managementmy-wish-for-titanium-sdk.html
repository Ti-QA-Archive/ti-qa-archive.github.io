			<p>Hi</p>
<p>It&#39;s needless to say that appcelerator has made life easier for web developer to use existing skills for iPhone development.</p>
<p>Recently I came across Corona SDK which makes Game programming, specially physics based programming easy by writing simple line of codes. The main catch for Corona SDK is that it targets game programmers. The main flaws from Corona is that it asks money for uploading app in Appstore and its based on LUA.</p>
<p>Why Titanium is not focusing on Box2d? Knowing the reality that most successful apps on Appstore are games, would it not be good that Box2d is added in Titanium SDK?</p>
<p>-My other wish is some WYSIWYG editor which can generate code for Titanium SDK</p>
<p>Any one going to second me?</p>

							<p>As a Corona developer and a Titanium developer i would like to add my 2 cents:</p>
<p>Corona is great for game development and weak for app development (try to create a simple table view and feel the pain)</p>
<p>Titanium is great for app development and weak (or non-existant) for game development (just try some of those html+css+js games online: they suck)</p>
<p>If you wish to develop games and want or need to avoid objective-c, Corona is a great way to do it.<br>If you wish to develop apps and want or need to avoid objective-c, Titanium is a great place to go.</p>
<p>Each framework is awesome in it own ways. If they try to do everyting they will hava a sub-par solution.</p>
<p>cheers</p>

										<p><p>I agree with you. But the issue with Corona is that unlike Titanium they ask to pay them for publishing app on AppStore which I disagree.</p>
