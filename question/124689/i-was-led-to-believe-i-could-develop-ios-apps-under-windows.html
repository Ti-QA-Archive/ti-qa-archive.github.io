			<p>When I launch Titanium Developer why does it say; iPhone SDK not found? Obviously I can&#39;t get the iPhone SDK under Windows, so it makes sense, but how to I go about signing the apps and building them under windows to test on an iDevice?</p>

							<p>Well, honestly, I thought the same way.<br>What led me to think so, hmm, I read almost entire documentation and do not remember anything stating this, either I&#39;ve missed or did not read the full documentation.<br>And, all the examples and screencasts display both iOS and Android as an environment option. Surely I&#39;ve noticed that all the development were made on Macintosh, but I didn&#39;t guess that this is an issue. Because I can count at least 5 sentences say that &quot;no need to rewrite the app for different platforms&quot; in your website.</p>
<p>Feeling like i hit a wall after 3 days of learning.</p>

										<p><p>Me too.  I naively thought that perhaps an agreement with Mac must have been made to provide some type of system emulation with a appropriate SDK. Maybe Appcelerator might consider a BIG warning sign at the home page  &quot;Requirements: One operating Windows PC. One operating MAC PC. etc&quot;</p>

							<p>I find two of your sentences paradoxical:</p>
<ul>
<li>why does it say; iPhone SDK not found? </li>
<li>Obviously I can&#39;t get the iPhone SDK under Windows</li>
</ul>
<p>Doesn&#39;t the second answer the first?</p>
<p>I am not sure what led you to believe Titanium could build an iOS application under Windows.  Since Titanium works by creating a source project in the target platform&#39;s native language and automagically passing it through the native compiler, it follows an iOS target cannot be built when the native SDK is not available.</p>
<p>As such, it seems to me there are only two possible alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run an OSX virtual machine under Windows (and while technically possible, is against Apple&#39;s OSX license terms and conditions, so is not legal even if you purchase a license to OSX)</li>
<li>Cloud compile the project, i.e. ship the Ti project source off to a server which does run OSX, have it perform the build and code signing, then return the distributable</li>
</ul>
<p>The first option is illegal, so obviously not something Appcelerator can endorse.</p>
<p>The second option leaves you without a simulator, and with horrendous debug&#x2F;test cycle times.</p>
<p>I think the only reasonable way to develop iOS apps is with an &quot;Apple branded&quot; computer, to use the terminology of the OSX license terms.</p>
<p>IMHO.  YMMV.</p>

							<p>I just downloaded Titanium for Windows.  It was readily apparent AFTER download and a dialog requested which sdk&#39;s I wanted to build for; iOS&#x2F;iPhone was not an option, that was a big hint (unfortunately).  At least I&#39;m not the only one who didn&#39;t realize at first.  Suppose I have to buy, beg, or borrow an Apple machine ;-)</p>

							<p>You can create ios apps with Basic4Iphone or B4i, check it out, of course you will still need a mac computer to upload your final app to the apple store but i do it by running mac os in a virtual box.<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.b4x.com&#x2F;b4i.html</p>
