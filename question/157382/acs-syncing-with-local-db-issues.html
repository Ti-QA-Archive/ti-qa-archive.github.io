			<h1>ACS syncing with local db issues</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey Everyone,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been looking at integrating some syncing between the local db on the phone and ACS, I have come across a few examples that show this (or atleast I think they are supposed to) but I can&#39;t seem to get them to work properly.  </p>
<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aaronksaunders&#x2F;ci.alloy.acs.books<br>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aaronksaunders&#x2F;ci.alloy.adapter.one<br>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aaronksaunders&#x2F;ci.alloy.adapter.two</p>
<p>I can get the book one to create ACS, but it does not create a SQL db.  Are these adapters supposed to create the DB based on your ACS objects? Or are you supposed to develop your own DB and hook them up together somehow? I noticed in the code there is a sync folder which contains code for localdatabses etc. However, it doesn&#39;t seem that the code is ever invoked.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure i&#39;m missing something here, if someone could shed some light on this that would be great.  I&#39;ve browsed the titanium doc but still a little confused.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help!</p>

							<p>I pretty sure those adapters are designed to sync data between local backbone models and collections (in device memory) and ACS. I think what you may be looking for is some kind of dual sync adapter for Backbone to keep data synced between ACS and a local SQLite (or indeed Ti.properties) datastore.</p>
<p>I&#39;m looking into the same thing myself and have recently found the following which may be a good starting point:</p>

							<p>Hmm, what do you make of the sync folder then? Contains files like localstorage.js, sync.js, etc.. Those look like they may do some of that, but i&#39;m having a bit of a hard time understanding it.  Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>Not quite yet, as we are focusing on the local portion of it.  I did try and play around a bit, but didn&#39;t really get anything working.  You may try adapting something like this example:<br>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nilbus&#x2F;Backbone.dualStorage</p>
<p>If you manage to find something, please let me know!  If I come across anything myself i&#39;ll post it here.</p>
