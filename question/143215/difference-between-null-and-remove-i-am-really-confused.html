			<p>Can anyone please explain to me the difference between null and remove?</p>
<p>I am confused as to where to use what. What will release memory and act as a garbage collector?<br>I am currently working on the performance of my app where a lot of memory is being used because i am not destroying objects and variables properly as i am not understanding where to use what?<br>Also is it necessary to remove event listeners? If yes then how much and how to do the same?<br>Also any basic tips on improving the performance of the app in case of speed and memory usage?<br>Also I have modal windows through out the app and i read that on closing a modal window it automatically takes care of the memory release but in the DDMS it does not reflect as much in releasing as in allocating the memory while opening the windows… So is there any better way to do so or am i missing something there? I just use the window object and close it eg :: window.close();…</p>
<p>Any help is really appreciated…</p>

							<p>The difference is that &quot;remove&quot; removes visual representation of removed element on the screen, while setting it to &quot;null&quot; just references other value (and devs usually use that so that GC can kick in). </p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">//removes visual representation of "view"</span>
parent.remove(<span class="hljs-built_in">view</span>);
<span class="hljs-comment">// "view" still holds a reference to TiUIView so it won't be GCed</span>
<span class="hljs-built_in">view</span> = <span class="hljs-built_in">null</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">//now, a reference to TiUIView is gone and it can be GCed</span>
</code></pre><p>You shouldn&#39;t use any of those for manual GC, GC should be automatic.</p>

							<p><strong>Remove</strong> is an action you take against a parent view to remove a child view. The child view will remain though in memory and you will be able to add it to another parent view.</p>
<p>When you <strong>nullify</strong> a component it means you mark it as &quot;not needed anymore&quot; and the next time the GC will kick in, will remove  this component from memory EXCEPT if there is no other reference to it in a different region of the code that blocks it.</p>
<p>The best approach is to use both at the same time.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">parent_view.remove(<span class="hljs-built_in">view</span>);
<span class="hljs-built_in">view</span> =  <span class="hljs-built_in">null</span>;
</code></pre>

										<p><p>The GC I&#39;m talking about is not the javascript garbage collector. Is the platform&#39;s one.<br>Because of the way the native-javascript proxies are created, this is possible :)</p>
