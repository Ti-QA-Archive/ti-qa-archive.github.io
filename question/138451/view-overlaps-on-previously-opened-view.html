			<p>hi all, i recently ran into some problems using the views. I have two windows each with seperate table views in them. when the application starts the first table view is loaded with list from web service. On selecting one of the rows,the second window is loaded and the second table view is loaded with some other data from a web service. but when i click on back button and select another row from the first table view,teh second window with different second table view contents loads but the problem is that the content appears as if overlapping on the previous opened second window. how to resolve this problem,,also if i just display &quot;there is no content to display&quot; label in the second window,it appears over any of the previously opened second window contents…plz help me with this problem…</p>

							<div><p>the version of the code I had when I asked this question has changed now..the scenario is such that the second window contains 5 imageviews in a view which are set to be to look like a tab bar, and on clicking each of the image views the view below changes. this is where the problem arises,I create a view(whose background is transparent) on click of each button which contains some data and this view is displayed below the image bar at the top,these views appear overlapped after clicking all the imageview buttons on the top,can anyone help me about this overlapping</p>

							<p>Basically you have a container view, in pseudo code:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> lastMainView = <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> setMainView = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">view</span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(lastMainView) {
        <span class="hljs-built_in">window</span>.remove(lastMainView);
    }

    <span class="hljs-built_in">window</span>.add(view);
    lastMainView = view;
}

btn.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> view = createMyView();
    setMainView(view);
});
</code></pre><p>where <code>btn</code> is the one of your 5 images.</p>
