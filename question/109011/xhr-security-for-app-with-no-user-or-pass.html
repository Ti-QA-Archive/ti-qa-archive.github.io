			<p>Hi,<br>I am creating an application where a user can send information to the server in json format where the server takes the information from json and add the information to the database. </p>
<p>Now, my concern is how can i protect it so that a hacker won&#39;t get the url and send his own bogus data to flood the database. My application won&#39;t use any type of user authentication because it&#39;ll be a public&#x2F;open application. (I know I could&#39;ve used md5 for a user to sign in through the app and valdify on server end, but thats not the case.) </p>
<p>Any help is greatly appreciated</p>

							<p>Do I have this right?  Your server:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is a public&#x2F;open application which requires no login or user validation</li>
<li>It accepts information in json format from a client and adds it to a db</li>
<li>You want to prevent someone from flooding the database</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are accepting information publicly without any user validation, there is really only so much you can do.  By definition you tell us you accept the data and add to the database.</p>
<p>One possibility that can at least slow the rate would be to have the server store the IP address of each sender and the timestamp.  Before adding to your database, do a SQL count of the number of records from that IP address within the last xxx period (you&#39;d have to define the appropriate limits).</p>
<p>Reject any submission that has exceeded its &quot;rate limit&quot;.  Note that while this can slow the rate the database grows, it does nothing to stop the overhead on the server so you could still have a denial of service condition if that is what the hacker is trying to achieve.</p>
<p>It isn&#39;t foolproof, but at least affords a degree of protection.</p>

							<p>Public writeable SQL via JSON without any user, app or device authentication.I don&#39;t mean to sound harsh but this is pretty crazy.</p>
<p>Just because the application is public&#x2F;open doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t perform application authentication.</p>
<p>For example you could have an activation process on first run where over and SSL connect you perform a creation and exchange to later validate the app against connections. This means each app will have its own unique shared secret.</p>
<p>I assume you are sanitizing the SQL content before you insert in your DB to avoid injection attacks. So alternatively, you can perform a risked based data authentication by doing things like examining the content, determine source IP, performing rate limiting etc. This is very much like spam filtering (public system that must accept all information but throw away the junk).</p>

							<p>What is a recommended method to authenticate a service like this? </p>
<p>Even if you add a username&#x2F;password in the json or xml you are sending this could be pulled out of the request and used again.</p>
<p>Would adding the authentication to the headers be any better?</p>
