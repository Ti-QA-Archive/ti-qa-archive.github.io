			<h1>animated views and addEventListeners not listening</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>As the title suggests, I&#39;ve been trying to get addEventListeners to respond to clicks on views during animation.</p>
<p>Looking at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;52391&#x2F;click-event-while-view-in-animation-dont-work">this post</a> from two years ago I thought I&#39;d reintroduce the question by sharing what I have learned.</p>
<p>The view I&#39;m toying with is being rotated and scaled via a 2Dmatrix and also traversing across the screen by setting the animation top and left parameters.</p>
<h3 id="a-partial-answer">A partial answer</h3>
<p>Though I&#39;ve had no luck interacting with animated views directly, I did find I could add a filler view (where height&#x2F;width are Ti.UI.FILL) and an addEventListener for the child view will respond to clicks, despite the parent view not listening.  BUT I can only get this to work when the parent view is being rotated and scaled.  It does NOT work with when I specify a top&#x2F;left&#x2F;bottom&#x2F;right parameter in the animation declaration.</p>
<p>Anyway, this doesn&#39;t fix my problem, but thought I&#39;d share what I have learned.  If anyone knows of a way at all to get an animated view to respond to listeners while traversing across the screen, I&#39;d love to here it!</p>
<p>Currently using Ti.SDK 2.1.0v20120501131823</p>

							<div><p>Okay, after further examination anda little sleep, i&#39;ve found that you don&#39;t need the filler view to get addEventListeners to work with 2dMatrix transition animations.  Those will work on the view as they should, it&#39;s just the traversing animations that don&#39;t listen.</p>

							<p>I saw this bugfix in the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;release-notes&#x2F;?version=2.1.1.GA">2.1.1 release notes</a>:</p>
<p><em>Animation: A view moved by an animation no longer responds to touch events. (Touch events are generated based on the original location, not the new location.) (TIMOB-10042)</em></p>
<p>Note that this was an android fix; you didn&#39;t mention a specific platform, so this may or may not be helpful.</p>
