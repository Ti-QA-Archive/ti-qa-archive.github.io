							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The latest stable is Ti Studio 3.2.3.201404181442.  This is actually slightly older than the GA version available right now.</p>
<p>Also - you know this is Ti Studio and not Ti SDK - if you were looking for a more up-to-date Ti SDK this is not the place to see that.</p>
<p>What were you hoping to see?</p>

										<p><p>thanks for quick reply !Malcolm. my question is : when i opened up the Titanium Studio every each time , i was endless prompted to update Titanium Sdk and other softwares needed , there was a list of it ,i tried to update but never worked . either this update freezes there forever or shows error &quot;npm error&quot; , i am thinking it maybe because of my internet connection from China , so i am wondering is there a package that already contains all the latest software&#x2F;components needed by Titanium Studio in one , i could just download it and installed it offline just in once .</p>

										<p><p>The reason for the endless prompts is because you have somehow managed to get onto an automatic update list that goes beyond the normal app - so basically you are on one of the several beta threads.</p>
<p>You can stop this by;</p>
<ul>
<li>In Studio</li>
<li>Help Menu</li>
<li>Select &quot;Install New Software..&quot;</li>
<li>Select &quot;Available Software Sites&quot;</li>
<li>Look down the list and find anything that is prefixed; &quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;preview…&quot;</li>
<li>Remove these entries</li>
<li>LEAVE the &quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;download…&quot; entry - that is the one you want</li>
</ul>
<p>If you get any further messages to update - simply download the full software from the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;my.appcelerator.com&#x2F;resources">resourcs</a> page.  This should stop them - but the above should have already done that.</p>

										<p><p>thanks ,there is only one url on my &quot;Available Software Sites&quot; list ,which is exactly the  one you suggested  ! for the sake of many obvious reason(ijust fixed a problem by updating) , i would like to install all  the stable updates needed by the Titanium Studio , but i got very different internet environment here in China (they block or interrupt many websites) , so the typical Titanium updates seem not very applicable to me , i am wondering is there any other alternative to install updates.</p>

										<p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a similar problem on Mac. Every time I launch titanium studio it prompts me to update versions of CLI, alloy and node.ACS. it gets installed and shows the dialog &quot;following updates were installed ….&quot;</p>
<p>But next time also it gives me the same update info.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help</p>
