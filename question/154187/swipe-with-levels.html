			<h1>swipe with levels</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am quite new to Titanium and would like to ask if there is a way to create a swipe with more levels or multiple options depending how far you swipe. Like the new Mailbox app is using it. ( http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mailboxapp.com&#x2F; ) If you swipe a little you get one command &#x2F; option, but if you swipe all the way… you get another one… or for example second picture on this link ( http:&#x2F;&#x2F;designmodo.com&#x2F;flat-design-mobile-apps&#x2F; ) … where you can see that row was swiped and user gets 3 options.<br>And lastly … can you implement diagonal swipe… let say from center of display… like compass directions…  NW, NE, SW, SE ?</p>
<p>I would really appreciate some help or answers. </p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Tomaz</p>

										<p><p>Hi,<br>thanks for your answer, but this is not really what I was hoping for… the way swipe and commands behind work (on mailbox app for instance… ) is … that if you start the swipe… slowly… underneath new command is showing… or is shown… and if you stop the swipe… and go back… nothing changes… the underneath command disappears. It is very appealing to the user. Dan Tamases video shows his implementation in a way… that when you swipe.. some predefined commands are displayed. But then jou must CLICK on something… to trigger it. This is the spet I would like to avoid.<br>But really thanks for your help. I appreciate it.</p>

							<p>I&#39;m quite sure that the comment by Manual Lehner has the link to exactly what you are looking for.</p>
<p>To me, it appears exactly like Mailbox App, you would only need add different options for the swipe distance you have in mind, if more than one option per direction is what you&#39;re after. His code only has one option for right and another for left, with a small amount in either direction giving an indication of what would happen if you swipe further.</p>
