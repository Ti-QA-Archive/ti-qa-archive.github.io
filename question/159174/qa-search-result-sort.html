							<p>Hi</p>
<p>It is a known issue, the good news - Appcelerator knows about it and has promised a fix.  Bad news - this has been promised more than once and over at least three years that I know about.</p>
<p>Solution; never search using the search box - it will only make you cry.  Instead use trusty google, it does two things;</p>
<ul>
<li>actually searches for things and finds them</li>
<li>allows you to refine the results (search tools link in results) to focus on a day.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good Google search examples;</p>
<ul>
<li>Appcelerator tabgroup android actionbar</li>
<li>Appcelerator iPad popover example</li>
<li>Appcelerator Hollingsworth android images</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice each one starts with appcelerator, not titanium.  Keep it simple.  The third example shows you that you can search for results based on an author of answers, me for example (my answers are great!) this way you can look for something you know someone you trust had answered.  It is great when you have a name that is more unique - you are screwed on that one - sorry.</p>
<p>But seriously, those of us who do this Q&amp;A thing24 hours a day gave up on Q&amp;A search a long time ago.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks, I can believe I never noticed this before.  I guess I noticed it this time because the things I was searching for were related to the iOS 7 release .  Before I didn&#39;t care how old the post was as long as it answered my question but I did find it odd that I was coming across so many old posts!</p>
