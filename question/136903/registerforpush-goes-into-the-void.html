		<section>
			<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>I have an app up and running as a test build distributed to a few colleauges using TestFlightApp.  I am now in the process of experimenting with PUSH notifications and have run into things that I do not wholly understand.  </p>
<p>I started off by creating a new AppID in my Apple Developer account, then created the provisioning profile and set it up in the local keychain.  I am using the Development provisioning profile since TestFlightApp complains about &quot;Developer Build Entitlements must have get-task-allow set to true&quot;.</p>
<p>In my app I am calling Ti.Network.registerForPushNotifications with a perfectly valid callback, success and error function.  As far as I can tell the call is going away into the void.  I have coded in a report from both my sucess and error functions but nothing ever gets reported back to me.  What could I be doing wrong here?  Any help would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>I am using the latest Titanium build dated the 13th of April 2012</p>

										<p><p>I am not too sure what you mean by that.  I have three testers, including myself.  At the moment I am sending out a build notitification just to myself from TestFlight after having uploaded the newly build IPA - created with a development provisioning profile after having first created an AppID and configured it for PUSH.</p>
<p>The thing that happens is this - I call Ti.Network.registerForPushNotification and….nothing happens.  No errors, no success,  Just complete silence.</p>

										<p><p>Me too. No success, error, or callback functions being fired when calling registerForPushNotifications. Did you ever resolve this?</p>

							<p>No callbacks may occur when the required ports are closed behind a Firewall. Specifically port 5223. More info here:<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;kb&#x2F;TS4264?viewlocale=en_US</p>
<p>This is most likely to occur when testing on WiFi only iPads as iOS will opt to use a Cellular Data Connection when available to bypass such issues (even when connected to Wifi).</p>
