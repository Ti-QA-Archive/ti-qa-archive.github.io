							<p>Hi</p>
<p>You will find that in order to provide the base level of functionality for Android that Titanium requires - libraries of code are used. For android those libraries are much larger than those required for iOS.</p>
<p>An easy way to see the base difference is to create a default alloy project and without changing any code compile each so you can see the original file size of the installable files.</p>
<p>You should find that once you take your common assets plus platform specific assets into account for each platform your contribution to the app size should be the same (again taking platform specific assets into account).</p>
<p>Keep in mind your assets can often massively increase the size of the app and at 20Mb would be a factor here.  So optimising any images, PDFs would be smart.</p>
<p>This situation has been around for a long time and is unfortunate. However it may change in the future with Ti.Next and Hyperloop (both topics relate to upcoming internal changes to the Titanium system), but this potential size reduction will not be fully known until those projects are fully realised. I would not expect these to be fully available fully until the end of the year.</p>
<p>So for now, your app size for Android looks reasonable given the size of your iOS app once the base differences are taken into account.</p>
<p>You mention your app is 20Mb and some are 650K - even once the Titanium library is removed the app would be no where near 650K.  If your app has (for example) 10Mb of images, databases, PDFs or any mixture of additional files then that 10Mb is never going to reduce down to 650K.  A better example would be 20Mb to 12-14Mb app.</p>
<p>Additionally the APK format includes a copy of itself - do not ask why - I have no good idea.</p>

										<p><p>@Ritesh - good answer - shame you copied it word for word from the original poster of the answer.  It would have been polite to have acknowledged the actual author that provided the you simply duplicated - both here and in the answer you got &#39;accepted&#39;.</p>
<p>Given the answer was created more than 2 years ago and mostly references the big changes between SDK 1.7.x and 1.8.x this answer is mostly irrelevant.</p>
<p>Do you have a follow up you created that takes a current view of the situation and does not focus on the change of the underlying JavaScript engine?</p>
