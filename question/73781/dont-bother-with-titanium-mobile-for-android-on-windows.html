			<h1>Don&#39;t Bother with Titanium Mobile for Android on Windows</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>We had a few people together trying on several Windows and several Macs.  Basically, our conclusion is that trying to use Titanium on Windows with Android is a WASTE OF TIME.  There are many possible problems and Titanium does not help to figure our why things are not working.  It can work once, then you change something, it breaks.  We try to figure out what&#39;s wrong, but everyone came up with a different theory.  Even if you get it to work, it is like 10X slower on Windows, so no serious developer can be productive in such environment.  </p>
<p>We decided to just develop on Mac for iPhone first… when we are further along, then we will deal with Android (and many be Appcelerator will fix the problem by then).</p>

							<p>Its not an Appcelerator issue, its the emulator on Windows itself is just slow.</p>
<p>And maybe its you guys that have the problems, I&#39;m cross-developing right now a pretty intensive app, and aside for just the emulator being slow, it works fine.</p>

							<p>What was the point of this post other than to complain?</p>
<p>Titanium Mobile works on Windows and as Josh said the emulator is slow (An Android&#x2F;Computer issue). I&#39;ve had no issues developing on Windows, although I primarily develop on the Mac. The Android simulator needs improvement. For me, it is slower than the device, which makes no sense.</p>
<p>I&#39;d recommend doing more research on the issues you are having rather than complaining about a product that&#39;s actually not at fault.</p>

							<p>Funny, 4 separate installs of Titanium, and no problems here… anyhow, back to module writing, this wastes too much time.</p>

							<p>I&#39;ve noticed that Android is much slower even on the Mac.  It seems like an eternity before it launches each time, even if you leave the simulator running and just reload the program.  Titanium closes the iPhone simulator each time and is still about 10x faster than the Android side.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll agree Titanium isn&#39;t perfect, but neither is maintaining separate code bases for each app.  Thanks for sharing your perspective.</p>

							<p>I develop my apps for both the iPhone and Android at the same time.. since I&#39;m forced to use a Mac for the iPhone stuff, it makes sense to run the Android emulator on the Mac as well. It works fine. A little slow compared to the iPhone Simulator, but bearable.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve no real complains. And it&#39;s not something that Titanium can address.</p>

							<p>FWIW, I develop solely for Android on the Windows platform, on both Win 7 64-bit and XP 32-bit machines.</p>
<p>I won&#39;t say that there weren&#39;t niggles getting it up and running, but no more than a lot of other toolkits and frameworks, DotNetNuke being one.</p>
<p>The Android simulator <em>is</em> murderously slow on anything other than cutting edge hardware - I mostly just use a phone now for this reason.</p>
