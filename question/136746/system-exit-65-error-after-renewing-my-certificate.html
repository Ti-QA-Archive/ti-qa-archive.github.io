										<p><p>Hi Gurkan,</p>
<p>I think you need to run your project in different system for testing may be it works in other system.so give your project to your colleagues for testing of your project.</p>

							<p>I got the same issue. I am unable to compile for Device tests.</p>
<p>I have Titanium Studio Titanium Studio, build: 2.0.2.201205091504 (last update from this morning)<br>and Titanium Mobile SDK 2.1.0.v20120509144718.<br>XCode 4.3.2 (4E2002) is installed in Applications (before XCode 4.3.2, it was installer in &#x2F;Developer&#x2F;)</p>
<p>and I&#39;ve got the same issue. I am unabled to create .ipa to transfer on iPhone device for test.</p>
<p>App in Simulator works fine.</p>
<p>I also tried to change the Titanium Mobile SDK version but didnt change anything</p>
<p>[ERROR]<br>[ERROR] Error: Traceback (most recent call last):<br>  File &quot;&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx&#x2F;2.1.0.v20120509144718&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;builder.py&quot;, line 1472, in main<br>    execute_xcode(&quot;iphoneos%s&quot; % iphone_version,args,False)<br>  File &quot;&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx&#x2F;2.1.0.v20120509144718&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;builder.py&quot;, line 1231, in execute_xcode<br>    output = run.run(args,False,False,o)<br>  File &quot;&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Titanium&#x2F;mobilesdk&#x2F;osx&#x2F;2.1.0.v20120509144718&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;run.py&quot;, line 41, in run<br>    sys.exit(rc)<br>SystemExit: 65</p>
<p>–&gt; I also tried to create a new demo project (new mobile project) and transfer with the same id (com.etc) on device is ok.</p>
<p>so after i replaced my Resource + i18n folders in the demo project then launch Simulator (ok)<br>then tried to compile on device but failed…</p>
<p>Help would be appreciated !!</p>
