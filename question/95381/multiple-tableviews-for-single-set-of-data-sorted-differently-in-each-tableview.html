			<h1>Multiple TableViews for single set of data, sorted differently in each TableView</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve got a set of data that I&#39;d like to show in different <strong>TableViews</strong>, each in its own Tab or Window.  In each different <strong>TableView</strong>, the data will be sorted differently - but the data itself is the same - just in different sorted order.</p>
<p>What is the most efficient (fastest) way of handling this?<br>In each <strong>TableViewRow</strong>, I&#39;ve got text and graphics (icons) - I think icons make it slower to draw&#x2F;create <strong>TableViews</strong>.</p>
<p>I have not experimented the different ways (yet), but here are the ones I can think of:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Use ONE <strong>TableView</strong> and separate data sets - each with the same data, just sorted differently - and swap out the data used&#x2F;attached to the TableView.<br><strong>QUESTIONS</strong>: if I change out the data member, will the <strong>TableView</strong> automatically refresh (with the different data set that is just sorted differently) or will I have to <strong>createTableView()</strong> from scratch with the &quot;new&quot; data (which makes having a single <strong>TableView</strong> pointless), OR will I have to <strong>tableView.updateRow()</strong> ALL the new data in the existing <strong>TableView</strong>?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use separate <strong>TableViews</strong> and ONE data set - and update each <strong>TableView</strong> as the individual elements&#x2F;rows and&#x2F;or sorting changes in the data set.  This seems like a lot of work - and again, similar questions exist here.<br><strong>QUESTIONS</strong>: if the data changes (in this instance, 3 <strong>TableViews</strong> may have been created from a single dataset - but during creation, the data set was attached with it sorted a specific way) - will the <strong>TableView</strong> reflect it automatically?  If so, this won&#39;t work since this model is working with one data set while needing to display it in 3 differently sorted ways - I&#39;d have to have multiple data sets each sorted differently for each <strong>TableView</strong> .. onto #3 below.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use separate <strong>TableViews</strong> and a separate data set for each - each with the same data, but sorted differently.  Unfortunately, in this case, I&#39;d have to continuously keep the data in all 3 data sets in sync - if any rows&#x2F;elements changes.  This would also be a resource hog - but would this be the only or best (<strong>performance-wise</strong>) to do it?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for any help.  Performance is the biggest concern here…</p>

							<p>As with nearly all programming tasks, the &quot;best&quot; approach can vary with a number of factors not mentioned in your question.  For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>How often does the data change?</li>
<li>Does the user change data, or does it come via REST or SOAP etc?</li>
<li>How many rows?  Dozens?  Hundreds?  Thousands?</li>
<li>Is the data stored in a SQLite database?  JSON object?  Or?</li>
</ul>
<p>And probably many other factors.</p>
<p>But to more directly answer your questions, first realize that if you put each table view on a different window or tab, then you will have 3 copies of the data populated into 3 different tables.</p>
<p>That means that once you load the tabs, you can change tabs and instantly see a different view.  But it also means there are three sets of data and you must control keeping them in sync.</p>
<p>Pretty much all of your questions only matter if you were using a single table object in a single window.  Or at least if all the tabs and windows run from a single context in app.js, instead of using url: *.js on the create window method.</p>
<p>I really can&#39;t give more personal opinion on how to load &#x2F; store the data without knowing more about the volume of the data, how static it is, how you plan to store it, etc.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Doug - </p>
<p>There are some assumptions I am currently making:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The data will change based on user input, so it&#39;d prob be one item&#x2F;row at a time (but see #3 below on dataset count).</p>
</li>
<li><p>User will change data most of the time, with some syncing done via REST (I&#39;m not <em>overly</em> concerned with performance here since I do not expect the user to be interacting with it at the same time in most cases; I&#39;ll prob lock out the data when they do a REST-based sync)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The dataset <em>could</em> be 200-300 items (one &#39;item&#39; per TableViewRow, with each row holding some text, numeric, and icon&#x2F;graphic data)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The data will be stored locally in SQLite - but (as per #2 above) can be synced with an online database via REST.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#39;m primarily concerned with performance when the user is interacting with the GUI.  I don&#39;t want the user to be waiting more than 1-2 seconds to get any of the TableView UIs refreshed just for updating one item&#x2F;row in the dataset, especially if the dataset has 200-300 - maybe even 1000 rows&#x2F;items…</p>
<p>FYI this is a Todo&#x2F;Task list manager app.</p>
<p>With that said, it seems as long as I don&#39;t use url: *.js to create the windows and instead declare&#x2F;define ALL the windows within app.js, each and every window&#x2F;tab (and their TableViews) will have access to a single set of data.<br>On a related note - does the TableView automatically update the rows visually if the data it is pointed to is updated, or do I have to recreate the TableView (createTableView()) every time a row or the sort is changed?</p>
<p>I appreciate the quick response!  I&#39;m about to do some experiments in the next few days to see which option makes sense…</p>

										<p><p>&gt;I&#39;m primarily concerned with performance when the user is interacting with the GUI. I don&#39;t want the user to be waiting more than 1-2 seconds to get any of the TableView UIs refreshed just for updating one item&#x2F;row in the dataset,…</p>
<p>Just use the tableview.updateRow() method on the row in question; don&#39;t repopulate the entire table for a single user update.  What could complicate things for you is if kept three tables in different sort sequences, for instant moving between them.  In that case you&#39;d be responsible for locating and updating the corresponding row in the associated tableviews.  If&#x2F;when you know the row index, you still only need to .updateRow to modify a single row.</p>
<p>That said, if the data they change impacts the sort sequence for one of the table view then you have another wrinkle to iron out.</p>
<p>Does the switch between sort sequences need to be instant?  Can you reload the table in a new sequence when it changes?</p>
<p>IMHO, the way I would approach it, especially since you will have the data in SQLite, is to use a single table.  To load the table or switch sort orders, run a SELECT … ORDER BY … to get a sql result set in the right sequence.  Then just toss out the existing data and reload the table iterating over the sql result set.</p>
<p>However, performance will still depend on a number of factors and could easily exceed 1-2 seconds to switch sort orders and do a complete reload.  However, there are ways to overcome this too.</p>
<p>For example, look at the kitchen sink <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;KitchenSink&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;KitchenSink&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;examples&#x2F;table_view_dynamic_scroll.js">dynamic scroll</a> method.  I use a variation this in an app of mine where the number of rows can be up to 30,000.  I do an incremental search on the database with each character keyed into a search field.  I compute a WHERE clause to filter the data, and ORDER BY to sequence it.  Then I add LIMIT to return only the first XX rows (where XX is user configurable in my settings).</p>
<p>Even with 30+K rows in my database, typical response time in my app to load up at least a &quot;page&quot; (visible portion) worth of data is always under .2 seconds.  So I just do it as they type, dynamically adjusting the table view until they see what they want.</p>
<p>If they stop typing and try to scroll the list instead, I use the methods in the above kitchen sink example to dynamically grab the next &quot;chunk&quot; of data to display.  (I do this using the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses in the sql select statement.)</p>
<p>I don&#39;t really care how big the list is, or how far they scroll.  I just keep the amount of data I fetch at any one time to be small enough so the elapsed time is under 1&#x2F;4 second.</p>
<p>I can change sort orders and still redisplay the first results in under 1&#x2F;4 second, even with 30+K rows in the database.  All it takes is proper database planning, the right indexes built in the database, and the above linked dynamic scroll method to loading the data.</p>

										<p><p><em>Does the switch between sort sequences need to be instant? Can you reload the table in a new sequence when it changes?</em></p>
<p>Data change <em>could</em> change its location - so that&#39;s something I will have to handle by deleting the index and re-inserting at the correct location in the TableView.</p>
<p>The switch between the different TableViews (different sorts) <em>should</em> be instant, if not close to instant… less than 1 second with anything is <em>highly</em> preferred.  2 seconds would definitely be unacceptable.  1 second would be borderline…</p>
<p>One question I had is whether the ORDER_BY by SQLite (using multiple fields) is faster than a Javascript sort() (calling a custom function, since it&#39;d be of objects and the sort would be multi-level).. obviously that&#39;d be largely implementation-independent.</p>
<p>As for table_view_dynamic_scroll - it is one of many iOS-specific things in KitchenSink so I have not seen it (sorry, developing on PC&#x2F;Android combo at least <em>initially</em>).  One concern I have is whether or not it&#39;d work (well) in Android, and whether it will be fully supported in the future - obviously don&#39;t want to use something that will not work later.  Similarly, TableViewSections are in the same group, which is kinda frustrating since I could definitely use that functionality as well.</p>
<p>Thanks for your input.  I will look at the Dynamic Scroll (move it to compile in Android to see how well it works, if any)… my current mindset is do do what you said initially - one dataset and multiple TableViews each with a different sort… just have a table that maps the dataset index for each TableViewRow, and update all TableViews at once - I assume for the TableViews that are off-screen (different tab&#x2F;window) it&#39;d be pretty quick.  I&#39;m not sure I have any other alternative for now…</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that also means I&#39;ll have to have the separate TableView code in app.js (or at least, where the dataset is declared) so that they can each work with the same set of data…. ugh… was hoping for separate js files (unless there&#39;s a way to make a &quot;global&quot; javascript variable persist across separate js files??)</p>
