			<h1>Emulator does not display anything</h1>

		<section>
			<p>I downloaded Titanium, and created a new project called &#39;TestProject&#39; (the one given as default).<br>However, when I click on Run Emulator, nothing shows up (not even the iPhone and Android tabs). I am hence unable to launch the app at all, and get going with Titanium.<br>What am I doing wrong?</p>

							<p>I would recommend removing and re-downloading Titanium, it looks like something may have gone wrong on your machine or in the orig download. You should have an SDK of 1.6.2 or something close to that, 1.2 is rather old and would absolutely cause your app to not load correctly.</p>
