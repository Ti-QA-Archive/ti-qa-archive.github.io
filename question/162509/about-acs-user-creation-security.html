			<h1>About ACS user creation security</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I was wondering about security concepts on ACS and I found the next situation (I&#39;m figuring it):</p>
<p>In the ACS console you have the option to set &quot;Allow User Creation&quot;, that only gives you 2 options: true (all users can create themselves just calling the API) or false (you can only create users in the ACS web console).</p>
<p>In an ideal situation, you only allow users to create themselves in your program if you want. Let&#39;s suppose you make a Node.ACS app (server side) to manage your users (CRUD operations, you need to set Allow User Creation to true) but you don&#39;t want the mobile users can create an account. Then you publish your mobile app. </p>
<p>In theory, all the code is encrypted but, as you may know, all that a man can encrypt, another man can decrypt. If someone decrypt you code (I&#39;m assuming it is possible), I suppose then can get you API Key (and Secret Key). With this info, now the attacker can create new users in ACS, just writing a new program using your Keys. </p>
<p>Once he has the new user, can query any info he wants.</p>
<p>The question is: is all I was figuring, right? If true, is the only solution to set &quot;Allow User Creation&quot; to false? A good solution to this could be to allow a new option &quot;only admin users&quot; so only the admins can create users.</p>

							<p>Hello Manuel,</p>
<h2 id="allow-user-creation">Allow user creation</h2>
<p>This is for making the UI&#x2F;UX easier for the user (and the administration for you). By default, the new created users will be able to read&#x2F;write only their own content. In general, the user can&#39;t access other user&#39;s data. </p>
<h2 id="lost-keys">Lost keys</h2>
<p>If your app is decrypted and the keys are compromised, then the malicious user can create a new user, but won&#39;t be able to read any other users data. </p>
<h2 id="what-to-do-">What to do?</h2>
<p>As in any security decision, at the end the call is yours: do you want to make the system more secure or more usable? </p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro</p>

										<p><p>Hi Mauro.</p>
<p>Then I&#39;m losing something because, from Node, this simple code get all the Custom objects, doesn&#39;t matter who created it (I&#39;m logged as a generic saved user, not admin):</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">        <span class="hljs-built_in">var</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">params</span> = {
            classname: <span class="hljs-string">'Messages'</span>,
            <span class="hljs-keyword">order</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'-created_at'</span>,
            response_json_depth: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
        };

        ACS<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>Objects<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>query(<span class="hljs-keyword">params</span>, function(<span class="hljs-built_in">data</span>) {
            <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-built_in">data</span><span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>success) {
        <span class="hljs-attribute">...</span>
            } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
                res<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>send(<span class="hljs-string">'Error occurred.'</span>);
            }
        });
</code></pre><p>And this happens for all my custom objects. Any user can read (maybe not write, I didn&#39;t check) any custom object I have, and even can read any User objects (not write, in this case).</p>

										<p><p>Hello Manuel,</p>
<p>you did not created any ACL related to your object. Therefore, It will be available across all your users. </p>
<p>For more info about how to create ACLs, you can read it <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;cloud&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;ACLs">here</a> and <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;cloud&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;CustomObjects-method-create">here</a>. </p>

										<p><p>Thank you Mauro, for your comment. I was reading about ACLs and seems to do what I need.</p>
<p>Just one thing: the fact that all is accesible &quot;by default&quot; seems to be a great security issue. I think that the policies must be &quot;deny all&quot; by default, not &quot;allow all&quot;.</p>
<p>But, in general, I think the most easy solution to the user creation problem could be a new option &quot;only admin users&quot;, because ACLs are complicated.</p>

										<p><p>One thing, Mauro. Reading about ACLs i found this: <em>Currently, ACLs can be used with the following ACS objects: Checkins, Custom Objects, Events, Files, Photos, Photo Collections, Places, Posts, Reviews and Statuses.</em></p>
<p>Not for Users? I then made a single <strong>ACS.Users.query({blah, blah});</strong> with a normal logged user and I got all the users list. This means that I cannot restrict the users to read&#x2F;write, so I&#39;m again on the first point of the problem: if someone can decrypt my mobile app and get the KEYS, then can create his own program to create his user and manipulate my whole system.</p>
<p>Doesn&#39;t sounds good.</p>

										<p><p>Hello Manuel,</p>
<p>related to your first concern, I added a bug report <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;CLOUDSRV-3256">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;CLOUDSRV-3256</a> that covers the comment of having policies like deny all by default.</p>
<p>The second one is more about usability. You will be able to see the other users, so you can easily connect to them. You won&#39;t be able to read their stuff, if you have the right ACL. In short: If you have a system with the right ACLs, even if your evil friend get access to create a new user, he won&#39;t be able to actually read or write other user&#39;s stuff. </p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro</p>

										<p><p>Hi Mauro.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t see the JIRA, (not enough permissions ;D ) but will be good a deny policy by default for security reasons. People usually don&#39;t have security mindset and will believe that all is secure.</p>
<p>For the second, then for me, looking for security, tell me if this is right:</p>
<ol>
<li>I must create an ACL (the Creator User ID can be anyone? This is the point I&#39;m missing in ACLs) like &quot;deny_acl&quot; with &quot;public read&quot;=false and &quot;public write&quot;=false</li>
<li>Apply it to all my Custom Objects every time I create a new one, so only the owner will read&#x2F;write his stuff.</li>
<li>If I need that a &quot;role admin user (not a real admin, only a role)&quot; can read&#x2F;write all Customs Objects, I must include it in the reader&#x2F;writer list? (this is to be able to have a CRUD system with an admin user to manage the other users).</li>
</ol>

										<p><p>Hello, </p>
<p>some details related to this:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>What happen when you unzip the APK produced by Titanium? - Once you build for distribution (i.e, either for Google play store or Testflight) your code will be obfuscated. Even if anyone is able to get the APK and unzip it, the code won&#39;t be easily readable.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The selfservice allowing you to create users is part of the usability of any app today. I recommend to set the permissions to the lowest level possible (i.e., just user). If you need any other permission, add it manually (then will need your action).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Best,</p>
