			<h1>App works on simulator, crashes on device</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have been working on an app that works fine on the iOS simulator, but suffers very frequent and seemingly random crashes (the app just closes unexpectedly) when running on the device (iphone 3GS in this case). I tried but I really couldn&#39;t find any pattern –it seems to happen at any moment.</p>
<p>I have searched about this &quot;device-only&quot; crash issue [1] but didn&#39;t find a solution for me. These and some other reports about app crashes suggest a bad memory management by Titanium that I guess that combined with the device&#39;s lower resources may cause the crash. Just in case it is useful, the latest device logs say &quot;Exception Type: EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV)&quot; and &quot;KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at 0xfffffffb&quot; while some previous ones say &quot;EXception Type: EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGBUS)&quot; and &quot;Exception Codes: KERN_PROTECTION_FAILURE at 0x00000014&quot;.</p>
<p>The app is quite big and does a variety of things, like database access, a long tableview with images, switching tabgroups, a small XmlHttpRequest, webViews with some Javascript, scrollableViews with variable contents… so it&#39;s very difficult to me now to guess where could could it be best to attack the problem. And the fact that this issue only happens on the device makes it absolutely unaffordable to go trying uncertain hacks.</p>
<p>Recently I noticed that using Titanium SDK 1.6.x instead of 1.7.x, the app crashed a lot less frequently, but then I updated the iOS SDK to version 5 and Xcode to version 4.2, and I have not been able to use Titanium SDK 1.6.x since then[2]. So now I only can use SDK 1.7.x, and thus suffer those frequent crashes, to the point that the app now always closes itself right after the first click… while still working perfectly on the simulator.</p>
<p>Maybe I will try to find out how to downgrade Xcode and iOS SDK, but maybe someone can give some tips about how to work around this problem, or any sort of idea that has not come to my head yet.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

							<div><p>Can you post a full log of the errors you get when your app crashes, like after that first click? Is there any chance you can narrow this behavior down to a reproducible chunk of code? It&#39;s really hard to diagnose these things without any code to work with.</p>

							<div><p>The last log: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;2762086<br>The console log: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastie.org&#x2F;2762084</p>
<p>As for the code, yes, I know it&#39;s hard to diagnose anything without a chunk of code, but the problem is, there is too much code where to choose from, and I have no clue where the problem is (when this happened in the simulator this could be more or less difficult to find, but on the device it is almost impossible).</p>
<p>Well, let&#39;s take, for example, the code for the button of this famous &quot;first click&quot;:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    b_login.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span>{
        Pyramid.user.name = tf_name.value;

        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> xhr = Titanium.Network.createHTTPClient();

        xhr.open(<span class="hljs-string">"POST"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"http://noscuidamos.com/login_form"</span>);
        xhr.onload = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
            <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> cookie = xhr.getResponseHeader(<span class="hljs-string">'Set-Cookie'</span>);

            <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (cookie == <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>) {
                alert(<span class="hljs-string">"Error on login"</span>);
            } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
                Pyramid.user.age = <span class="hljs-string">'adult'</span>;
                Pyramid.calculate(Pyramid.user.name);
                Pyramid.meal.refreshMealSelector();
                Pyramid.t_meals.open(Pyramid.w_day_selection_wrapper);
                tg_app.open();
            }
        };

        xhr.onerror = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{
            alert(<span class="hljs-string">"Error de connexión. ¿Está conectado a Internet?"</span>);
        };

        xhr.setRequestHeader(<span class="hljs-string">"content-type"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8"</span>);
        xhr.send(<span class="hljs-string">'__ac_name='</span> + tf_name.value +<span class="hljs-string">'&amp;__ac_password='</span> + tf_passwd.value + <span class="hljs-string">'&amp;form.submitted=1'</span>);
    });
</code></pre><p>So, when you click on this button your username and password are sent to a server, and if the authentication was successful, among other things two functions are called: Pyramid.calculate, which makes a variety of things among which reads contents from database, updates global objects&#39; values and finally calls other functions which update the contents (views) of several, previously created windows; and Pyramid.meal.refreshMealSelector which also updates the contents of a window, in this case replaces the views of a previously created scrollableView by newly created views. After all that, the proper window and tab group will be opened.</p>
<p>Maybe the pertinent question would be: what are the things that Titanium memory management handles worst, to try to avoid them?</p>

							<div><p>I just have realized two things:</p>
<p>1) The app always crashes 12 seconds after booting, no matter what you do.</p>
<p>2) This addEventListener has no effect, neither the one that is applied to the button next to this button. These buttons &quot;can&quot; be clicked in the sense that you&#39;ll see their &quot;backgroundSelectedImage&quot; when you click upon them, but their respectively assigned actions won&#39;t be triggered (I tried having only a simple &quot;alert&quot; in the addEventListener and it didn&#39;t work either) and the app will crash just because of the reason stated above.</p>

							<div><p>Joan,</p>
<p>Could you review the crash logs on the device again and see what the stack trace for the crashed thread looks like.</p>
<p>Look for <em>Thread # Crashed:</em> and post it here (please put it in a code block)</p>

							<div><p>Looking at your crash log the problem is (I&#39;ve had this) the symbols aren&#39;t being resolved so its just a bunch of memory addresses… if you get the symbols resolved you can have a few more clues as to what function is causing the exception. If you open it up in xcode organiser it should be able to resolve symbols (just google this stuff…)</p>
<p>Note that it&#39;ll likely just be a bunch of internal Ti&#x2F;Kroll (the bridge) functions but might be a clue.</p>
<p>Also, you can build it in Titanium, then go in the projects build&#x2F;iphone directory and open up the xcodeproject and then build&#x2F;run on the device so when it crashes it should crash into the XCode debugger.</p>
<p>Might also help a bit.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve spent countless hours chasing various quirks with Ti and it can be veeeeeeery frustrating.. </p>
<p>Usually its just eliminating files until things work, then digging through and eliminating functions…</p>

							<p>I managed to reduce the crashes somewhat with these two changes:</p>
<p>1) Add a view to an array in two steps, first create the view and then add it.</p>
<p>Instead of:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var views_days = [];
<span class="hljs-comment">(...)</span>
for<span class="hljs-comment">(var i = 7; i &gt;= 0; i--)</span> {
    views_days.push<span class="hljs-comment">(Ti.UI.createView()</span>);
}
</code></pre><p>do:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var views_days = [];
<span class="hljs-comment">(...)</span>
for<span class="hljs-comment">(var i = 7; i &gt;= 0; i--)</span> {
    var v = Ti.UI.createView<span class="hljs-comment">()</span>;
    views_days.push<span class="hljs-comment">(v)</span>;
}
</code></pre><p>2) Pass a &quot;plain&quot; variable instead of one nested into another object as a parameter to a function.</p>
<p>Instead of:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">Pyramid</span>.w_day_selection_wrapper = Ti.UI.createWindow(<span class="hljs-list">{ (...) }</span>);
(...)
<span class="hljs-keyword">Pyramid</span>.day_selection(<span class="hljs-keyword">Pyramid</span>.w_day_selection_wrapper, views_days, <span class="hljs-string">'meal'</span>);
</code></pre><p>do:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in">var</span> w_day_selection_wrapper = Ti<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>UI<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>createWindow({ (<span class="hljs-attribute">...</span>) });
(<span class="hljs-attribute">...</span>)
Pyramid<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>day_selection(w_day_selection_wrapper, views_days, <span class="hljs-string">'meal'</span>);
</code></pre><p>Only after having applied these two changes I could make that little progress. Either of them alone would do nothing.</p>
<p>I am using a number of Javascript values, functions and also Titanium objects stored as properties of other JavaScript objects, mainly because I need to call functions between different files, thus I use a global object called Pyramid into which I store these objects. This also works as a namespace for my app, and facilitates my understanding of it. For example, Pyramid.user.name stores the username of the current user and Pyramid.user.age stores her age. Sometimes I think that reducing the use of these nested variables would be more safe, but until now I have not been able to prove that. Maybe someone has an opinion about this? (Or about anything else…)</p>
