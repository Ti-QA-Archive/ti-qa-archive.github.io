			<h1>touchmove/touchcancel problem on Android - touchcancel is firing too soon</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>On Android, touchmove is being interrupted by touchcancel. Also, once the touchcancel event has fired, the touchend event never gets fired either (which is the correct behavior - assuming the touch cancel event is being fired correctly).</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that iOS also fires the touchcancel event prematurely (you can test this by updating a label when the touchcancel event fires), however, it seems iOS is clever enough to realise that the user is still &quot;touchmoving&quot; on the screen and it keeps firing the touchmove event regardless of whether or not the touchcancel event was fired. It seems to me that this is actually a bug, but thanks to this bug, it works on iOS.</p>
<p>I&#39;m using Ti Studio with SDK version 2.1.3.GA</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tested this on both the V8 and Rhino Android Runtimes (as seen in the tiapp.xml editor)</p>
<p>I must say, this is really disappointing. One would think that for touch enabled devices, getting the touchmove&#x2F;touchcancel events working properly would be one of the core issues to deal with?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also tried the TiDraggable module (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pec1985&#x2F;TiDraggable&#x2F;), however, the behavior is identical.</p>

							<p>Got it! The object I&#39;m trying to move was inside a ScrollView object … so both objects were fighting over the touch events.</p>
<p>I moved my object to a regular View object and it is now working as expected …</p>
