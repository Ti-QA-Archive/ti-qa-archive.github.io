							<div><p>Sounds like you have question that need answers - so why have you created a pointless topic that serves no goal and certinaly does not help you gain answers as you failed to provide any relevant questions.</p>
<p>BTW posting a questions like &quot;does the thing YOU use suck&quot; - is unlikely to get loads of people saying yes - otherwise they would not be using it.</p>
<p>If you do not like it, go somewhere else and try something else, if you want to give it a fair shake rather than than giving up because you cannot solve something - then do that.</p>
<p>Have fun or don&#39;t - but this was pointless.</p>

							<div><p>I just started answering some of these based on your actual questions - but now given up as having answered a couple based on what you said in the questions - you come back and tell me you have not done what you said.  You have also not provided much if any code, when you do - the code is limited and does not contain things that appear dependent.</p>
<p>Not sure what help you are after or if you are just wanting to argue.</p>
