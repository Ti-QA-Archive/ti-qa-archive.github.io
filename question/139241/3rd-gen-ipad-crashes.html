			<h1>3rd Gen iPad crashes</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a Titanium app that I&#39;m sorry I ever built.  Doesn&#39;t load on an iPad 1 just splash screen and crashes.  Works on an iPad 2.  Now with an iPad 3rd gen works like a 1.  Splash screen loads, sits a while, and then crashes.  Rarely it opens up.  Does anyone know what causes this or how to troubleshoot?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>You must be doing something funny there that eats all the memory on the device.</p>
<p>Mostly I suppose you load a bunch of resources (images) that maybe can be deferred.</p>

										<p><p>yes, but the ipad 3 still decodes the image for retina.</p>
<p>when the image loads into memory is decoded from the format you are having (jpg,png etc) in a raw image, with 4 bytes per pixel (rgb+alpha).</p>
<p>it doesn&#39;t matter that u have a jpg or png or whatever, the result will be te same.<br>so a complete black jpg image with 100x100px will have the file size of few kilos or less while in the memory will have 100x100x4 = 40k. </p>
<p>For the ipad 3 where a pixel has 2 dips ( so x4) the image will have 160k.</p>
<p>Makes more sense?</p>

										<p><p>Wow would have never imagined.  Since I had a vendor build this application, going to have to figure out how to fix it as they will charge me a fortune to evaluate the problem since they are not the most technical group (more marketing than technical).</p>

										<p><p>Doing some more research I am not sure I&#39;m agreeing here.  I did something different.  Normally when I create an IPA I right click on resources and Select Publish and then Ad-Hoc&#x2F;Enterprise.  As that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing for my company.  It generates the IPA and well we are here with the problems.  I today tried selecting the Apple iTunes Store option.  That took my same Enterprise cert info however opened me up in the xCode Organizer.  From there I said to distribute for Enterprise.  Picked my end cert and out came an IPA.  The resulting file doesn&#39;t crash or crashes every time on first open and then works on the second one.  Like clockwork.  As a matter of fact, first time I did this it opened flawless each time and then eventually was on the second attempt.  Looks to me like there is more of an issue with the signing process in Titanium but could be wrong.</p>

							<p>Here&#39;s the answer.  I&#39;m )(#@<em>$%@)(#</em>$)@.  Probably get fired over this.  I have physically removed every single image from the application and when it launches I still get a memory warning and dies.  This is a Titanium problem and I might as well walk out the door from my company as I recommended we give it a try.  Thanks a bunch.</p>
