		<section>
			<p>What is a method of actually learning to use titanium?</p>
<p>The API references show all the common functions- but where would you go to figure out what the parameters are?</p>
<p>For instance, just trying to open a &quot;select file&quot; dialog- the function to do so from the API is:</p>
<p>Titanium.UI.UserWindow.openFileChooserDialog(callback, options);</p>
<p>(first question)<br>How the heck do you figure out what parameters &#39;options&#39; takes???</p>
<p>I downloaded the source code for titanium, and found the function there, but it seems to be out of date (2008), with different parameters.</p>
<p>(second question)<br>Is there a &quot;kitchen sink&quot; for the desktop? Kitchensink on android doesn&#39;t install for the emulator, and crashes on my actual device upon opening….</p>

							<p>Three weeks ago I had no clue how to use Titanium.  But since then I&#39;ve gone from &quot;Hello World&quot; to a finished app and it has been a huge learning process.  I&#39;m a video guy, not a programmer, but I was able to get it figured out.  I did that mostly by using the Kitchen Sink examples and spending a lot of time in here, searching and reading.</p>
<p>If you are programming for your device or desktop, I&#39;m not sure how much help the source code for Titanium will be.  For me, that would just confuse me.  I do have more problems with the Android emulator than I do the iPhone, but I&#39;ve found that the less I have running in the background the better.  </p>

										<p><p>What have you used as resources for figuring out how to use the titanium API function parameters, or have you had to use them yet?</p>
<p>I normally program in actionscript3, javascript and c++, so coding issues aren&#39;t the problem for me - </p>
<p>It&#39;s just discovering a resource for using the Titanium API (beyond the API reference which is less helpful than the dated source code so far)</p>

										<p><p>I just decided to stick to Adobe AIR.<br>Much faster to get started with, and a lot more tutorials.<br>Titanium looked promising, but couldn&#39;t get it to actually work… which is a big advantage to air. </p>
<p>You can also develop air apps for free, but hopefully you can also deploy to mobile phones soon. </p>
<p>Titanium looks interesting, but will they ever have more documentation in the future?</p>
