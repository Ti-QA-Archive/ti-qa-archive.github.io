			<h1>TiStudio Project References and Ti.include</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Does anyone know whether the project reference ability in TiStudio works for mobile projects?</p>
<p>I want to create a library of js code in a blank project and then use the project reference facility in other projects to access the js files&#x2F;functionality in the &#39;library&#39;. </p>
<p>I have given it a try but when using a Ti.include there seems to be no way of referring to the code in the referenced project.  </p>
<p>At the moment I am assuming that actually this is not possible due to the way Ti.include works, but wondered if anyone had any suggestions? i.e. is this the right approach or should I really be looking at using&#x2F;creating a js module?</p>

							<div><p>I&#39;d really like to hear what exactly the &#39;project references&#39; sets up. I&#39;d like to use a couple of external libraries (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Third-party+Tools#Third-partyTools-Framework) but can&#39;t find any doco or example regarding doing so.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve imported the projects into my workspace, but now what? If I set my project to reference one of these third party utility projects (via the Project Properties-&gt;Project References tab), what does that mean? Does it make Ti.include search those projects? What syntax is required for that to work?</p>

										<p><p>currently javascript with some Titanium API calls, which is why I wondered if I could use the project references. I am assuming that if I created it as native js module I can only use pure js and not reference the Titanium API?</p>

										<p><p>why not? can&#39;t you create a set of js&#x2F;titanium class and then include in your project with Ti.include?</p>

										<p><p>That is not the problem and is fine for a single project. But to share a js code repository is not possible unless you put the code into each project (at least I have not found a way), which again is fine but not ideal when you want to use the same code library in multiple projects.</p>
<p>A simple example would be a custom code library that has an SHA1 encryption function in it written in js. I don&#39;t really want to put a copy of the same library into multiple projects, it would be far better to share it from just one source file but Ti.include seems to only be able to reference files within the current project workspace and not a referenced project.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, Ti.include is not a solution in your case.. I&#39;m not sure if there is a way to create a custom module in pure js</p>

							<p>A workaround is that Ti.include accepts any path, not just &quot;current project&quot; :)</p>
<p>Too include (relative to current project) a js file from a subfolder in a different project, i would write: Ti.include(&#39;..&#x2F;..&#x2F;PROJECT_X_COMMON&#x2F;src&#x2F;xxxx.js&#39;);</p>

							<p>Sorry, but the above only works on IOS and not on Android.<br>I wonder why there is a difference in the implementation…</p>
