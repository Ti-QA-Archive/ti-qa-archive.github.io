			<h1>Google Play - App not showing up for my device</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I can see my app if search http:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.ggogle.com but if I use the Google Play App to search, My app doesn&#39;t show up.  I only loaded the app a couple hours ago by the way but it does show up on the web.</p>
<p>My device is a Droid x2 and as you can see by the pic here, it is supported</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;s1283.photobucket.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;djonesax&#x2F;library&#x2F;androidApp?sort=3&amp;page=1</p>
<p>I have checked many things but dont see why this isnt showing up to install to the device.  Any ideas or is it still a matter of time?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>David</p>

							<div><p>I was able to get it to open in google play by opening it from the web on the device and then it prompted me to open it with the google play app.  I did and it said that the app was not compatible with my device but I dont know how to find out why… I have tested the app on this same device and it works perfectly so why would Google Play not think so?</p>

<p>which Mobile SDK Version are you using? I remember an old bug where they left out a ton of android devices because of an error with configuration of the apk.</p>
<p>Best,</p>

							<div><p>I started with 3.1.0.G.A but dropped it down to 3.0.1.G.A to see if that helped.  I was able to determine that this device was not able to install many other apps as well,  that needed the same permissions as mine.  The phone is old and running 2.3 which shouldn&#39;t be an issue because I coded it for 2.2.  It also has no service so I thought maybe that was an issue.  Anyway, I started calling everyone I knew with an Android phone and so far it installs and works on all of them except for my test device so I dont think I am going to worry about it.  The supported devices on the APK tab says 2820 devices, does that sound right?</p>
