			<h1>PayPal module support (Adaptive Payments in particular)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am trying to figure out who is responsible for developing and supporting the PayPal module? I have posted questions on the module&#39;s questions page but no-one seems to be looking at those (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;780?1253383706#questions).</p>
<p>The biggest problem I have with the PayPal module is the lack of support for various Adaptive Payment features such as delaying payments and specifying who is the fee payer in a chained transaction.</p>
<p>Regards.</p>
<p>Titanium SDK: 2.1x</p>

							<div><p>Nik - I have huge problems with the PayPal module for iOS, including some item totals don&#39;t seem to work whereas others do, a problem where running on a device PAYPAL_ENV_SANDBOX throws a server error (on the Simulator it does not) and the latest is trying to get the thing to update the values if a user changes their mind and adds or deletes and item. I know the PayPal button has to be recreated each time and am doing so, and also sending it the new values. But when shown in the &#39;My Total&#39; box once the button has been clicked we see the previous values! Only restarting app will sort this out - which is no good!</p>
<p>Anyway for the first of these I contacted Marketplace support at Marketplace marketplace-support@appcelerator.com and did get a reply. The result being a JIRA ticket - whether anything will be fixed on what is now a free module we will have to see!</p>

							<div><p>I found that the problem with prices not being updated correctly here seemed to be caused by the PayPal button being appended directly to a table cell. When wrapped in a plain old view and the view appended to the table cell this issue goes away. Probably due to the way iOS reused table rows and caches items.</p>
