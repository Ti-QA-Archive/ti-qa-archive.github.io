			<h1>iOS XHR Duplicate Requests - iOS 4?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am getting a significant percentage of duplicate XHR requests under iOS 4.3.5.</p>
<p>I am aware of the iOS Bug <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-6016">TIMOB-6016</a>, which dealt with duplicate xhr requests and it was supposedly limited to iOS 5. However I am experiencing a lof of this under iOS 4, even with the &quot;fix&quot; for the issue within the Titanium SDK I am using as well as the most recent continuous build.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a major issue for me, as customers are doing actions such as cancelling  appointments and get error messages because the first request cancelled it, the second then didn&#39;t have anything to cancel.</p>
<p>Any suggestions or things I can try? I doubt it matters but I am using XCode 3 and building with the iOS 4.3 SDK.</p>

							<p>Can you post your code. But to give you a potential lead… If you are creating a http request each request has to be created into a unique variable as the connection is asynchronous and stays open until finished.</p>
<p>So if you create a second connection it actually uses the first one. then they requests can get themselves confused.</p>
<p>I use a common routine and hit this issue, I simple just used a array and passed it a unique number, clearing out the array element when the request was finished.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>T…</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the response Trevor, I&#39;m using a common routine like you had, but it is wrapped in a function so calling it should produce a new instance of the variable each time, thus I do not see why I would need an array.</p>
<p>This used to be working previously, but in recent weeks has had issues.</p>
<p>Please offer your expertise. Thank you! </p>

										<p><p>no it doesn&#39;t create a new function I did exactly the same and had similar issues. you need to create it into a different variable. I simply set a variable which incremented and passed it into the function so then had xhr[incount] = http request then after the processing finished or failed xhr[icount] = null… then used that array element through the whole module.</p>
<p>I hope I have explained this ok..</p>

										<p><p>Thanks again, your explanation is clear enough. I just have a hard time believing it is reusing the same variable….if so, Titanium really has scope issues since instance variables from different requests to a function shouldn&#39;t be accessible let alone re-used.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, your suggestion is clear, easy and worth a shot so I went ahead and coded it up and have sent this to our tester. Sadly, they are off the rest of the day so I won&#39;t know until tomorrow if it is any better for them.</p>
<p>The issue itself is particularly confusing as it had been working great for 11+ months and we weren&#39;t having issues on iOS 5 (with the Titanium Fix used), just iOS 4.</p>
<p>Anyways, thanks and I&#39;ll update you if your &quot;work around&quot; fixes our issue.</p>

										<p><p>After extensive testing, it actually appears like the arrays made the situation worse. Kind of confusing. </p>
<p>Another thing I tried, as this only seems to be an issue on our iOS 4.3.5 testing, don&#39;t apply the new <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_mobile&#x2F;commit&#x2F;4d22d9340b59449269785dc4cb86176b3fec7af1#diff-0">iOS 5 fix</a> for the iOS 4 clients. However that didn&#39;t seem to improve anything.</p>
<p>Do you have any ideas of anything else I could try?</p>

							<p>After testing, the thing that so far seems to work best is to use the undocumented <strong>enableKeepAlive</strong> property of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium_mobile&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;Classes&#x2F;TiNetworkHTTPClientProxy.m#L394">httpClient</a>. Set the value to <strong>false</strong> and it <em>still happens</em> but significantly less (at least in testing).</p>
<p>Thanks for all the suggestions, I&#39;m hopeful someone comes up with something better (or Titanium gets around to ditching ASIHTTPRequest now that it has been abandoned). This is a significant issue and while not every device has the issue, we do have lots of customers experiencing it. Perhaps it also has something to do with limited network connectivity at the time?</p>
