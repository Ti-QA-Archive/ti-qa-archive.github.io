							<p>Not that I don&#39;t want to help or maybe I&#39;m missing something here.</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t know which questions to ask for selecting a titanium Developer, <strong>how are you supposed to validate his answers</strong>?</p>
<p>I mean, we could give you some broad questions, but what if the answers are not <strong>100% similar to the answers we gave you</strong>? That won&#39;t necessarily mean that the developer is not fit for the job.</p>
<p>My best advice to you would be to ask the candidates to show some sort of <em>portfolio</em>. That way, you can assess his capacity as a developer based on application he already developed.</p>

										<p><p>Well, in that case, if you are the one being interviewed. And <em>(I assume)</em> you are familiar with Titanium. You should be able to answer most of the questions.</p>
<p>You can always take a refresh watching the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeopro.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;building-native-mobile-applications">Building Native Mobile Applications with Titanium</a> video series. If you watch them all, you should cover a lot of ground.</p>

										<p><p>4 rounds? What is this Nasa?<br>One project to complete? </p>
<p>Sorry to say but the guys that are asking a project to be done in a interview are not really sane, or they are jackasses. I wouldn&#39;t even consider working for somebody like this, no matter who they are. Just my 2c :)</p>

										<p><p>Yeah, I missed the part where you had to finish a project (for free) during the interview process.</p>
<p>Seems to me these guys want people do write code for free. Baiting you with a job opportunity that may or may not even exist.</p>
