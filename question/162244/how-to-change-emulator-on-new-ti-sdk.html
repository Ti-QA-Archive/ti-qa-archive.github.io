			<h1>How to change Emulator on new Ti SDK</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am using latest Ti Studio (3.2.0.2…) with Ti SDK 3.2.0.GA and trying to run my App on Android Emulators (platform 4.4.2 , API level 19) the same dimensions and dpi as Galaxy S2 and S3 (if S2 is not supported then I am ok with S3 and S4).</p>
<p>When I first clicked run with android, it opened a WVGA800 Emulator so since it is not what I need I had to find a way to change it. I opened the preferences and opened the AVD Edit. I changed it to XVGA854 (S2) and WXGA720 (S3) but the Emulator starts (most of the times at least) and the App fails to install or sometimes it says that it is installed and it is trying to run, but it doesn&#39;t show on the Emulator.</p>
<p>I have been trying all day to run it on S3&#39;s dimensions and dpi but it didn&#39;t work. Am I doing something wrong? Back to the older Ti SDK versions I could change the skin and the API level from outside the AVD manager. This way I didn&#39;t have to Edit AVD&#39;s since the basic ones were preloaded and worked.</p>
<p>Please, assist me, as I have an official project to complete and the deadlines are giving me much pressure.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Not an answer to your specific problem but more an answer for long time benefits.</p>
<p>I gave up on the whole emulator thing a while ago - you should now be looking to use the GenyMotion solution.</p>
