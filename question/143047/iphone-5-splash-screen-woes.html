			<h1>iPhone 5 Splash Screen Woes</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Ok, I know the new iPhone screen size requires the presence of Default-568h@2x.png in Resources&#x2F;iphone in order to trigger the app to be full screen. I have that, and can confirm that my app does, indeed, work at full screen on a new iPhone 5. But I am having a bit of a time getting the actual splash screen to work properly. It appears that as the app is loading, the old (Default@2x.png) splash screen is displayed, but stretched to fit the taller screen of the iPhone 5. I know this has been brought up, but according to JIRA (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-11150">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-11150</a>) this has been fixed. It looks like that fix was just in TiRootViewController.m, which I can confirm that once the app loads and that root view controller initializes the correct splash screen is used. It&#39;s just that ~1 second before that view controller loads that is still using the old splash screen (at the OS level and not in Ti, at least that&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking).</p>
<p>So, has anyone else seen that and been able to get past it? I&#39;ve been working on this for around a solid day now and haven&#39;t been able to get it working yet. It&#39;s killing me that obviously Xcode know the Default-568h@2x.png file is there, otherwise the app wouldn&#39;t fill an iPhone 5 screen. But it still uses the old splash screen anyway. I&#39;m using build 2.1.3.v20120927181611 which came after the JIRA ticket fix. Any pointers would be greatly appreciated!</p>

							<p>It appears that it may just be a simulator bug. We had a little miscommunication regarding one of our test devices and I think everything is good. So disregard this question. Everything appears to be working correctly.</p>
