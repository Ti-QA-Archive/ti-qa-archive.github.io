			<h1>Problem Running App on Device</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve just purchased a new Mac Book Pro and I&#39;ve been testing my latest app built with Titanium 1.2.2, Mobile SDK 1.6.2, I&#39;ve had no problems testing in the simulator. </p>
<p>This morning when trying to load onto a device I get the following error:</p>
<p> [BEROR]Code Sign error: The identity &#39;iPhone Developer: xxxxxxxxxxxx (xxxxxxxxx)&#39; doesn&#39;t match any valid certificate&#x2F;private key pair in the default keychain</p>
<p>I&#39;ve downloaded all certificates and provisioning profiles, so I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going on. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve also deleted my build and recompiled again but to no availl.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>Regards,<br>Stephen</p>

							<p>When you plug in your device in Xcode, it should show up in the organizer, and you can tell it to use that device for development.</p>
<p>Also, have you gone into the Apple Provisioning section, added your device, etc?</p>

										<p><p>Are you using provisioning profiles from an old mac?  I had this problem when I upgraded, basically I had to do the Keychain Assistant thing that it tells you to on Apple&#39;s site when you generate a new certificate.  Had to go through the whole process, recreating the profiles (you can do a Modify on Apple&#39;s site and choose your new certificate that you upload), and redownload the new ones.</p>

							<p>the problem lies in the certificates&#x2F;AppIds or profiles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have an Development certificate</li>
<li>Make sure You have an valid AppId and your project AppId in titanium matches this ID</li>
<li>Make sure you have added the provision profile to your Xcode by double clicking it</li>
<li>The keys can be a bit difficult at first, but this must be set right to.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line this is Apples fault for making the process so damm complicated for beginners. ( i was struggeling to at first! )<br>Read the documents at apple correctly on how to create everything, follow everystep exactly an it should work ;)</p>
