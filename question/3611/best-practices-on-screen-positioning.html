			<h1>Best practices on screen positioning?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi All-</p>
<p>I recently discovered Titanium and have been incredibly impressed with the functionality I&#39;ve played with so far in developing mobile apps - much much much easier than developing using the iPhone and Android SDKs, and the development paradigm is just so natural coming from the web world.</p>
<p>I have been wondering how layout is supposed to be handled, however. So far I&#39;ve played around with positioning elements in what seems like CSS absolute positioning (left, top, width, height, etc.). This looks pretty good in the iphone emulator, but I&#39;m concerned how this is going to look in the various screen sizes that Android has - are the coordinates absolute positions, or am I misunderstanding the concept? </p>
<p>An example of how this would come into play: I&#39;d like to design a simple layout that looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>top image</li>
<li>Scrollable content area with lots of text</li>
<li>OK button</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea is that the scrollable content area can scroll as much as the user wants but the OK button will always remain visible at the bottom of the screen. I laid this out using top values: 10, 50, and 410, and this looks great on the iphone emulator. But what will happen on Android screens of variable sizes - will I have a bunch of extra whitespace at the bottom of the screen on, say, a Droid?</p>
<p>What are best practices for these layouts?</p>
<p>thanks!</p>
<p>-simon</p>

							<p>Hi Simon,</p>
<p>Where possible I try to use percentages. For example I have a background element that is always 40% of the screen ( height:&#39;40%&#39; ). This seems to work well for simple elements. </p>
<p>Please note you will want to listen for orientation change events and re-set your height&#x2F;width percentages on that change event.</p>
<p>The other catch is you will still need to account for some of the Android edge cases.  I&#39;ve found it works ok on the Droid but, most likely smaller screens could result in overlapping.</p>

							<p>You may also want to try to use the &quot;layout: vertical&quot; property to many of the view constructors and &quot;height: auto&quot; property on many content widget constructors.  Check out the kitchen sink for some examples on their use, since the documentation is a little sparse on them still.</p>

							<p>@Ben -</p>
<p>Thanks for the tips on using percentages - I hadn&#39;t seen those in the examples in Kitchen Sink, so I&#39;ll take a look for that.</p>
<p>@Allen-</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried to use height: &#39;auto&#39; a number of times, but I&#39;ve found it&#39;s a little inconsistent. For example, when I tried height: &#39;auto&#39; for a View inside a ScrollView I found the view did not display the entire text. Thanks for the tip on layout: &#39;vertical&#39;, I haven&#39;t come across that one yet!</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<p>-simon</p>
