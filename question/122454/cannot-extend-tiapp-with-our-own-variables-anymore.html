			<h1>Cannot extend Ti.App with our own variables anymore?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have used the Global context and appended variables onto Ti.App to keep simple properties available throughout my app. I understand they are not thread safe, as such I never change them.</p>
<p>In addition to the changes in 1.7.0, I ran across some comments in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;122275&#x2F;global-variable---again#212575">this question about passing variables</a> that leads me to believe Titanium is going to change something in the future that will cause my applications to break. I would appreciate some clarification from Appcelerator, what changes are coming and how is that going to stop Ti.App extension entirely?</p>
<p>I’m sure other developers are using this and while I understand extending Ti.App has never been recommended per say, without it we are forced to load &amp; reload data on every single window. It’s kind of wasteful and bad for performance. In native iOS development, you can add small things to the AppDelegate and have them available everywhere. I don’t understand why Titanium does not support such a simple concept as global or static classes. Particularly when each window is a new context having a static context available for some common functions would be ideal.</p>
<p>Basically, I want to know if I have to rewrite my entire app, when I will be forced to, and why.</p>

										<p><p>Aaron, while your answer is in line with what I have seen and does what it does well, I feel it doesn&#39;t quite meet the needs of the question asker.</p>
<p>Your global scope is &quot;global&quot; but the only way you can get at it in sub-contexts is through events. Ti.App allowed you direct access to variables&#x2F;functions through any window in a synchronous matter (though perhaps not thread safe).</p>
<p>In order to emulate Ti.App functionality, you have pass namespaces by attaching them to newly created windows, though if the namespace included any functions <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-4618">this is no longer recommended</a>. Also, this of course is not pass by reference, so if your namespace was big there is perhaps a performance penalty of re-evaluating it on every page.</p>
<p>I feel Titanium should have some kind of static class we could extend. It seems kind of bad style to reload namespaces that don&#39;t change on every page. As the question asker commented in native iOS you could always extend the AppDelegate.</p>
<p>Do you have any experience&#x2F;workarounds that are more similar to the Ti.App model?</p>

										<p><p>mike, it meets the needs if there is a complete understanding of how to use namespaces in an application</p>
<p>if you structure your app as directed in the Appcelerator Training, you will see that your entire application is within the global scope you have created and there is no need to pass anything around.</p>
<p>I would suggest you review the documentation on the wiki and take a look at the TiBountyHunter Application.<br><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;td&#x2F;TCAD+Course+Labs">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;td&#x2F;TCAD+Course+Labs</a></p>

										<p><p>Aaron, I was unable to add my comments onto your blog for whatever reason. I understand how some projects are all somewhat global, such as your example.</p>
<p>My problems lie in what happens when you have to use the &#39;url&#39; property to create a new window. This forces it all to be within the new context and you get myglobalscope is undefined errors.</p>
<p>Can you recommend changes to: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;1081029">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;1081029</a> that maintains the URL window.</p>

										<p><p>Aaron, doesn&#39;t your example require the use of a single context with other *.js files included, as opposed to multiple contexts via the url property of new windows?</p>
<p>As I understand the original poster (Vinh) and Mike, the question is how best to retrofit non-trivial existing apps which did this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple contexts using url property on createWindow</li>
<li>Insert one or more custom properties or namespaces in Ti.App</li>
</ul>
<p>If the namespace does not include any functions, then as Mike points out, one option is to pass the namespace as a property attached to each newly created window.  As he also points out, if there are any functions in the namespace then this is not supported from 1.7.x onward.  Even without functions though, his concern is both performance and the fact it is not pass by reference.</p>
<p>So I think the $64 question here is retrofitting existing complex applications, and whether the use of multiple contexts has just become a paradigm which is less versatile than in the past.</p>

										<p><p>@aaron I completely understand and agree what Doug said. It is exactly what I am trying to get across. Stated simply, I have an older app which opens windows from windows from windows all using the url parameter of createWindow which creates a new context. There are tons of windows, think of the KitchenSink.</p>
<p>Your new example lacks the use of a URL parameter on a single window (it looks like you accidentally kept the tab group there as well). The tab groups was not my confusion. I am saying I start with a Ti.UI.createWindow({url: and used to use Ti.App to have common data. It would be a major pain to rewrite my application, but it looks like that is what I am going to have to do.</p>
<p>However, currently I think I would best be served with an example of opening a window, from a window, from a window. Moving to the single context I have some confusion of how to structure this while maintaining access to the global scope.</p>

										<p><p>@mike we have hijacked the original question and I think your answer is beyond the scope of a simple forum response; contact me through devlink and I think i can give you a simple answer.</p>
<p>bottom line is the example i provided is a simplified version of what is taught in training and how Tweetanium was built. It can be utilized to meet your needs, but I would hardly recommend someone completely rewrite an app at this time to address this issue.</p>

							<p>Aaron, actually, I think instead of hijacking the original question, we are finally trying to answer the original question.  This is what Vihn was asking all along, then Mike joined the chorus.  Or at least that is how I took the original question.</p>
<p>A complete paradigm shift away from using separate contexts seems to be not only what is being recommended, but close to mandated if it will be the only way we can use proper namespaces now.</p>
<p>All fine and well for new projects.  The question all along has been the impact on existing complex projects, and the best way to make the transition.</p>

										<p><p>@Doug my apologies, I have taken the discussion offline with Mike because I personally believe it is not a one size fits all answer, maybe it is maybe it isn&#39;t but understanding the specific capabilities of an individual and or organization, the problems they have and the requirements of the application and what they are putting in the namespace all play into finding the right answer… that was all i was trying to say.</p>

										<p><p>Fair enough.  I misinterpreted the previous hijacking comment.  Be that as it may, I think the original question remains valid.  The fact there may not be a one size fits all answer just helps confirm this paradigm shift may be very non-trivial for those with complex projects using the paradigm described.</p>
