							<p>Please post the code which is failing. I don&#39;t think it would be even worth a guess as to what is happening.</p>
<p>Also please post what platform etc. Look at the notes on how to post to the forum. We need info to be able to help.</p>

										<p><p>Antonio</p>
<p>Again from the info you have provided its very difficult to get an answer. How is the window being called, when is the textfield being added to the window is it part of a different view, what platform are you running this on. Where are you adding the text etc etc etc</p>
<p>Minimal info really is not possible to diagnose the issue.</p>
<p>This is not a common problem and is probably an issue with the code, but please if you would like it looked at we do need the information to be able to diagnose the problem.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for the info, but again you have missed the point. The only answer I can give you is that you have something wrong with your code.</p>
<p>Without seeing the textfield in relation to the other code It is impossible to go any further. I really would have liked to be able to help as this is a Q &amp; A forum where people provide their knowledge and help resolve issues. But if the person isn&#39;t prepared to provide the information needed then we can&#39;t really help out.</p>
<p>My guess would be that you have another object within the same space and the zindex is putting in front of the textfield, but being honest I have no idea.</p>
