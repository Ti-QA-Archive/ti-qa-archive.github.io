		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Does anyone know if on 1.8 RC1 (AKA 1.8.0.1) require saves the module it loads in memory or is there still a need to use monkey patch?</p>
<p>Also, if I have a commonJS (lets call it test.js) like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">exports.Test = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-comment">// some things to do</span>
};
</code></pre><p>and I want to create a new object of it…</p>
<p>on android I need to write this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> testClass = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'/commonJS/test'</span>).Test;
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> obj = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> testClass();
</code></pre><p>on iPhone I need to write this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> testClass = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'/commonJS/test'</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> obj = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> testClass();
</code></pre><p>what works on iPhone doesn&#39;t work on android and the opposite. why is that?<br>and it seems that if I use monkey patch it works the same way (the iPhone way).</p>
<p>My problem here with it is that if I need to require a commonJS module from within a different module I need to re-include the monkey patch (because now modules actually do run in their own context).</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>Basically, iPhone got it wrong. Monkey patch is actually also wrong (so that leaves Android implementation as the right one - finally Android got something right). :)</p>
<p>&quot;exports&quot; is an empty object ({}) which &quot;require&quot; function will return, so if you add &quot;Test&quot; property to that object, &quot;require&quot; function call will return:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-rules">{ <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">Test</span>:<span class="hljs-value"> <span class="hljs-function">function</span>() { do something </span></span></span>} }
</code></pre><p>That&#39;s why you need to use:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> testClass = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'/commonJS/test'</span>).Test;
</code></pre><p>to get function constructor that you need and that&#39;s obviously boring to write for every module.</p>
<p>You can read <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-5406">here</a> why is this implemented that way and what is other way to use function constructors in CommonJS module (monkey patch won&#39;t work in future because of global variables functionality in CommonJS&#39;s Titanium implementation :) ). Basically, you just need to use this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">//test.js</span>
<span class="hljs-built_in">module</span>.exports = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-comment">//do something</span>
};

<span class="hljs-comment">//app.js</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> test = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'test'</span>);
</code></pre>

										<p><p>&quot;finally Android got something right&quot; - couldn&#39;t agree more… :-)</p>
<p>so basically, because of the iPhone bug I need to do an if - so on iPhone I call the object one way (wrong way) and on android I call it the other way (the correct one). That&#39;s what monkey patch does for me right now - other than that I don&#39;t have any use for it (and yes, I do need to require it on each of my modules). I&#39;ll fix that once the iPhone bug is fixed…</p>
<p>do you know anything about if require saves the module it loads in memory?</p>
<p>lets say I&#39;ve required a module in app.js, and I require the same module inside a different module - does the call from the inside of the module loads the module from memory? or is it being re-evaluated?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>Monkey-patch will work until global variable bug will exist on iPhone. So, watch in JIRA for that bug.</p>
<p>Module is not re-evaluated every time it&#39;s &quot;require&quot;d, you can test that like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">//app.js</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> test1 = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'test'</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> test2 = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'test'</span>);

<span class="hljs-comment">//test.js</span>
Ti.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">'Module'</span>);
</code></pre><p>You should get just one record in console output.</p>
<p>Now, that could be good thing or bad thing … because, if someone changes your module, it will be reflected on all instances (modules are singletons in a way). Some people says that is a bad thing, most doesn&#39;t care. I think it&#39;s not so bad because there are workarounds to prevent that (ECMAScript 5 features can prevent object modifications).</p>

										<p><p>Yes, no more global variables, unfortunately. I had to put inclusion of my library in every module to get things work. It&#39;s against DRY principles. I really don&#39;t understand the paranoia about global variables usage, especially when it&#39;s OK to use global native objects like Array or Date, or global host objects like Titanium objects. This seems like half-baked solution to me.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#39;m not sure about iPhone, I think &quot;module&quot; is still not implemented, but should be soon. You could try to use &quot;exports&quot; directly, but it&#39;s against CommonJS standard to store anything directly to &quot;exports&quot; variable.</p>

										<p><p>I found another solution that makes it work on both - simply put (don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a bug or not) - don&#39;t name your export.MyFunc the same name as the module name.</p>

										<p><p>As long as it works for both iPhone and Android - it&#39;s fine for now (until fixed and then all I&#39;ll need to change is one line of code to adjust it).</p>
<p>I think it&#39;s better then writing workarounds… I think because we&#39;re using titanium to develop our apps, and it&#39;s something that relatively is still in it&#39;s first steps (even though it had come a long way since I&#39;ve been using it) - we need to do what works (it is cross platform, so we need to adjust ourselves sometime in order to enjoy this advantage.</p>

										<p><p>That&#39;s right! but better then waiting who knows how long until it&#39;s fixed…</p>
<p>I rather publish an app then have one written according to nature that sits on my drive waiting to be published.</p>
<p>When the time comes, I&#39;ll have to change a 1000 rows, like the time had come for me to get rid of my global NS.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, that is so if you pursue the profit. We all do in some way, but I strive for greater things. Code esthetic and good app design is what I love and what makes me happy. I try to write code that looks and runs good, and I hate to write &quot;good enough&quot; code that is full of ugly hacks (although, sometimes that is a &quot;must&quot;). :)</p>
