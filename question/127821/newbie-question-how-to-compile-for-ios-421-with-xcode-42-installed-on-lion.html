			<h1>Newbie Question: How to compile for iOS 4.2.1 with xCode 4.2 installed on Lion?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just started with the Titanium environment and installed xCode 4.2 last night (release version) from AppStore on my Mac 10.7 Lion. I successfully compiled the sample Kitchen Sink iPad and ran on my iPad2 natively. However, I would like to try that on my iPhone4 as well (with Kitchen Sink for iPhone version). My iPhone4 is running 4.2.1. When I tried to build it for the iOS device, I couldn&#39;t find how to change the target iOS to be 4.2.1, and the only option there is 5.0.</p>
<p>Do I have to download earlier version of the mobile sdk? I believe the one installed is version 1.7.5. Or is it because the xCode 4.2 prevent me from compiling for the 4.2.1 or 4.3 platforms?</p>
<p>I tried to google this but couldn&#39;t find an answer (may be wrong keywords)… Hope you can help me to find an answer…</p>
<p>Thanks a lot in advance…</p>
<p>Frederick</p>

							<p>You have to install iOS4 on your Mac OS first then when you can choose &quot;run on device&quot; in Ti Studio. After that, you will have the options to build it against 4.2 or 5.0.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. I am new to Apple&#39;s development platform, xCode as well as the Studio. I do not know how to install iOS 4 on my Mac. </p>
<p>I saw in the Development directory (after I installed xCode 4.2) under Platforms&#x2F;iPhoneOS.platform&#x2F;DeviceSupport has 4.2, 4.3 and 5.0, therefore I thought that I already have supported for iOS4? </p>
<p>Can you point me to where I can download iOS4 sdk and how to install it correctly? </p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

							<p>Hi Frederick</p>
<p>I must admit that I have only ever installed Xcode using the manual download method described in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Installing+and+Updating+iOS+SDK">Installing and Updating iOS SDK</a>, which provides all iOS versions, rather than the latest that come with the App Store version.</p>
<p>Do you get the Xcode Install Assistant with the App Store version? Have you tried starting it and updating?</p>
<p>I&#39;d be interested to know exactly which iOS versions come with the App Store version of Xcode, and whether more can be added. Try creating a new project in Xcode, by choosing File &gt; New Project &gt; navigation-based Application. What is in the list of Deployment Targets in the dropdown menu on the following screen?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. I think Apple do not allow you to manually download it anymore. I went to the developer page (followed the instructions from the installing and Updating iOS SDK) and the only option there is to launch the AppStore. When I clicked install xCode, it download a 1.8GB file to my application folder. I then need to run this app (called Install xCode) which is similar to the Xcode Install Assistant described in the instruction but different - it only allow you to accept the license and enter the password to install the xCode, there is no option for you to select &quot;Destination&quot; (I actually spent hours trying to find how I could move my Developer folder to another drive but I can&#39;t with this install app), no option for the Installation Type. Basically, you are forced to install the xCode in the Macintosh HD. Note that I never install xCode on my machine before. Therefore, I do not know how this &quot;Install xCode&quot; behavior if you have a previous version of xCode.</p>
<p>I will try to create a project in xCode and see what the options are in a moment… (sorry just woke up). I will let you know how it goes. </p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>I just tried. There is no Deployment Targets option when I create a new project. The only selection there is Device Family - options &quot;iPhone&quot;, &quot;iPad&quot;, and &quot;Universal&quot;.</p>
<p>Does it means xCode 4.2 do not allow you to create apps that are below iOS5.0?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Frederick</p>

<p>I still seem to have the option to download. See the screenshot below. Try browsing to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;devcenter&#x2F;ios&#x2F;index.action#downloads">iOS Dev Center - Downloads</a>.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>It is correct for Snow Leopard, not for Lion. If you click the link to download for Lion, it redirects you to another page, where it redirects you to the AppStore.</p>
<p>There is another option to download xCode3 but the page said it is not compatible with Lion. Therefore, if I am using Lion, I cannot develop apps for the 4.2 or 4.3?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>Stupid me… After I created the project using xCode 4.2 and re-open the project, it shows the &quot;Deployment Targets&quot; options and all versions are listed. I was wrong and that xCode 4.2 does include deployment targets of earlier iOS versions.</p>
<p>My question now is how I can change Ti Studio so that it can build against different deployment targets? I saw the option &quot;Select SDK version&quot; when I try to build for the iOS device (not simulator) but the only option there is 5.0. I must have missed something in configuration? Can you help me to configure Ti Studio correctly? Or point me to the documentation that shows me how to do it (I must have missed it after reading all docs for so long)?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>If you launch the simulator from Titanium Studio, and click on the simulator, there should be a menu option at the top named &quot;Hardware&quot; allowing you to select the Device and Version.</p>
<p>Let me know if that works.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>I just built and ran it on the iPhone simulator - the Device available are &quot;iPhone&quot;, &quot;iPhone (Retina)&quot;, and &quot;iPad&quot;. The version available is &quot;5.0 (9A334)&quot;.</p>
<p>It seems to me that I can only build against 5.0 and can only simulate in 5.0 environment. From the xCode project you asked me to examine, I believe the xCode that I installed should have other versions available?</p>
<p>I also just tested a moment ago to build the app in 5.0 and downloaded on to my iPhone 4 (version 4.2.1) and it works fine. However, it seems weird that I only allow to build against iOS 5.0 SDK from Ti Studio…</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

							<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have the exact same problem. Did you find a solution to target other SDK Versions than &quot;5.0&quot; ?</p>
<p>Strange that you could install your 5.0 app on 4.2.1. I could not. How did you do?</p>
<p>Thanks<br>Jens - also a newbie</p>

							<p>Hi Jens,</p>
<p>You may try to uninstall your iOS5 first and then install iOS4. After that, install 5 so that you can have both iOS4 and iOS5 on your system.</p>
