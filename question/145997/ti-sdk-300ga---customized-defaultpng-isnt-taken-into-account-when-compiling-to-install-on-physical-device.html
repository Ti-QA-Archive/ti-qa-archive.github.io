		</header>
		<section>
			<p>It appears that under Ti SDK 3.0.0.GA, customized Default.png isnt taken into account when compiling to install on physical device.<br>I created a bug issue TC-1660 after several tests (described in this ticket).</p>
<p>Can someone do the tests and confirm please ?<br>Thanks</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I have just compiled an app I have created using only Ti SDK 3.0.0 GA and I am seeing MY version of the <strong>default.png</strong> startup&#x2F;splash screen.  I have tested on an iPhone 5.0 so far, but I wnated to check what equipment you are using.</p>
<p>Are you targeting iOS if so which device, if Android which device and what resolution is that device?</p>
<p>Does the emulator&#x2F;simulator show the correct image?  What do you mean a custom default.png - do you just mean an image you made or something more complicated?</p>

										<p><p>Apparently, when you copy your Default.png image (located in &#x2F;Resources&#x2F;iphone) to &#x2F;Resources&#x2F;,<br>customized Default.png is taken into account ! </p>
<p>But if you do this, the Default.png image isnt taken into account in simulator (instead, you&#39;ve got an alias to the  Default.png in &#x2F;Resources and black screen when launching in simulator).<br>This simulator problem doesnt appear if you have installed to device before…</p>
<p>I tested it several times and confirm this behaviour.</p>
<p>Quite strange…dont know if they changed something about that in 3.0.0<br>Il will notify it in the bug declaration <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC-1660">TC-1660</a></p>

										<p><p>Hi again,</p>
<p>you can check it without device:</p>
<p>1&gt; From Titanium,  install it to device (Titanium OS application installer) to install the app on iTunes.</p>
<p>2&gt; Then check your Project_folder&#x2F;build&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;build&#x2F;Debug-iphoneos&#x2F; on your Mac.</p>
<p>3&gt; Click mouse right on the generated app (the one which will be transfered to iTunes)=&gt; &quot;Display the content&quot; </p>
<p>You will see the generated Default images. If Default.png is the titanium one, so you see the bug !</p>

										<p><p>I have tried installing the app onto and old iPhone 3g and a second gen iPod touch and as neither can go above the iOS 4.2.x - the current xcode excludes them as it uses 4.3 as a minimum iOS.</p>
<p>I am going to create a small test app with zero functionality but custom default.png files and see what happens.</p>

							<p>Hi,<br>I have written all the steps (and procedure) in the following ticket https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TC-1660.<br>Emulator is ok but the problem is on device. Customized Default.png isnt taken into account on device (iPhone 3GS).</p>
<p>If you try to install your app on your iPhone 5, as Default@2x.png is the launch screen for you, you wont see the problem, but if you look in the compiled app path:<br>Project_folder&#x2F;build&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;build&#x2F;Debug-iphoneos&#x2F;ProjectName&#x2F; and view archive<br>you should notice that Default.png is still Titanium one (instead of the Default.png in &#x2F;Resources&#x2F;iphone<br>…if you reproduce the problem.<br>Thanks</p>
