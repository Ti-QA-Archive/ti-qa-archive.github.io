			<h1>Appstore pushed an update notification with no update.. (!)</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I have published my first Appcelerator app few days ago with no problems at all. Earlier this day, some friends called me and asked if I have released a new version because they have received a notification for an update. </p>
<p>I was really surprised to hear this because I haven&#39;t published any update. To be perfectly honest I changed one of my controllers in my application and tested it on my simulator. But never logged into itunesconnect or published any binary. </p>
<p>Any idea why this might happened? Is there any kind of setting within Titanium that could have possibly caused that?</p>
<p>Oh, I have checked my itunesaccount and there does not appear to be any new version there, just the original! Also, I asked my friends that downloaded the &quot;updated version&quot; to see if my little change that I did in my controller was there, and they reported &quot;no&quot; , which means that really nothing was updated!</p>
<p>But why Appstore notified them ?</p>
<p>Thank you,<br>George</p>

							<p>Apple has been having some issues with their DRM system and were pushing bad binaries out to end users.  They claim that has been rectified.  Would not surprise me if your problems are related to this.</p>

										<p><p>Really so strange! Anyway, so .. it&#39;s definitely not an issue on my side, right? :-) I mean … you cannot publish any update &#39;by mistake&#39; with Titanium! :-)</p>

										<p><p>Appcelerator should market all those wizard screens that way…</p>
<p>Feature: &quot;We put in extra screens in our publishing wizard so you cannot accidentally publish your app&quot;</p>
