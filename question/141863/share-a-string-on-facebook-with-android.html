							<div><p>Raffaele,</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll agree, that your question doesn&#39;t gives us much to work with. I strongly suggest you have a look at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;ask">the guidelines to follow</a> when asking a question.</p>
<p>Also, please include some code detailing what you are trying to achieve. This will give everyone a better understanding of the problem you are facing.</p>
<p>Simply asking for an entire solution without having experienced it yourself seems counter-productive.</p>

							<p>I agree with @Christian, that more information helps us to provide you with a better answer. </p>
<p>If you have not written any code yet, then I would suggest that you look at the KitchenSink application or the documentation on Facebook, write some code and then post the problem you are having so we can assist you.</p>
<p>It will demonstrate that you have made an effort instead of just looking for someone to solve the problem for you without trying.</p>
