		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve been doing some research in to TableView performance, since I&#39;m having a devil of a time getting even reasonable performance out of my tables. I keep hitting this blog post, which suggests drawing the content on to a single view:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.atebits.com&#x2F;2008&#x2F;12&#x2F;fast-scrolling-in-tweetie-with-uitableview&#x2F;</p>
<p>However, as far as I can tell this is not possible to do with Titanium. Am I correct with that? Do I have any options or am I simple stuck with the slow performance of Titanium&#39;s TableView?</p>

										<p><p>Thanks. I&#39;m already implementing that on my app. The problem is not the loading of data, but rather the fact that when data is already loaded it renders very slowly. It&#39;s totally a rendering problem, and possibly cache related as well.</p>

										<p><p>Labels views and graphics. The URL I posted above explains that in order to get decent scroll performance on a table you have to pre-render the content, rather than using views and labels. This is what I&#39;m pretty sure can not be accomplished with Titanium.</p>

							<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Here you have a tip to improve a lot TableViews performance: borderRadius and transparency are truly EVIL. Yes, I know… a 4px borderRadius makes rectangles look beautiful, as so having a gradient background behind labels and images. </p>
<p>In my case I had a TableView with 30 rows with an image (actually quite big: 100x100) and 2 labels (long TextField with such an username + TextField with user&#39;s detail) each. Rows background was white. There&#39;s a view containing the image and labels, since somewhere I read that having a view container helps -not sure it helps in the end…-.<br>The first time I scrolled down it was jerky, choppy, whatever… you know.<br>What REALLY helped was setting the background to both the view and labels. Now, it performs very very good, no more jerky stuff :)</p>
<p>Actually, there&#39;s an <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-6559?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:all-tabpanel#issue-tabs">opened ticket at jira for the next 1.9 SDK</a> which lead me to try this.</p>
<p>As always, I hope this helps somebody.</p>
<p>ps: also remember to use className attribute in createTableViewRow!!!</p>

							<p>The tableviews can be a bit pesky, but here is a way to speed up the scrolling performance (though resource costly so use with caution):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>iOS:</strong> Cache the images as thumbnails in memory blobs and use these when setting the image property. I am using this technique for a tableview with around 90rows and the scrollling performance is great.</li>
<li><strong>Android:</strong> Tableview scrolling performace on android is pain in the <em>*</em>, however if you are not using many tableviews in your app, try wrapping it into a scrollview, set the height of the tableview and the contentheight of the scrollview to the total height of all rows. This makes the scolling nice and smooth. Tested with SDK 2.0.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, the above techniques can be resource consuming so use with caution.</p>
