			<h1>UDID for the Device...</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am developing an AP that should only work if a Device has been authorized to use the app. So, my initial train of thought was to setup an API call that when the app is launched it will check on the server, sending the UDID of the device and if it validates, then all is good to go. Problem is that I read somewhere that Apple is not authorizing apps that using the UDID anymore. See below:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrumors.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;03&#x2F;21&#x2F;apple-will-no-longer-approve-apps-using-unique-device-identifier-udid-beginning-may-1&#x2F;</p>
<p>So, it leaves me wondering if there is another option that generates a unique id to the device that is the same regardless of how many times the app is installed on the same device.</p>
<p>I figured this has to exists.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Short answer - no.</p>
<p>Longer answer;</p>
<p>Basically the same as the post says.  Apple does not want a users devices to be tracked against other apps and past installs.  This wish&#x2F;requirement is now also coming from other parties who wish devices break the one to one links.</p>
<p>Titanium provides a version of the UDID but it is NOT across different installs.</p>
<p>If there are only going to be a small number of these apps change your Apple account to enterprise and use the ad-hoc variation where you assign the certificate&#x2F;profile to known device IDs.  If more users then you will need some external way - a username&#x2F;password login for example.</p>
<p>Only one other way that comes to mind - but also likely to get you booted from the store if&#x2F;when the realise;</p>
<p>Use a custom iOS module to provide true iCloud access, create a unique value and store it in the key&#x2F;value pair in the cloud.  Then each time the app starts check that value exists for this AppleID account.</p>
<p>The logic here is that each account (your appleid) has a link to your iCloud account.  So if the device is using your app then it links to a space for that appleid.  If the applid is not in the key&#x2F;value pair then whatever technique you use to confirm the user is allowed to use the app will return nothing if this user is not valid.</p>
<p>Keep in mind the appleid spans multiple devices - so it would work on iPad and iPhone using this technique.  If this is a problem then introduce the device type into the field name.</p>
<p>Keep in mind I am NOT suggesting this is a good plan - just explaining it could work.</p>

										<p><p>@Moritz has another example of a way it could be achieved, but he agrees with me these hacks are NOT a good idea - and will only serve to get you banned.</p>
<p>You need a different approach that does not track the device and only tracks the user- for example login - not ideal if not the way you want to go, but your choices are limited.</p>

							<p>Hi Rosabel,</p>
<p>One small addition to Malcolm&#39;s answer. You can use the iOS keychain to store values, which persists app uninstall&#x2F;reinstalls. But if a user restores his iTunes Backup to another device, the keychain also will be restored. You can write&#x2F;read the keychain with the Properties implementation of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;benbahrenburg&#x2F;Securely">Securely</a>. I also recommend NOT to do that, if Apple catches you exploiting the keychain for device based tracking, your app most likely will be rejected. It might be better to reconsider your distribution&#x2F;payment model.</p>
