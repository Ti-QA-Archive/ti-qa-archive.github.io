			<h1>Several views one win best practise</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I want to clean up my coding and make things the right way.</p>
<p>What i have trouble understanding is how to get 3 different views in to same win and changing between them.</p>
<p>Lets say that i have a win with a toolbar and three buttons on it.</p>
<p>Each button has an addEventListener to it.</p>
<p>How will i code it to &quot;Push&quot; the new views in the same win&#x2F;tab and change between them without opening like 100 modal views….</p>
<p>I would like to know how to make the addEventListener call and how to write the views the correct way.</p>
<p>Thanx</p>

							<p>I think with this question you need to provide some code, an idea of what device your aiming at..</p>
<p>But while you get that..</p>
<p>I would create the views within the window.. Only 3 .. then set their left position to be off screen…. i.e. view1.left = 900;</p>
<p>Then when you hit the button, you can set the left of the required view to 0…</p>
<p>Im not sure there is such a thing as a modal view. If you are doing it that way, then you are opening a new window each time, which will kill the app after a while…</p>
<p>T…</p>

										<p><p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I am opening new window now and i dont want to do that.</p>
<p>Do you have an example for how to put some views in a window like that? (offscreen)</p>
<p>So i guess that one view is always in the window right? and two views are pulled back and forth from the edges in the win?</p>
