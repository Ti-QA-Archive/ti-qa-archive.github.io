			<h1>Tab colour my first impression after a year</h1>

			<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>I tried Titanium around a year ago and at the time I decided to wait another year to see where this project is heading.</p>
<p>Two days ago I started with the new version 2.0 and started a new tab based project for Android.<br>Ok it comes with native android tabs, wonderful! Then I decided to try to just change the background to white to make it look a little different. To my surprise it wasn&#39;t that easy.</p>
<p>I checked the doc and learnt that there are couple of properties for android that are supposed to change the colour but those properties seems to be ignored. They do not change anything.</p>
<p>Then I googled, maybe I am missing something. But apparently you can&#39;t change the colour. The only option is to hack a solution. Someone has to create a set of buttons in another view and then put it in another view and change the z-order to appear on top off the tabgroup.</p>
<p>But that simply makes an app more chunky and slow. We are talking about mobile applications here and this is a simple task. It is just changing the background of a component. </p>
<p>Am I missing something here? Is there a simple way to change the background colour of a tab?<br>Is this a bug that is introduced in the new SDK?</p>

							<p>Hello Reza, </p>
<p>It is simply not possible to change the background color of Tab under Android. This is not a Titanium specific limitation I&#39;m afraid. On Android, the Tab color is managed by the Theme and the only way to change the theme is by hacking it.</p>
<p>So, even if you developed you entire application purely in Java, you would still be confronted with the same issue.</p>
<p>I know this doesn&#39;t solve your problem, but I wanted to give you a little more hindsight as to why things are like that.</p>
