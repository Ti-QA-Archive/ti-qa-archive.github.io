			<h1>iTunes failed to install on provisioned iPad2</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Running Titanium SDK 3.0.1 on a Mac OSX 10.5.x and Xcode 4.5.2, iOS 6.  I have 3 devices attached to my provisioning profile and dev certificate. My app is successfully installed into iTunes and synched to my iPhone 5.  However when I try to synch same to my iPad2 which is also a registered and active device, i get &quot;iTunes failed to install …&quot; error and the app icon is deleted as soon as dismiss the error alert box.</p>
<p>Any thoughts and help are appreciated as I am developing for 3 targets (iPhone, iPad, and Android). So far I am able to install on 2 of the 3 targets (iPad not allowing an install). Thanks</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>This does sound like a simple case of the device not being registered in the certificate.  I know you say it is but can you double-check the devices long number matches an entry in the devices section and the certificate you are using has that device ticked then re-download the certificate.  Delete the previous certificate and install the new one and re-compile.</p>
<p>Have you set the device to be development enabled? Has this device ever been able to take a app you created?  Does this device normally sync to this computer and this iTunes?</p>
<p>Let me know if any of these help, if not I have something else.</p>

										<p><p>Malcolm thanks for chiming in.  I redownloaded my provisioning profile to include the new iOS devices and recompiled but still getting the same error of inability to install my app. </p>
<p>BUt on further research I found that I needed to access the Organizer in Xcode to ensure my dev cert has not expired which it hasn&#39;t. But when I now click on the refresh button (lower right hand corner of the organizer window), my certificate was renewed to now include the ad-hoc testing profile which contains the new devices and downloaded same.  Now I am able to install my app on all the devices.  Thanks a bunch friend.</p>
