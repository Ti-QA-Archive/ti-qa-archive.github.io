		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have just updated to SDK 2.1.2, using the latest Titanium Studio (2.1.2.201208301612).  After running fine on the simulator, I deployed to my iPad, but I could not instantiate my 2nd window.  </p>
<p>Then when I run again on my simulator, I get the following error while the 2nd window is being created:</p>
<p>{src}<br>var olt = Ti.UI.create3DMatrix();<br>{&#x2F;src}</p>
<p>[WARN] Attempted to load TiUI3DMatrixProxy: Could not find class definition.<br>[ERROR] Exception in event callback: {<br>    line = 91;<br>    message = &quot;invalid method (create3DMatrix) passed to UIModule&quot;;<br>    sourceId = 257901152;<br>}</p>
<p>If I do a clean build &#x2F; delete the build directory (what others have had success with), the problem goes away.  Then every time I deploy to my iPad, it happens again.  As it is, I cannot get the application to work at all on the iPad.</p>
<p>Could this be a problem with the new Studio, since it is now happening with 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 SDK?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Vernon</p>

							<div><p>if you go to previous versions and do a clean build, also updating your tiapp.xml… do you see the same behavior</p>

							<p>I have found the problem; it may also have affected the previous versions.  I was testing a window class to be used for both iPad and Android tablet configurations.  The file exists in the filesystem as …&#x2F;ui&#x2F;tablet&#x2F;android&#x2F;SplitWindow.js, and is require()&#39;d for both configurations in my top-level controller class.</p>
<p>It appears that for the iPad simulator build, the file is included and properly referenced.  But the iPad app build ignores the js files because it is considered an &#39;android&#39; subdirectory (the file and symbols do not appear in the build log), and stops processing at the require().  The problem does not go away until the next clean simulator build.</p>
<p>After moving the file up a subdirectory, everything works as expected.</p>
<p>Just another gotcha with this versatile but fickle platform.</p>
