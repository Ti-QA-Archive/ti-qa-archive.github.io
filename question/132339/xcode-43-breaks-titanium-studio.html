			<h1>Xcode 4.3 breaks Titanium Studio</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>So I installed last night Xcode 4.3 and when I ran it, it asked me if it can delete the old Xcode 4.2.  So I said yes.  It turns out it deletes the entire developer directory with Xcode in it because Xcode 4.3 is now an app in the &#x2F;applications folder.   When I ran Titanium Studio and tried to run an app, it said that my iOS SDK is not installed.   I guess Studio looks only in the &#x2F;developer&#x2F;applications&#x2F;xcode directory. The problem is that does not exist any more as of Xcode 4.3.  I went into Studio-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Titanium Studio-&gt;Titanium and tried to &quot;configure&quot; the iOS SDK home there, but it says it does not exist.  Any help would be greatly appreciated as for now, I can only build for Android.</p>

										<p><p>The problem here is very much the fault of Apple.<br>Structure changes such as this should really change on major versions, not between .dot releases.  The 4.3 change affects more than just our Titanium setups here, some of our build factories will need to be redesigned.</p>

							<p>Thank you for the quick answer.  Looks like I&#39;m download 4.21 again and will run both 4.21 and 4.3 concurrently until there is a new version of Studio to fix that issue.  Thanks again!</p>

										<p><p>Its a mess of a thing for the Titanium team, in that they will need to support 2 different install locations based upon the version of xCode installed.  Then the question becomes, because I can have two builds of Xcode installed, which one do I want to build with?</p>

							<p>The issue is that Xcode 4.3 removed xcode-select (unless you had it previously) and switched a number of paths. Please watch <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TISTUD-1196">TISTUD-1196</a> for the Studio fix to find the new location, though there will still be related issues for platform (such as an issue with ios-sim). The fastest workaround is not use 4.2.1 in the meantime.</p>
<p>Note that we will continue to use xcode-select if it exists, and then fall back to other options if that fails.</p>
