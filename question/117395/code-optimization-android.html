			<h1>Code Optimization Android</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am working on an application that started as an iPhone only app and has since been ported to the Android; however, where the application was and is incredibly fast on the iphone, it is horrendously slow on the Android. Why is there such a speed difference between the two platforms and how can I optimize the code so that the application runs faster on the Android?</p>
<p>In particular I am looking for answers to the following questions: - What is the proper usage of Titanium.include() and does it evaluate at compile time or runtime? - How and when are objects created and instantiated in a mobile app? Are classes created at compile time and then instantiated at runtime or are they dynamically created at runtime? - As an extension to the previous question, how does the class creation pertain to self calling functions that create module in javascript? - What is the quickest way to get a window to load in Android? For example, my windows exist in a tab group and when I click on a tab, there is a noticeable delay between when the tab is pressed and when the window is opened.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for the help.</p>

							<div><p>Are you testing in the emulator or device?  What API level?  I have found that in the emulator if you use anything lower than API 2.2 it will run super slow.  However if you are testing on the device it should run a lot faster.  What device and API level are you testing on?</p>
