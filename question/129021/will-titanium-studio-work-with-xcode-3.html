							<div><p>I went a different way.  I was trying to get around this problem: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;128919&#x2F;started-getting—error-traceback-most-recent-call-last .  I had the install disk for an older version of OSX so I was going to install on VMWare Fusion with the older tool stack and develop there so I could at least get something done.</p>
<p>Turns out WMWare Fusion 4 supports Lion so I was able to get Xcode 4 and Titanium Studio loaded on there.  My app at least compiles now and runs in the emulator.  Crashes when deploying to a real device, but that could be problems with the provisioning.  I was also careful to backup the VMWare image in case something goes wrong again.</p>

							<p>Hi Hayata </p>
<p>You can always use the Titanium Developer which you can get from here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;adrianopaladini&#x2F;titanium_developer">Titanium Developer</a> This was the previous version of Titanium with lots of updates you can use this to make the application on xcode 3. Its not the same as Titanium Studio as that was came later but on the initial stage we have the titanium developer which i still use for the development.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Nikunj</p>
