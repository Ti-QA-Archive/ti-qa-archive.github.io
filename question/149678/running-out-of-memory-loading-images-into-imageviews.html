			<h1>Running out of memory loading images into ImageViews</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Google API 2.2, Titanium 3.1.0 (same issue with 3.0.2, using 3.1.0 for the fix to remote server-generated images issue with iOS)</p>
<p>So, I have an app that displays 7 fixed-size imageviews that correspond to images that need to be uploaded to a server.</p>
<p>When the app is loaded it creates each ImageView and either sets the URL to a local &quot;missing photo&quot; image or a remote url to the image on the server.</p>
<p>The missing images have a click handler that allow you to grab an image from photo gallery or camera and display it in the imageview.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tested using a 3600x2430 jpg image (576KB).  When I load it into the first imageview, it displays fine.  But if i try to then load it into the second imageview, I get the exceeds VM budget error.  It says it&#39;s trying to allocate 17,496,000 bytes.</p>
<p>The bytes it&#39;s trying to allocate seem to be about what a bitmap representation of the image would be.  Does the imageview keep a copy of the bitmap representation in memory?  Or is it only a temporary allocation that should be cleared from memory after the image is rendered in the view?</p>
<p>I tried using Android Debug Manager to track down the memory allocation, and i&#39;m confused.  When the app loads up the heap is 4.2MB and 3.3MB allocated, after I load in the first image.. the heap is 4.3MB and 3.4MB allocated.  So, it seems the bitmap allocation is being done outside of the application heap somewhere?</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#39;m confused.. if anyone could clear anything up for me I would appreciate it.  Thanks!</p>

							<div><p>Okay, so I went ahead and rewrote my code so it resizes the image (to 80x100) before loading into the imageview.  Now i can select two images okay, but then on the 3rd it will crash with the same memory allocation error.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the weird thing though: if I use the &#39;cause GC&#39; button in Android Debug Monitor after selecting an image, I can then select the next image successfully.  I can repeat this process to load all of the images.</p>
<p>So, somehow the garbage collector is not freeing up the allocated memory from the bitmap decoding unless forced to (or after some length of time, i&#39;m not sure).</p>
<p>I am nulling out the event object from the photo gallery&#x2F;camera after resizing the image&#x2F;loading it into imageview.  I figured that would force the GC to clean it up, but i suspect the imageview is doing the allocation so i can&#39;t just null it out to force it to free up the memory.</p>
<p>I have no idea what to do about this :&#x2F;</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>This is some information to work with - it may not be a full answer, but thought it worthwhile before I sign off for the evening.</p>
<p>Firstly you are correct in your guess about the amount of memory used.  An image loaded is ALWAYS the sum of the parts of the bits and has nothing to do with the file size.  File sizes are simply how the data is stored with or without compression.</p>
<p>When displaying the data you should work with this simple equation;</p>
<ul>
<li>width <em> height </em> colour depth, example; 500x500x3 or 500x500x4</li>
<li>A JPEG would work out as 500x500x3 (width in pixels <em> height in pixels </em> (red, green, blue))</li>
<li>A PNG would work out as 500x500x4 (width in pixels <em> height in pixels </em> (red, green, blue and alpha))</li>
</ul>
<p>So the JPEG would be 500x500x3 = 750,000 bytes or around 732.42 kilobytes<br>So the PNG would be 500x500x4 = 1,000,000 bytes or around 976.56 kilobytes</p>
<p>So your device would need sufficient available memory to map the image data requested at the same time.</p>
<p>To get an idea of what you can store in memory there is a table in this detailed guide.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Managing_Memory_and_Finding_Leaks">Managing Memory and Finding Leaks</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You should also consider using <strong>large heap</strong> if you are targeting Android 3.0 or higher.</p>

										<p><p>I posted a comment to my original question.  It seems like there&#39;s an issue with the garbage collector not freeing up the memory allocated during the decoding process.  If i force garbage collection from android debug monitor, then I can load the next image, and repeat this process to get all of the images loaded.</p>
<p>Do you have any ideas on how i can force the garbage collection to happen automatically?</p>
