			<h1>Jelly Bean AudioPlayer issue?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve just had a client tell me he&#39;s upgraded his Galaxy S3 to Android 4.1.1 (Jelly Bean) and the Icecast audio streams no longer play on the app I built for him last month which were working fine under various other flavours of Android. I do not have a device with Jelly Bean on it so can&#39;t test - I can test under 4.1.2  on the simulator though and it works - but are there any known issues with audio streams under Jelly Bean?</p>
<p>I am using Appcelerator&#39;s AudioPlayer API and the streams are presented in this format &#39;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;radio.foobar:8080&#x2F;stream1.mp3&#39;</p>

							<p>Hi Patrick,</p>
<p>I have the same problem ! My streaming audio works fine on Galaxy S, but it lag (start, stop, restart) on Galaxy S3 (Android 4.1.1).</p>
<p>I built it with 2.1.3 then 2.1.4 but no changes. I tested Kitchensink on the S -&gt; good, on the S3 still the lag.</p>
<p>Did you find a solution ?</p>

										<p><p>Hello Greg, No solution as such - yet - but we did find that the radio station in question was running an old version of Icecast. The new one, version 2.0.2, has &#39;burst on connect&#39; which boosts the start time for the stream which otherwise was something like 9 seconds on Android compared to half that on iOS. So it appeared that their Icecast server may be the culprit. But why this should have such an affect on the Galaxy S3 is a complete mystery.</p>

							<p>Hi Luiz - your problem is different from mine but similar to this one http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;140520&#x2F;android-background-audio-using-videoplayer, however it seems he had to use the audio player rather than the video player to obtain background audio.</p>

										<p><p>Android is not my first choice of platform and I&#39;ve never used the VideoPlayer, so I can&#39;t be much help I&#39;m sorry to say. But looking around the web it seems at least one Android app can do what you want, the Act 1 Video Player. That proves it&#39;s possible - only it&#39;s likely to be a native build, not an Appcelerator one.</p>
