			<h1>GCM Cloud Push not working - but mqtt works!</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Okay, I know that post 3.1.2 gcm became the default setting but my app was started before. Everything works perfectly up to version 3.1.1.v20130531163723</p>
<p>The moment I try SDK version 3.1.2GA or newer, it all goes to pot.</p>
<p>I DO have the mqtt key set in my tiapp.xml:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">property</span> <span class="hljs-property">name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"acs-push-type"</span> type=<span class="hljs-string">"string"</span>&gt;mqtt&lt;/<span class="hljs-keyword">property</span>&gt;
</code></pre><p>What happens is I hear my phone make the usual &#39;ding&#39; sound when the push message is received but my app doesn&#39;t detect it until I close the app - then when I relaunch it, it suddenly tells me I have however many push notifications (which were sent <em>and received</em> before I closed the app)</p>
<p>I have tried the following:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">alerter = setInterval(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span>{alert(<span class="hljs-string">"CloudPush.enabled = "</span> + CloudPush.enabled);}, <span class="hljs-number">10000</span>);
</code></pre><p>This continuously tells me that CloudPush IS enabled so it hasn&#39;t somehow been accidentally been disabled.</p>
<p>I also have an alert in the only piece of code which could potentially remove the event listener and it is not being removed.</p>
<p>The thing to remember is that it works as intended up until I change the SDK version to 3.1.2 or newer.</p>
<p>I have tried setting up GCM - whenever I change the tiapp.xml key to gcm it fails.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been over and over the documentation:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-symbol">http:</span>/<span class="hljs-regexp">/docs.appcelerator.com/titanium</span><span class="hljs-regexp">/latest/</span><span class="hljs-comment">#!/api/Titanium.CloudPush</span>
</code></pre><p>I have registered for gcm with google and I have obtained my API key and project number and have put these into the ACS Dashboard for my app but that doesn&#39;t work either. (Is the project number perhaps not the same as the &#39;senderID&#39; - could this be the problem?) Am I supposed to put either of these numbers &#x2F; keys into my code &#x2F; tiapp.xml in some way?</p>
<p>I have been struggling with this for weeks now, on and off. Can anyone please help?</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Robin</p>
