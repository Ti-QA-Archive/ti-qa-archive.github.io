							<p>Try opening the AVD Manager and launching the emulator first. Once the emulator is up and running, then go back to Studio and launch the application.</p>

							<p>How can I do this? I open the Android AVD Manager and start one of the AVDs. Then I start the App in Titanium. But then Titanium opens a second Emulator with a different Adress. For example the first Emulator is 5554:titanium_2_WVGA854 and then the second 5560:titanium_2_WVGA854. How can I start the app in the emulator opened with the AVD Manager?</p>

							<p>Well, what does build log says? Or what is the terminal output?<br>KitchenSink requires Google API, so you need to set GoogleAPI instead of Android in AVD, when editing Virtual devices.</p>

							<p>Check your run and debug configurations in Titanium. You can see where it says Android API and a dropdown. You can&#39;t use Android x.x with KitchenSink because it uses Google Maps and some other stuff, that is only available if you select &#39;Google APIs Android x.x&#39; instead. </p>
<p>If you change your emulator settings manually with AVD manager and they don&#39;t match EXACTLY with what&#39;s in the debug&#x2F;run configurations in Titanium, Titanium will create a new emulator that does.</p>

							<p>OK, but I startet a complete new Mobile Project and I used Google API Android 2.3.3 to compile. I also deleted all AVDs in the AVD Manager. Then I run the Project in Titanium. The emulator started, the app doesn&#39;t. Then I stop the emulator und start the AVD in the AVD Manager. It created an emulator with 5554:titanium_2_WVGA854. When I start the project in Titanium it creates a new emulator with 5560:titanium_2_WVGA854, which do not work (it is only black). I did not chance any debug configurations.</p>
<p>If found one error in the build.log:<br>[ERROR] Error generating R.java from manifest</p>

										<p><p>Troubleshooting suggestion:</p>
<ol>
<li>Any chance you have spaces in your user folder? Can be weird on Win, unless you&#39;re handy with Python.</li>
<li>Can you compile a sample Android project in Eclipse (rules out the SDK or JDK being the issue). </li>
<li>The emulator starts, but where does it end? Can you run other apps? One problem I had was the Emulator being corrupted, and trying to use too high of resolutions…For some reason Windows can&#39;t even really use the tablet emulator, no idea why. That&#39;s why I suggested moving your Android version down to something like API Level 4 or maybe Droid1.6, rinse and repeat to test it out. </li>
<li>If all else fails, and you can definitely run a sample project in Eclipse (just a normal Android hello world thingy), IF and only if all that doesn&#39;t work, reinstall Titanium. I had to do it more than once during troubleshooting and I think it may have helped at some point.</li>
