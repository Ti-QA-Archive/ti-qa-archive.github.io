			<h1>Add Event Listener Not Working (HUM)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am posting this not so much as to ask why although it might be nice but more to let know what I have come across.</p>
<p>I have an app, with a unique menu control system. This has a title bar at the top, a screen view area and a menu bar at the bottom.</p>
<p>I had a need to have a popup menu option. This I coded as a view with the menu options included in this and added an event listener to each button.</p>
<p>I called the popup menu from the main menu bar, after building it all. And the popup menu is displayed using a - on the top to display it in the main screen area. But it is actually part of the bottom menu bar.</p>
<p>OK so the issue. Only the event listener which was displayed in the bottom menu bar itself worked, the other which were displayed over the main screen area did not work.</p>
<p>I solved it by recoding the popup menu to display on the main screen not the menu bar and all the event listeners worked as they should.</p>
<p>Oh yes I had set zIndex as well but that didn&#39;t resolve the issue, and the popup menu was created and displayed correctly.</p>
<p>I really hope I have explained this ok, and hopefully somebody else may not spend a few hours trying to work it out.</p>
<p>T…</p>

							<div><p>will try and add some later. But really I think it is how it works rather than a bug …. (The app is quite large and don&#39;t want to polute gist paste :) ).</p>
