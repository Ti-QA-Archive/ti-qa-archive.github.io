		<section>
			<p>For anyone thats used Scoutmob, is there a way to display images with the cropped&#x2F;scaled way they do?  I&#39;m working on a project where people are going to upload a photo on a web server, and I want the app to do something like that, without distorting it.  Some sort of cropping?</p>
<p>iOS only</p>

										<p><p>So you simply want to take an image that may be both wider and taller than the target size but it also has a different aspect ratio as well.</p>
<p>For clarification; you MAY have an original image with dimensions of 1000x1000 but you want to have one like the scoutmob app (assuming the widescreen version in the example) which could be 320x120 for example?</p>
<p>You suggest the image will be uploaded to a web server;</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the image coming from the server the one that needs work?<br>or</li>
<li>Does the image come from the device (camera&#x2F;gallery) and then gets resized BEFORE being uploaded to a server elsewhere in the app?</li>
</ul>
<p>Cheers</p>

										<p><p>All the images will be uploaded on the backend with an admin tool, nothing will come from the device.  The device would just display them.  I supposed I could get the full sized, add a some sort of overlay and toImage the composite to mask, but it sounds like a pain in the ass.</p>

										<p><p>If they are coming from the server then normally this action will be performed on the server before delivering them to the device.</p>
<p>Most server side languages have this ability including; PHP and ASP.net.</p>
<p>If you do need to handle it on the device I can knock-up some code for you, let me know.</p>

										<p><p>Here is a PHP version you can use as a starting point, with this is takes an image and then resize the image down and the crops the resulting image to match the required the dimensions.</p>
<p>You can use this on the server when images are added into your admin and you can then have the correctly sized images as you need them - these then are served to your app.</p>
<p>It uses the superb PHP library <strong>Gravitywell Image</strong> with some tweaks of my own.</p>

<p>This is the important part, you will find many functions in the library you can use.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-variable">$image</span> = new Gravitywell_Image(<span class="hljs-string">"color.jpg"</span>);
<span class="hljs-variable">$image-</span>&gt;thumbnail(<span class="hljs-number">320</span>, <span class="hljs-number">120</span>);
<span class="hljs-variable">$image-</span>&gt;save(<span class="hljs-string">"resized.jpg"</span>, <span class="hljs-number">100</span>);
