		<section>
			<p>Hello, I&#39;m pretty new to Titanium and I have to develop a web app and also a mobile app both remaining almost the same with a few functionalities more on the mobile app.</p>
<p>Please, could anybody tell me if I can make the web app also with Titanium and get a native look and feel or I should think in something like Sencha?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot in advance.</p>

							<p>You&#39;re in luck! Titanium Mobile supports not only native Android and iOS, but Mobile Web. Using the same Titanium code that is used for native apps, you can build your app for the web and it will generate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Titanium Mobile Web supports all modern browsers on both handheld devices and desktop browsers.</p>
<p>You need to be using the latest 2.0.2 release to get started, however v2.1 is going to be out in a couple short weeks and has many bug fixes and performance enhancements. I&#39;m the lead engineer for the Mobile Web platform and I monitor this Q&amp;A daily, so give it a try and if you have any questions, just ask away! :)</p>

										<p><p>Camera, not yet. The only browsers I know that support camera is Chrome 21, Opera 12, and Opera Mobile 12. That means it&#39;s low priority right this second, but it&#39;s definitely on our radar.</p>
<p>GPS is working though! Just use Ti.Geolocation as you would in a native Titanium app.</p>

										<p><p>I would think not but you can implement it via <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;html5please.com&#x2F;#geolocation">geolocation</a> and <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;2012&#x2F;01&#x2F;hands-on-building-an-html5-photo-booth-with-chromes-new-webcam-api&#x2F;">getUserMedia</a>. <code>navigator.getUserMedia()</code> is only supported in Chrome and Opera as far as I know. Firefox have their own <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mozilla.org&#x2F;Platform&#x2F;Features&#x2F;Camera_API">Camera API</a>. Both camera implementations are based on <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.webrtc.org&#x2F;">webRTC</a></p>
