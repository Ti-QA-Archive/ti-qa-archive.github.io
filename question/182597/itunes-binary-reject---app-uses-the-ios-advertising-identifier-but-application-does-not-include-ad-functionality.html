			<h1>iTunes Binary Reject -  App uses the iOS Advertising Identifier but application does not include ad functionality</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Application type: Mobile<br>Titanium SDK: 4.0.0 GA<br>Platform: iOS:10.10.3<br>Device: iOS</p>
<p>Submission issue with iTunesConnect.  App rejected because iOS Advertising Identifier framework included, but application does not use advertising..<br>I did indicate when submitting that the application included the iOS AdID, but it seems that Apple does not want the framework included if the application does not use advertising.</p>
<p>Message from Apple:<br>Note: iAd does not use the AdSupport framework, ASIdentifierManager, or the Advertising Identifier. Therefore they are not required for iAd implementations and should not be included in your app for iAd support. </p>
<p>If your app does not serve ads, please check your code - including any third-party libraries - to remove any instances of:</p>
<p>class: ASIdentifierManager<br>selector: advertisingIdentifier<br>framework: AdSupport.framework</p>

							<div><p>i think if you check the ad option &amp; do not include ads in app, then the app will be shown on app store as serving the ads, &amp; this is what apple does not want ……if you are providing the ads, then show them, or else do not check the ad option while submitting the information about your app…..</p>
