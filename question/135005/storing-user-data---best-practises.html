			<h1>Storing User Data - Best Practises</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>I am working on a simple application for which I will need to collect from the users some data. It&#39;s really 2-3 figures that I am going to need from them. I have three options to consider.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Storing the user&#39;s data on a remote server. I can do that since my app will be exchanging data with the remote server all the time. Pros is that data will be fully backed up and if my user&#39;s phone is replaced nothng will be lost. Cons is data usage and performance.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Storing the user&#39;s data on a local SQLite database. Pros is that both performance and data usage issues are eliminated. Cons is too much code to store 2-3 values.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Storing the user&#39;s data on an application variable within the Titanium.App.Properties scope. Pros is that it&#39;s too simple to implement. Cons, not sure if this is a good practise! :-) </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What would you do and why?</p>
<p>George</p>

							<p>I&#39;d go with the properties.<br>If you need db like behaviour take a look at TaffyDB and TiTaffyDb to see how to use it (json database).<br>You still have to take care about the size of the properties. I discovered that on my 3GS in properties I cannot store more than 204k in one variable.</p>

										<p><p>204k in one variable is a lot of space! I would only store IDs and references (perhaps name, email at max!). For more yes, I would use SQLite of course!!</p>
<p>SQLite is very easy, however it&#39;s more lines of code compared to a single variable definition! :-) </p>
<p>Thanks for the TaffyDB tip, didn&#39;t know it!</p>

										<p><p>Depends on how much data and how you use it. But Properties are written on the &quot;hard drive&quot; so you can always write, free the resource from memory and read it again only when u need it.</p>
<p><strong>A bad example</strong> would be to create a xml structure, write it to properties then read it back and parse it. It will take a lot of time and memory.</p>
<p>Use JSON with Properties.set&#x2F;getString and u&#39;re set :)</p>

										<p><p>Oh yes, I always avoid XML in mobile development. JSON is cool! Hm.. it&#39;s good to know that Properties is stored on the &quot;hard drive&quot; and not in memory!!! Thank you!</p>

							<p>You could mix it with backend and properties on first install you could sync them, Sure its a Bit more effort.</p>

							<p>You can periodically store data to remote server so your user&#39;s data can not lost even though the phone will change. and at the client side you can download remote side for first time and use properties rather than database if it is not complex. as Dan Tamas said that there is size problem in property so you should take precaution for that point. Generally 100Kb of JSON string is much more than you need.</p>
<p>But, it preferable that you should choose method by application functionality and complexity.</p>

										<p><p>ok, so it&#39;s not a bad practice to store user settings within Properties.. that what I was trying to find out to be honest!</p>

										<p><p>Someone in here said that the cons of storing with Properties is if device&#x2F;app crashes.. the Properties get reset. I have not used appcelerator long enough to encounter this issue nor can say it will never happen.. so better be cautious..</p>
<p>Having said that.. I will implement something like this..<br>Say you are storing userid, password and picture.. what you can do is combine all of them (it doesn&#39;t matter how) and then generate MD5 from it. And then compare with similar MD5 stored in server.. if there are any changes.. then it is time to sync!</p>
