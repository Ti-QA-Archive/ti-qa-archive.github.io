							<p>First off, I&#39;d be curious to know what class this is for? Is it a biz class, dev class, mobile specific?<br>Second, since were just talking ideas, here are a few things to think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does wifi have to do with the app? Just because you&#39;re on wifi doesn&#39;t mean that you can query things around you that also have wifi. So the app would work just as well on 4g, 3g, or maybe even Edge.</li>
<li>Where do you plan on getting your data? As Steven mentioned above, you need a place to get your information, you can&#39;t just create it all yourself, that would be pointless. The first thing you need before you can do any of this is find a data source.</li>
<li>How do you plan on dealing with data queries? Coupled with #2 above, if you plan on filtering and sorting this data based on price range or food courts and your data source doesn&#39;t allow this out of the box, then you need to find a way that makes sense either in-app or server side.</li>
<li>What is your knowledge level of javascript? Its great that you have knowledge of Android and Java, which is always very helpful, but most everything you do here will be in javascript. This probably should have been #1, but oh well.</li>
<li>Does this meet the project requirements for your final? If you just have to create a mobile app for your final, then this will work, but if you need to create something new, then this might miss the mark as it seems that I could just pop open Expedia, Travelocity, Hotels.com, or any of 100 other mobile apps that does the exact same thing that you&#39;re trying to do and get the information.</li>
</ul>
<p>I know when you ask a question, you don&#39;t really want a bunch of new questions as a response, but as Stephen points out above, the idea behind a final is to apply what you&#39;ve learned to your thesis or project, and judging by the question you&#39;ve asked, I wouldn&#39;t guess that any of this was in your course curriculum. But by answering these questions, you&#39;ll have a basic idea of the requirements and knowledge that you need to get going.</p>

										<p><p>Ok, I got what you&#39;re saying. Unfortunately, the main functionality of your app idea is not possible. You cannot query the wifi at some local establishment and get data from them. ie: the menu from a close by mcdonalds, or the prices of a nearby hotel. You&#39;d only be able to get this information from a public domain. Meaning that you could data mine it from their website, or use an already existing API that has the data you want. So keep that in mind as you start building out your app.</p>

							<p><code>I m doin this project for my college final year B.E</code></p>
<p>Yeah, you need to figure this all out on your own. Anyone who helps you is an enabler, but at the same time, should get a footnote on your degree.</p>

										<p><p>Hi There</p>
<p>In a nutshell, you would need a feed to tell you the hotel information.<br>Then your app could bring in the feed, and display the data in a table view.</p>
