			<h1>Android Emulator wont load Kitchen Sink - Emulator runs, but no App loaded in?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Have just set up Titanium and iPhone emulator is working fine, loads nicely. Android emulator goes through the motions but never loads the Appcelerator Kitchen Sink?</p>
<p>I get the following warning in RED:</p>
<p>emulator[17667:903] Warning Once: this application, or a library it uses, is using NSQuickDrawView, which has been depreciated. Apps shoudl cease use of QuickDraw and move to Quartz</p>
<p>Then it runs through the build of the emulator but I never get to see the Appcelerator Kitchen Sink?</p>
<p>i&#39;m running Mobile SDK 1.7.0<br>and Android 2.3</p>

							<p>The red warning there can be ignored.  The android team just needs to compile the SDK against some updated libraries. (which, if it bugs you, you could do too)</p>
<p>Does the emulator launch?<br>Does adb ever find the device?</p>
<p>[DEBUG] Waiting for device to be ready …</p>
<p>[TRACE] adb devices returned 1 devices&#x2F;emulators</p>
<p>Does the apk get copied to the device?</p>

										<p><p>The console has a TON of information, just work your way back up through the log until you find the failure point.  Toss any additional details this way, will see what can be done to help you.</p>

							<p>Andrew,</p>
<p>If you are using the Kitchen Sink demo for the 1.7.0 release, you may need to update your Android SDKs. Once updated, open your AVD Manager and delete any devices in the list and relaunch the KS demo.</p>
<p>If you are using the KS demo from a previous release, then you may need to build using the mobile SDK that matches that version of KS.</p>

										<p><p>Hi, thanks for response, I&#39;m using the latest SDK&#39;s and 1.7.0 KS - Ive removed the devices from AVD, re-run and still nothing… The emulator loads up, but the app&#x2F;icon for KS doesnt appear in the APP list.  </p>
<p>Should the App icon for KS be in the main set? Am i looking in the wrong place, most frustrating…</p>

										<p><p>The KS icon should show up in the main apps list. To double check, you can open your device settings and go to Application Management to see the full list of apps installed on that AVD. Also, make sure that your emulator is running when you launch your application for the first time, as stated below, you should see this in the console:</p>

							<p>make sure in your run configurations you are using Google Apis and not just Android as the Android API. I had the same problem everything loaded fine just no KS app. I was using Android 2.2 I changed it to Google Apis Android 2.2 and it worked. Hope it helps</p>

										<p><p>Hello Guillermo,</p>
<p>Thanks for the response, in Run Configurations, I cant see anything other than the Android API drop down? I&#39;ve installed all the SDKs via the tool, is there some setting to show the Google APIs?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance. Andrew</p>
