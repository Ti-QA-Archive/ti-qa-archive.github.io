							<p>Hi Lakshmi,</p>
<p>UDID means (unique device ID) which is only for ios devices to identitfy devices.  TO detect UDID  for ios device is banned by apple now. Insted of using  UDID   you can use UUID -  which create unique identity for every device in application. you can use this. for more for info about UUID you can refer the below link or let me know for more help.</p>
