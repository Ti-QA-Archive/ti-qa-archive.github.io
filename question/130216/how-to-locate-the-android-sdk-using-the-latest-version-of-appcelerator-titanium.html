			<h1>How to locate the Android SDK using the latest version of Appcelerator Titanium?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m having a problem upon locating the Android SDK using Appcelerator Titanium. I already installed the following programs accordingly and correctly:</p>
<p> <em>Java SDK
 </em>Android SDK platforms and Google APIs for (using SDK manager):</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">- Android <span class="hljs-number">4.0</span><span class="hljs-number">.3</span> (API <span class="hljs-number">15</span>)
- Android <span class="hljs-number">1.6</span> (API <span class="hljs-number">4</span>)
</code></pre><p> *Latest version of Appcelerator Titanium Studio</p>
<p>I also moved the extracted &#39;android-sdk-windows&#39; folder to C:\ and renamed it to &#39;android-sdk&#39; right before I install the SDK platforms and Google APIs. And also, I added the required variables to the path on system variables.</p>
<p>After all of that, I tried to locate the Android SDK on Window &gt; Preferences &gt; Titanium Studio &gt; Titanium. I chose the directory &#39;C:\android-sdk&#39;, which is the directory of my Android SDK, but still, I have no items to select on &#39;Default Android SDK&#39;.</p>
<p>Now, what do you think is my problem?</p>
<p>Any help? Thanks.</p>

							<p>Hello,</p>
<p>please run android from the android-sdk&#x2F;tools directory and install android 2.2. After that, you will see the Android SDK in your Ti Studio.</p>
<p>Best,</p>

<p>I&#39;m just a student. My group was just asked to develop a mobile application on Android. That&#39;s why I&#39;m desperate to have the emulator on my Titanium in order to have even just an emulator to run our applications.</p>
<p>So please help me with this. :)</p>

										<p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>No, I don&#39;t mean an actual physical android. I mean more like going to the components section and add the android 2.1. Example <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;sdk&#x2F;adding-components.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Let me know if that works.</p>

										<p><p>Hello Mauro,</p>
<p>May I ask for help again?</p>
<p>I also installed Appcelerator Titanium, Android SDK, and JDK to my groupmates laptop, and I followed the same procedure, just like what I did on mine, but we encountered another problem.</p>
<p>It says, </p>
<p>[TRACE] adb devices returned 0 devices&#x2F;emulators</p>
<p>[ERROR] Timed out waiting for emulator to be ready, you may need to close the emulator and try again</p>
<p>What do you think is  the problem? Thanks. :)</p>

										<p><p>Sir, It&#39;s still not working. Titanium still reports the same problem.</p>
<p>I&#39;m just wondering, since I installed a lot of SDK&#39;s for Titanium, is selecting the Default Android SDK a big issue?</p>
<p>Or was it the one that causes all that errors?</p>
<p>My current Default Android SDK is Android 2.2.</p>

<p>having multiple SDKs for android should not be an issue. After you build for the simulator, did it start? I mean, is there a window with the android emulator? </p>

										<p><p>Hello Anthony, </p>
<p>1G and an atom? It will take forever. The Android Simulator it&#39;s pretty resource consuming. You are seeing that  you don&#39;t have a simulator, because it didn&#39;t started yet. You will need to wait more for it to start (this is an android issue, not titanium one). And once the android simulator started, please don&#39;t close it. You can reuse it because of fastdev functionality. </p>
<p>My recommendation: Get a cheap android device and test with it. Will be easier for your machine, and you will be getting more accurate results on terms of memory usage and usability testing.</p>
<p>Best,<br>Mauro</p>
