			<h1>removal of temporary files created on SD card on device</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am developing an app where you have to read PDF files. I am using intents to open the file outside of the app in a PDF Reader. That seemed the only way you can read PDF files in Android, unlike in iOS where you can open the file in the app directly.</p>
<p>Well, thats fine. I got it working. On the device, since the data directory of the app is not accessible outside the app, I had to copy the PDF to a temporary file on the SD card (external storage), and then read that file instead. This is all good. (<em>*</em> I can post the code here, if anyone is interested)</p>
<p>My question is - what happens to the temporary files on the SD card that are created? Do they get deleted somehow? Since the user is taken to the PDF viewer, i have no control of when to delete the file myself. There are quite a few PDFs on my app. If the user decides to open every one of them it can get quite big with 2 copies of the file - one on the data directory and one on SD card.</p>
<p>Anyone has any answers?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

							<p>Possibly you could &#39;clean out&#39; the directory on startup or on shutdown? At least this way the only build up of files would be during use of the app. If you want to be a little more granular, you could create a list [array] of all of the PDF files you open and the date&#x2F;time you sent them to the intent and clean up all pdf&#39;s that were opened more that x days ago…</p>
