			<h1>powerpoint found a problem with content</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m actually using office automation with PowerPoint to manipulate PowerPoint presentations.   A PPTX was uploaded from the internet and the process failed.  I opened the PPTX directly with PowerPoint and got the error &quot;PowerPoint found a problem with content&quot; and asked if I wanted to repair.  I said yes, saved it as another PPTX, and everything was ok.  However, I can&#39;t do this for every PPTX that&#39;s uploaded and need to find a way to deal with it when it&#39;s using office automation to extract the contents of the PPTX.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve unchecked all the protected view settings in the trust center, set my computer to authentication and impersonation to connect and identify, enabled macros and activeX controls, added the upload path to trusted settings, right-clicked the PPTX, properties, but there is no &quot;unblock&quot; to unblock.   Nothing has fixed the issue.</p>
<p>What else can I check or is this just a bad PPTX since it&#39;s the only one we&#39;ve found like this?</p>

							<p>Hi<br>Although this does solve your problem, it is unsafe to disable the Protected View setting.<br>It was specifically added to enhance security of opening Office documents from untrusted sources.<br>If you go to file properties of the file, you may see a button called &quot;Unlock&quot;. Unlocking the file should also suffice.<br>Use PowerPoint Repair Toolbox. The PowerPoint repair tool reads and analyzes the damaged files and exports data the restored data to Microsoft PowerPoint.<br>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.repairtoolbox.com&#x2F;powerpointrepair.html</p>
