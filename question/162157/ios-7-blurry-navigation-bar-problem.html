			<h1>Ios 7 blurry navigation bar problem</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I jail broke my iPod for ios 7 and some of my apps seem to have this blurry white over the navigation bar. Like as if I was on FaceTime or a phone call. How do I get rid of it? None of my tweaks I have seem to be the  problem. Or maybe there is. I don&#39;t know.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Your question is not very clear, I am reading it two ways;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your Apps</strong>; You have built some apps using Titanium and when you run them on your jail broken iPod running iOS7 there is a navigational display issue?</li>
<li><strong>Built in apps</strong>; You have jail broken your iPod and are now running iOS7 - and some of the built in apps have visual issues on the navigation bar?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are talking about your apps then you need to check your apps on another device, make sure the second device has NOT been jail broken.</p>
<p>If you are talking about your apps then you need to supply an screenshot so we can see what you are talking about as it could be many different things.  Also provide a small reproducible snippet of code that we can try to see the problem.</p>
<p>I would say that by jail breaking the device you have voided any warranty on the device which you likely are aware off.  You may not be aware that the development licence may also be in question as you are using non-approved devices.</p>

										<p><p>So is this happening on apps that you have NOT been written by you using Titanium?  You mention pandora this was not written by you (guessing).</p>
<p>If so then I can assume this is not a problem with Titanium but more general question.</p>
<p>Working on the basis that Pandora does not look like this on a non jail broken device or at least whatever generation iPod you have (they can act differently) that has been jail broken.  Then this is specifically related to the fact you have jail broken your iPod.</p>
<p>If you have tried creating an app with titanium and this also does the same thing - it will still be the jail break you performed as it is affecting all apps you have and not just those created using Titanium.</p>
<p>Sorry it not the answer you are looking for, but certainly appears to the correct answer.</p>

										<p><p>I never used titanium I was just wondering if anyone&#39;s would know a tweak that would cause this because it was fine when I jail broke it and I can&#39;t find the tweak that&#39;s causing this</p>
