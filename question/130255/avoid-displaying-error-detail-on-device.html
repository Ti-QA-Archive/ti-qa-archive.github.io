							<p>If you are talking about the big red full screen &quot;PROGRAMMER SCREWED UP&quot; errors, those also say they will not show up in production.</p>
<p>Try&#x2F;Catch&#x2F;Finally (too many forget the Finally to let users out of a bad trap) when used with caution and wisdom (these carry some serious overhead) are a good way to catch and control problems that may occur from outside sources (bad remote data, no remote data) that would hinder a users pleasant experience.</p>

										<p><p>Not being harsh, you need to program better (as do we all). </p>
<p>I mentioned remote data, because we found that was the number one area that was presenting problems.  Web monkey puts bad data into the database, we pull bad data, bad data won&#39;t parse, is wrong, is malformed, and we get errors when applying it to variables, or manipulating it (i hate dates <em>grin</em>).  </p>
<p> Where are these failure points that are presenting errors for you?  Are they in the same general area of the code?  Can you find a pattern of any sort?</p>

										<p><p>Stephen,<br>I agree with you, the problem is that I have to consume and do a lot of stuff with datas comming from a server not made by me. Every case is not predictable (not stable serve</p>

										<p><p>In the desktop world, if the network was down, it was down for everyone. The problem became part of corporate &quot;culture&quot; if you would.  Now, however, the end user&#39;s network is up, but the servers might not be.  The joys of network expansion.  We have one mobile app, is fed from a server that has minute long delays in http responses randomly throughout the day.  But of course, its the apps fault, not the host.  <em>grin</em> (server monitoring now in place)</p>
<p>Hit me up on DeveMail and we&#39;ll see what we can hammer out with you.</p>
