			<p>I&#39;ve just finished my first 3 weeks with titanium. They&#39;ve been gulling, steep, fiddly and coming from .net, strange to be reading everything on a forum to make headway every time I&#39;m stuck. I&#39;ve lived on this thing for the last few weeks. Thank you to those community members that are active on here.</p>
<p>I&#39;m kinda happy with what I have at this point - a rather large iPhone app, that runs &#39;smoothish&#39;, but crashes a lot. However, really what&#39;s going to make me think a month investment in trying learn the Titanium platform is a complete waste or really fantastic will be week number 4.</p>
<p>Yesterday I tried to run my application on android, I got it onto my testing G2x (hoorah!) and it bombed on the first screen… I&#39;m not even going to bother figuring out why. I&#39;ve had enough working backwards troubleshooting from the top down and I&#39;m now aware of single vs multiple context applications and unfortunately I built my app modeled on the kitchen sink so I figure now that I&#39;ve learned a lot about titanium it&#39;s a good time to rebuild my app and test on both iphone&#x2F;g2x as I go.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve actually played now with 4 different architectures and considered a few different styles, KitchenSink (MultiContext&#x2F;InlineJss), JabMvc (SingleContext,Redux,TiAir,Rjss), MyCurrentArchitecture (MultiContext,Redux,Rjss), Tweetanium (SingleContext, ObjectJss+OSBranching).</p>
<p>Not only have I looked at and explored the code, but yesterday I deployed them to my G2x to see how each performed. Tweetanium seemed the bestish, JabMvc surprisingly failed to run booting slow and getting tons of runtime errors. Obviously my current architecture didn&#39;t work at all. Kitchen sink just doesn&#39;t seem like a real app you could model off.</p>
<p>SO… I&#39;ve decided I&#39;m going to rebuild my app from the beginning. Probably modeled most closely on tweetanium. Problem is:</p>
<p>a) I don&#39;t like the way tweetanium does styling. Tweetanium is a tiny app compared to mine and I think it will be hard to manage. Whist some people comment that the combining thing is flexible, I think it&#39;s gross to look at. I would much prefer a different style sheet for each target and some form of root level os&#x2F;target branch to include the desired stylessheet. I understand I could have a stylesIphone.js, stylesAndroid480800.s, stylesAndroid480854.js etc. - it is an option.</p>
<p>b) I&#39;m so confused about the state of jss, I&#39;ve read other threads on this forum asking about it with little answer and I&#39;ve been miserably failing to find examples, resources and documentation. Even the video that says it&#39;s going to talk about it doesn&#39;t mention anything on it: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeopro.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;building-native-mobile-applications&#x2F;video&#x2F;26414757</p>
<p>c) Tweetaniumw was written in JANUARY!! This platform and the thinking around it is evolving very quickly, but it&#39;s samples are lagging behind (I wish appcelerator would have a more solid iphone&#x2F;android base before trying to tackle everything else - I&#39;ve read tons of on stackoverflow and other websites of developers complaining and shooting down tatanium and that&#39;s because there is this sensation of going back to the dark ages coming from something more mature like .net). I feel like everyday I sit down and I have to make risky decision and trial them out, it&#39;s not a fun way to developer. I&#39;m concerned that tweetanium is probably not the most accurate full story reflection anymore of what are best practices. So I would like to know if it still is.</p>
<p>If you have any high level insight into difference from the tweetanium implementation that should be considered, where the hell things are at with jss, I really like reduxJss (Rjss) I wish that was what jss was, but just not ready to take a leap of faith on it right now, or have experience with a full blow app you&#39;ve built recently that runs well on both iphone &amp; android please make a comment on my post!</p>

							<p>great thought, thanks for sharing. In my case, I prefer tweetanium styling, modified to maintain different &#39;style.js&#39; files for different platforms. I think is easy to maintain, a good way to isolate style from code and still allows to use javascript coding for conditional styling or whatever you need.</p>
<p>Maybe things will change in a few years (or months, who knows), with interface design graphic tools, which would generate its own styling stuff isolated from code but, by now, I found tweetanium style so confortable.</p>

							<p>Personally I would recommend TiAir with redux &amp; rJSS. I&#39;ve made a few tweaks to the both TiAir and redux to fit my needs and improve performance (e.g. compiling rJSS files to js before building). I&#39;ve found it to be very flexible and a much nicer way to code. It also avoids many of the irritating bugs in Titanium.</p>

							<p>I use tweetanium for most apps these days, however I modified it a decent amount to fit my needs, as the sample implementation doesn&#39;t account for a lot of real world situations. The &quot;master context&quot; does make life a lot easier and I&#39;ve noticed significant improvements in terms of performance and stability. Kitchen Sink with the multiple contexts is meant to show API usage, not application architecture.</p>
<p>I certainly like the RJSS implementation in Dawson&#39;s Titanium Redux better than the styles.js implementation of Tweetanium, however you don&#39;t have to choose one or the other, you can use Redux with Tweetanium.</p>
<p>Being a .NET developer myself, I&#39;m guessing that you will appreciate <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dawsontoth&#x2F;TiAir">TiAir</a> more than anything else, as it closely resembles ASP.NET MVC, especially in the controller implementation.</p>

							<p>I was very unimpressed with TiAir. I looking back, I would highly recommend stick very tightly to tweettanium. Anything outside that box and your doomed on Titanium.</p>
