			<h1>Album artwork database</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Does anybody know if it&#39;s possible - or even legal - to access an album artwork database to display a thumbnail image along with the current song playing in a streaming radio app?</p>
<p>I have a potential customer with a shopping list of features and this is one of them! Apparently &quot;other&quot; radio apps he has seen have this feature.</p>

							<p>Apple offers this API for free and is quite complete (includes artwork):<br><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;itunes&#x2F;affiliates&#x2F;resources&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;itunes-store-web-service-search-api.html">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;itunes&#x2F;affiliates&#x2F;resources&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;itunes-store-web-service-search-api.html</a></p>

							<p>Pandora does it, but they have a deal in place with record companies for using music and artwork from the artists - I&#39;m not a lawyer, but I&#39;m pretty sure you would need to have similar permission from the artists is question.  But it&#39;s purely hypothetical until you have more details about what art is to be used, and where.</p>
<p>From a technical perspective, if the resource exists on the web (or is in your possession on disk), it is trivial to include it in your application as an image view, background image on a view, or inside a web view.  So there are no red lights from Titanium - very probably in the legal area, though.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Kevin. I was rather thinking there would be legal issues - trouble is nowadays everybody expects it all to be free. I doubt my potential client would be willing to pay a license fee to display album art in their app given they are a small on-line radio station.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Chris - as far as I can tell with a quick look the last.FM API can get artist images but I can&#39;t see any mention of album artwork. But it does a lot of other stuff that may be useful.</p>
