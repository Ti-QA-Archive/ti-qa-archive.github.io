			<h1>Industrial Strength App</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m contracted to build an industrial strength app. It&#39;s going to have a few hundred thousand users with payment processing</p>
<p>Does titanium deliver the goods here.  I&#39;d like to have a common code base but not at the expense of performance.</p>
<p>Has anyone tried the blackberry api? </p>
<p>It&#39;s bothering me that I can&#39;t try before I buy.  I&#39;d hate to commit to appcelerator  only to find out that the BB is not ready for prime time.</p>
<p>Please advise if anyone has built a professional industrial app. </p>

							<p>It depends on what you&#39;re doing.  You say you want a single code-base and you mention Blackberry, so I assume you&#39;re targeting multiple platforms.  Here, in my experience, are some things to keep in mind.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If you&#39;re targeting iPhone&#x2F;iOS, Titanium is pretty solid.  Obviously you can&#39;t use the most advanced features of the platform, but for a basic, form&#x2F;dialog-driven app, it&#39;s pretty good.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you&#39;re targeting anything else, Titanium is much less solid.  Regardless of the version number, Titanium for Android is beta-quality, at best.  There are far more unimplemented APIs, strange crashes, etc. on Android than iOS.</p>
</li>
<li><p>So target iOS first.  If you can&#39;t get it working on iOS, it&#39;s almost certainly not going to work on Android.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The documentation is abysmal.  It&#39;s incomplete, inconsistent, and sometimes just plain wrong.  Almost always you&#39;ll get the advice to refer to KitchenSink instead of the documentation.  So be prepared to go poking through the sample code to find the answers you want.</p>
</li>
<li><p>File bug tracker tickets.  Follow up.  But in the end be prepared to work around bugs yourself.  We&#39;ve had show-stopper tickets sitting unaddressed for months, leading to redesign on our end to find another way of doing things.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you&#39;re a decent programmer and the app is of reasonable size, it might be faster to implement it separately in Obj-C on iOS and Java on Android than to spend an inordinate amount of time working around holes in Titanium.  Despite being &quot;cross-platform&quot;, you&#39;re almost certainly going to end up with a lot of platform-specific code, except in Titanium it&#39;s going to be platform-specific Javascript talking to a sometimes-wonky toolkit layer.</p>
</li>
</ol>

							<p>Haven&#39;t tried the blackberry app, but it shouldnt matter how many clients you have. You should have those on a webserver instead, and have one user or so per device.</p>

							<p>I have not tried the blackberry beta, so can&#39;t comment on whether &quot;it is ready for prime time&quot; except to note that it IS still in beta. In my experience with other products, even when you first go GA you can anticipate there will be issues which were not discovered during beta and features which are still lacking.</p>
<p>So having a Pro or Enterprise level support plan may be very beneficial and cost effective, if you are really targeting having hundreds of thousands of users.</p>
<p>In terms of try before you buy, you can now get access to the blackberry beta for only $49&#x2F;month. And with GA scheduled for late June, you may only need to buy one month (or at most two) to get you out that far.</p>
<p>For payment processing, you will either need the Ti+Plus modules included with the paid support plans or need to develop your own equivalents or find &#x2F; license third-part modules to perform the payment processing.</p>
<p>Seems like $49 would be a pretty cheap way to try both the blackberry sdk and Ti+Plus payment modules.  </p>
<p>IMHO.  YMMV.</p>
