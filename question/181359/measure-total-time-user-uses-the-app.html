			<h1>Measure total time user uses the app</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi guys.</p>
<p>Is there any easy way to measure the total time a user is interacting with our apps? Not just the time when the app was opened, but the time when user uses the app (i.e., is in foreground).</p>
<p>I was thinking on create a timer when the app starts, detect when it goes to background to stop timer and continue timer when goes to foreground, but I have some questions with that:</p>
<ol>
<li>If I have 5 different windows, I must program all this in the 5 windows, or events like Ti.App.Event… will work always (once called in the index.js), no matter in what window the user leaves the app?</li>
<li>Because app can die, I will need to save current value every time it die and retrieve it on load to continue the measurement, true?</li>
<li>Is there any simpler method?</li>
</ol>
<p>I need it to gave my users, individually, the &quot;total time of use&quot; statistic.</p>

							<p>Hi Manuel Conde Vendrell,</p>
<p>As per my suggestion it&#39;s not good practice to start timer and continue during application running.. Because earlier i did same thing for change banners but it&#39;s create problem for me when i navigate to detail screen. (specially in android).</p>
<p>but i have one idea if you want to implement it.. </p>
<p>At the time of application launch set current time into one property and at the time of application pause (when go to background) calculate the difference of current time and started time and store it into property. and at the time of resume override start time property and set new time and at the time close app calculate new time + old total time (which is stored in property).</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>Hi Nilesh. It&#39;s a good idea.</p>
<p>Regardless point 1, I need to check all this in all windows, or I can develop it only in the initial window (index.js) and the <strong>pause</strong> and <strong>resume</strong> events will be fired up in any window?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

										<p><p>No need to add in all window because pause an resume event is a Ti.App events so just add it in root window either add it in alloy.js file if you using alloy</p>
