			<h1>xcode 4.2 question.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I installed xcode 4.2 with the iOS5 sdk, and titanium still works, etc etc.</p>
<p>However, I can&#39;t submit apps, because Apple isnt allowing it with that iOS version.  Can I install JUST the iOS 4.3 sdk alongside, so I can choose it when I&#39;m compiling?  I mainly did it this way because I have the beta on my phone, and am tired of having to upload to Testflight to test things for myself.</p>
<p>In Xcode, I told it to use the 4.3 version for the app, but it still doesn&#39;t work.</p>

							<p>It is more than the SDK.  Apple isn&#39;t accepting apps compiled with xCode 4.2 even if you target iOS 4.3 instead of iOS 5.0.  You can check the apple dev forums for a couple of threads concerning this.</p>

										<p><p>Ahh thanks.  I was up for 3 hours signing, resigning, rejecting and recreating certificates…finally rolled back and the old version works.</p>
<p>Strangely, now I can deploy to my 5 beta 6 device through xcode now.</p>

							<p>Anyone with access to Apple beta software, including iOS5 and the pre-release version of Xcode, has agreed via Apple&#39;s NDA not to discuss it in a public space. As this includes us, we will be obliged to close and lock any threads on the subject. Thus, kindly raise any issues, comments or feedback about Apple beta software in the Official Forum instead. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
