			<h1>Debugger on iOS causes the app to crash in the Emulator frequently</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi there</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been pulling my hair out for ages now trying to figure out why my app seemingly crashes at random points every time I debug it, and I&#39;ve finally found the root cause, and it&#39;s the damned debugger itself.</p>
<p>Every time I run the app in the iOS 4.3.2 emulator without the debugger enabled, the application runs perfectly every time.  As soon as I turn on the debugger, even without any break points set, the app crashes at random points (I have tried debugging and tracing to find where it crashes and every run seems to crash at a different point) in the code base.  The error message that is returned is completely useless and is usually something like &quot;[DEBUG] Session did end with error (null)&quot; and nothing else.  No exception is raised, no indication of where the execution stopped, no traceback.  I do sometimes see that there appears to be quite a few threads running at the point of the crash, but the debugger itself provides no hints as to what is running in those threads so I can&#39;t diagnose that.</p>
<p>I am running OS X Lion, Titanium Studio, build: 1.0.2.201107130739, Titanium SDK 1.7.2, iOS emulator 4.3.2.</p>
<p>Is anyone else experiencing the same issue?  Does this really mean that in order to build my app I have to now stop using the debugger.  This seems like madness that the tool I need to use to diagnose issues with code is in fact introducing new issues.  Help Appcelerator!</p>
<p>Any advice would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Matt</p>

							<div><p>Hi Matt. I also found debugger unestable, but not always (!). In my case, breakpoints sometimes works and sometimes crashes the app. And after using the debugger I have to clean \build folder one or two times before I can run the project again (not debugging). :(</p>
