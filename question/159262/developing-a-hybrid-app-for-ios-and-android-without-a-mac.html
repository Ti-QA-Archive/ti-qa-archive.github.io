			<h1>Developing a Hybrid App for iOS and Android without a Mac</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have just signed up and am very impressed thus far with the incredible support for the product, both in the forum and documentation.  I had a question that I hope doesn&#39;t shout too loud that I am a noob…I am interested in developing hybrid apps only but I can&#39;t seem to find the documentation on using Studio for this.  I watched the first &quot; Preparing for mobile development&quot; video and it references downloading the native SDKS from Apple and Android, but I work from a PC and can&#39;t load the iOS SDK&#39;s.  </p>
<p>Any feedback or link to the existing documention would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>Charles</p>

							<p>Hello Charles, welcome.<br>The answer is -as you suspected- that it&#39;s not possible to build for iOS on Linux or Windows.<br>You will need a Mac, with Xcode and the iOS SDKs to build your apps for Apple devices.</p>

							<p>Here&#39;s a question that may get me straight.  Can I build the app and then load studio and iOS SDKs on a friends MAC and compile it there?  So the platform for building the app isn&#39;t the problem, it&#39;s compiling it…? Is this correct?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

										<p><p>That is correct.  You can &quot;write&quot; the app, but you can&#39;t compile, run on a simulator or compile and load to a device without a Mac.</p>
