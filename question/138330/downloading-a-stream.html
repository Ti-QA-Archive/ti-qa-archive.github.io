			<h1>Downloading a stream</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to download a stream.</p>
<p>Its working - in that the file I&#39;m sending is in fact being downloaded, except its the wrong file. Its the resources file, not the actual media file.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the method I&#39;m using:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> url = <span class="hljs-string">"http://www.appSite.com/myFile.m3u8"</span>;
 <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> client = Ti.Network.createHTTPClient({
     <span class="hljs-comment">// function called when the response data is available</span>
     onload : <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{
         Ti.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">"Received text: "</span> + <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.responseText);
         alert(<span class="hljs-string">'success'</span>);
     },
     <span class="hljs-comment">// function called when an error occurs, including a timeout</span>
     onerror : <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> </span>{
         Ti.API.debug(e.error);
         alert(<span class="hljs-string">'error'</span>);
     },
     timeout : <span class="hljs-number">5000</span>  <span class="hljs-comment">// in milliseconds</span>
 });
 <span class="hljs-comment">// Prepare the connection.</span>
 client.open(<span class="hljs-string">"GET"</span>, url);
 <span class="hljs-comment">// Send the request.</span>
 client.send();
</code></pre><p>How can I download this video stream or video file? (i.e. the actual video&#x2F;audio frames) - is using this method correct for what I&#39;m trying to do? Should I be looking at Ti.stream ?</p>
<p>I had incorrectly thought that i need to use the &quot;nativePath&quot; variable, but it seems that this is incorrect.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Ebs</p>

							<p>A .m3u8 file is only a meta file which describes possible alternatives of a stream for differnt bandwidths.</p>
<p>Open it in a text editor and you will see the options. </p>
<p>If none of the files are being served via HTTP, then it is not possible to save&#x2F;download the stream (on Titanium), since they probably use RTSP or RMTP instead of HTTP. </p>
<p>Part of the reason for using a non-http &#39;stream&#39; for media is to actually stop people from downloading them and to protect copyright, etc.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you for the response, Kosso.</p>
<p>What about downloading it from the buffer whilst its playing? How can I access the movie&#x2F;mp3 buffer?? </p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>Hi. You can&#39;t in Titanium.  </p>
<p>And as I said, part of the reason why providers and creators of media use streaming technology like this is to STOP people downloading and pirating the media. </p>
<p>There are some very complicated ways to do this on a server or with some desktop software (most of which use an open source project called FFMPEG) but you won&#39;t get this in to Titanuim without a LOT more skill and knowledge of how these things work.</p>
<p>It sounds to me like you&#39;re trying to pirate a media stream in a mobile app. Not the smartest or easist thing to try and do with this platform.  ;)</p>

										<p><p>Hello Kosso,</p>
<p>We are the owners of the content. On the contrary, we would be happy for this to be downloaded by others and watched by others. Its a charitable organization. </p>
<p>Why do you say that its not smart to do this with Titanium? Are there memory leaks in performing these types of manipulations?</p>
<p>Given that this is actually &quot;legal&quot; (for us at least) - is it possible to perform this via the buffer?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<p><p>OK. If you&#39;re the owner of the content, then why don&#39;t you simply make the content accessible via HTTP? </p>
<p>Problem solved! :)</p>
<p>Regarding whether or not it is smart to try and download media from a technology designed to STOP people downloading media using Titanium. I think you&#39;re missing the point. </p>
<p>Do you have the means to do what you are trying to do on the desktop?  </p>
<p>Seriously. If it&#39;s your content, set up an HTTP server for the content downloading. This solution will not take much time at all to set up.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Kosso,</p>
<p>I was looking into that. The problem is that I&#39;d have to work with others the organization to get this part solved. The streaming is working fine after a LOT of outage. If I asked them to go and change their WOWZA server settings now, it will be a headache for everyone. </p>
<p>I&#39;m just doing the app part for this. I&#39;m not really responsible for the video encoding part. </p>
<p>Yes, we can download the video streams via desktop app. Real (the company real) have this pretty good tool that downloads all videos one sees from any website (i have the Mac version).</p>
<p>No worries.. if you say that this method cannot be used, I trust its best to drop this off the feature list.</p>
<p>If the owners want it added, then can you confirm that the above code I wrote would be OK (i.e. if they gave me the actual streaming URL, not the resources file?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
