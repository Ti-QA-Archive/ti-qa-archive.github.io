			<h1>Help with Testflightapp</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me how Testflightapp works?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve selected my project for distribution (with my provision profile to upload to the app store) and then xCode opened. Then I picked &#39;share&#39; and it created a .ipa file.</p>
<p>I went to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;testflightapp.com&#x2F; and dragged the .ipa file in there, but it gave an error saying </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Invalid profile: Does <span class="hljs-keyword">not</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">contain</span> provisioned devices, are you sure this 
<span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">not</span> a developer profile?
</code></pre><p>The developer profile is the profile you use to test on devices right?</p>
<p>I used the profile I normally use to upload to the app store. Which one should I use?</p>
<p>Can anyone perhaps explain some steps I have to take to get it uploaded there?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Tjeu.</p>

							<p>If you are planning on distributing your application via TestFlight you will need an Ad-Hoc provisioning profile generated through your Apple Developer account.</p>
<p>Every application I build has at least 2, often 3, different provisioning profiles assigned to them.</p>
<ol>
<li>Development</li>
<li>Ad-Hoc for outside testing</li>
<li>Distribution</li>
</ol>

							<p>We use testfilightapp.com and don&#39;t do ad-hoc builds. Instead, we put our tester&#39;s device id&#39;s into the development provisioning profile.  Testflight makes that easier by collecting those device ID&#39;s for you.</p>
<p>Note that I believe you can ONLY add 100 device id&#39;s per year to your developer profile, but I think you avoid that by using ad-hoc profiles.  I&#39;d love to know for sure, so if anyone can clear that up for me, I&#39;d be grateful.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

										<p><p>No, I believe each apple developer account is restricted to 100 devices per year.  If you remove some devices, those devices are no longer able to install the app but you still can&#39;t add more devices.  To get past 100 devices, I think you need to use another developer account.</p>
<p>An alternative for those who qualify is an Enterprise Developer account.  Enterprise profiles are similar to ad-hoc distribution profiles but with two major differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can be installed on an unlimited number of devices</li>
<li>The profile does not need to contain the UDIDs</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, an app with a valid enterprise profile can be installed on virtually any iphone&#x2F;ipod using testflightapp or other OTA means, or iTunes or whatever.</p>
<p>The caveat is that the Enterprise license is designed for internal use by a corporation.  It cannot be used for general distribution outside of a qualified enterprise setting.  You can read more about it <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;programs&#x2F;ios&#x2F;enterprise&#x2F;">here</a>.</p>
