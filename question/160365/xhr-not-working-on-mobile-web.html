			<h1>XHR Not Working on Mobile Web</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;ve run the most basic XHR test on the a new mobileweb build 3.1.3 (and 3.1.2) and can&#39;t get it to communicate with the server.  I also can&#39;t find this on the JIRA list of issues.  I&#39;m curious if anyone has run into this same issue with a mobile web build.</p>

							<div><p>Thanks for responding Trevor.  I think the reason has to do with not having a proxy to my server.  The reason I was trying this in the first place is because I couldn&#39;t get ACS to work on the mobile web.  Do you know if ACS works with the mobile web or does it suffer the same issues as all http requests on the mobile web?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Just in case this comes down to a cross domain issue; from the docs;</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mobile Web Platform Implementation Notes</strong></p>
<p><em>Mobile Web is limited by the same-origin policy. According to W3C: &quot;User agents commonly apply same-origin restrictions to network requests. These restrictions prevent a client-side Web application running from one origin from obtaining data retrieved from another origin, and also limit unsafe HTTP requests that can be automatically launched toward destinations that differ from the running application&#39;s origin.&quot; This means that browsers cannot request information from a domain that the app itself does not reside on. If you are hosting the app at foo.example.com, then requests to any domain other than </em>.example.com will fail.*</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Check here for more details and potential workarounds;</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Malcolm.  I&#39;ve ran some more tests and I actually think this is broken in 3.0.  As you can see with this test I ran where the site it is accessing is setup for CORS - http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;160454&#x2F;httprequest-works-on-ipad-fails-on-mobileweb</p>
