			<p>Hi,<br>I have an odd problem with the camera in my app.<br>I want to take two pictures and place them in my windows side by side (with a little gap).<br>This works fine and i have got the camera returning images and populating the views.</p>
<p>However, when i take a picture and then say &#39;use&#39; it rightly returns me to the window where i came from with the images side by side.</p>
<p>When i click to populate the second image i get the camera view but it is all black except a square 25% of the screen in the top left.</p>
<p>If i take a picture it takes the full screen showing the blacked out area and the small amount of view.</p>
<p>Strangely if i go into the camera on the second try and click on cancel then go back into it, its fine.</p>
<p>Is there some way to release the camera? Or set the size of it or something.<br>I am calling a function to open the camera;-</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">showCamera</span>(<span class="hljs-params">pictype</span>)</span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> overlayView = Titanium.UI.createView({
      width:<span class="hljs-number">320</span>,
      height:<span class="hljs-number">460</span>,
      top:<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,
      backgroundImage:<span class="hljs-string">'backgrounds/picTargetShape.png'</span>
    });

    Titanium.Media.showCamera({
      success:<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">event</span>)
      </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> cropRect = event.cropRect;

    }<span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>{
        savePhotoToDB(<span class="hljs-string">'your'</span>, filename, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>);
    }
    refreshPicContent();<span class="hljs-comment">// this populates the views </span>
    Ti.Media.hideCamera();
      },
      cancel:<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>)</span>{
    Ti.Media.hideCamera();
    },
      error:<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">error</span>)
      </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> a = Titanium.UI.createAlertDialog({title:<span class="hljs-string">'Camera'</span>});
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (error.code == Titanium.Media.NO_CAMERA){
      a.setMessage(<span class="hljs-string">'There does not appear to be a camera'</span>);
    }<span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>{
      a.setMessage(<span class="hljs-string">'Unexpected error: '</span> + error.code);
    }
    a.show();
      },
    mediaTypes:Ti.Media.MEDIA_TYPE_PHOTO,
    autohide:<span class="hljs-literal">false</span>, 
    overlay:overlayView,
      allowEditing:<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>,
      showControls:<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
    });
}
</code></pre><p>I am trying everything i can think of but there is nothing in the API that suggests you can or need to set sizes or release the camera or anything.<br>Also the fact that a cancel and re-open makes it work again makes me think that if i could simulate whatever cancel does then i could force it.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jez </p>
<p>p.s. I have posted quite a lot of questions on here and i really appreciate how helpful everyone is, so if i have not said before, then Thank you for any answers!!</p>

<p>I do need to use an overlay as its part of the app design so i will try some things with the overlay.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

							<div><p>Hmmm… yes as soon as i add the overlay back into the mix then it does the same thing… the example of an overlay in kitchen sink suggests that i should make the image view first then add it to an overlay view and then use that… which produces the same result.</p>
<p>If this was a big problem then i would expect to find more questions on here about it, but since it is only me, it must be in the code.</p>
<p>The camera does appear on the second call and the overlay is in the right place (centered over the whole window) but only a small area is visible in the top left corner.</p>

							<p>I think i am closer to solving this.</p>
<p>It could be something to do with the HDR functions now on the iPhone as the second image is much smaller, then when you cancel it gives a normal image and then a smaller one etc.</p>
<p>So, here is my question how do you programmatically disable HDR for the camera in your app.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jeremy</p>

							<p>I have a camera problem that sounds a lot like this one: I&#39;m using an overlay for the buttons, and the first time you use the camera, everything works just fine.</p>
<p>However, after either taking a picture or cancelling it, the second time you open the camera, the camera view seems to have shifted in some way? Only the top left quarter of the screen shows some of the camera view now. However, if you take the picture, it still shows the whole cameraview, and it seems the view that was visible was the bottom right part of the camera.</p>
<p>If you return to the home menu and access the camera a third time, it seems to be just fine again.</p>
<p>I have no idea what I&#39;m doing wrong, because the commands I use for accessing the camera from the home menu are exactly the same as the other ones…?</p>
