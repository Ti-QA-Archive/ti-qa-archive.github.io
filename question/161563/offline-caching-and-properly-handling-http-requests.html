			<p>Hello guys,</p>
<p>I am trying to find an answer for my question for months, and I can&#39;t be the only one that has this problem.</p>
<p>How do you handle XHR requests properly? How do you store them, or how do you syncronize the app&#39;s database with the server if the device is offline, or has a bad connection? I&#39;m searching for a module or wrapper around httpClient for ages. Until now, I am storing the items that will be sent to the server into a table, with a synced column. If the device is online, I make the request. If it fails, I try 3 more times. If it fails, I set the app to offline mode for 1 hour, or until you disable it from settings or I detect a connection change. When in offline mode, no requests are sent, all is done locally. Also when a network change is detected I iterate the table to see what I have to sync. But my method is far from perfect, it fails often.</p>
<p>How do you do it properly? I can&#39;t be the only one that has this issue.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>Depends on the app and the data.  In many cases, we simply pull in the data json&#x2F;xml, process it and display.</p>
<p>For other apps, we pull in the json&#x2F;xml file, save to a file, then we process them from there.  In this case, we often tag them with a date that we can use to check in subsequent runs to see if we need to repull them, or just process the file that sits locally.</p>
<p>For other apps, we pull the data, process the json&#x2F;xml file, saving the entries to a table so they are available offline, and set the date&#x2F;time of the pull as a property that we can check at a future time to see if we need to pull the remote data.</p>
<p>A sample of the later case can be found in the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mcongrove&#x2F;ChariTi">ChariTI app</a></p>
<p>Should say that we used to also do this with images, before images in an image view were cached automagically.</p>

										<p><p>The decision comes down to:</p>
<p>how often does the content&#x2F;data actually change?</p>
<p>how important is it that the user have the latest content?</p>
<p>how important is it that the user have access to content offline?</p>
<p>how much is your client willing to pay?</p>
