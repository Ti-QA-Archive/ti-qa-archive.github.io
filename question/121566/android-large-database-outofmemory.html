			<h1>Android large database outOfMemory</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,<br>I&#39;m installing sql database (15.5mb it&#39;s a dictionary) on android like </p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-setting">db = <span class="hljs-value">Titanium.Database.install(<span class="hljs-string">'android/newWorld.mp3'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'newWorld'</span>);</span></span>
</code></pre><p>but everytime I launch the install ,(after first time I do check if file exists =&gt; than I do delete it so install does install every time trust me on this one), the android console outputs error starting like </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">....
<span class="hljs-number">06</span>-<span class="hljs-number">24</span> <span class="hljs-number">20</span>:<span class="hljs-number">02</span>:<span class="hljs-number">01.737</span>: ERROR/dalvikvm-heap(<span class="hljs-number">1447</span>): Out of memory on a <span class="hljs-number">15074320</span>-byte allocation.
.... 
and bunch of stuff here and app exits / force close
</code></pre><p>How can I overcome this problem ? can it be that only emulator is unable to install this file ? I do not have any device near by to test if it would install this 15.5mb file correctly but I hope it would as iphone simulator &amp; device are working correctly.</p>
<p>Can someone help me with this emulator ? Or ensure me that on device it will work ?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<div><p>Lukas,</p>
<p>In order to get an answer to your question, you&#39;re going to have to give a bit more information. What version of the platform and mobile sdk are you using? Can you please post the rest of the error that you are receiving (everything replaced by &quot;and a bunch of stuff here …&quot;). If the error is extremely long, you can use something like Pastie and share the link. </p>
<p>Just on a side note, are you trying to install an MP3 as a database?</p>

							<div><p>Sure it is an SQLite database, but as I&#39;ve learned from some of already answered questions, to get larger database packaged into apk you should &quot;mask&quot; it as mp3, or is it an outdated workaround ?</p>

							<p>Ok, as for now I&#39;m pretty sure that the &quot;name your database as .mp3 to get it packaged into final .apk&quot;-workaround is not the source of the problem, and that is not required to mask it as mp3 anymore.<br>That&#39;s the good message, but as for the 15mbyte allocation problem and therefore app crash - still no solution.</p>
<p>Waiting hopefully for any response. Thanks in Advance</p>

							<p>As it seems you know, the install method will copy the file from the resources folder to another location which is not read-only on the device.  This means you actually consume twice the storage necessary, and you can&#39;t delete the resource copy after the install because the folder is read only.</p>
<p>With a db of that size, I would recommend doing one of two things instead of using the Ti.Database.install method:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#39;t include it at all, and download from a server on first use</li>
<li>Zip the database in the resources folder, then extract on device</li>
</ul>
<p>In either case, you need to know the path and filename of where Titanium will expect to find the &quot;installed&quot; database.  Place the (uncompressed) file there and you can use the Ti.Database.open method instead of install().<br>The method I use to determine the path and filename is <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;96771&#x2F;location-of-titanium-sql-database-on-android">here</a>.</p>
<p>Once you know that, you can either use httpClient to download the db direct to the final destination.  Or if that is not practical for you, extract a compressed copy of the database from the resource folder to that location using <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;2974798&#x2F;unzip-file-from-zip-archive-of-multiple-files-on-android-using-zipfile-class">this</a> for android and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;TermiT&#x2F;ZipFile">this</a> module for iOS.</p>

										<p><p>So, now I&#39;ve moved somewhere where I was at the beginning :D now the file I move to the &#39;&#x2F;data&#x2F;data&#x2F;app_id&#x2F;databases&#x2F;nameOfDb&#39; is once again only 3kb of size which means that it did not copy the original pre-populated database. How can it be that it is unable to simply move the original file to final destination at once, and it only leaves some corrupted database of 3kb size ?</p>
<p>Do you have any experience with this kind of thing happening ?<br>But I admit :D we&#39;ve move a little now I can see my UI initialized, as before it died before initialization (splashscreen)</p>

										<p><p>No, I have not had this problem.  How are you determining the file is 3kb?  And how are you &quot;moving&quot; the file?  You cannot do a file move, because the resources folder is read-only.  You must do a file copy, leaving the original in place.</p>
<p>I am wondering if the file &quot;move&quot; is not working at all, then you use an open() command and it is creating a new database.  I have not checked the size of those, but perhaps 3KB is the size of a &quot;new&quot; database?</p>
<p>Can you show us the code to &quot;move&quot; the database?  Immediately after it, and before any open() method, can you dump the .size property of the file to the console window or an alert?  For that matter, dump the .size property of the original resource folder as well.</p>
<p>We&#39;re to the point that without sample code, we are shooting in the dark.</p>

										<p><p>And how do I &quot;copy&quot; a file then ? I&#39;ve found no command like copy in API for File&#x2F;Filesystem so I&#39;ve tried the .move() to new path &#39;&#x2F;data&#x2F;data&#x2F;….&#x2F;file&#39;.</p>

        }
    }
</code></pre><p>I do know that it is a 3kb file because the DDMS module installed in Studio can access the data&#x2F;data&#x2F; folder of the emulator and there the database has only 3kb but the titanium Db has 4kb or something like that.</p>
<p>So how exactly am I supposed to copy the file ? thanks for your time</p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t think the move method can work here, because that would require removing the file link from the resources folder.  On devices, the resources folder (and everything below it) is read-only.  So I think the move is bound to fail.  Perhaps it copies 3K of data before it figures that out?  Never tried it myself.</p>
<p>There is no documented copy method, as you note.  It seems often there are more things available then show in the official API docs, so I guess you could try a .copy() and see if one exists.  But the way I have copied files in the past is to get file object references to both the source and destination files, then use something like:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">db_dest.<span class="hljs-command">write</span>(db_source.<span class="hljs-command">read</span>());
</code></pre><p>Caveat emptor:  I have never tried that on a 15.5MB file, and you may be back to the original error of the install() method running out of memory.</p>
<p>The last time I needed to copy a file, the new filestream support of 1.7.x was not available.  If you can&#39;t get by with the simple statement above, using filestreams you could now setup a loop and read say 1MB chunks at a time to read from the source and write to the destination.  Or smaller than 1MB to minimize memory usage.</p>
<p>However, instead of doing that I&#39;d urge you to zip the database in the resource folder, then extract it to the desired location.  This would push off the incremental file writing to the zip decompression routine.</p>
<p>As mentioned in my original reply, to decompress in android you should take a look at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;2974798&#x2F;unzip-file-from-zip-archive-of-multiple-files-on-android-using-zipfile-class">this</a> code.  With a 15.5MB resource file, I really think it is the better approach to take here.</p>

										<p><p>A few comments.  First, on your outstream.write you don&#39;t want to specify 0 for the offset each time.  I believe that will continually overwrite the first 1024 bytes of your output file with each 1K chunk as you read it.  Try changing that line to simply:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">outstream.<span class="hljs-keyword">write</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">buffer</span>);
</code></pre><p>and I think Titanium will take care of the rest for you.</p>
<p>Second, is the outstream &quot;f&quot; file object really on the SDcard?  The .error text at the top of the last code block mentions the SDcard.  You don&#39;t want it there, as the database should be in internal memory.  Use the &quot;f&quot; setup from your attempt to use .move – that is, you want:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> f = Ti.Filesystem.getFile(<span class="hljs-string">'file:///data/data/'</span> + Ti.App.id + <span class="hljs-string">'databases/'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'newWorld'</span>);
</code></pre><p>Third, if you want to try the httpClient again, take a look at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;35041&#x2F;large-file-download-on-mobile">this</a> thread as it shows how to avoid the out of memory error in Android for large files.  Although this thread was specifically about Android, for the sake of the archives and people who read this in the future, in iOS it is even simpler to download direct to a file.  Set the httpClient object .file property after the .open and before the .send, as shown in the kitchen sink <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;KitchenSink&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;examples&#x2F;xhr_filedownload.js">file download</a> example.</p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t think you need to if you do what I suggest above.  But while looking for that thread to reference for you, I also stumbled on a thread which said there is an undocumented variation to the Filesystem.write method in android, which lets you append to the end of a file:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">f.<span class="hljs-command">write</span>(bytes,<span class="hljs-constant">true</span>);
</code></pre><p>Adding the second argument and setting it to true switches the write() to append mode in android (but I don&#39;t think iOS).  So you may be able to use that in your onDatastream event, without even needing the filestream.  Make sure you delete any previous file before the httpClient send operation.</p>
<p>The filestream should work too.</p>

							<p>So to sum this up.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve managed to get httpClient working (that one from your link, thanks)<br>as for now app is able to download database from internet to SDcard, and install it properly to the database folder IN device, and remove the SDcard file which is no longer needed.</p>
<p>I believe it has something to do with 1.7.2 nightly&#x2F;continuos build I&#39;ve downloaded maybe some problems where fixed already.</p>
<p>Anyway if someone need to have database file of 10mb or bigger I advice you to </p>
<ol>
<li>Download the database file from the internet with utilisation of <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;35041&#x2F;large-file-download-on-mobile">this script</a><br>For android only of course as for iOS, the database can be prepackaged with the app, no problems there.</li>
<li>Then install it as you normally would by Ti.Database.install()</li>
<li>Remove downloaded file if you care for data stored in your DB and you don&#39;t want to let everybody get to it so easily </li>
</ol>
<p>That&#39;s it, and Thank you very much Doug for helping me. </p>
<p>Cheers</p>
