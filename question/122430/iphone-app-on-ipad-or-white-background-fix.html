			<h1>iPhone app on iPad (Or white background fix)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello</p>
<p>Is it possible to install the app on an iPad device, but it is installed as an iPhone app instead of iPad? Because the iPad settings are not good yet (the tableviews background is white instead of the striped one).</p>
<p>Or can this background problem be fixed with a workaround? That would be even better!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Tjeu</p>

							<p>Yes, you can choose not to create for iPad when you creare your project<br>in Ti Studio, or if you&#39;ve already created for iPad, I think you can turn<br>That flag off in the Tiappxml file. You could then choose to run te<br>IPhone app on the ipad simulator.  However, if your only<br>concern is th table background, you can change the colors - don&#39;t<br>know offhand for the striped one you need.</p>

										<p><p>I knew in iOS this striping appeared for Grouped Tables, so try this Ti property…<code>style:Titanium.UI.iPhone.TableViewStyle.GROUPED</code> which appears in Kitchen Sink for the &#39;table_view_refresh.js&#39; and seems to do it.</p>

										<p><p>Yes, I know.. That&#39;s what I have used.. But when you run the app on the iPad (as an iPad application) the background will be white. I need to know how that can be fixed :p</p>

										<p><p>Ok, now I see what you mean - just ran KiSink on iPad sim and I see the white where in iPhone sim it would be striped gray.  Probably a bug that should be reported, but in the meantime I guess you&#39;ll have to &#39;fake it&#39; with some kind of backgroundColor&#x2F;gradient combo, or perhaps create an image.png of the real thing and try using that as a background image or something…</p>

										<p><p>The bug has been reported a several of times i think, but still not fixed. I was away for a while, so I hoped they had fixed it in the newer SDK versions, but doesn&#39;t seem to be</p>
