			<p>I understand that enabled is deprecated, but is there a difference between the two. I am trying to style my buttons differently based on if they are enabled or not, but touchEnabled does not seem to take that into account. In my style sheet I specify disabled color and color, but if I leave enabled alone, disabled color does not show up when it should, regardless of the value of touchEnabled. Additionally when setting touchEnabled to false (and doing nothing with enabled) I can still use whatever button I am trying. This is on an iOS simulator if that makes any difference.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>There is a difference right now, but seems that difference is merging. Currently</p>
<ul>
<li>Ti SDK 3.2.x and lower;<ul>
<li>enabled = this view cannot be interacted with by the user! will accept events! manually fired ones.  The presentation of the button was affected by this property.</li>
<li>touchEnabled = this view does not accept events and passes any event up to the next parent level.  No presentational changes will occur for true or false.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ti SDK 3.3 and higher<ul>
<li>enabled is deprecated and should no longer be used</li>
<li>touchEnabled = no events accepted, passes them up to the parent and &#39;should&#39; affect the styles of presentation </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The first thing to note is that this change does not occur until Ti SDK 3.3 which at the time of writing is still at RC (release candidate) stage.  Although it should be available very shortly.  So unless you are using that SDK your expected result will not happen.</p>
<p>Earlier I said &#39;should&#39; as I have not personally tested the touchEnabled property effect on the disabled state of buttons in 3.3 RC.</p>
