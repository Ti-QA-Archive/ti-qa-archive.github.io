			<h1>Show view first when layout is rendered</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>My app consists of a couple of &quot;complex&quot; views (contains many nested views). When the app is starting I can actually see how all of those elements are being put in place, and it&#39;s not very beautiful. I want to make sure that the content is finished rendering before i show it to the user. Kind of like the <code>ready</code> event works like in jQuery.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation</strong></p>
<p>Right now the app work as </p>
<ol>
<li>Show activity indicator</li>
<li>Load data from server or local DB</li>
<li>Bind data to view</li>
<li>Hide activity indicator</li>
</ol>
<p>However, sometimes the view hasn&#39;t finished rendering before the data is loaded and bound to the view. On slow devices, it can look really ugly for a couple of seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>I want to detect when the view has finished rendering. Then, I can wait by showing it until it&#39;s all finished. I imagine that I would have to listen to some kind of event to detect this, but i haven&#39;t found anyone that&#39;s been working.</p>
<p><strong>What I&#39;ve tried</strong></p>
<p>I tried listening for the <code>postlayout</code> event. I tried attaching it to both the window and one of the parent views that&#39;s containing complex layout. It never get&#39;s fired. This I tried on iOS (7.1 and 8). Ultimately, a solution that works on iOS as well as Android would be optimal.</p>
<p><strong>Versions</strong></p>
<p><em>Titanium SDK</em>: 3.4.0.GA<br><em>iOS</em>: 7.1 &#x2F; 8.0<br><em>Android</em>: 4.0+</p>
<p>Do you have any idea of how to accomplish this?</p>

							<div><p><code>postlayout</code> will tell you when the view finished rendering, but will also be triggered on orientation changes.</p>
<p>The question I now have for you is, why do you want to pre-load all those views at once?  I&#39;m curious as to what your navigation looks like and which native containers are you using for it.</p>
