<p>What version of Node.js do you have installed? Node.js 0.10.X is only supported by Titanium 3.1.0 or newer (as of right now, 3.1.0 has not been released)</p>

							<p>Adnan,</p>
<p>The error you posted indicates that you need android-10 along with its equivalent level 10 google apis.  This is the minimum level required to get started using Titanium at this time.  This does NOT mean you cannot include higher level APIs and set them as your target api level, it just means that the Titanium tooling expects a minimum level of android support to be installed.</p>
<p>The second error you posted indicates you are trying to build a project that eother has TiSDK 2.1.2 set in nits tiapp.xml (which in your case, this is a new project, so that is probably not the case) or you have 2.1.2 installed an not the newer versions of the sdk.</p>
<p>Toss us the report generated by <code>ti info</code>, properly formatted, and we can take a look to see what else you are lacking.</p>

										<p><p>Wow.  You just want to argue up a storm don&#39;t you? </p>
<ol>
<li><p>My answer about your missing versions came AFTER you posted this image: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinypic.com&#x2F;view.php?pic=2w38d9j&amp;s=8#.Uz2DCK1dVuU which CLEARLY shows that you DID NOT HAVE THEM INSTALLED.</p>
</li>
<li><p>My answer about your tisdk version comes from this image (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinypic.com&#x2F;view.php?pic=14y6cu1&amp;s=8#.Uz2DM61dVuU) that shows you are trying to build against 2.1.2.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I&#39;v been thinking about this while typing, since you seem to know so much more  allow me to say &#39;physician, heal thyself&#39; - unsubscribing.</p>

										<p><p>I don&#39;t know what pissed you much or had some bad incident for you today. My mistake I did not upload new snapshot. </p>
<p>I am not trying to be smart ass here. Just that I am feeling helpless how to fix shit up. You are happy to unsubscribe. I don&#39;t need your help. Thankyou</p>
