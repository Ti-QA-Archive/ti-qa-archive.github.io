							<p>The V8 runtime is a bit larger than the Rhino .jar file - we&#39;re looking at ways to potentially mitigate this, but shipping the V8 shared library does result in an increased binary size.</p>

							<p>Another thing that I notice with SDK 1.8.0.1 is that in addition to the APK increasing from 2.5mb to 6mb is that the JS files in the APK are no long compiled. The JS files in SDK 1.7.5 were compiled but if you use SDK 1.8 they&#39;re no longer compiled - this is the case should you choose Rhino or V8.</p>
<p>Why is are JS no long compiled and why are they included in the deploy&#x2F;final APK?</p>

							<p>Also, if you&#39;re targeting Rhino, you&#39;re getting the Rhino interpreter, as well a two versions of the V8 interpreter, each targeting a separate ARM7 ABI.  All packed into your .apk.  For whatever unknown reason.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re targeting V8, you might only be getting the two V8 libraries – I&#39;m not sure if Rhino is still included.</p>
<p>You can look at the compiled .apk to see what I mean.  There&#39;s a metric ton of stuff bundled in there that you didn&#39;t have&#x2F;need before.</p>
<p>No clue whatsoever what Appcelerator is thinking with this one.  Even two ARM7 versions shouldn&#39;t be necessary: simply target the lower ABI.</p>

							<p>Hey guys, I&#39;ve filed a bug for the runtimes being all bundled together:<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-7472</p>
<p>On top of this, do you think it would be good for us to expose an option for only bundling the <code>armeabi</code> (compatibility) or <code>armeabi-v7a</code> (speed) versions of our shared lib?</p>

										<p><p>Yes.  Not every app needs FPU support and the doubling (or so) in size that accompanies it.</p>
