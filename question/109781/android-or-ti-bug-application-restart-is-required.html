			<h1>Android or TI bug &#34;application restart is required&#34; </h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I created an app and it is working fine in the emulator. But when I am testing on my devices (android) I keep getting this error &quot;application restart is required&quot;.</p>
<p>I have tried it on my Mac and PC running, TI 1.2.2 and SDK 1.5 &amp; 1.6.</p>
<p>My devices are a Droid X and Incredible running Android 2.2.</p>
<p>I have looked though the Q&amp;A and have tried everything listed in the Q&amp;A. I tried the nightly build 1.6.0, didn’t work I tried building from source (1.5 &amp; 1.6). I tried the workaround documented in Lighthouse.</p>
<p>The issue is installing the &quot;app&quot; on the device. I put the .apk file on the device and install it. Once the install is complete I get this error &quot;application restart is required&quot;.</p>

							<p>Just in case somebody is still dealing with this issue, the solution is to add the following property tag to you <code>tiapp.xml</code> file.</p>
<p>This fix was introduced on Titanium SDK 2.1.2 so make sure you&#39;re using that version as a minimum.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">property</span> <span class="hljs-property">name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"ti.android.bug2373.finishfalseroot"</span> type=<span class="hljs-string">"bool"</span>&gt;<span class="hljs-constant">true</span>&lt;/<span class="hljs-keyword">property</span>&gt;
</code></pre><p>Titanium SDK builds can be found here:</p>

										<p><p>@Boydlee, in my case I had the property misplaced. Check below:<br>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;109781&#x2F;android-or-ti-bug-application-restart-is-required#answer-256432</p>
<p>I was putting the property on the Android node but it has to be on ti:app main node. That fixed it for me.</p>

							<p>There are now more options available for dealing with the Google bug that we&#39;re working around. See <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-4941">TIMOB-4941 - Android: More graceful workaround for Android Bug 2373 &amp; 5277</a> for configuration options.</p>
<p>To provide a little more detail, this is a bug in the android market app that doesn&#39;t launch applications the same way as the home screen. Therefore, Android sees it as two different invocations of the app and you&#39;ll have multiple copies of your app running if you open it right after install, press home, and then launch the app again from the home screen.</p>
<p>The new options allow you to disable this workaround and have exposure to the same bug as native Android apps or you can also more flexibly message and restart the app w&#x2F;o user intervention. It&#39;s completely up to you now to deal with it as you see fit for your app.</p>

										<p><p>It looks like google fixed the bug in Android 4, because I do not see the app closing and opening with the correct intent. I can&#39;t 100% confirm though. I can confirm that SDK 1.8.1 has the fix if you add the properties in tiapp.xml.<br>This worked for me (no toast message):</p>

										<p><p>This is definitely not fixed.  It is a major source of complaint from Google as well - and if one is trying to get their app featured in their App Market, this is potentially going to be a show stopper (it has been a consistent complaint from Google for us in our discussions with them).</p>
<p>The way this manifests is if you try to launch your app after install, from the Market.  i.e. install app from App Market, then when it asks if you&#39;d like to launch it, say yes.  You&#39;ll then get this message.  If you search elsewhere in the Titanium Q&amp;A I believe, you&#39;ll find the reference to the Android SDK issue that causes this.</p>

							<p>There is a solution to this that is detailed <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-9285?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#issue-tabs">here</a>. Just follow the instructions in the JIRA ticket (TIMOB-9285). It will require you to add a property to your tiapp.xml and you need to use ci build 2.1.2 (at the time of this posting).</p>

										<p><p>@Don - as expected?  <em>&quot;This application requires a restart&quot;</em> is acceptable and as expected!?  Appcelerator probably won&#39;t get too many paid subscription users out of those expectations. Ti apps are the only one&#39;s I&#39;ve installed that do that and they do that on every device on first install, in my experience.</p>

										<p><p>@shane I couldn&#39;t agree with you more.  We are currently weighing the possibility of buying a subscription package, but when I find bugs like these that are &quot;working as expected&quot; in the free version, and the solution is compile the source code myself, subscriptions just took a hit in value.</p>
<p>Throw in the support-screens (1.7.0) change that suddenly breaks layouts.</p>

							<p>In my experience, the message only happens when you open the program directly from the install notification message.  If you instead close that notification and open the program directly from the list of installed programs, you do not see that message even on the initial launch.</p>
<p>It may be a similar situation as what got fixed in this <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;32238&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;2649-android-detecting-second-instance-causes-npe">ticket</a>.  That one was more serious though.  It caused a null pointer exception – or a hang on the splash screen – and this is just a minor inconvenience.</p>

										<p><p>Doug,<br>Thank you for your comment. I have seen that ticket and have tried the workaround and it still doesnt work.</p>
<p>It might be a minor inconvenience but it is a &quot;BUG&quot;. This bug needs to be resolved.</p>
<p>Does everyone who builds apps in Titanium have this same issue with Android apps????????<br>David</p>

										<p><p>I have an app in the market place built from Titanium, it also gives this message.  It&#39;s embarrassing and I hope this BUG gets resolved quickly.  I do not look forward to charging for future apps when the first impression is essentially a crash.  Ti 1.6.2</p>

							<p>I ran into this problem today, and since there isn&#39;t much to do short of recompiling, I updated the message that pops up so it doesn&#39;t scream &quot;Bug!&quot; so much.</p>
<p>By adding the following to your tiApp.xml, you can modify the language that is shown in the alert dialog:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">property</span> <span class="hljs-property">name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"ti.android.bug2373.message"</span>&gt;App initialized, Restart Required.&lt;/<span class="hljs-keyword">property</span>&gt;

							<p>Hi! Unfortunately I&#39;m still seeing this issue after trying the new fix. The phone is a Galaxy S3 SCH-R530M running 4.0.4. This the relevant part of my Tiapp.xml:</p>

    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">android</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>I&#39;ve tried both SDK2.1.2 and SDK3.0.0. Everytime I run the application from the installation menu I get the cursed &quot;application restart is required&quot;.</p>
<p>Can there be something else I&#39;m missing? My project was created back in 1.7.2 if I remember correctly, so wondering if there may be some other dependency&#x2F;config introduced in between that I&#39;m missing.</p>

										<p><p>To my knowledge, that is just the way it works right now.  The ticket I referenced in the other reply was talking about a more serious issue (in my opinion) where the program would either hang or give a null pointer exception.  That problem has been fixed.</p>
<p>If this message bothers other people (I can live with it), then somebody needs to raise it as an issue in lighthouse.  Personally, I care much more about other pending tickets.</p>
