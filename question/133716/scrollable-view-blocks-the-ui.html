			<p>I have 1.8.2 ios and scroll up or down on a scrollable view results in blocking the ui; the ui is not responsive for up to few seconds sometimes and then kicks back in;</p>
<p>has anyone else experienced this? is this a common bug?</p>
<p>thanks</p>

										<p><p>sorry I cannot; which I know is not helpful; in a nut shell I have a scrollable view which I use as a inner tabs implementation. inside the views are tableview with table rows; </p>
<p>I am going to try to extract what I have so I can make a small example.<br>But the structure remains; scrollview - view - tableview - tablerow</p>
<p>NOte this only happens on the Device and not in the IOS iphone emulator.</p>
<p>You scroll down the table rows; and the ui is now blocked; you cannot clikc on tabgroups or anywhere; about 2 seconds later the ui comes back and plays all the clicks that you previously did;</p>

							<p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>Try to debug you code in XCode, for that you have to open your build project in to xcode project and run, see the error log when you click the view or tableView or row.</p>
<p>if you should put the info in each event and layer.</p>

										<p><p>good advice; </p>
<p>its not on a click event where it locks the ui; its actually scrolling the table view. as this only happens on the device I will see if I can debug in xcode with the device if possible, thanks</p>

										<p><p>I have debug and there is no error generated; any ios app that runs on the device and their application uses a scrollable view with table rows is going to have this problem as far as I am concerned; scrollable views are not useable for ios currently</p>

										<p><p>Hi Richard,<br>may be this type of structure can not decide from global points what should be scroll, but I did not decide yet why are you using this structure?</p>
<p>table should not use inside scrollview and scrollable view in most of condition.</p>

										<p><p>scrollableview comes from creating inner tabs; so we have tabgroup but a tab also has 2 tabs inside; &quot;inner tab&quot; quite common in most apps;</p>
<p>the actual approach comes from the new Community Titanium application </p>
<p>it is a nice simple way to create tabs that animate for free;</p>
<p>they work on android; obviosuly this is  not the way to go with iphone</p>
<p>thanks</p>
