			<h1>CFBundleShortVersionString does not update</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I am having problems with the CFBundleShortVersionString not updating from 1.0 and this stops us from updating the app as it always fails validation.</p>
<p>I have found this:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;120234&#x2F;app-icon-and-version-no-is-missing-at-xcode-organizer</p>
<p>and this:</p>
<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;126340&#x2F;cfbundleshortversionstring-is-always-10</p>
<p>and have tried updating the builder.py to:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    shortversion = project_info_plist[<span class="hljs-string">'CFBundleVersion'</span>].<span class="hljs-built_in">split</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'.'</span>)
    archive_info = {
        <span class="hljs-string">'ApplicationProperties'</span> : {
            <span class="hljs-string">'ApplicationPath'</span> : appbundle,
            <span class="hljs-string">'CFBundleIdentifier'</span> : project_info_plist[<span class="hljs-string">'CFBundleIdentifier'</span>],

            <span class="hljs-string">'CFBundleShortVersionString'</span> : <span class="hljs-string">'%s.%s'</span> % (shortversion[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>], shortversion[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>]),
            <span class="hljs-string">'IconPaths'</span> : [os.path.<span class="hljs-built_in">join</span>(appbundle,icon), os.path.<span class="hljs-built_in">join</span>(appbundle,icon)]
        },
        <span class="hljs-string">'ArchiveVersion'</span> : <span class="hljs-built_in">float</span>(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>),
        <span class="hljs-string">'CreationDate'</span> : datetime.datetime.utcnow(),
        <span class="hljs-string">'Name'</span> : name,
        <span class="hljs-string">'SchemeName'</span> : name
    }
</code></pre><p>however in the info.plist the value still remains 1.0:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">key</span>&gt;</span>CFBundleVersion<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">key</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">string</span>&gt;</span>2.1323054662<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">string</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">key</span>&gt;</span>CFBundleShortVersionString<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">key</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">string</span>&gt;</span>1.0<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">string</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>I am using Titanium Studio, build: 1.0.2.201107130739<br>Iphone SDK 1.8.0.v20111109103101<br>Xcode version 4.2 (recently upgraded)</p>

							<p>I suspect you&#39;re running 1.8.x - as the string not updating is a bug in that build. I got around this by manually updating the CFBundleShortVersionString in a custom info.plist dumped into the project&#39;s root directory.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Chris, thanks for the suggestion</p>
<p>you are correct I am using 1.8.0. whatever</p>
<p>OK if I need to manually change this where is the file actually contained and in what order do I do this?</p>
<p>IE build the app, then….</p>
<p>assistance would greatly be appreciated!</p>

										<p><p>Hi Drew,</p>
<p>When you build your app look in the build&gt;iPhone directory and copy the generated info.plist file to the root project directory - where Tiapp.xml resides.</p>
<p>Edit that plist file - you should see a entry for CFBundleShortVersionString - simply manually change that to whatever version you need.</p>
<p>Save that file (in the root directory) and when you rebuild the project the auto-generated info.plist will take the data in your amended file.</p>
<p>Hope this works for you, as it solved exactly the same issue for me.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Drew,</p>
<p>Glad it worked, it&#39;s a workaround - but 1.8.x isn&#39;t officially supported yet so can&#39;t really complain about this one too much :)</p>
<p>Can you mark the question as solved so it may help others in the future.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;ve just spend quite a while trying to figure out this problem only to come across this post and see it&#39;s a 1.8.x issue. You would have though this would have been fixed by now? (3 months on from your post). Where will I see what versions are supported when they are released? as 1.8.0 just appeared after an update so I thought I should use the latest version… Nothing told me that there were issues updating apps. When will I know that I should use 1.8.x?</p>

										<p><p>Thank you so much for this! I was having the same issue and could not find a fix. The one thing I had to do though was after copying the Info.plist from build to root I had to delete the Info.plist from the build folder since it still said 1.0.</p>

							<p>Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve discovered. </p>
<p>Ti Developer packages archives with two plist files. (Open the package contents to see). </p>
<p>The first root plist file has the CFBundleShortVersionString and the contentsfolder in the archive holds the CFBundleVersion key. </p>
<p>I was getting a CFBundleVersion version not high enough error (not verbatum).<br>The cause… I tried using a 1.0.1 version and Ti packaged my CFBundleVersion as 1.0.1326912887 instead of 1.0.1.326912887. Ti adds the unique id on the end of the version. However, they don&#39;t respect the third version placeholder when they append to the bundle version. </p>
<p>Sooo, incrementing the second place holder for your app version (CFBundleShortVersionString), 1.1, fixed the issue for me.</p>
