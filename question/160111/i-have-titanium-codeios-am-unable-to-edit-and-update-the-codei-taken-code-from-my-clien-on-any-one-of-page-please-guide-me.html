							<p>Hi Ramesh, unfortunately you exposed your problem in quite a vague way.</p>
<p>So starting from the very beginning: to update iOS code you need a Mac with Xcode installed, you also need Titanium Studio, which comes with the necessary SDK, or you can just install Node.js and the Titanium CLI if you don want to use TiStudio in favor of your preferred text editor.</p>
<p>Please refer to the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Quick_Start">QuickStart guide</a> for more detailed informations.</p>
<p>If you follow the guidelines and still find problems feel free to come back here to post some details about them, in order to let someone understand their nature and try to find a suitable solution for you. Hth. regards.</p>

										<p><p>Hi patrick,<br>first very thanks to your reply for my question. In your answer you mentioned about Mac with Xcode and Titanium Studio with SDK, these all things i have on my machine.<br>Actually i have total code one application taken from one of my client. But sadly I&#39;m new to titanium, am able to run the code and able access that app in Simulator.<br>When I&#39;m trying to update the code, it is not updating. In app.js page(for example I&#39;m saying that only one which was made by me) i made some changes and clean the project and run the project, When it is completing the run process total changes are not available..all are going to loss. I think we have read only permissions on code or some where we are missing the some process, which was we not able find out.<br>We all are new to titanium. So please guide us how to check our permissions and how to update existing code.<br>Thanks in advance…</p>

										<p><p>Hello Ramesh, you&#39;re welcome. So your development system is up and running, as you can compile and test the app on the simulator. The problem you describe make me wonder if the project you try to update could be an Alloy project instead of a standard Titanium.</p>
<p>In order to understand this could you please check in the directory tree  for the presence of an <strong>app</strong> directory (and an <strong>alloy.js</strong> file inside it, with other dir as models, views, style, controllers ..)?</p>
<p>If they exists, the proj is using the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Alloy_Framework">Alloy MVC framework</a>, and you will want to edit the code in the app dir, <strong>NOT</strong> in Resources dir, which is overwritten by alloy compilation before each run. So, for example, as a test-modification you could put an alert at the very beginning of <strong>alloy.js</strong>, as:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">alert<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-string">"Updated by Ramesh"</span>)</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>then check if the app shows it running in the simulator.</p>
<p>In case the <strong>app</strong> dir is not present, try adding the alert line at the beginning of app.js, and again run the project in simulator. </p>
<p>Hth.</p>

										<p><p>If the project uses Alloy it is correct: app.js is compiled by the framework and you will not have to write code in it.</p>

							<p>Welcome to titanium,</p>
<p>a good entry point to learn titanium is the wiki. You found it <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide">here</a>. If you are a visual type you can also find a lot of videos. </p>
<p>In first step you can import  the client project with the import tool inside studio.</p>
<p>Good look!</p>

										<p><p>Hi Rainer ,<br>Thanks for your quick response. I import the code with import tool inside studio only. But I&#39;m not able to update the code.
