			<h1>Upgrading to Ver 1.2 from 0.8</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Ver 1.0 of our app was built using Titanium Ver 0.8. The app has been published in both Android and Apple store.</p>
<p>We have finished our upgrade to Ver 1.2. For the upgrade, I had created a new app and we have been doing our testing using that APP. Now to publish to the store I need to rename my app. From the forums, I gather than renaming does not work. So looks like the only option is to delete all the files in the original project and replace them with files from the new project.</p>
<p>Do you have any recommendations on what is the best way to do this? </p>

							<p>0.8 t0 1.2 presents a major change in the way Ti works.<br>I thinking starting from 1.0 Ti mobile SDK, the move is towards javascript and away from webviews..<br>Check the docs.</p>

										<p><p>I have completed the upgrade as far as code is concerned. My problem is I created a new APP for 1.2. Now I want to rename it to the original name (the one we used for 0.8) so that our users have seemless upgrades from the iPhone store. Ti does not allow you to rename the project. That is my problem.</p>

										<p><p>This is what I have done</p>
<ul>
<li>Started with the project which was developed in 0.8.</li>
<li>Modified tiapp.xml to the new format. Made sure app name and guid stay the same.</li>
<li>Removed all the old html and js files</li>
<li>Added new js files</li>
</ul>
<p>when I run the app using android emulator, the app installs but after the splash screen loads it gives me a message application had stopped unexpectedly. please try again. The last statement in debug trace is </p>
<p>[DEBUG] C:\android-sdk\tools\adb.exe -e shell am start -a android.intent.action.MAIN -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER -n com.tmaresources.personify&#x2F;.PersonifyActivity</p>

							<p>You should be able to just copy over the Resources folder and clean out the contents of build&#x2F;android.</p>
<p>If you touch tiapp.xml it should force a full rebuild.</p>
