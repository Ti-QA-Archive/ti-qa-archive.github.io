			<p>in the app i&#39;m building  (transport) i thought it would be different to have a couple of time-wasting games for when users are wtg for their bus etc</p>
<p>i dont have time nor the wherewithall to create them so i wondered if there was anyone who has done some games as say personal projects or in app store that they would like to put in my app - i&#39;d give full credit, links to the devs other apps if they are in the app store etc etc</p>
<p>quite happy to show the app to the dev via testflight prior to submission - its quite a reasonably small target audience so i&#39;m not expecting millions of d&#x2F;loads - but would be nice obv ;)</p>

							<p>I know there might be a few you can find if you search GitHub. With the launch of Lanica, people have been waiting for its release to start creating their Titanium games. Another simple way to get some light games into your app would be to find some web based, or local html5 based games and drop them in for use in a webview. Back in the day, people did this all the time. See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;krawaller&#x2F;Golingo">Golingo</a>. Its an older example, but it should give you an idea of what Im talking about.</p>
