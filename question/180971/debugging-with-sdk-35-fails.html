			<p>Since upgrading from 3.4.1 to 3.5 I&#39;m unable to launch debugging from Titanium studio on the device and emulator&#x2F;simulator. Is anyone experiencing a similar issue or knows how to fix it?</p>

							<div><p>Yep happening to me too. It seems to happen when it hits a breakpoint. Instead of stopping, it just crashes. Super frustrating as I can&#39;t get anything done without debugging!</p>

							<div><p>This is happening to me as well with 3.5.0GA and 3.5.1GA.  I went back to 3.4.1GA in my tiapp.xml file and that is the only SDK that works.</p>
<p>Please fix this!!!</p>

							<div><p>I have not seen a solution to this. My workaround is debugging using 3.4.1 and then building and testing on 3.5.1. Not efficient but it is what it is.</p>

							<div><p>indeed that is mine too, I don&#39;t know if there is a difference if you run titanium studio in windows perhaps. I am running on yosemite on a mac and since 3.4.1 no breakpoints are hit, and indeed only then if you use the debugger keyword. Overall my debugging experience with titanium studio could best be described as poor. I wonder if anyone from Appcelerator would be able to shed some light on this issue, perhaps if gets upvoted enough there might be some attention to it?</p>
