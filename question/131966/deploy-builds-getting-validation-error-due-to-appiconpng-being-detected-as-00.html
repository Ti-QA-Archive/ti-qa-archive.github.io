			<h1>&#39;deploy&#39; builds getting validation error due to appicon.png being detected as 0,0</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Since updating to v1.0.8 of Studio, each ad-hoc or app store build I create using studio fails validation through XCode 4.</p>
<p>The error I get is:</p>
<p>&quot;iPhone&#x2F;iPod Touch: appicon.png: icon dimensions (0 x 0) don&#39;t meet the size requirements. The icon file much be 57 x 57 pixels, in .png format&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve double checked both my appicon.png and appicon@2x.png (neither of which have been changed since I last submitted a built) and both are 24-bit pngs of the correct dimensions.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried deleting my &#39;build&#39; folder so that this would have to be recreated; I&#39;ve tried compiling against older versions of the SDK; I&#39;ve tried completely deleting the project from Studio and re-importing it - none of this makes the slightest bit of difference.</p>
<p>The only thing I haven&#39;t actually tried is attempted to revert back to an older version of Studio. But thought I&#39;d better check on here first to see if anyone get help or is getting a similar issue?</p>

							<p>Please see here. The issue is with the 10.7.3 OS X update. This blog has a workaround for the issue:</p>

										<p><p>You star! Thanks so much for the quick and accurate response.</p>
<p>I was fixated on it being a problem with studio as the appicon.png that it was copying to build&#x2F;iphone kept showing up in Finder&#x2F;Windows Explorer as having no width or height data… so didn&#39;t even consider that it might be something in OS X itself.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>
