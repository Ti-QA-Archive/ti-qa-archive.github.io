			<h1>Titanium Studio - Pay to debug?!</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I love Titanium and Appcelerator, but this is <em>crazy</em>. Titanium Studio requires you to PAY to debug your apps? I didn&#39;t like Studio anyway (it&#39;s one big mess, a real designer should take a look at it) so I think I&#39;m going back to Developer for now. I loved the simplicity of TiDev but it seems that it isn&#39;t going to be supported anymore. I think TiStudio could have been so much better if it was rethought; it&#39;s totally not logical.</p>

I know you guys aren&#39;t outright saying &quot;you have to use this&quot;, but you certainly are showing your hand on how you plan on denying core features (ala debugging) unless money has been given. I thought the whole reason of choosing Javascript was so &quot;anyone could code it&quot;. Not &quot;anyone could code it, but if you want to actually make it work . . . give me the money!&quot;.</p>
<p>I get you guys have tons of funding and probably all kinds of VC&#x2F;Angels to make happy . . . but find another place to get the money. Charging for debugging, forcing IDE&#39;s and saying &quot;nah-nah-nah-nah-nah . . . you can&#39;t get me&quot; won&#39;t get you anything but angst and eventual competition bitch slaps.</p>

							<p>i agree with doney, its outragous to ask a subscription for a debugger. The Ti studio indeed looks like crap ( no offense devs, but seriously ).</p>
<hr>
<p>im now using titanium for 6 months, especially on android in the first 3 months a debugger would make my development around <strong>5x faster</strong> if not even more!</p>
<p>sometimes it takes hours to just find 1 crappy little typo which would take less then a second in a debugger.</p>
<p>Just give me an debugger in Ti developer and im much much happier to develop apps in titanium</p>

							<p>All - </p>
<p>Some explanation for everyone on where we&#39;re headed as ultimately, I think the confusion is more around what our freemium model is based on rather than any one feature.</p>
<p>What we’re providing is two paths for developers: one path for getting started building the same native apps you always have. The app you could build last week with Titanium Developer is the same app you can build this week with Titanium Studio. That’s the community version and is on parity with what we offered since June 9, 2009 when we launched Titanium Mobile. We will continue to invest here. In a couple weeks, we’ll introduce BlackBerry and Mobile Web… for free, in the community edition.</p>
<p>So the Community edition is all about being able to build the same apps that you can with the native SDKs themselves.</p>
<p>What’s different is that we’re putting a lot of resources in extending the entire platform with value-add software. It’s not just the debugger. It’s all the modules that we added with Titanium+Plus (barcode, urban airship, bump, etc). And there are lots and lots and lots of extensions coming beyond that. I just took a tour of what’s coming with our engineering team and they showed off work on Box2D, OpenGL, graphing, Greystripe ads, a PDF reader, DoubleClick ads, etc. And that’s in addition to the modules we announced in March. This is where we’re heading as a business.</p>
<p>In terms of the IDE, that too will keep improving. All 10 of the Aptana devs are working on Titanium Studio and we have a ton of improvements coming for that product as well. 10 full-time devs just on the IDE product. This version was just the initial, obvious port of Aptana Studio. We said we were going to do this, and we did.</p>
<p>On top of this, we start adding in a full training program that’s bundled into an Indie annual subscription – not for $600 but the full bundle for $499. That’s less than 50 bucks a month. Is developing apps worth as much as your cable bill?</p>
<p>So what we offer all Titanium developers is a simple choice: a getting started, always free, option for building ‘standard’ apps and a premium bundle for building ‘great’ apps with more and more value-add options packed into the offering every month.</p>
<p>We are moving fast – the Titanium community is moving fast – and we welcome developers reading this question to jump on the train that we’re building at a very rapid pace. We’re investing – literally – millions of dollars into enabling a whole new class of talented web developers to build rich, fully native applications for companies large and small. We can always do better, we do listen to our community very closely, and we will continue to expand the creative potential of Titanium developers around the globe.</p>

										<p><p>I understand all of this, but at least make it so that the debugger in Titanium Studio contains a filter to filter annoying build details from the log. The console log is unusable right now and not as great as the console in Titanium Developer. Maybe make this a priority for the 10 Aptana devs? There&#39;s another <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;119794&#x2F;lots-of-debug-statements-in-titanium-studio-console">topic</a> about this too.</p>

										<p><p>Couldn&#39;t agree more- that is the exact reason I use TiDev side by side with Studio because you can&#39;t seem to filter or find logged info from the app. In response to Scott S. - is there an official stand on dropping TiDev in favor of the Studio?</p>

<p>&gt; - Titanium Indie—Free 30-day trial—get all the software you need to build great apps including: Titanium Studio with mobile debugging, Titanium Mobile, Titanium+Plus modules that extend your apps to the cloud, and early access to new software.<br>&gt; - Titanium Professional—Free 30-day trial—get all the Indie software plus access to Appcelerator helpdesk professionals. Yes, you can test drive support during the trial!<br>&gt; - Titanium Community—Free—get the core Titanium mobile SDK for iOS and Android and Titanium Studio (all current features <strong>except mobile debugging</strong>).</p>
<p>Yep, it appears that the debugging feature was only free during the Beta phase.</p>

							<p>Appcelerator does not require a paid subscription in any way to use the debugging functionality, both on the simulator and&#x2F;or on the device. Titanium 3.0 now offers &quot;on device&quot; application debugging.</p>

							<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I think that debugging as it is now in Titanium is pain in the ass. </p>
<p>What&#39;s useful in dumping some object as &quot;[Object@hash]&quot;.</p>
<p>Real debugger would be huge benefit for this community. I know that people have to make money somehow and I don&#39;t mind paying for a product if it&#39;s worth. For now, Titanium Studio debugger is not really useful, I&#39;m using real device and not emulator, and there is no debugging option for devices yet. Also, Studio is not quality product for now, there are a lot of bugs (and same applies for framework).</p>
<p>I hope that will change in the future, Titanium has potential.</p>

							<p>I am new to titanium and I think that paying for debugging privileges is absurd. It is 10x slower form me to find mistakes in my code and check what functions return and so on. It is easier for experienced devs, of course they all went through all that but only because there were no other options. Now that Titanium does have the option to debug it is out of my reach teasing me from far away, and here 2 things why I think debugging should be free:</p>
<p><strong>a)</strong> If you are a newbie like me and you try the Titanium, you have no reason to just buy the product. Investing money in the product makes sense only when you truly are using Titanium productively. Perhaps they should make developers pay a subscription fee to the documentation and API references.</p>
<p><strong>b)</strong> If you are experienced developer you can manage without the debugger if and it also does not make any sense in buying the product only for getting the debugger. </p>
<p>I think this is a short term money gain and cause only bad in the long term.</p>

							<p>I don&#39;t see an problem with it - you didn&#39;t get debugging in the free TiDev (since you couldn&#39;t) and now that a single developer can actually afford to get a subscription it isn&#39;t too bad. I did find that ALL I really got for my money was debugging since the training etc isn&#39;t anything special.</p>
<p>Now as for TiDev - I still use it, it is faster and more reliable than Studio so hopefully it won&#39;t go away, at least not before Studio works properly. I have both open at any time, debug on one and deploy on the other.</p>

							<p>Is it possible to debug on the device with Indie FREE TRIAL? I just downloaded it but I don&#39;t see any chance to start debugging on the device (just on the emulator). Will this change after paying the Indie subscription or isn&#39;t it implemented yet, meaning only available on the emulator?</p>
