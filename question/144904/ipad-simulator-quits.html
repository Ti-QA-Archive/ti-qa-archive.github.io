							<div><p>HI Steven</p>
<p>Not enough information here to give any advice specific to your situation and realistically speaking you will have way too much code to provide for any one to have a stab at it.</p>
<p>My suggestion would be work out when it last ran successfully on the simulator and try and determine what changes or sections of the app you add afterwards.  Then where possible remove or hide those sections and see what happens.  Ideally rolling back a few versions of any back-up code for test compiles would be a good plan.</p>
<p>If this does not work - then you have two main ways;</p>
<ol>
<li>Plenty of use of <code>Ti.API.info(&amp;#39;debug&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;info&amp;#39;);</code> At least one at the start and end of every code file and module.  Ideally start and end of every function, this will tell you if the code got that far, then find the last place and work from there.</li>
<li>I always use a 50&#x2F;50 approach when all else fails, remove 50% of the code from running and try the rest, if it works try the other 50%, when one fails repeat within that 50%.  Really only useful though if you have broken your project up into CommonJS and&#x2F;or Alloy techniques.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am guessing you have been testing as you have gone along so it must be recent - so wherever you were last is most likely.</p>

							<div><p>Sounds like a Plan.<br>Have lots of CommonJS modules.<br>Seems to me that the Titanium framework should be reporting an error, not just quiting the simulator.<br>This is definitely a bug with Titanium. </p>
<p>Seems that issues like this have forced a few companies in Australia to not use titanium, and have all gone native. Me on the other hand have supported this platform, which does have its issues. </p>
<p>But love using it, and will continue despite a few issues here, and there.</p>

							<div><p>Hi Steven</p>
<p>It might be a bit premature to suggest there is a bug in Titanium but of course there might be.</p>
<p>I have been doing this for several years now and a couple of days ago I ended up spending several hours trying to work out my my new shiny app had stopped doing something so simple and basic it was hard to comprehend what had happened.  Turned out (after many hours) it was me (can&#39;t be great all the time).  I had written code that was syntactically correct it was not the way I should have written it.  In this case Titanium would have needed to be a mind reader.</p>
<p>It is a shame those companies went &#39;native&#39; as the platform gets stronger and better every month, Appcelerator are doing an excellent job of bridging the gap between platforms (with more comping shortly) and allowing rapid development.</p>
<p>Keep going it is worth it and good luck.</p>
