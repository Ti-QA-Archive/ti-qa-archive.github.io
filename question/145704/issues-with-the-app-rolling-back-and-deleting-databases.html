			<h1>Issues with the App rolling back and deleting Databases</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>We have developed an app for our customers that allows them to work out in the yard.  In the code there are databases that are created when pulling the information from the server via XML.  The problem is that there have been a few occurrences with one of our customers getting booted from the app and losing all of their settings in the database.  There&#39;s a button that is called &quot;download settings&quot; that dials out to the server and pulls the info.  Once you pull that info then it stays in the databases, but when they get booted, it rolls back the app.  I want to just blame the fact that they got the tablets from AT&amp;T and there is something on the tablet causing this issue.  Has anyone else been having a problem?  Or any suggestions?  Like I said, they got the tablets from AT&amp;T because they are using the cellular service to transmit data instead of WiFi.  I know carriers are notorious for putting a bunch of crap on their devices they sell to customers.</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I have never heard of a situation where an app is rolled back by the OS - with or without a crash.</p>
<p>Are you sure this is not simply a result of the app not logging that the process to store the local copy of the settings has completed - before the &quot;crash&quot; occurs, so on next launch it tries again - thus resetting things back to original as it then calls out to re-download?</p>
<p>If this was me I would add a diagnostic log, that tracks the pull request and the success or failure.  Have this a file that is APPENDED to and then have a hidden option in the app that trigger that file being presented in a standard email dialog as an attachment and a pre-populated email address.</p>
<p>Then if it happens again and you are able to speak with the customer - you can have them send you the log.</p>
<p>Make sure to not re-created the file ever - only append.</p>

										<p><p>That does not sound right at all, I think the idea that a device would lose such a specific file and no others is unlikely.</p>
<p>The database is stored in a fixed location.  This previous question might help you <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;135245&#x2F;android-database-file-location-in-osx">android-database file location in osx</a></p>

										<p><p>I have actually been reading that this is an issue with Samsung Devices with 2.2.3 and 2.3.3.  Even DropBox had to fix the issue.  The only resolution that I have seen is to rename the folder or delete the database folder before the databases are filled with the information.</p>

							<p>I actually did a little digging and I found out that Samsung devices has a tendency to &quot;Lose the databases&quot;.  So Samsung Devices with Gingerbread on them will just suddenly lose the databases.  The customers are then forced to recreate the databases again from the server.  Does anyone know if there is a way to relocate on android where the databases will be saved?  When i developed the App, sqlite didn&#39;t really give me an option of where to save the databases.</p>
