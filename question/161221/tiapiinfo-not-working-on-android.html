</code></pre><p>Is there anything in particular i need to do to activate this with android?</p>
<p>The device I am using is:<br>Android 4.3 on a Samsung galaxy s3</p>
<p>I cannot see anything in the titanium console.</p>
<p>It takes about a minute to load up the app onto the device, which is painfull. However the app doesn&#39;t even seem to load on the simulator.</p>
<p>So far on day 1 of the conversion to android i haven&#39;t really achieved much :s</p>

							<p>If you upgrade to Titanium 3.2, you will see the log output. Also, with 3.2, Android device builds on my computer are about 30% faster.</p>

										<p><p>Wow, ok.. after upgrading ti to 3.2 then downloading what seemed like all of google, the simulator would not load moaning about xcode (even though i am building an android app). Updated the macosx from 10.8.2 to 10.8.5, updated xcode, a couple of restarts and another update to xcode i finally have the simulator working.. i would like to point out that the docs on appcellerator could be a LOT clearer for setting up the android enviroment (so could googles TBH). Anyway, you were right.. it is now loading at a workable speed now. Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>@John Sorry about having to install Xcode. We found and fixed the issue the other day (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;browse&#x2F;TIMOB-16130">TIMOB-16130</a>). I&#39;m glad to hear you got your environment up and running.</p>

							<p>You won&#39;t be able to see log output within Studio if you&#39;re running the app on a device. You&#39;ll need to use Monitor (or DDMS or at a command prompt, you can use <code>adb logcat</code>). Monitor is included with the other Android executables in your android-sdk folder.</p>
