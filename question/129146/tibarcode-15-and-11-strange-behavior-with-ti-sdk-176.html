			<h1>ti.barcode 1.5 and 1.1 strange behavior with TI SDK 1.7.6</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi folks !<br>First, project history :<br>I&#39;m working on a big project. Two weeks ago, the project was almost finished, but we discovered a bug appearing only on IOS5. At this time the project was based on Ti 1.6.3.<br>I was not able to clearly identify this bug… so i moved all the project on Ti 1.7.6<br>This change solved the bug !<br>But now, i&#39;am facing a new bug !</p>
<p>When the Ti.barcode is closed (canceled or after a succesfull scan), the screen is left blank !<br>The only thing that i see is the root view (tested by changing the root view background color)<br>At the time i was using Ti.barcode 1.1, i have tested with Ti.barcode 1.5 but this change doesn&#39;t solve my problem…<br>Also this bug is not appearing everytime… and this bug doesn&#39;t exist with Ti 1.6.3 !</p>
<p>I&#39;m lost !</p>
<p>Any help welcome !</p>

										<p><p>What i&#39;ve observed with Ti 1.7.5 and Ti.barcode 1.5 : In the app, we have 2 steps on launch. First step is a simple window for login. In the first step the barcode works correctly. The second step is based on a tabgroup. That&#39;s in the second step that the bug is occuring… but not allways… it seems that if i launch the scanner once in the first step (single window) the barcode is working correctly when launched over the tabgroup (second step)</p>

										<p><p>i confirm that : if i launch the barcode in the first step (only one window open), then the barcode is working correctly in the second step (tabgroup). If i open the first step, close the first step window, open second step tabgroup, then the barcode doesn&#39;t work correctly (Ti 1.7.5 Ti.barcode 1.5)</p>

										<p><p>After some changes in my code, the bug seems resolved…<br>But i still don&#39;t know what caused the bug…<br>The only major change that i&#39;ve made :<br>I removed a MapView added to the tabgroup (i was doing this because at the time this was the only way for me to disable the geolocate service)<br>@Radamantis Is it possible to know the process involved in the Ti.barcode opening ?</p>
