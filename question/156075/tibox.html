							<p>Hi</p>
<p>There is a free module in the market place to provide the features you require.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.appcelerator.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;4964?1980271872">Box.net Module</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You have not specified if you need this for Android or iOS but lucky for you it works on both.</p>

										<p><p>I have not had the opportunity to try this module myself as I have not yet had any need for it.  </p>
<p>The usual idea here you try something yourself and especially if there is example code you use that and work through your needs.  If you have a specific problem then you come back here and ask for help with that.</p>
<p>Requesting others to provide how to guides for everything you need before you have even tried it is considered bad form.  We are very happy to help you look into specific things (Even trying things we have not tried before) but we have to know you have actually tried sufficiently without success before we get involved.</p>
<p>Remember the Q&amp;A is for you to ask a question and people on the community to help answer that question.  We are not here to do your work for you.</p>
<p>It is also not common that you would send multiple DevMails to people requesting their help, especially when the question you are looking for help with has only just been posted and you have not had any previous interactions with the person you are asking.</p>
<p>Having reviewed your previous questions, every single one seems to be you asking for people to provide you with everything you will need before you have even tried to determine things for yourself.</p>
<p>You are new here so you are forgiven but remember the community helps out here for free, all we ask is you do your part.  We are a very helpful bunch of people but get annoyed when you do not attempt to help yourself first.</p>
<p>Remember to search the Q&amp;A, search Google, try the example apps.  Event the best of us do this as we start with things we have not used before.</p>
