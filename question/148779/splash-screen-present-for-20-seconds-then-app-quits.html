			<h1>Splash screen present for 20 seconds then app quits</h1>

			<ul>
<li>App type: mobile</li>
<li>Titanium SDK: 3.0.1.201212181159</li>
<li>Platform: iOS 5.1.1</li>
<li>Device: iPhone 4S (Jailbroken)</li>
<li>Host OS: Mac OSX Mountain Lion</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m working on an app that loads information from a server asynchronously in app.js. I&#39;m using a jailbroken 5.1.1 device to test my applications (build then drag and drop to iTunes to deploy). In some cases, the app is built, and I&#39;ll run it on the device and I get an &quot;app.js not found&quot; error, which is weird - <strong>but in most cases after reinstalling the app, it just opens and sits at the splash screen for around 20 seconds, then quits.  What is really strange is that the app works perfectly in the simulator</strong> I ran an analysis on the app to see if it was burning through memory, but it looks like it peaks around 3MB, so that can&#39;t be it. I&#39;m not sure providing code will be of too much use, but I&#39;m wondering if anyone else has been in a similar situation, and what you did to fix it. I&#39;ll keep looking myself, thanks for any information you may be able to provide.</p>

							<p>When trying to track down similar issues, here is the approach I&#39;ve taken:</p>
<ol>
<li>Insert copious Ti.API.info calls into your code. Since you think you are getting hung up running the code in app.js, go through your code and insert info calls with specific information to let you know where your code is executing&#x2F;failing.</li>
<li>Launch xCode, run the app on your phone and use the Organizer view in xCode to view the logs for the device. Then you can see the output from your Ti.API.info calls and figure out where the code is failing… fix the code… repeat.</li>
</ol>
