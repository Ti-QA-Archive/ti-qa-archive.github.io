			<p>Hi Appcelerators!</p>
<p>Is there an object, method or class in the Titanium API that works as a &quot;favorite&quot; button. </p>
<p>I&#39;m sure you have all seen this somewhere. </p>
<p>You&#39;re using an app, you come across an article or whatever you like, you click the &quot;heart&quot; button, and the app keeps in mind your selection. </p>
<p>I have a few ideas of my own on how to implement this myself, but rather than re-invent the wheel, I&#39;d like to know if this wheel already exists?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>There isn&#39;t a favourite button component.  The ones you see on other apps are just normal buttons with appropriate graphics (i.e. a hart icon).  You will need to implement the logic to make the app remember user&#39;s favourite items (database or local variables).</p>

							<p>Hey E B</p>
<p>There is no such component, module or any which works as favourite. What ever record you wants to set as favourite you can either update that record in the Database to be as favourite or you can save the id of that particular record in the Ti.App. Properties. After that once you again open the same screen first check either in the DB or in the Ti. App.Properties for the favourite id&#39;s and set the particular row with that id as favourite or you can even show the different list as favourite too.</p>
<p>If you still not getting it, then sure ask, its a logical part to be code nothing there available to use as component or model. Also i would like to know what idea you have for this.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Nikunj</p>

										<p><p>Well, what I had in mind was to create an event that updates a table. I&#39;ve lost a bit of trust in the Ti.App.Properties command… I don&#39;t find it keeps a record always. </p>
<p>So, my pseudo code would be:<br>–&gt; create icon<br>–&gt; create EventListener on icon<br>–&gt; onEvent &quot;click&quot; –&gt; update database row execute(&quot;update favorite column&quot;) where </p>
<p>This is the point.. the &quot;Where&quot; clause.</p>
<p>Where what? </p>
<p>So, I have a long tableview (i.e. with many table rows.</p>
<p>If a user selects one row, what event (in terms of SQL) would that relate to??</p>
<p>OK.. how about this fellas:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span></span> image_heart.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span></span>
{

    --&gt; exec(update db.Table <span class="hljs-keyword">where</span> e.row.MYDATABASEPARAMETER)
});
</code></pre><p>How exactly do I get e.row.MYDATABASEPARAMETER to update a table.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s say that e.row.MYDATABASEPARAMETER was a field from the database that was selected that now appears in a row. I.e. its a row item.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know, like Contact Name. </p>
<p>I want to make that contactName a &quot;favorite&quot; </p>
<p>So, I create a column in the same table called favorite. </p>
<p>What would be the &quot;logic&quot; or the mechanics in informing the table that I wanted to update THAT row with a &quot;YES&quot; in the favorites column??</p>
<p>I guess I could figure it out… just needs playing around with.</p>
<p>Thanks guys</p>

										<p><p>What you are trying to do is call a CRUD operation.  <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2010&#x2F;07&#x2F;how-to-perform-crud-operations-on-a-local-database.html">This blog entry may be of good use</a>.</p>
<p>The important part is to use an ID column for each record.  This can be an automatic column.  So once added each record will have an ID value and this should also be populated in the TableView as a custom property.  So when a user clicks on a row you can get the ID value of that row and use it for your WHERE clause.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
