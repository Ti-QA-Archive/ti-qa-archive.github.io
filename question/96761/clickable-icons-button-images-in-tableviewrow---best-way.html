			<h1>Clickable icons (button images) in TableViewRow - best way?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>So what is the correct&#x2F;best way to implement clickable icons that are images (i.e. in my case, 36x36 PNG icons) in a TableViewRow?</p>
<p>I&#39;m currently using Ti.UI.createView, setting its top&#x2F;left&#x2F;width&#x2F;height, its backgroundImage to the PNG file, and adding that view to the TableViewRow.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I seem to be hitting a weird roadblock that I&#39;m having a hard time chasing… or have spent too much time chasing.. and am wondering if this is the right way?</p>
<p>Every so often (completely random), the app will crash (Force Close) when I display the TableView with the items above.  It seems to be directly related to backgroundImage - as once I comment them out, it will display (I verify this by also setting the borderColor and borderWidth to see where it SHOULD have been placed).</p>
<p>I have so far been unable to track down what causes these crashes&#x2F;FCs - originally thought it was when the Views&#x2F;images were overlapping - but that is not the case.  <em>something</em> to do with displaying the PNG icons as backgroundImage - and I have yet to figure out a pattern.</p>
<p>Any thoughts&#x2F;ideas?  I&#39;m on Android with Ti 1.5.1</p>

							<p>is there a reason you are not using image views? How many rows are you talking about here?</p>

										<p><p>No reason except I based the code off of the KitchenSink code (Table View Layout 2) because, it was very very similar to what I&#39;m trying to implement (TableViewRows with text as well as icons you can click on) - so I assumed that was the correct or best way to do it…</p>
<p>Should I swap out the Views (specifically being used for the icons) for ImageViews?  I was just assuming it was OK since that&#39;s how it&#39;s done in KitchenSink.  What advantages could I get, and if it&#39;s better to do it that way, why didn&#39;t Appcelerator use that method in the KitchenSink?</p>
<p>My TableView is dynamic (i.e. user can have as many rows as it defines) - personally, I have about 200 rows in it right now…</p>
