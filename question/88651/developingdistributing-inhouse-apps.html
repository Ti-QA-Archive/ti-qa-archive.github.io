							<p>Russell,</p>
<p>As you may know, apps distributed outside the app store require a mobile provisioning profile to authorize its use on a device.  There are two types of such profiles:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ad-hoc distribution.  Any registered developer can get one of these, however each specific device where it is to be deployed must have its UDID submitted to Apple for inclusion in the profile.  There is a limit of 100 devices in the profile.  You may remove UDIDs, but within a (calendar?) year you can not add more than 100 unique IDs even if you have removed some.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Enterprise distribution.  Only companies with an Enterprise License can get one of these profiles.  They cost $299&#x2F;year, and the company must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet&#39;s number in order to apply.  Until late Sep 2010, the company also needed a minimum of 500 employees, but that requirement has been lifted.  The major benefit of the enterprise profile is you do not have a device limit, nor do you need to enter the UDIDs of the devices where it will be deployed.  Once you have the enterprise license, you get a distribution profile that can be installed on any device to authorize the application to run.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So which you use comes down to your environment.  If you need to deploy to over 100 devices, or you are unwilling or unable to pre-collect the UDID of a device, then look into the Enterprise license.</p>
<p>If you do not qualify for an Enterprise license, then you must collect the UDID of each device and update the provisioning profile each time you need to add more devices.  If you reach 100, you must begin a new profile.  I think you may even have to clone the app to another name – one per set of 100 devices.  (Not 100% sure of that need.)</p>
<p>With either type of profile, you then need to get the profile on the device or the app will not install.  However, it is possible to include the profile in the *.ipa file itself.  Titanium will automatically build the the app with the distribution profile you selected and include it in the app root folder.</p>
<p>The goal is to get a <em>.ipa file with the app and included profile.  I have heard some say that Titanium builds the </em>.ipa for them automatically, but it does not for me.  I don&#39;t know why.  However, it is fairly easy to do yourself.  This is what I do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build the app using the distribution build mode of Titantium</li>
<li>Navigate to the project&#39;s build &gt; iPhone &gt; Release-iphonesos folder</li>
<li>If there is a *.ipa file as some get, just use it.</li>
<li>Otherwise create a new folder at that level called Payload</li>
<li>Move the project.app folder to inside the Payload folder</li>
<li>Zip the Payload folder</li>
<li>Rename project.zip to project.ipa</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have the *.ipa file, there are three ways to distribute and install it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send to user and have them dbl click or drag to iTunes then sync</li>
<li>Install via iPhone Configuration Utility (available for Windows too)</li>
<li>If the device is at OS 4.x, you can also install over the air</li>
</ul>
<p>The last option is what I now do.  In a nutshell, you place the <em>.ipa file on the web server or intranet of your choice.  The web page, instead of providing a link directly to the </em>.ipa file, must link to a *.plist file as described later.</p>
<p>On an OS 4.x device, you then can use Safari to visit the web&#x2F;intranet page with a download link to that <em>.plist file.  It in turn identifies the location of the </em>.ipa file to be installed, prompts the user, and handles all the installation tasks such as shutting down an active version, etc.</p>
<p>For OS 4.x devices, it is <em>very</em> slick.  I just put a link to the web page in my app&#39;s About box and users can upgrade to my latest version with only a few taps, even when in the field with no access to iTunes or ICU.</p>
<p>For OS 3.x devices, you still must install via iTunes or ICU.</p>
<p>The process for creating the *.plist and a sample PHP page to serve it can be found <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;samvermette.com&#x2F;71">here</a>.</p>

										<p><p>Hey Doug,</p>
<p>thanks for your great tutorial. It&#39;s working quite well for me, the only problem I have: After updating my apps with the .plist file on a web server, I always have to restart my iPad after the update. Otherwise the app won&#39;t start. But if I turn the iPad (1) off and on after the update, the app runs perfectly and the update is installed.<br>Do you know this problem and maybe have any solution for it?</p>

										<p><p>See my reply to your identical question <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.appcelerator.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;122991&#x2F;titanium-studio-adhoc-enterprise-ota-distribution.html#answer-213962">here</a>.  The short version is no, I have not heard of that problem when using iOS.</p>
