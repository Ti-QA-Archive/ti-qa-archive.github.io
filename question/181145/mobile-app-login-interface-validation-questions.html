							<p>You are going to bypass the native way of doing that. But there are many apps with web views on both google and apple store. This method was ok in 3 - 4 years ago but nowadays it&#39;s not much difficult to implement that in either  Titanium or in objective-c. My personal opinion is spend much more time and do it in correct way.</p>
<p>If you stil think its difficult then phonegap is the correct software for you. As What it does is it just wrap your web app  on a web view for deployment.</p>
<p>This link has a nice example of a typical Titanium Authentication.</p>

										<p><p>Hello my app login application is natif app.</p>
<p>it works very well</p>
<p>The first login page is made with titanium studio and its properties.</p>
<p>I speak in terms of the acceptance of the apple store if they are very specific rule for an application of members with login access.</p>
<p>Once we are connecting information, seen page.js with its content. But also some link webview.</p>

										<p><p>Yes they will approve your app. Make sure to provide a demo user  name&#x2F;password on submission<br>for testing. Also make sure to check the data connectivity before open web views. Always try to use HTTPCliens to load the data instead of direct linking.</p>
