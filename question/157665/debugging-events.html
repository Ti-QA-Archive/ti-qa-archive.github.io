			<h1>Debugging events...</h1>

		<section>
			<p>On the second time I open a particular window on iOS only I am getting a close event very quickly after then open event is handled and the window close. First, Third and subsequent times that I open the window it open it works just fine. e.source is the window that it getting the &#39;close&#39; event (i.e. sender and receiver are the same window).</p>
<p>How do I debug these events (i.e. how that I can find out where in the code this close event was fired?)</p>

							<div><p>Simple test cases don&#39;t seem to exhibit the problem. The window closes just after trying to draw a ListView. My simple test case without a ListView works fine. My hunch is that somewhere in the Appcelerator ListView component an error is thrown and it closes the window. I&#39;ve put breakpoints on ever .close statement in my code and it doesn&#39;t hit any of them and the source of the close event is the window itself (e.source) and it only happens the second time I open the Second Tab Group.</p>
<p>The App is organized like this</p>
<p>Main Window<br>    Authentication -&gt; Open Login Window if Authentication fails<br>    -&gt; Open First Tab Group when Authenticated<br>    This top level window is necessary to keep the app running while opening and closing tab groups and it allows me to bring up the login window before bringing up any tab groups if needed</p>
<p>First Tab Group<br>    Tab 1 contains a list view of choices<br>    Tab 2 &amp; 3 will contain other information</p>
<p>Tab 1 ListView<br>    When you click on one of the choices from this ListView it closes the First Tab Group and open a Second Tab Group (i.e. according to the docs you can&#39;t have 2 tab groups open on Android and this code needs to run on both iOS and Android).</p>
<p>Second Tab Group<br>    3 Tabs in this group contain detail information about the choice made in the ListView in the Firsst Tab Group<br>    Clicking on the &quot;back&quot; button in any of these tabs will close the Second Tab Group and open the First Tab Group</p>
<p>I was hoping that there was a way to monitor Titanium events that I didn&#39;t know about (like an event window &#x2F; console) that could tell you where events were fired from. Or Perhaps there is another way to debug this?</p>
