			<h1>Tab through textfields</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I know there has been a few questions about the next key on the keyboard and having to stick a listener on the text field itself to control this. </p>
<p>My question though is while running the app through the emulator or using an external keyboard, you can by default tab through all the text fields etc.<br>Now is there a way to fire a &#39;tab&#39; key event, so this would work. It does not seem like a hard thing to accomplish, just don&#39;t know the system well enough.</p>
<p>Or any other thoughts? Manually doing this is just stupid….especially if you have a dynamic form that exists on multiple levels.</p>

							<div><p>Curious on the phone there is no tab key ?. So how would you want to handle this?.</p>
<p>The normal way is to have the keyboard show a next button the listen for this event to fire and move to the next field by using the focus.</p>

							<div><p>Correct there is no tab key, yet using an external keyboard the tab key works with no added listeners etc. So if it is built in already shouldnt that be the way to attack it, instead of adding more needless code. I just wish I knew the way around it. I am almost wondering if there is an easy way to do it native and then build a module to tap into that.</p>

							<p>Not sure what you mean by a form that exists on multiple levels, but one option would be to store your form objects in an array, and iterate through it to create your form.  You can also set the eventlisteners during the iteration.  Here is a quick example:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Ti.UI.setBackgroundColor(<span class="hljs-string">'#000'</span>);

var win = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
    <span class="hljs-string">title :</span> <span class="hljs-string">'test'</span>
});

var arrayLength = <span class="hljs-number">5</span>
var fields = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Array(arrayLength);

<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span>( i = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i &lt; arrayLength; i++) {
    fields[i] = Ti.UI.createTextField({
        <span class="hljs-string">id :</span> i,
        <span class="hljs-string">height :</span> <span class="hljs-number">40</span>,
        <span class="hljs-string">width :</span> <span class="hljs-number">100</span>,
        <span class="hljs-string">hintText :</span> <span class="hljs-string">'Field '</span> + i,
        <span class="hljs-string">value :</span> <span class="hljs-string">''</span>,
        <span class="hljs-string">top :</span> i * <span class="hljs-number">50</span>,
        <span class="hljs-string">returnKeyType :</span> i != arrayLength - <span class="hljs-number">1</span> ? Titanium.UI.RETURNKEY_NEXT : Ti.UI.RETURNKEY_DONE,
        <span class="hljs-string">borderStyle :</span> Titanium.UI.INPUT_BORDERSTYLE_ROUNDED
    });

    fields[i].addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'return'</span>, function(e) {
        var j = e.source.id;

        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(j != arrayLength-<span class="hljs-number">1</span>) {
            fields[j + <span class="hljs-number">1</span>].focus();
        } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
            alert(<span class="hljs-string">'Done'</span>);
        }

    });
    win.add(fields[i]);
};

win.open();
</code></pre><p>I suppose you could also do something similar with a table view if you prefer to manage your form that way.</p>

										<p><p>A web view is not going to work in this situation, or I would have to rebuild the whole thing.<br>As far as multiple levels, well there are different dynamic fields that get added by the user or removed by the user withing different sections, so I have basic sub views that I would need to bubble the event up, listen then check the current array of sub views to find the next and then set focus. Yes this all can be done, and I am doing it. It just seems to be a lot of needless code to do something that is already built into the system.</p>
<p>I guess it would all go around getting soft key events from the keyboard, if that were possible, you could easily fire your own key event, which would be the tab key</p>
