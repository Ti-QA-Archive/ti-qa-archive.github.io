		<section>
			<p>Hi all ,</p>
<p>I went through the forum digging answer for this question. I found some said yes and some said no it only worked on the simulator not on the device.<br>My question is &quot;does Webservice calls also support SSL with https URLs? &quot;</p>
<p>Hope to get answer this time .</p>
<p>Thanks for the help.</p>

<p>Setting it true or false isn&#39;t a requirement, setting it to true makes the app require that the certificate is ONLY valid, or exists. I test with SSL on my home server which doesn&#39;t have a valid certificate, but I can still talk via https.</p>
<p>You haven&#39;t posted any code, so I&#39;ll assume you are using the following formatted url:</p>

										<p><p>PS. I always set to false because I don&#39;t care if the certificate on MY server is valid or not, I just care about communicating via https.</p>

										<p><p>@Darren:  Then how do you know if it&#39;s YOUR server? ;-)  That&#39;s part of the point of certificates — authentication, not just confidentiality (encryption).</p>

										<p><p>My point with setting the property to false when communicating to my home server is that when I am &quot;developing&quot; and not in &quot;production&quot;, I don&#39;t care if I have a valid certificate or not, i just want my code to work. When I go forward away from development and toward production, I will concern myself with the issue then. I just want comms to work at first, so I shut off any and all error checking if possible, then work forward. This helps eliminate the &quot;what am I doing wrong here&quot; frustration.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks for your reply Toni.</p>
<p>&quot;set this to control how SSL certification validation is performed on connection. defaults to false if in simulator or device testing and true if release for distribution mode.&quot;</p>
<p>Do i have to set the variables manually or it is taken care of automatically.</p>
