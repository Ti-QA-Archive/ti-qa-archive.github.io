		<section>
			<p>Hi Appcelerator community. I need some help, serious help. I am not a coder by any means, although I&#39;m not totally illiterate. I helped someone create an iOS and Android, the main function being the ability to stream their terrestrial radio station. By helping them, I mean that I hired a cheap guy on Elance. So far, three different people on Elance have supposedly &quot;fixed&quot; my problem with the iOS version, but the problem still persists. When a user goes to the &quot;Listen Live&quot; page, the stream auto plays. Not everytime, but many times, after about 3 - 5 minutes, the stream stops playing and gives the error &quot;Unable to Configure Network Read Stream&quot;. There used to be a Twitter stream on that page, but we moved it when Twitter updated their API, thinking it might have been the problem. But it wasn&#39;t. I paid the last Elance guy out-of-pocket and I&#39;m not sure what to do from here. I know it has to be a simple fix by someone who knows what they are doing, but I can&#39;t even figure out how to open the project in Titanium. HELP, please! Just tell me what you need.</p>

							<div><p>This would be the AudioPlayer API which uses Matt  Gallagher&#39;s AudioStreamer class. The error is a generic one thrown when the stream bombs out or the format is unreadable. It could be that the app is not receiving enough data to keep the buffer happy. It could simply be the state of the connection, rather than anything to do with your app. Can you play the same stream OK using another app?You could try increasing the buffer size on yours to see if it makes any difference.</p>

							<div><p>Would someone be willing to let me send them the Titanium project and see if they can open it? I had a coder friend attempt to open the project and he couldn&#39;t either. I&#39;m sure we are missing something, but not sure what. Thanks for any help.</p>

							<p>Thanks, Patrick, and sorry for the late reply. I have an Android version created by the same developer in Titanium and it doesn&#39;t seem to have the problem, although I&#39;ve just realized that the Twitter api is broken on it now. Would anyone be able to look at the code for me?</p>
