							<div><p>You mentionned the JDT. Are you planning on developing Native Android Modules?</p>
<p>If not, simply install the 1.6.2 JDK by yourself first so it will get detected when installing TiStudio.</p>

							<p>Here&#39;s what was going on:  installer dug up some obsolete jdk home path from the windows registry - was not in my env variables, could only find it in the registry - and then did a check to verify the location by looking for c:\jdk_dir\bin\java.exe.  Since I had long ago deleted the jdk the check failed and the install was aborted.  I put a java.exe in the expected location and tried again.  The installer finished successfully.  Interesting thing is that when I start up, titanium studio seems to be using the jdk found in my path or java_home env variables, not the one for which the installer was checking.</p>

							<p>That is usually due to permission at the Windows level. My best suggestion to you is that you install the necessary components yourself.</p>
<ul>
<li>The JDK</li>
<li>The Android SDK</li>
<li>The Python Interpreter (if needed)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once all these are in place (as well as the right environment variables). Then relaunch the Titanium Installation program. All the necessary items will be detected and properly configured.</p>
<p>You could always try and <em>hope</em> that Titanium will do this correctly for you. But from experience, I always had to do this manually on Windows.</p>

							<p>Just had this problem.  I tried installing Java manually, uninstalling old JDKs, but the install kept trying to install Java and failing.  Finally I realized I needed to install the 64 bit version and the install was finally happy.  This was on Windows 7.</p>

							<p>hello everyone,<br>To solve your java problems, you would use the java that is in Program Files (x86) and  it&#39;ll work<br>example :<br>1) C: \ Program Files (x86) \ Java \ jdk1.7.0_55 \ bin<br>2) C: \ Program Files (x86) \ Java \ jdk1.7.0_55 \ jre \ bin</p>
<p>Good luck to everyone.</p>
