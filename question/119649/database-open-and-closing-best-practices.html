			<h1>Database open and closing best practices?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Okay, so I have a database in my app and I need to call data from it on a 1 second interval. I also have a ton of functions that make database calls throughout. It\\&#39;s likely that some of these functions will try and fire at the same time.</p>
<p>This is resulting in database locking issues.</p>
<p>My question is which option is the best practice:</p>
<p>Should I open an instance of the database in each function?</p>
<p>Should I open an instant of the database with each db.execute, closing it right after?</p>
<p>Currently, I\\&#39;m opening the database at the top of my function list and the leaving it open, firing db.execute\\&#39;s within the functions.</p>
<p>Thoughts or ideas would be tremendously helpful. These database locking issues are a show-stopper right now.</p>

							<p>I also wonder about this.  Maybe you could be inadvertently opening and closing the database due to the way Titanium instantiates objects when you view each &quot;screen&quot; in a new .js file?  Sqlite seems to be really fast that I would not think you would get locking issues simply by running commands on the same connection, but rather by trying to open simultaneous connections.</p>
<p>I know this is a bad practice for server code, but for my client I instantiate my database as a singleton like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Common.openCache = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span>
</span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (!Titanium.App.myCacheDbIsOpen) 
    {
        Titanium.API.info(<span class="hljs-string">'Common.openCache'</span>);
        Titanium.App.myCacheDb = Titanium.Database.open(<span class="hljs-string">'cache'</span>);
        Titanium.App.myCacheDbIsOpen = <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>;
    }
};
</code></pre><p>When you save variables in the Titanium.App namespace they seem to persist across all of the various pages and don&#39;t get re-instantiated.</p>

										<p><p>I have a separate JS that I include that&#39;s instantiating the database. I added some code for it to check to see if it already existed and if it did, to close it.</p>
<p>Will try putting it in Ti.App. I didn&#39;t think to do that. Still having the same issues with the data locking.</p>

										<p><p>I did the same thing at first - it seems that separate .js pages will not retain their state, but when you use the Ti.App namespace it will.  I put in a bunch of logging and found that was the only way I could make a singleton work.</p>
<p>Of course I am pretty new to this as well, so I have no idea if it is the &quot;best practice&quot; or not, but it does work for me!</p>

							<p>In my experience, if you are calling SQL execute statements from multiple contexts&#x2F;threads and there is a chance they will overlap database inserts&#x2F;updates, then it is only a matter of time until have a locking issue.</p>
<p>Database reads seem like less of a problem, in my experience.</p>
<p>Putting an open&#x2F;close around the execute won&#39;t help lock issues on concurrent operations.  I think SQLite is designed as a single user database, and when concurrent threads try to perform updates they appear to SQLite as multiple users.</p>
<p>Thus in a database centric application, adding the open&#x2F;close just adds more overhead without solving the lock issue.  So I tend to leave them open and close on exit.  (For applications where the database use is less frequent, opening and closing as needed is fine.  But like my typical application, you are talking about very frequent access.)</p>
<p>My approach to solving this problem was to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the database(s) in my startup code (e.g. app.js)</li>
<li>Create a custom event listener (in app.js) for db update requests</li>
<li>In other windows&#x2F;contexts where a db update is needed, create the SQL statement and pass in the object for my custom event listener</li>
<li>Close the database in the close event for the application</li>
</ul>
<p>By preparing the SQL statement in any thread needed but then passing it to my app.js context for execution, I have yet to have a table lock error.</p>
<p>I have not done exhaustive stress testing to try to force concurrent usage, but I used to have semi-frequent lock issues and have not since implementing the above technique.</p>
<p>YMMV.</p>
