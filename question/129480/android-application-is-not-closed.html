							<p>This is normal. If you are interested in the underlying reason, check out this post on StackOverflow regarding the topic of &quot;quitting&quot; apps on Android. It includes a quote from Android engineer Romain Guy: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;2033914&#x2F;quitting-an-application-is-that-frowned-upon">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;2033914&#x2F;quitting-an-application-is-that-frowned-upon</a></p>
<p>The reason RAM grows but does not reduce is that aps on Android will typically take all that is alotted to them and keep it in terms of resources. Android, behind the scenes, will free these resources only when necessary. In other words, Android&#39;s app lifecycle takes care of managing resources and actually quitting apps for you.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m having a very similar issue with my App, in fact it&#39;s my last remaining issue before release. Basically memory just grows and grows every time the Activity is restarted. I understand the Android lifecycle but I think there is still an issue because the resources are not being freed and after only 3 restarts my App will not load images because the VM reports that there is insufficient free memory. I&#39;m using SDK 1.7.5 and interestingly enough I&#39;ve noticed that the problem appears to be much less prevelant in SDK 1.8.2, but I can&#39;t use SDK 1.8.2 as image aspect ratio handling doesn&#39;t work.</p>
