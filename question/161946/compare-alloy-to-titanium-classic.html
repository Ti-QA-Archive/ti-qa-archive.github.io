			<p>I am developing an app in Classic and someone said it would work better using Alloy.  The app has instagram-like feature, facebook-like elements and location based elements.</p>
<p>What are the main differences?</p>
<p>What are the pros of using just Classic or Alloy?</p>
<p>What are the cons or using just Classic or Alloy?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The first thing to take into account is that Alloy and Classic are both Titanium.  In the documentations own words &quot;Alloy is an application framework built on top of the Titanium SDK designed to help rapidly develop high quality applications and reduce maintenance&quot;.</p>
<p>So it is not should you use one over the other - but more about how structured do you want to be?</p>
<p>Writing an app without the Alloy frame is perfectly fine and we have all done it - partly because we previously did not have Alloy but sometimes because moving a big project into the framework can be a lot of work and of course time.</p>
<p>So if you are creating an new app (a 1.0 app) then I would recommend taking a bit of time and taking a look at a test app of your own to explore the framework and what you can do with it.  If you are updating an existing app then if you are simply making a few changes - do not bother - too much hard work.  If however the upgrade id a bigger process where you are revisiting many sections then it might be worth it to move to the alloy framework.</p>
<p>You mention you have facebook and instagram features - these do not change, as I said Alloy is a framework it is still Titanium code during and after the pre-compile process.</p>
<p>Everything you have learnt so far is still valid and will continue to be, you will need to know more due to the extra framework things you will need to know - but these are offset by the advantages and you gain including the stylesheets that used correctly can greatly increase the app wide appearance (because you define the rules that everything follows) but also they help you to manage the app by sectioning off functions and creating defined widgets and controllers to manage specific tasks that can be re-used.</p>
<p>In short;</p>
<ul>
<li>Never created an app before - Use Alloy, makes sense to start off as you will probably keep going</li>
<li>Created an app and want to make a few small changes - do not jump to Alloy</li>
<li>Big changes to an app in an update - consider Alloy</li>
</ul>
<p>Either way create a test app and play with some of the things that speed up the app development process; stylesheets, widgets, themes, controllers, built in support for underscore, moment and more (although all of these can be used without alloy of course).</p>
<p>I will only build app using Alloy from now on - big or small, but big apps that are already mature - the need to change is much less due to the scale of the work involved in making the changes.</p>

							<p><code>someone said it would work better using Alloy</code></p>
<p>First, ruling on that statement, </p>
<h2 id="bull-">Bull.</h2>
<p>Build an Alloy app. Look at the build (build&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;assets&#x2F;alloy&#x2F;controllers&#x2F;index_js as an example), holy crap! your Alloy files have been merged and precompiled to look like, well, Classic code!</p>
<h2 id="however-with-that-in-mind-">However, with that in mind…</h2>
<p>The question is, which is better for YOU.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Separation of concerns into xml, tss, js can make for an effective use of your time.  The changing of element orders can be faster, the changing of styles is faster.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Alloy optimizes your code by stripping out the the alloy specific platform conditional blocks so that these dont even appear in the other platform final code.  If you write classic, the conditional would have to be checked at run time</p>
</li>
</ol>

										<p><p>In our shop, all new projects will be Alloy.  We did not switch in 2013 because we had too many in-process.  We took nov&#x2F;dec as a firm to evaluate and get up to speed on Alloy.</p>
