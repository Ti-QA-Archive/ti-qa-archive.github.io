			<h1>Whats the reason for having to pay for the kitchen sink on android</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Why do we have to pay for the kitchen sink on android isn&#39;t it supposed to be a learning tool.</p>
<p>I have grabbed it from github and it will not run on the Android emulator, </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Failed installing com<span class="hljs-class">.appcelerator</span><span class="hljs-class">.titanium</span>:     pkg: /data/local/tmp/app<span class="hljs-class">.apk</span>
Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_MISSING_SHARED_LIBRARY]
</code></pre><p>could someone also suggest some good android apps that have been built with titanium, trying to decided if this is the best way to go for a android mobile app, obviously i would be my preferred choice because i can build it in javascript, but cant seem to find any really good android apps built on titanium?</p>
<p>I have tried triplingo but it the screen just flashes crazy when i try to open it on my s3 galaxy?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I spent most of last night rebuilding and submitting nearly all our binaries (and those of clients) to address this particular issue.</p>
<p>As an aside, how are you liking your S3?  I had to get rid of that lousy Samsung keyboard and its mis-predictive-text and quickly load up SwiftKey. It would &#39;predict&#39; things and I&#39;d be confused about what I was even wanting to type.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll tell you that the USB host is great.  Cables available on Amazon for $.05 and shipping. Watched Big Buck Bunny (720p) played off a flash drive over the cable.  Very cool indeed.</p>

							<p>You don&#39;t have to pay for the KitchenSink. The version you saw on the Android Market was put up there (for a fee) by someone hoping to cash in on the sample. </p>
<p>There was a post on the Q&amp;A a while back and the outcome of it was that, since the code is open-source, there isn&#39;t much Appcelerator can do about it.</p>
<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.appcelerator.titanium&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5hcHBjZWxlcmF0b3IudGl0YW5pdW0iXQ..">Here is the link to a version made available for free</a>. This should get you up to speed on your Android device.</p>

										<p><p>Weird, If you go to google play store on a android and search for titanium kitchen sink you see there is a paid one on their for £1.25 but after searching some more i can see their is also a free one i would suggest getting rid off the paid one as it doesnt look good for you guys and the comments are not that good, considering people havent also noticed that there is also a free one as well ;)</p>

							<p>Also looking at your error: </p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Failure <span class="hljs-string">[INSTALL_FAILED_MISSING_SHARED_LIBRARY]</span>
</code></pre><p>This often indicates a device or AVD that does not have the Google APIs installed.</p>
