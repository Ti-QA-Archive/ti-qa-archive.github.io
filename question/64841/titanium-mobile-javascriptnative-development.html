			<h1>Titanium Mobile JavaScript/Native Development</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am a relatively new Titanium Mobile user.<br>I started using Titanium because the possibility for developing (semi-)native applications for the most popular mobile platforms (iPhone, Android, Blackberry in the making) was very promising.</p>
<p>However, in the past monhts I began to lose my confidence in the platform, based on accumulated knowledge of its inner workings. I am not quite ready to abandon all hope yet, so I will ask several general questions, hoping that I have mis-understood something or there are other ways.</p>
<p>First, let me state my goals: I want to build an application infrastructure around Titanium. I need to achieve the following goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Goal1. Be able to develop&#x2F;deploy native UI on iPhone&#x2F;Android client devices.</li>
<li>Goal2. Be able to implement and expose server-hosted services in uniform manner, that can be easily consumed by the mobile clients mentioned in Goal1.</li>
<li>Goal3. Goal1 and Goal2 must be achieved productively, with little overhead per new project.</li>
</ul>
<p>&gt;What have I done up until now:</p>
<ul>
<li>(Goal1) Obviouslu, using Titanium, I am able to create native interfaces for the target platforms</li>
<li>(Goal2) I have chosen a common platform-independent protocol for communication: XML-RPC</li>
<li>(Goal2) I have implemented a Java-XMLRPC bridge, which makes exposing pure Java services a breeze</li>
<li>(Goal2) I have modified a JavaScript XML-RPC client to work on the iPhone. This client converts XML-RPC documents to JavaScript objects. The client uses the HttpRequest Titanium object to perform remote invocations</li>
</ul>
<p>&gt;Going back to the point of this topic - my<br>PROBLEMS and QUESTIONS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problem1. The iPhone XML-RPC client is very slow and takes up LARGE amounts of memory for heavier requests. I have tried to analyze the situation using XCode&#39;s instruments. I can see MANY objects of type TiDOMElementProxy and TiDOMNodeListProxy. Below you can find a screenshot of Xcode Instruments Leaks. It is made afted one (!) XML-RPC request was made returning around 100 serialized objects with their properties in XML:<br>(Please note that if we invoke the service only without working with the result, such objects are not created)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;img525.imageshack.us&#x2F;img525&#x2F;3503&#x2F;titaniumleaks.jpg" alt="Titanium Project in XCode Leaks"></p>
<p>&gt;So, here are some related questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Question1. The most general question: Am I right in the following assumption: Titanium Mobile is executed as JavaScript (within WebKit), with some hooks that redirect specific JavaScript calls to the Objective-C universe. If this is correct, how are objects passed between these two universes and what is the overhead of these operations? I can only imagine that some kind of pairs (JavaScript proxy)&#x2F;(Objective-C proxy + real object) exist in order for the framework to operate.</li>
</ul>
<p>&gt;And a more detailed question:</p>
<ul>
<li>Question2. Am I right in the following assumption: The HttpRequest.xmlResponse returns a proxy to a Objective-C DOM tree, which (as a single proxy) is not a performance and memory hog. But then, the JavaScript XML-RPC parser starts to pull parts of the DOM tree into JavaScript objects - Strings, numbers, dates, arrays, maps. Each pulled part of the DOM tree needs a pair of JavaScript variable and Objective-C proxy. We end up having thousands of pairs of javascript&#x2F;proxy objects. This behaviour  heavily affects at least device CPU and Memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the logical question:</p>
<ul>
<li>Question3. Can this be avoided at all? Have someone been the same road and found a way to use XML-based protocols for communication without the overhead described above? Maybe there is a way to use the real JavaScript XMLHttpRequest object - I have the feeling that it will be much lighter and faster?</li>
</ul>
<p>&gt;Thanks in advance, Georgi</p>

							<p>Hi Georgi</p>
<p>I&#39;m working at quite the same thing as you! I implemented the JS-XMLRPC in my application. It works fine with creating a request (although it might be because there are quite few properties)  - but processing a response takes forever. Did you find an approach to speed the whole thing up? </p>
<p>Best regards!</p>
