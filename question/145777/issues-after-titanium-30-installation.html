		<section>
			<p>Hi, I&#39;m experiencing some issues after Titanium 3.0 installation.</p>
<ul>
<li>I can&#39;t compile on iOS device with SDK&lt;6 but I need to do it. Is there any way to add 5.1 SDK? In the previous version of Titanium I could choose from a dropdown menu the SDK version (now, there&#39;s only 6.0);</li>
<li>I have a valid provision but Titanium says it isn&#39;t; </li>
<li>The iOS simulator ALWAYS fails;</li>
<li>I can&#39;t use the Titanium 3 SDK (error message);</li>
<li>I can&#39;t install the CLI package (Error encountered during update);</li>
</ul>
<p>Is there any way to return back to my previous Titanium version? This way I simply can&#39;t work…</p>

							<p>Now I have 3&#x2F;5 issues solved: the first and the second in the list are NOT solved.</p>
<p>But:</p>
<ul>
<li>The IOS Simulator now works: directly open the simulator, then from the program menu: IOS Simulator &gt; Reset content and settings…;</li>
<li>You can use the Titanium 3 SDK if you download the CLI;</li>
<li>You can install the CLI only if you previously install NodeJS;</li>
</ul>
<p>If someone has hints about first and second issues…   :-)</p>

							<p>To better debug your problems let&#39;s do a few things.</p>
<p>First, launch the terminal and run <code>titanium config cli.logLevel trace</code>.</p>
<p>Now, run <code>titanium info -t ios</code>. This will print out all sorts of iOS related dev environment information such as Xcode versions, iOS SDK versions, provisioning profiles, and so on. Using this info, you can verify that you have a iOS 5.1 Simulator installed and that the appropriate provisioning profiles exist.</p>
<p>Next change into your project directory and run <code>titanium clean</code>. Then run <code>titanium build -p ios --sim-version 5.1</code> to perform a build and launch the 5.1 Simulator.</p>
<p>Regarding item 3, yeah &quot;Reset Content and Settings&quot; is your friend. For item 5, the new CLI (thus Titanium 3.0) require node.js 0.8+.</p>
<p>Give this a try and lets see if we can get your issues resolved.</p>

										<p><p>Hi Chris. Aside from launching the terminal, I currently USE the three simulators with XCode… so they are installed.   :-)   Anyway, this is part of the second command output: &quot;Xcode<br>4.5.2 (build 4G2008a)<br>  Install Location                 = &#x2F;Applications&#x2F;Xcode.app&#x2F;Contents&#x2F;Developer<br>  iOS SDKs                         = 6.0<br>  iOS Simulators                   = 5.0, 5.1, 6.0&quot;<br>Same for the provisioning file: I can see it in &quot;green&quot; (working) state from XCode and I see it in the terminal output (&quot;UUID                             = D6C86F39-F68D-480A-B2F9-7937AC7FCA2F<br>  App Prefix                       = M2JE828MIT).</p>

										<p><p>@Kiwi Cool, the Titanium CLI is working. I&#39;m not sure the best way to debug Studio. In the preferences, there should be an iOS section somewhere and you can &quot;refresh&quot; the list of certs and provisioning profiles.</p>

										<p><p>@Chris Barber: problem is I should be able to deploy&#x2F;test on a 5.1 real device and there&#39;s no way to load the 5.1 SDK in the dropdown menu. So, at the moment, anything related to the real device (not simulator) is not working the way it worked with the previous TitaniumStudio version.</p>

										<p><p>@Kiwi, you don&#39;t need iOS 5.1 SDK to build for a 5.1 device. You can build with the iOS 6 SDK and it will still run on a 5.1 device.</p>
<p>Also, there was a bug in older versions of Titanium Studio where the iOS SDK dropdown would incorrectly list all the iOS Simulators, not the actual installed iOS SDKs. That means if you have iOS 6 SDK installed with iOS 5.1 and 6.0 Simulators installed, it would allow you to pick 5.1 or 6.0. Picking 5.1 would then tell the build scripts to use 5.1, but the build script wouldn&#39;t find 5.1 and would actually just use 6.0 anyways. Crazy, I know.</p>

							<p>@Kiwi:<br>For the first item in your list, I think this is what you are seeing: Xcode 4.5.x comes with iOS 6 SDK. Studio previously had a bug where &quot;run on device&quot; builds were showing the list of simulators instead of the list of SDKs. So since you can only compile with the iOS SDK 6.0 with Xcode 4.5.2, if you set the pop-up (in run-on-device builds in the older Studio) to anything other than iOS 6, say to 5.0 or 5.1, then that setting would be ignored, and the build would compile with iOS SDK 6.0. These apps should run on devices running iOS 4.3 or better.</p>
<p>If you really need to compile against 5.0, the only way I know of is to install an older Xcode that comes with that SDK. If you do this, you need to run &quot;sudo xcode-select -switch &lt;your Xcode path goes here&gt;&quot; in terminal then restart studio to ensure the setting is used.</p>
<p>For your second item:<br>If your CLI installation is somehow not functioning, you may experience issues here. But aside from that, Studio will filter what you see based on your workflow. For example, if you want to run on device, you will only be presented with a list of development provisions. If you package, you will see only distribution provisions (Ad-hoc or app store). If you see none, try making a change to the list in Xcode, and this should force an update.</p>
<p>If you are able to build, but the console outputs a problem with the provision, paste the info and I can provide more help.</p>

							<p>I encountered the same problem and fixed it by updating the modules in my project. Some were not compatible with 3.x.</p>

										<p><p>There are very strange issues: any NEW project (empty, master-detail, etc) doesn&#39;t work in the simulator (it simply crashes). Some old projects are still working, but I don&#39;t understand why a new blank project does not work and some old ones are working.</p>
