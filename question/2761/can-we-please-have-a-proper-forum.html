			<p>i don&#39;t mean to sound ungrateful but, for me at least, this q&amp;a is totally unusable and a pain to navigate.</p>
<p>what was wrong with the old support forum?</p>
<p>the voting system is a nice idea but for some reason a post can&#39;t have a score &gt; 1. and as higher voted posts rise up through the thread you lose the chronology and logic to the question. it would work if there was an easy single answer to each question…but there isn&#39;t.</p>
<p>am i the only one you thinks this?</p>

A normal forum requires too much weeding through the cruft. A typical message board promotes leaching and &quot;me-to&quot; posts. In contrast, a Q&amp;A style promotes answers and community support towards a common goal. Understanding the philosophy of <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackexchange.com&#x2F;about">SO</a> helps a lot in developing a thriving community. &#39;Least that how I see it.</p>

							<p>Yeah, I kinda miss the old forum too. This one is a pain to navigate. Maybe you could bring back Categories and have the option to view threads by categories. Tags are a pain.</p>

							<p>the q&amp;a is still great! really good community here but i think its the lack of categories and not many questions per page which means that if you have a more complicated question where there is no signe correct answer, it gets lost very quickly.</p>
<p>has anyone else tried voting on a post with a score of 1? it doesn&#39;t go up.</p>
<p>good idea with the hosting. i need to get some new hosting which supports add-on domains and then i&#39;ll get a forum going! might not be for a few months though (if anyone has any hosting company suggestions let me know)!</p>

							<p>I&#39;m not so keen on this Q&amp;A thing either, its very difficult to find the most relevant question.</p>
<p>If you are interested I have just launched <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.talktitanium.com">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.talktitanium.com</a> a forum for the discussion of all things Ti related. Pop-by if you have a minute, it&#39;s extremely new so we need plenty of help to get it off the ground :-)</p>
<p>Thanks Sam</p>

							<p>no</p>
<p>+1 to have same forum from extjs.com. Problem is that appcelerator team really like basecamp stuff and more. I don&#39;t have problem with that, except for forum community, which has nothing to do with tickets etc.</p>

							<p>You can only vote for other people&#39;s issues. </p>
<p>if you&#39;d like to suggest some improvements (or issues found), feel welcome.  as you can see from the past week, we&#39;re making a number of improvements.</p>
<p>the problem with a &quot;regular forum&quot; is that it becomes a waste land of posts that are impossible to find and hard for us and you to monitor.  </p>
<p>voting has the nice benefit of us being able to see the Q&amp;A that people actually care about.  given we now have to be mindful of customers that have paid for professional support, we need a way to be able to continue to help with community support in a way that allows more important and popular issues to bubble to the top.</p>
<p>we&#39;re pretty open to improvements.</p>

										<p><p>With all due respect, Jeff, improvements have been suggested in this Q&amp;A but they have been ignored. There is no transparency about the developments going on behind the scenes, and what your current priorities are (and hence, how long we have to endure the problems people have raised).</p>
<ul>
<li>To my mind, an option to chronologically sort each thread is essential, as it&#39;s so difficult to follow posts about complicated Ti issues.</li>
<li>The search facility needs to be worked on - the reason you get so many duplicates is that it&#39;s so difficult to find anything. For example, I started a thread a couple of days ago with &quot;please&quot; in the title, but if you search for that term it doesn&#39;t even come up in the first few pages. There is also no way to search using a combination of a search term and &quot;most recent&quot;, which is intuitively how I would expect to obtain the correct result.  Of course, as it was me who started the thread, then I can use &quot;My Q&amp;A&quot; which is, incidentally, a good feature.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is there any chance you could respond to our concerns?</p>

							<p>i love this Q&amp;A helped me a lot those days…</p>
<p>a regular forum would not work for me. i like this Q&amp;A because its simple and fast :) we really don&#39;t need another forum with a &quot;counting post&quot; or other offtopic posts :)</p>
<p>BUT I would love some kind of usergroup section. i&#39;m thinking about hosting one in our coworking space in munich&#x2F;germany.</p>

							<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I don&#39;t mean to sound bad, but it&#39;s a relatively straightforward process (given some webspace with a capable hosting company) to create a bulletin-board forum. We need not be dependant on Appcelerator for absolutely everything.</p>
<p>It surely can&#39;t be a negative thing to have more places for discussions around Titanium - and I think they would work well in tandem with the Q&amp;A section here. In addition it would spread the word out over the net about the technology and draw more interested people towards Appcelerator.</p>
<p>cheers,<br>Chris.</p>

										<p><p>I couldn&#39;t agree with you less, Chris. I think the main motivation for people setting up Ti forums is precisely because the Q&amp;A does not deliver and the community is not being nurtured here. Although I admire the efforts of the respective creators, having forums dotted all over the place just serves to dilute the community. </p>
<p>From a productivity perspective alone, I would prefer to search a single knowledgebase than numerous different resources each with a small fraction of the content.</p>
