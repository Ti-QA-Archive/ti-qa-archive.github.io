			<h1>Sqlite locking problem</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I&#39;m getting a locking error on a query. Looks like an update is locking that table.</p>
<p>[ERROR] Error occurred calling next on a PLSqliteResultSet. SQLite error: &#39;database table is locked&#39; for &#39;UPDATE …[rest of update statement]&#39;</p>
<p>The update statement is running as background process using setInterval. I tried to unblock the reading with db.execute(&#39;PRAGMA read_uncommitted=true&#39;) but that didn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>Anyone got any ideas?</p>

							<p>Found it!  I had an SQL function where I forgot to call close() after the execute(…).  Once I closed it, the error went away.  Hopefully that&#39;s all it is (was?) for you as well.</p>

										<p><p>The database file will lock when a write action is being performed such as a insert, delete or update. You&#39;ll need to ensure that you close and&#x2F;or end the transaction of any insert&#x2F;delete&#x2F;update queries to prevent a locking run-time error. It&#39;s also worth noting that currently a try-catch around the query execution will not catch any SQL error notice.</p>

							<p>I have a similar problem - an Update statement running in the background with setInterval, which results in a &#39;database table is locked&#39; error.  If anyone has a guess, it&#39;d be appreciated.</p>

										<p><p>I found a select statement that wasn&#39;t being closed. After fixing that, my problem seems to have went away. Or at least I haven&#39;t seen the error in a since I found that. The problem was intermittent before so I can&#39;t be 100% sure.</p>

							<p>database may be locked due to running the titanium project again and again.This occurs<br>while copying resources.Since the resources are huge ,it takes time to run on the<br>emulater or device.so better keep the images or other resources in sdcard.</p>
