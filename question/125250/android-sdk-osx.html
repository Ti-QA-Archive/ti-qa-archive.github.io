			<p>I can&#39;t get Titanium Studios to recognize my installation of the Android sdk.  Every time I try and point the IDE to my working android sdk directory, it complains that it can&#39;t find it.  I was tasked with testing out this IDE and I can&#39;t even get the thing to work.  I&#39;ve done plenty of native development for both Android and iOS and think this platform is a joke but I have to work with it as it is expected from the people who make decisions. The documentation is pretty sparse on OSX&#x2F;Android setup.  Surprisingly, launching an application on the iOS simulator works right out of the box.  Any help would be appreciated.</p>

							<p>This was just answered earlier today.<br>There are two things:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Spaces in your sdk path are bad (particularly on windows)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Download API 7 from within the android utility.  This created an android-7 directory within your platforms directory.  This should resolve your problem.</p>
</li>
</ol>

							<p>Unfortunately this will not fix my issue.  There are not any spaces in my path.  Also I have all android SDKs that are publicly available and I made sure to update using the android utility.  I made sure that everything was checked and tried updating again.  It completes within less than a minute as all of the platforms are already downloaded and installed.</p>

							<p>A temporary work around for anyone who&#39;s interested…</p>
<p>Make a symbolic link from any of the existing platforms in your directory to android-7.  If you&#39;re like me and your platforms folder looks more like &#39;android-2.1_r02-macosx&#39; you will need to make a symbolic link for each of these platforms to the naming convention that Titanium Studio is expecting it to be stored under.  </p>
<p>Making a symbolic link in OSX is as simple as firing up the terminal app, and typing the following command :<br>     sudo ln -s &#x2F;path&#x2F;to&#x2F;real&#x2F;directory &#x2F;name-titanium-expects</p>
<p>This should only be used as a temporary workaround until they can fix this mess.  When you&#39;re ready to get rid of the symbolic links, just navigate to the platforms directory again and type:<br>    sudo rm -f &#x2F;name-titanium-expects<br>This will only delete the link and it won&#39;t have any effect on the real directory it was pointing to.</p>
