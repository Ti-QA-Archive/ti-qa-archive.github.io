							<p>Hi</p>
<p>There is a very long explanation as to why this is a better idea and a simple one, I will post it as a comment to this answer - it did get away from me a bit and ended up being very long.</p>
<p>This example will provide the same layout and size when using iOS and Android even on different sized devices.</p>
<p>There are two blocks of code provided here, to test either one (both are stand-alone apps) create a new default project and replace the contents of <strong>app.js</strong> with EITHER block of code below - one block per test.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Ti.UI.setBackgroundColor(<span class="hljs-string">'#000'</span>);

var win1 = Ti.UI.createWindow({  
    backgroundColor: <span class="hljs-string">'#fff'</span>,
    title: <span class="hljs-string">'Tab 1'</span>
});
var tab1 = Ti.UI.createTab({  
    icon: <span class="hljs-string">'KS_nav_views.png'</span>,
    title: <span class="hljs-string">'Tab 1'</span>,
    window: win1
});

var view = Ti.UI.createView({
    <span class="hljs-variable">height</span>: Ti.UI.SIZE,
    layout: <span class="hljs-string">'vertical'</span>,
    left: <span class="hljs-number">0</span>,
    top: <span class="hljs-number">0</span>,
    <span class="hljs-variable">width</span>: Ti.UI.FILL,
});
win1.<span class="hljs-built_in">add</span>(view);

var lbl = Ti.UI.createLabel({
    <span class="hljs-built_in">color</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'#000'</span>,
    font: {
        fontSize: <span class="hljs-string">'14dp'</span>

var tabGroup = Ti.UI.createTabGroup();
tabGroup.addTab(tab1);
tabGroup.<span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>();

										<p><p>Hi</p>
<p>The easiest way to achieve this is to use device independent pixels <strong>(dp)</strong>, this convert the numerical data into a constant layout matrix that helps to even the playing field when making sure that you can support multiple devices each having; different physical pixel widths and densities.</p>
<p>As iOS and Android both use different defaults to translate numerical  values into to positions on the device you are seeing those differences played out in your app.</p>
<p>A short description of the differences - a fuller version can be found here <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;Layouts,_Positioning,_and_the_View_Hierarchy">Layouts, Positioning, and the View Hierarchy</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS use <strong>dp</strong></li>
<li>Android uses pixels</li>
</ul>
<p>The easiest way to think of the difference is the way iOS works as standard using <strong>DP</strong>.  Think iPhone, the iPhone has a pixel width of 320 pixels and the iPhone retina has a pixel width of 640 pixels.  However when you are adding something to the far right of the screen you provide 320 as the answer for BOTH iPhone and iPhone retina, because the <strong>DP</strong> solution has 1 DP = 2 pixels on the retina devices.  This way we only have to think about laying out our app once for iOS and both Retina and Non-retina look the same.</p>
<p>This technique aid in the simplicity of providing an interface without having to worry about the details.  Right now you may be thinking, &quot;but that wastes pixels on the retina iPhone&quot;.  You would be right AND wrong.  You would be right as you are not referencing each specific pixels but instead a 2x2 grid on tiny pixels, but now both screen resolutions are positioned correctly.  You CAN still access the actual pixels simply write <strong>320px</strong> instead of <strong>320</strong> the first one is actually HALF way across the screen.  Now you can access every pixel.  But before you think that is great, this is not good for layouts as you non-retina devices will guess how to position that point as it would not appear in an actual location it could map.</p>
<p>Android uses pixels, so here the opposite is true, you are specifying the specific pixel each time, but now you would have to manage the translation yourself for each potential scale factor of devices.</p>
<p>So the easiest thing to do is to try and force them both to behave the same.  But which way? If we force pixels then we have to manage a lot of scale calculations on the fly.  So they easiest (but not always perfect) way is to go the <strong>dp</strong> route.  This way when you specify a point on the screen it is translated for you and you simply think in terms of a virtual screen.</p>
<p>If you think in terms of all devices having a virtual width of 320 wide when held in portrait then the <strong>dp</strong> solution means that you specify <strong>0</strong> for left, <strong>160</strong> for centre and <strong>320</strong> for far right - for ALL phone format devices.  For other devices there are some small differences but much easier to consider using this technique.</p>
<p>Now, whilst this is a simply solution - this is NOT the answer for all apps of all types on all devices.  I am offering advice to provide the simplest and fastest solution for most phone device apps.  Once you have nailed this thought process (easy to do in a tiny amount of time) you are then able to comprehend what to do in the other cases.</p>
<p>So - how to tell Titanium that you want to use <strong>dp</strong> as a unit of measure.  There are two main ways;</p>
<ul>
<li>State your choice on each dimension, position and size;</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="hljs">var txt = Ti.UI.createTextField({
    borderStyle: Ti.UI.INPUT_BORDERSTYLE_ROUNDED,
    <span class="hljs-built_in">color</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'#000'</span>,
    font: {
        fontSize: <span class="hljs-string">'14dp'</span>
    },
    <span class="hljs-variable">height</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'40dp'</span>,
    top: <span class="hljs-string">'10dp'</span>,
    value: <span class="hljs-string">'Malcolm'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-variable">width</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'300dp'</span>
});
</code></pre><ul>
<li>However I prefer NOT having to convert all my numbers into strings and suffix them.  Mostly because I am likely to forget one and that is a pain to track down, but also your code editor colour codes numbers differently from strings which makes it easier to see numbers from a distance.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="hljs">var txt = Ti.UI.createTextField({
    borderStyle: Ti.UI.INPUT_BORDERSTYLE_ROUNDED,
    <span class="hljs-built_in">color</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'#000'</span>,
    font: {
        fontSize: <span class="hljs-number">14</span>
    },
    <span class="hljs-variable">height</span>: <span class="hljs-number">40</span>,
    top: <span class="hljs-number">10</span>,
    value: <span class="hljs-string">'Malcolm'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-variable">width</span>: <span class="hljs-number">300</span>
});
</code></pre><p>But to still use simple numbers you have to tell your app you want to use <strong>dp</strong> all the time as your preferred unit of measurement - good news; Titanium thought of that.</p>
<p>Edit your <strong>tiapp.xml</strong> file which you will find here;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-regexp">/{appname}/</span>tiapp.xml <span class="hljs-comment">// this file</span>
<span class="hljs-regexp">/{appname}/</span>resources/
<span class="hljs-regexp">/{appname}/</span>resources/app.js
</code></pre><p>If you are editing this file in Titanium studio, swap to the <strong>tiapp.xml</strong> tab at the bottom of the file editor, if you are editing it in another editor you are already there.</p>
<p>Find the entry;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">property</span> <span class="hljs-property">name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"ti.ui.defaultunit"</span> type=<span class="hljs-string">"string"</span>&gt;system&lt;/<span class="hljs-keyword">property</span>&gt;
</code></pre><p>And change it to the following (if the entry did not appear <em>look hard</em> add the following)</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">property</span> <span class="hljs-property">name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"ti.ui.defaultunit"</span> type=<span class="hljs-string">"string"</span>&gt;dp&lt;/<span class="hljs-keyword">property</span>&gt;
</code></pre><p>Note the <strong>system</strong> value has changed to <strong>dp</strong>.</p>
<p>Re-compile the app and now you can use the simple number system.</p>
<p>This has ended up being much longer than I expected, if you have reached this far WITHOUT falling asleep - give your self a little clap - you did well ;-)</p>

										<p><p>Hi Malcom,</p>
<p>I have followed the same approach (dp) that you have mentioned above. But it was not working as per the expectation.</p>
<p>Let say I have a textbox having 250dp and tested the same on iphone simulator. But what it should be on iPad. Will it be covered the place with same ratio w.r.t. iphone on iPad.</p>
<p>Please suggest.</p>

										<p><p>Short answer no.</p>
<p>You should not expect a phone and a tablet to have the same exact layout or aspect ratio.</p>
<p>All the suggestions and recommendation above are to allow you to manage the different densities of each device - not to make each device look the same.</p>
<p>The logic here is that an iPhone and an iPhone retina will end up with the same layout as they are the same aspect and the same width and height.  But the iPad is a different ratio and larger actual device.  When designing for a larger devices you should have different layouts.</p>
<p>Pick up an iPhone and an iPad using the same app and see how developers make use of the extra screen real estate.  </p>
<p>The (almost) only time you should ever hope that one layout fits all (ignoring the obvious aspect ratio issues) is if you are creating a game.</p>

										<p><p>@Malcom : I got you. i.e. if we are design will be different for different device for IOS. But if we look for Android, it has different resolutions and size for phone and same for tablets.<br>So in that case, if tablets having different size, how to manage styling in tss file. Like</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">
"<span class="hljs-tag">TextBox</span><span class="hljs-attr_selector">[platform=android formFactor=tablet]</span>": <span class="hljs-rules">{ 
    <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">backgroundColor</span>:<span class="hljs-value"> <span class="hljs-string">"#0f0"</span>,
    width:<span class="hljs-number">200</span>    
</span></span></span>}
</code></pre><p>So on above case for all tablets in Android the text box will be of 200 dp. Then will it be look same in same ration for all tables with different sizes.<br>Please correct me if I am wrong at any place.</p>

<p>The above post changed the idea which malcom suggested. It totally relies on percentage. Using <strong>dp</strong> works well with all android &amp; ios devices along with tabs &amp; ipad but only in <strong>portrait</strong> mode.</p>
<p>But when it comes to <strong>landscape</strong> orientation again calculation needs to be done to match the design which is very difficult &amp; results in force close. Percentage rule suggested in above post works well for all android devices along with <strong>landscape</strong> &amp; <strong>portrait</strong> mode, I have not tested it for ios devices.</p>
<p>So is <strong>percentage</strong> or <strong>dp</strong> the right solution to use &amp; complete the app.</p>
<p>Is there any other way to solve the problem of <strong>landscape orientation</strong>?</p>

										<p><p>You were as surprised as I was initially having read that article.  Having spoken with Ricardo afterwards and pointing out my distinctly opposite views he explained that this was to be a start of a series of posts that will provide more than the simple documentation of facts - but add to it by having real world examples using more than one feature at a time - which is great news.</p>
<p>The post was also designed to provide one solution to make it easier for those coming into Titanium from a web background.  This was not meant to provide a baseline for all people - more a starting point for those who have yet to manage their own best practices situations that cannot all have the same &quot;one size fits all&quot; answer.</p>
<p>Ricardo has asked me to create a follow up post that explains how to achieve complicated layouts without the percentage - which I still thing is a cheat and should be used as a stepping stone only if you came from a web background.  But do not get me wrong percentages can help but they are very much the exception and only in some circumstances.  I will be answering the comments you made in the article with examples in code and visuals - which is why it will be in a post on the main site.</p>
<p>I hope to have my work on the post completed within the week, I imagine I will be asked to provide more best cases going forward.  I do have a significant wealth of experience and currently ranked the #1 expert here - so I have seen it all.</p>
<p>Some of the more seasoned community (including myself) have created a blog that helps support the titanium community <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tidev.io&#x2F;">tidev.io</a> that aims to help fill in some of the gaps the documentation does not explore, suggest books that are worthwhile to read, introduce new concepts and modules.  Go and visit this site (everyone) it is an excellent resource that is only getting bigger.</p>
<p>Shortly I am releasing a new development magazine (digital of course) that will go into all the subjects that you need to know beyond simply adding tables and buttons - it will be &quot;deep dives&quot; where each issue will take a specific subject and by the end you will know everything you had to know on the subject.  This will be promoted by Appcelerator when launched so you will know when to look out for it.</p>
<p>I hope this helps you understand your questions will have a detailed answer including why DP is significantly better than percentages and how to crack the landscape problem.</p>

										<p><p>Using percentages is a really bad idea IMHO - Did you have your chat with Macolm yet Muhammad ? :-)</p>
<p>Definitely try &#39;dp&#39; values instead</p>

										<p><p>@Muhammad - I have posted a very long explanation as to why using <strong>dp</strong> can be a MUCH easier solution that using percentages.  Take a look and let me have any follow-up questions.  This was the chat I suggest the other day ;-)</p>

							<p>Hello Mechri,</p>
<p>if you want exactly same for both platform, i can suggest you one thing that use the images for every single design that you want. and it&#39;s hard to manage via coding so better thing is to make designing for that.</p>
<p>because every platform has their own designing for components.so better to use images.</p>
