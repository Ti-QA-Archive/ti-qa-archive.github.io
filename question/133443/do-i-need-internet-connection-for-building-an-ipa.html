			<h1>Do I need Internet connection for building an IPA?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a problem. Right now i am on WLAN Connection with some closed ports. I tried to make an ipa from Appcelerator. Simaltor works great and my provisioning profiles are bringing no error, but after a while nothing happens. Last message is: Compiling localization files. The next step should bring the .ipa into iTunes. It worked always without problems, but now nothing happens, with other apps too. I am not sure if my Titanium is somehow broken or it just needs an Internet Connection for building an ipa. Some ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

							<p>I don&#39;t know if you need internet connection, but you can also build your IPA from xCode opening your project from build folder.</p>
<p>In xcode select Build for Archive and when the process is complete select Archive.</p>
<p>Your app will be builded and archived, then in the next window you can select &quot;share&quot; option to save as ipa.</p>

							<p>Hello Stefano, thanks for the answer. I thought exactely the same and did it, but in xcode everything its done and shortly before the and nothing happens. No errors no alerts, nothing it just only saying archiving for… but the progress bar doesnt move. So it is very strange and lets me thinks that it really needs an internet connection. Maybe someone can test to build the ipa without the internet connection and can tell me more. Its really frustrating, never had problems with it.</p>
