			<h1>Device unsubscribing when trying to push to it</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Push notifications using the cloud and cloudpush have been working fine over the last couple of months of development but have now started to display a very strange behavior. As a new user logs in the device get subscribed using the device token. This can be verified in the API console and works fine as it has before. However when a push is sent to the device (either from the console or by using the HTTP API) the push message fail and the device is no longer subscribed.</p>
<p>I&#39;m using GCM and an android device for the debugging. The app code has not changed between workng state and broken.</p>
<p>Have anybody experienced any similar problems? Any ideas?</p>

							<p>I have been diving deeper into the issue and realised that the first push notification sent after subscribing a device will repond with code 200 and behave as if it worked. The next one will fail with code 400 and message &quot;Subscription not found&quot;. The same is seen in the request logs. However when looking at the push logs every request have sending status fail.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t be the only one expeciencing this right now. My code is unchanged but the behavior of the server has changed.</p>
