			<h1>Different animation results on iOS and Android</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#39;m stuck on a couple of animation problems.</p>
<p>I have a nice stopwatch with a hand that I am animating around the clockface. I have a wonderfully smooth animation that works fine on iOS with this code:</p>
<p><a href="git:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;1100760.git">link to github code</a></p>
<p>However on Android the &quot;hand&quot; view always flicks back to the starting position, the anchorPoint does absolutely nothing and the audio cues never play.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve managed to figure out a workaround on the anchorpoint by extending my hand graphic so that the anchorpoint is in the middle of the graphic - the rest is transparent.</p>
<p>Can anyone see why this wouldnt work on Android but does on iOS?<br>Thanks</p>

							<div><p>I would like to agree with you. Animations on iOS are perfect, but animations on Android seem very edgy and glitchy and not very nice. I try and stay away from Android animations as much as I can, but whenever I do use them they are quite… Not nice.</p>
