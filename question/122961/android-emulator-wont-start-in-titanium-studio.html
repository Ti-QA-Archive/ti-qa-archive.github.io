							<p>I just dealt with this myself last night.  I had to install the JAVA and Android SDKs in my root folder on Windows because the default is <code>Program Files</code>.</p>
<p>Further investigation found that there&#39;s an issue with (I think) the Android SDK and it can&#39;t deal with the spaces i the folder name for the AVD.</p>
<p>I&#39;m also on XP, so I used fsutil to create a hardlink to the adb.ex and AdbWinApi.dll files.</p>
<p>I added the JAVA and Android folder to my Windows PATH, and then restared my computer.</p>
<p>After it restarted, I launched the Android SDK and launched Titanium.  I launched the Kitchen Sink app and let Titanium create the AVD.</p>
<p>I closed Titanium, and launched the AVD from the Android SDK.  I waited until the AVD came up and finished loading.</p>
<p>After I launched the AVD, I relaunched the Kitchen Sink app and it finished compiling, loaded and launched in the AVD that was up.</p>
<p>I thought I went through all of the documentation, but who knows… I finally got mine running and even installed my first app to my phone ;)</p>
