			<h1>transfering data from local db to webserver db process</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey - </p>
<p>I am using the latest titanium sdk and i would like to transfer data that I have stored in a local titanium db to a webserver db.</p>
<p>For this process I have been told to do a SOAP process but I have been reading that it is very cumbersome and causes more data usage.  </p>
<p>To do without soap do I need to convert local db data into json strings and then enter those parameters into PHP script on the webserver to insert into the webserver db?</p>
<p>I know this is a multistep process and I want to focus on what I need to learn first ie (converting a data array of json strings from a sqlite db)</p>
<p>thanks for all the help guys</p>

							<p>If you can work out how to receive standard form submissions through PHP then you have that side covered.  By this I mean no more complicated that if you had create a web form and then posted it back to the server - then processed that data.</p>
<p>If you can do that then the processing side is sorted.</p>
<p>To pass the data you should use the XHR info from the kitchen sink app or the documentation.  From this you can send form data to the server which you solution above will receive.</p>
<p>For a form post you can do something like this (simplified)</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">var xhr = Ti.Network.createHTTPClient();
xhr.onload = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> {</span>
    Ti.API.<span class="hljs-built_in">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'xhr status'</span>, xhr.status);
    response = this.responseText;
    Ti.API.<span class="hljs-built_in">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'response'</span>, response);
};
xhr.onerror = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(e)</span> {</span>
    Ti.API.<span class="hljs-built_in">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'error'</span>, e);
};

xhr.open(<span class="hljs-string">'POST'</span>, url);
xhr.send(param);
</code></pre><p>url = your fully qualified url<br>param = things you are passing</p>
<p>onload fires if what you sent worked<br>onerror fires - you can guess this one</p>
<p>tip for param</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> param = {
    firstname: <span class="hljs-string">'Ma'</span>,
    lastname: <span class="hljs-string">'Ho'</span>,
    id: <span class="hljs-number">6</span>
};
</code></pre><p>You can pass multiple values to the API, each of these are the equivalent of the form input and textareas in html - you respond to them in the same way.</p>

										<p><p>so i dont even have to do anything with JSON? i could theoretically create an array of strings from the sqlite db and pass that info by traversing through it to the php script?</p>

										<p><p>Pretty much that is right, as long as you can &#39;catch&#39; the information at the server then you can do it any way you like.</p>
<p>You should balance speed, usability, security against which method you end up using.</p>
<p>When passing an array make sure you are able to accept and process those fields on the server as there is a bit more logic to handle than simple string fields.</p>
<p>There are many ways to achieve what you want to do, SOAP is certainly a common one, but can often be an extra overhead that you do not need.</p>
<p>If you are passing personal or confidential information always have a HTTPS as the end point rather than HTTP.  Also you should consider having some simple (at least) security to make sure you are the one posting to the server.  If the URL got out - then hackers and morons tend to flock.</p>
<p>Something like a token or rule based logic to when and how it is passed is good.  For example adding a random string into an XHR header that you can check in the PHP script - is a good a simple way.</p>
<p>If you think this has helped - remember to mark it as such.</p>
