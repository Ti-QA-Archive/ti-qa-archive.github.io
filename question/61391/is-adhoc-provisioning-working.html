			<h1>Is AdHoc provisioning working?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I read on here that there were some issues with the adhoc distribution a few months back. I&#39;m wondering if the latest version fixes those problems. I downloaded a adhoc provision and added it to Titanium. It says its packaging the app but then just stops with no file output to my selected destination. Just wondering if I&#39;m doing something wrong of if this is a common issue.</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<p>Fish</p>

							<p>Once you see the app in the Archived Applications tab, you have to select that build and click on share application on the bottom which allows you to save the file. You should see something like this: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blogcdn.com&#x2F;www.tuaw.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;2010&#x2F;05&#x2F;snapz001.jpg  .. then you select the provision profile and hit save to disk. Make sure to send both the profile and the .ipa when you&#39;re sending it to your clients. </p>
<p>TiDev used use the package destination folder route but apple changed that so you see need to define that field even tho it doesn&#39;t do anything. I guess that field would be removed in the next update of TiDev. </p>

							<p>Did you add it to XCode first? (double-click the provisioning file) </p>

							<p>Thanks for the reply. </p>
<p>Yes I did. Actually now that I ran the process again. I realized that it was throwing me into Organizer when titanium finished compiling. </p>
<p>From there I can select Archived Applications in xcodes organizer and I see the version in there. I just assumed it was going to add the files to the package destination that I selected but thats still blank. But I can get to the newly compiled at from the organizer. Which seems to be good. I&#39;ll pass it on to my adhoc team of testers and see if they can install it. </p>

							<p>I had no problem with adhoc&#39;s since 1.3. If you can compile for the appstore, you should be able to compile for adhocs. </p>
