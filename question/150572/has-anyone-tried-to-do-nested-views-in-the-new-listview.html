			<h1>Has anyone tried to do nested views in the new listView?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>With custom tableviews I could basicly add one view to another view as its container in a nested fashion.  However with all the examples I&#39;ve seen of the new listview, it seems all the views are basicly stacked one after another in order.  Has anyone tried to somehow nest the views?  I cant think of how I would do that, but hopefuly someone smarter then me has figured out a way?</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>The first thing to keep in mind is that <strong>listView</strong> and <strong>tableView</strong> are different solutions to the same problem - they will co-exist but you need to choose which one solves your specific needs.</p>
<p><strong>tableView</strong></p>
<p>The original way of displaying tabular data or at least rows or data&#x2F;information.  This started off with a very simply approach;</p>
<ul>
<li>Title</li>
<li>Optional Left and Right Images</li>
<li>Choice of right hand side element; none, child, detail or tick</li>
</ul>
<p>This provided the ability to information in many ways - but not lots of ways.  Then it gained the ability to include views or any sort in any layout and you could mix them up to suit your needs - perfect.  This now gave everything you could ever need.</p>
<p>However one drawback is that some times you want to focus on speed.  As the <strong>tableView</strong> allowed so many combinations of views it can slow down the processing and rendering of those views - particularly on older devices.  It also led to some badly written or thought out layouts that added to the performance issues.</p>
<p>People who have been playing with the <strong>tableView</strong> for a long time know how to make the most out of it without the struggle of extra performance or memory issues.  Me included - but I am old so - I have been here longer.</p>
<p>Even for us old pros - they could sometimes be a better way to achieve the same goal, and increase the development process, the maintainability, the raw speed and decrease the memory requirements.</p>
<p>So the <strong>listView</strong> was born.</p>
<p><strong>listView</strong></p>
<p>As I say <strong>tableView</strong> uses child views to render data, the big difference of <strong>listView</strong> is that is focuses on the data side of things.  In order to do this the <strong>listView</strong> has a few standard layouts of the information you would normally use.  These include many (but not all) of the ways information is traditionally displayed in apps.</p>
<p>It will NOT replace <strong>tableView</strong> and will NOT allow every layout you could want - that is what the <strong>tabeView</strong> is for.</p>
<p>However if you want the maximum speed opportunity then the promise of the <strong>listView</strong> is just that.  Define the presentation of one of the standard layouts and then throw data at it.</p>
<p>The <strong>listView</strong> then already has everything it needs to display the information and can more intelligently display the data when on screen and reduces the amount of off-screen caching that would be needed for the <strong>tableView</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Choice</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you need raw speed and one of the currently available fixed layouts suits your needs - then go <strong>listView</strong></li>
<li>If you have way more rows of information than a sensible person should display - then go <strong>tableView</strong></li>
<li>If you need your rows to be displayed in ways not supported by the <strong>listView</strong> - then go <strong>tableView</strong></li>
<li>If you want to change the layout on the fly - then go <strong>tableView</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Your app will likely have a mixture of both types of these views as one solution does not fit all.</p>
<p><em>Note for others who read this <strong>listView</strong> is ONLY available from Ti SDK 3.1 or higher, not currently available out of beta at the time of writing this answer.</em></p>
<p>It sounds like you still need to use <strong>tableView</strong> for your specific need mentioned above.</p>

										<p><p>Thank you!  However aside from the nesting situation, I have my list view very closely mirroring a highly modified tableview.  The reason I made the switch is becasue of the promise of increased performance.  WIll see if it is better as I hope to abandon tableviews performance, and the lack of nesting can be overcome with some positioning tricks :)</p>
