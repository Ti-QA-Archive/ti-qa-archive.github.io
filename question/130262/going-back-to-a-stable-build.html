			<p>I currently get the nightly builds of Studio but would like to revert back to the latest stable build as I am about to work on a project for a customer.  When I try this via the install software option it won&#39;t install with the error message saying it is because I have a later version installed.  What&#39;s the easiest way for me to revert back to the stable build?</p>

							<div><p>Richard,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve always had to download a full studio build and install overtop (on OSX).  Sometimes reverting has seemed to work at first, only to have some weird error show up later on.  You aren&#39;t alone.</p>

							<div><p>Due to a limitation in Eclipse, you can only revert back to an update site which is still available. Thus, you can revert from a beta back to the current stable (assuming you installed that), but not from one stable back to the previous one. We&#39;ve updated the docs to reflect that. This may be possible to work around, and we are investigating possibilities.</p>
