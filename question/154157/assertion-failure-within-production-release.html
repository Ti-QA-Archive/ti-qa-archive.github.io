			<p>Hi all-</p>
<p>I am seeing a very strange behavior, only within an Enterprise release of our app.  I have tested the app in development within the simulator (iPad&#x2F;iPhone), and on a physical device with no issue.  It seems that once I have archived the app and pushed the ipa to a device though, the app functions properly until I bring a modal form up which contains a TableView.  The TableView and contents do not render (the Navigation Bar and other elements within the window do however), and when looking at the console from XCode, all I see in terms of errors is the following:</p>
<p>Assertion failure in -[UITableView _endCellAnimationsWithContext:], &#x2F;SourceCache&#x2F;UIKit&#x2F;UIKit-2380.17&#x2F;UITableView.m:1070</p>
<p>It is literally just this one piece of the app and one TableView that does not render, only in my archived release.  Has anybody experienced an issue where all is well until you archive a release for production and you receive something such as the above?  This is targetted as a Universal deployment, iOS 5.0 and above.</p>
<p>Talk soon<br>Chris</p>

							<p>I had this in my last app and took me few days to figure out what was going on.</p>
<p>My table had few sections and I was changing those sections between showing the window (think some sort of accordion) and at some point I had a row referenced in other place that didn&#39;t belong to the current &quot;opened&quot; section so the section had somehow 1 row while I was trying to display none.</p>
<p>It&#39;s hard to explain, the idea is to be very careful what you do with the sections and rows of the table between subsequent <strong>table.data= [my_data]</strong> and open&#x2F;close of the window that has that table.</p>

										<p><p>So, right before you answered, I saw something on Google about others (non-Appcelerator developers) who had similar issues) with deleteRows.  I actually in my Alloy controller was doing a deleteRow prior to my render (for a row that I added&#x2F;removed on user demand).  I commented the deleteRow call out and all is fine again. :(  The weird part is that when under test, this never surfaced on the physical device.</p>

										<p><p>We almost launched the app without knowing about, then my girlfriend insisted in testing the app just like a normal user would do it, and the one day testing turned into almost a week of hair-pulling because of this bug and some other UX improvements :)</p>
