			<h1>Genymotion - Virtual Box keeps openning new window.</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hey guys, recently I did change Genymotion option in Titanium Preferences about Virtual Box path. . . then I remove the path &amp; save all the setting.<br>But since the action, Virtual Box keep on opening new window of Virtual Box automatically. I don&#39;t really know the trigger. Even if I delete Titanium, Virtual Box, Genymotion and re-install them all the problem still exists.<br>I try to config the setting but it&#39;s not there anymore and I don&#39;t know what really trigger the action of Virtual Box opening all the time from the time I started to open TItanium Studio.<br>Hope you guys used to have the same problem &amp; have had a solution for it.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your attention and help.</p>

							<p>In your main user directory, there is a .Genymobile directory if your uninstalling Genymotion, you also need to delete this directory.</p>
<p>This is of course assuming your on a mac.</p>

										<p><p>I tried using clean up tool as uninstaller and re-install but the problem still exists.<br>Everytime I try to run my application on emulator on genymotion, Virtual Box pop new window &amp; I have to close the window or the run process will never start to run :O<br>I think this is some configuration in Preferences that I made the day before, but I did reinstall Titanium Studio.<br>Is there any way to just reset all setting of Titanium Studio, Trevor?<br>It doesn&#39;t really bother me much, but you know, it&#39;s annoying to have such window keep on popping up, one by one :\</p>
