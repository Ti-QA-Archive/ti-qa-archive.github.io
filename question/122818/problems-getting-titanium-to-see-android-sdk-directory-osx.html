			<h1>Problems getting Titanium to see Android SDK Directory (OSX)</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Just getting started with Titanium, and I am having some problems getting it to recognize the Android SDK directory.</p>
<p>I have installed the Android SDK into &#x2F;users&#x2F;USERNAME&#x2F;Android_SDK.</p>
<p>I have opened the SDK Manager and downloaded&#x2F;installed the SDK Tools, the SDK Platform-tools, and the following Platforms: 3.2 (API 13), 2.2 (API 8), and 1.6 (API 4).</p>
<p>I have created the symbolic link to adb as described in the &quot;getting started&quot; guide.  (And re-created it after installing new platforms.)</p>
<p>I have confirmed that I have java and javac versions 1.6.</p>
<p>However, every time I go into the preferences to point Titanium at the Android SDK directory, it tells me &quot;Could not locate the Android SDK at the given path.&quot;</p>
<p>Any ideas?  Am I missing a step somewhere?</p>

										<p><p>In answer to question 1 – yes, it has add-ons, docs, platform-tools, platforms, temp and tools directories.  (I did not download or install the samples.)</p>
<p>Q2 – no, apparently not.  Even though I can see them in the directory, I get the error &quot;-bash: android: command not found&quot;.  (Or whichever one I try to run.)</p>
<p>Q3 – nope, can&#39;t do that either, although the error it is giving me is &quot;Unrecognized option : -V&quot;.  I can run &#39;java -version&#39; and &#39;javac -version&#39; from a console.</p>

										<p><p>Q2 - after we get this running for you, you will want to create some alias&#39; to make life simpler later one. for now, can you run .&#x2F;android or .&#x2F;adb from their appropriate directories? testing to make sure that the ADK runs on its own outside of TiStudio. (i am assuming TiStudio and not TiDev)</p>
<p>Q3 - in my haste, probably typed those commands wrong.</p>

										<p><p>Yep, using TiStudio.  And also, yes, adding the &#39;.&#x2F;&#39; worked… android runs, adb doesn&#39;t exactly <em>run</em>, but it does give me a long list of options (as opposed to saying command not found).</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Stephen, I&#39;m not sure how I missed that thread.  (I did do some searching around the Q&amp;A before I posted my question, seems like I should have been able to find that.)</p>
<p>Anyway, for those just tuning in – there are a few proposed solutions in the thread Stephen linked above.  The one that worked for me was making sure that Android Platform 2.1 API 7 was installed.  After I added that API, TiStudio accepted the path to my ANdroid SDK as valid.</p>

										<p><p>Glad it worked.  In this Q&amp;A format, I&#39;m the last one to scream &quot;have you used the search!!!!&quot;  When the results from a year back come up before the one 30 minutes ago, its usefulness is questionable.</p>
