			<p>I recently had to renew my apple developer certificate. I downloaded all the appropriate certificates, updated my keychain, etc. But now I can not get a build to device or package for my app (in the app store for a year now). Has anyone dealt with a similar problem? If so, what was the problem? The app currently throws a build fail. Everything is fine in xcode organizer. And I can add the app to my phone after the build from organizer. I&#39;ve tried completely removing and re-installing appcelerator.</p>

							<p>Do you use regular Titanium Developer or Studio? I can&#39;t build for distribution from Studio. I&#39;m getting a code sign error:</p>
<p>[ERROR] [BEROR]Code Sign error: The identity &#39;iPhone Developer&#39; doesn&#39;t match any identity in any profile</p>
<p>Shouldn&#39;t it look for iPhone Distribution, not Developer? And opening the project in xCode I have both those identities so it seems to be a bug in Studio. I&#39;m using xCode 4, Titanium SDK 1.7, and the latest Studio updates.</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to try doing it from Developer and see if there&#39;s any difference.  </p>

							<p>I had to delete all of my profiles locally, then on Apple&#39;s developer site, go to the &#39;modify&#39; section of your Profile, and choose your certificate&#x2F;key again and save and redownload.</p>

							<p>I can run the app in the simulator, install to device but cannot package the app. Codesign error. &quot;Application failed codesign verification. The signature was invalid, or it was not signed with an Apple submission certificate.&quot;</p>
<p>Have tried for days to get this working. Delete and recreate new certs, new profiles, new project, clear build folder… Cleared Keychain and installed new certs and keys. Same error!</p>
<p>This is making us nuts! </p>

							<p>Ok, found one solution to the codesign error we were getting after we renewed our developer certificate. </p>
<p>The packaging error we would get was &quot;Application failed codesign verification. The signature was invalid, or it was not signed with an Apple submission certificate.&quot;</p>
<p>After days of headaches, 93 new certs and profiles, almost no hair on my head left, we yet again recreated the dev and dist csr&#39;s in Keychain using the Certificate Assistant. But during this process, we switched ON the option for &quot;Let me specify key pair information&quot;. Something we completely forgot to do. This worked!! :)</p>
<p>This finally allowed us to install to device and package the app successfully. The app has passed validation via xcode and hopefully gets approved without any signing issues.</p>
