			<h1>Android UrbanAirship module 1.3 not usable?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Has anyone been able to make the Android version of the Urban Airship module actually work?</p>
<p>The documentation doesn&#39;t explain what you&#39;re supposed to do. It tells you to set TRANSPORT and C2DM_SENDER, but doesn&#39;t tell you how or where. The example app.js doesn&#39;t have anything like that anywhere. It&#39;s just incredibly unhelpful in every way. Of course the iOS version is easy to setup and works fine.</p>
<p>I hate to sound noobish about this, because I&#39;m anything but, but surely there has to be a working example of using this thing for Android that can be posted. What actually came with the 1.3 module is insufficient. Or even a prior version- at this point I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s the latest module or an older one. I have to get push notification working on both platforms in our app and move on to something else.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

							<div><p>So I&#39;ve tinkered this up to a point where the module loads and starts (takes off), then .. nothing happens. Looking at the log in DDMS which is connected to a Xoom tablet, an APID is never registered. This seems to be the last problem I have before getting push notification to work. Some official guidance would be greatly appreciated (considering how much these Indie licenses cost, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too much to ask).</p>
