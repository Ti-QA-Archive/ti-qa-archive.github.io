							<p>Simply use the <code>openURL</code> function withe the <strong>sms:</strong> prefix.</p>
<p>####Like so:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">Titanium.<span class="hljs-keyword">Platform</span>.openURL(<span class="hljs-string">'sms:'</span> + phone_number);
</code></pre><p>This will open the message dialog window with the phone number already pre filled with the phone number.</p>
<p>Note that this will only work using <strong>physical devices</strong> (makes sense when you think of it). this will not work on an emulator.</p>

										<p><p>If you are sending an SMS, this will be done through <strong>Phone Carrier</strong>. You don have to do anything on the server side if you want a mobile device to just send an SMS.</p>
<p>Or else I am missing something from what you are trying to accomplish.</p>

										<p><p>Well if you want to send SMS from a server, you will need to connect to a service that will send those SMS for you. Keep in mind though, that it will most of those service providers <strong>charge</strong> for sending SMS. </p>
<p>simply said, someone has to absorb the cost, it can either be you or the users. But there is no such thing as free SMS sending. As for the Viber example you provided, they actually pay for those SMS in exchange for users to use their service.</p>
