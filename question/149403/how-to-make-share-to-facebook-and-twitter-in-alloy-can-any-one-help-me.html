							<div><p>Mahmoud, have you noticed that no one has been helping you when you write these 1 sentence questions with no apparent effort put in on your end? A number of community developers stated that they would be happy to help with many of your other unanswered questions as long as you shared what you had done so far and had given them information regarding your environment. Once you do that, you&#39;ll find the Q&amp;A a lot more useful and your questions will likely stop getting down-voted.</p>

							<p>Mahmoud, As Tony stated, please provide some additional context when posting your questions here. The community is here to help, but they need some more information and effort on your side before they are able to jump in. Please adhere to these guidelines or we&#39;ll need to start moderating your posts accordingly.</p>
