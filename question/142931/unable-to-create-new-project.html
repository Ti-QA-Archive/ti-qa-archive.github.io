			<p>Titanium Studio, build: 2.1.2.201208301612<br>(c) Copyright 2012 by Appcelerator, Inc.  All rights reserved.</p>
<p>Build: jenkins-titanium-rcp-master-232 (origin&#x2F;master)<br>Date: 30 August 2012, 16:14:46</p>
<p>I am having two issues with Titanium studio. My first problem is I am unable to create new project. I have uninstalled and reinstalled a few times. I have tried installing it in a different directory as well as creating a new workspace folder. If anyone can help me I would be greatly appreciated. I was excited to use Titanium but cannot even get it working to use it. </p>
<p>My second problem is I loaded the Todo list and Kitchen Sink sample projects and I cannot get them to compile. I have made sure I have all the SDK&#39;s installed on my machine as well as all android versions. It doesn&#39;t ever open the emulator.</p>
