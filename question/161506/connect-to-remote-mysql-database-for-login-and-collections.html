			<h1>Connect to remote MySQL database for login and collections</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I have a MySQL database set up which is managed by an admin website. The Alloy app I&#39;m developing requires that the user be able to log in using credentials stored in the database and then look through database records which I&#39;m assuming should be compiled into a collection. How might I go about this?</p>
<p>I&#39;m using the test login app on Appcelerator&#39;s GitHub repo as a reference for the login, but I have no idea how to integrate it with a remote database.</p>
<p>And is a collection the best way to go about fetching data from a database to display in the app? The data would be read only and the user would only be able to submit new data, not update existing data.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not expecting a full walkthough, I know it&#39;s not exactly a quick &quot;copy paste a few lines&quot; job, but any references to tutorials or working examples would be great. I haven&#39;t been able to find anything myself, anything that I could make sense of at least.</p>

							<p>Unless you are pulling the entire database down to the client (which IS an option), the MySQL server&#39;s data needs to be exposed through an API that will allow you to authenticate, then run querys against the data.</p>

										<p><p>Well, that is kind of obvious. I was trying to figure out how to actually do that.</p>

										<p><p>What else did you expect? You simply said you had a MySQL database. Well, that has no REST API built into it. You have a MS IIS server sitting there? PHP? NodeJS?</p>

										<p><p>I am with Stephen on this; API is the way to go.  Whilst you said in your somewhat unhelpful comment that his answer was obvious but your question seems to tell me the opposite.</p>
<p>You need to understand that ALL connections with a remote system will be via APIs you create there are no pre-existing ones, you create them for your needs.</p>
<p>An API is no more complicated that calling a server side script file using httpClient calls with any parameters you wish to pass to either update or store data or to provide parameters to determine what data to return.</p>
<p>Most of the work will be on the server side on whatever language you choose to use or are required to use due to any system restrictions.  So if you can create a simple web page that connects to your local database and output that data in a structured way in JSON (ideally), XML (if you fancy taking longer doing everything [not a fan]) or your own format (pointless comlicated) to a plain text page - then you have your API.  httpclient calls that page and shows that information using whatever logic your app needs display it.</p>
<p>Login is the only complicated part for newbies to the process as you really need to store an authentication token on your server for the duration of the connection to say &quot;this person can interact&quot;.  If you have ever done this on a normal web project - then you are sorted - simply do not output and HTML and you are good.</p>
<p>There is no simple &quot;guide to get started in 5 minutes&quot; and there are so many factors are in your control and specific to your project, plus so many scripting languages, storage types including databases other more, what libraries the connections require.  All of this is unrelated to any code in your app</p>
<p>Your next stage is - play with your web server and get it to return something from the database.  Then using httpclient from your app call that webserver page and access any part of the data - once you have simply decide how to display it.</p>
<p>80% of your needs are not part of the app - as the simply calls APIs with or without small chunks of data.  Your starting point is web server side scripting.</p>

										<p><p>What I meant by saying it&#39;s obvious is that I understand the concept of interacting with the database via an API, in my case I&#39;m handling all my server side operations with CodeIgniter, but I had no idea what to put in the app, even if it is only 20% of the required code.</p>
<p>I did manage to rustle up <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.tutsplus.com&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;appcelerator&#x2F;titanium-user-authentication&#x2F;">this article</a> that demonstrates a simple HTTP client request, and I&#39;ve managed to tweak that to provide a foundation for what I need. I&#39;m just wondering however if there&#39;s a more up to date way of doing it. Is there a &quot;cleaner&quot; equivalent I can use from Alloy?</p>

										<p><p>Nope the basics of the api call using httpClient are the same with or without Alloy.  Alloy is a framework that makes creating apps for Titanium faster and more manageable (and lots of other reasons).  But the raw methods are the exact same.  The httpClient object has stayed basically the same sinde the 1.x Titanium branch as it has a job to do that needs no improvements.</p>
<p>I am not trying to sound obtuse - it is simply that the documentation code examples and <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#!&#x2F;guide&#x2F;HTTPClient_and_the_Request_Lifecycle">guide</a> gives you everything you need to understand httpClient and the various options.  The rest is down to your specific needs.</p>
