			<p>So I have a folder in app&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;web and in there, I want to load index.html. </p>
<p>So, My code in my app.js is <code>var appwebview = Titanium.UI.WebView({
    url:&amp;#39;Resources&amp;#x2F;web&amp;#x2F;streaming.html&amp;#39;
});
win1.add(appwebview);</code></p>
<p>When the app loads, I get an error that says <code>Uncaught Type Error - cannot read property &amp;#39;replace&amp;#39; of undifined at index.html (line 8592)</code></p>
<p>I only have like 20 lines of stuff in my index.html so IDK why titanium is pulling this out of their butt… Anyways, ideas? Thanks</p>

							<p>Hi</p>
<p>I am always surprised when people come here and decide to blame (and in your case insult) the tools they use - then ask for assistance.  &quot;…why titanium is pulling this out of their butt…&quot;</p>
<p>In your case you have misread the error message as it does not say what you think it does.  It does not suggest line 8592 is in your code but in the code that is processing your code.  This sort of error message where it needs to refer to itself is uncommon - mostly because this sort of error is also uncommon.  It is rare that this sort of value is ever provided as people at this level of capability have normally read the docs for the example and would then not have made such a strange leap towards providing a value that is simply bad.</p>
<p>Your question provides this as the location to your source file;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">app<span class="hljs-regexp">/Resources/</span>web<span class="hljs-regexp">/streaming.html</span>
</code></pre><p>To avoid confusion in the future it might be best to adopt this format when providing path details.  Yours is fine but could be confused for the top level folder <em>app</em> used in an app benefiting from the Alloy framework.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">{appname}<span class="hljs-regexp">/Resources/</span>web<span class="hljs-regexp">/streaming.html</span>
</code></pre><p>Given your app root runs from;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">{appname}<span class="hljs-regexp">/Resources/</span>
</code></pre><p>As do your files; so you exclude any references below that point as they are already known to Titanium.  You only provide the details relevant to those things you have provided.</p>
<p>So as has been stated in the question comment the path you use should be;</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-string">url:</span> <span class="hljs-string">'/web/streaming.html'</span>
</code></pre><p>All questions welcomed - but consider holding off on the blame and insults until you have determined something is wrong and only then if once telling Appcelerator via the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jira.appcelerator.org&#x2F;">jira ticketing system</a>. they do not fix it.  Anything up until this point it is; not a bug, if it is a bug it is not a known one and then only if it becomes an ignored bug.</p>
