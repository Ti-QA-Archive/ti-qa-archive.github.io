			<p>Has anyone been able to get the lat and long from the &#39;longpress&#39; on the mapview. in debug mode I get the x,y of the map. I am basically trying to achieve the drop pin process.</p>
<p><code>mapView.addEventListener(&amp;#39;longpress&amp;#39;, function(e) {
        Ti.API.info(e);
    });</code></p>

							<p>Looking at the API (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com&#x2F;titanium&#x2F;2.1&#x2F;index.html#!&#x2F;api&#x2F;Titanium.Map.View">Ti.Map.View</a>) I don&#39;t see that longpress is listed as an event.  While it may fire, it isn&#39;t listed as passing mapview specific events.</p>

										<p><p>It strange, they said they would implement the longpress into the 1.8 September release. I guess its still a bug. How in the world could you create a drop pin in the mapview? Also FYI people this isn&#39;t int the KitchenSink.</p>

<p>It has been implemented for a number of other object, just not for that one.</p>
<p><code>Also FYI people this isn&amp;#39;t int the KitchenSink.</code></p>
<p>I&#39;m confused by this statement in this context.</p>

										<p><p>What confusing about it? I am saying an example of mapview longpress events are not in the KitchenSink example. What object if any has longress implemented for? I heard or seen any?</p>

										<p><p>I am NOT &#39;people&#39; I am a singular person trying to help you, and changing the context in a conversation is, in my opinion, ignorant and rude.  Instead of talking to me, you now want to &#39;shout to the world&#39; that its not in the Kitchen Sink. That is why I was confused by your statement to the world in general as &#39;people&#39; as I  mistakenly thought you and I were in a conversation.</p>
<p>I mention that longpress has been implemented in some areas, and you in turn question that knowledge (<em>What object if any has longress implemented for? I heard or seen any?</em>). I&#39;m sorry you haven&#39;t actually read the documentation located at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.appcelerator.com">docs.appcelerator.com</a> to see that it works on Buttons, ButtonBars, Dashboards, ImageViews, Labels, ProgressBars, ScrollableViews, ScrollViews, Sliders, Switches, TableViews, TabGroups, TextAreas, TextFields, WebViews, and Windows. So it would appear there are a LOT of places you didn&#39;t see it.</p>
