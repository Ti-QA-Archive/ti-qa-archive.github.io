<p>help comes to those that follow the rules:</p>
<p>Missing from your question are a number of important pieces of information. I suggest you take a look at the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.appcelerator.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;guides&#x2F;Using+Questions+and+Answers">Using Questions and Answers</a> article, specifically the Q&amp;A Question Checklist.  The missing information is critical to reproducing problems in a test environment and often indicates other factors that cause the undesirable outcome you are experiencing.</p>

<p>There are so many people who ask questions where they don&#39;t give the information required for us to help resolve their issues.</p>
<p>The people on this forum give their time and knowledge freely and openly.</p>
<p>I think the question you asked was very specific, not general. Background pause and resume are issues which require specific coding methods. IF your doing it wrong then you will get issues like you are.</p>
<p>To be able to help you resolve this, we would need to know a lot more info including the code your using for the pause and resume events.</p>
<p>If you asking a general question, then please specify that this is a general discussion and you would like help in the application architecture of your required issue etc.</p>
<p>Hope this helps, we don&#39;t want to drive people away from asking questions in the forum, but we also don&#39;t want people who expect a solution which takes extensive time to create for them, when they don&#39;t put the time in to provide the required information. (not the case here but there are examples all over this Q &amp; A)</p>
<p>T.</p>
