			<h1>Does it require ios sdk on windows?</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, im learning basic requirements of developing mobile apps. I have windows on my laptop and i want to develope mobile app for ipad. Is it possible with titanium?</p>
<p>I have ipad but i dont have mac. </p>
<p>Please explain in detail because i could not figure out that in documentation.</p>
<p>If it is possible to write code and test on windows platform without the ios sdk installed on windows platform. I know that ios sdk may be requirement for creating native build. But my point is that, i want to at least write code without ios sdk installed. After writing code i will ask my friend to make build for me because he has mac computer.  </p>
<p>I hope you understand what i need to know. I want to write app and test on windows platform without the ios sdk installed. I wan to develope only  for ipad at this time. And when there will be time to make installer for ipad i will send my code to my friend who will make the native build for me on his mac. </p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

							<p>Possible yes, but a terrible idea… Without being able to preview your app as you write it, you will end up passing the code backwards and forwards with your friend with a Mac. EVERY bug would require you to go through this routine…</p>

										<p><p>Whilst it seems like a plan - their are too many differences that you will not be able to test for including numerous views, navigation controllers, tool and button bars, popovers and much more.</p>
<p>If you want to develop for iOS you have to own a mac - just part of the deal.</p>

										<p><p>Hmm, many confusing points for me in your comments. How I will test my app is like this in my mind, I will write code and if possible to test in studio or in browser than good otherwise will send code to my friend for a build without testing. He will send me the installer of my app for iPad. Or may be he will upload the build some where on cloud and give me link that I will use to download on my iPad. Btw, I have done this before many times but in other mobile framework. I used phonegap cloud service the same way. I wrote code and uploaded code to phonegap build service. Phonegap then make build for iOS and I download the build on iPad. And when down load start iPad ask me if I want to install. Very simple process but a little time taking on my slow Internet speed. The charm is the ready to install build on iPad without even Xcode, iOS sdk, mac etc </p>
<p>I think you understand that I am talking about something possible. That is why I am asking this question in titanium forum. If titanium say that It cannot even write code on windows for iOS then I think it is lack of required feature in titanium because I am asking something that I am already doing.</p>
<p>I do not understand how I will not be able to check those things you wrote. Do you mean that I will not be able to test those things before making build or there will be no way at all to test anything?</p>

										<p><p>OK - I think you have become a bit confused.  In order to test an iPad App you need to use the iOS simulator.  As we have said - you CANNOT install the Mac software (xCode and the simulator) on a Windows PC.  This is not a short-coming of Titanium, it is Apple who require you to use a Mac to build iOS Apps.  PhoneGap is a different product where, as you say, you use their Cloud service to build and get a test IPA file back to install on your device. PhoneGap does NOT build native apps though - It just presents your html&#x2F;css&#x2F;js code inside a web view.  Titanium builds native apps</p>

										<p><p>I did not know those details but the installed app in iPad does not use safari. Icon is created for the installed app and browser is not launched. I am in the impression that phonegap is the most advanced tool that can build any project written in any framework that meet phonegap requirements. Anyway, I am not advertising phonegap.<br>Yes my idea is exactly like painting a picture with closed eyes. But at least I will be able to see what I have painted when finish the painting. Is that possible or impossible?</p>

										<p><p>No,with PhoneGap the installed App uses the inbuilt <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;ios&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;uikit&#x2F;reference&#x2F;UIWebView_Class&#x2F;Reference&#x2F;Reference.html">webview</a> that Apple provides for rendering HTML content so it &#39;looks&#39; like a &#39;real&#39; App. However you dont get to use iOS native controls, it can only render HTML designed content - That is the real difference between PhoneGap and Titanium.  Titanium == Native components in iOS and Android, PhoneGap is an HTML solution.</p>

										<p><p>I got your point now. I think that is the reason phonegap build was not able to use native API calls in my app and installed app was showing just a blank page. Thank you for explaining how phonegap cloud build is working.</p>
<p>So, now I can download titanium studio and start writing code for iOS?</p>

										<p><p>I understand there will be no way to test code before making build because iOS simulator is needed to test app before build. But that is ok, I can test app after making build based on your answer that it is technically possible.</p>

							<p>You cannot develop (or deploy) iOS apps on Windows with Titanium. You need XCode.</p>
<p>There could be a hack, but expect many issues trying to release anything at all to Apple.</p>

							<p>Yes, you are right and I understand I need mac. I am not alone without mac here because ppl here don&#39;t even know what is mac. Anyway</p>
<p>The important point for me is the option of writing code at least without mac. The 2 answers are completely different. one say Yes and other say No.</p>
<p>Please try to understand my point. I have to learn many things and all depend on the possibility of writing code (not deploying or building ) without mac on windows. I understand that it will be problem to check every change after installing app on iPad. I will do it happily if it is possible no matter how stupid is the idea. Thank you and please let me know possibilities in detail.</p>

										<p><p>Malcolm and I are saying it is technically feasible to write an App without <em>ever</em> testing it out yourself (this <em>is</em> a completely mad idea though - its like saying i&#39;m going to paint a picture with my eyes shut!!!). Kozzo, I think, has mis-understood your question</p>

										<p><p>Great, that means I can download the titanium studio and other required things and start writing my code. This is what you say?<br>It will be a great favour if you find the exact details and send me the link to read more. Asking because you already have the idea about what is my need and have development experience using titanium.</p>
