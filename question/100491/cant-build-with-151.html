							<div><p>Well I ended up reinstalling the iOS SDK and things seem to be working again…at least as far as building. I&#39;m still a little apprehensive b&#x2F;c I just upgraded Ti and iOS SDKs at work and now Ti can&#39;t find the iOS SDK when creating a new project even though it finds it just fine for existing projects. But I&#39;ll start a new thread for that…thankfully it looks like this thread is over with. knock on wood ;) Thanks again Hal for your attention to this.</p>

<p>Reinstall the <strong>Apple</strong> SDKs (not Ti SDKs) and clear the build directories again. Apple has made lots of internal and build changes over the last few months. There are times that going from one version to the next causes issues, which is why it sometimes needs to be reinstalled.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Delete everything in the <code>$PROJECT&amp;#x2F;build&amp;#x2F;iphone</code> directory and relaunch your app.  If this does not work, I will try to help you further.</p>

										<p><p>Thanks Hal, I&#39;ve done that multiple times. No dice. I&#39;m at work right now and my Ti probs are on my home machine. I&#39;m up to date on all SDKs with fresh installs but continue to get the same error no matter what i reinstall or delete. very odd.</p>

										<p><p>Sure thing. I just want to note that for me this wasn&#39;t an immediate solution and took lots of back and forth and multiple re-installs for both iOS and Ti SDKs…so keep at it if it doesn&#39;t work the first time, but hopefully it will!</p>

							<p>Thanks HalH, after pulling my hair out for ages your solution worked:</p>
<p>Delete everything in the $PROJECT&#x2F;build&#x2F;iphone directory and relaunch your app. </p>
<p>Good luck Kelly!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
