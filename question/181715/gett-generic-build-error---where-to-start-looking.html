			<p>I have been successfully working on and building a project in Titanium for some time.  I recently had to move to a new PC, thus reinstalled Titanium, used Titanium to install the Android SDKs, then tried to build this project.  I get the following message on the console (this is at Trace level) and no further output or information.  I have googled this error, but since the  message is so generic, it just points to hundreds of pages of completely different problems that result in this error message.  So short of just spending days randomly trying everything I find on google, where do I even begin to look for the specific problem I&#39;m having? Or how would you diagnose such an error?</p>

							<p>Hi Rusty, this error has been asked many times in different scenarios here, but there&#39;s no foolproof solution until yet.</p>
<p>However you could perform some few steps as i have already faced this issue many times in starting when i switched Titanium to different PC:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete everything related to Titanium, even in temp folder….do not keep any previous files</li>
<li>From titanium documentations, follow each step in sequence &amp; keep every software ready with you.</li>
<li>Follow each step &amp; have a fresh installation again.</li>
</ul>
<p>I know its quite tedious task, as it was for me, but before performing above steps try to change API level to 14 &amp; keep as many API levels installed in Android SDK.</p>
<p>This issue might be due to JAVA SDK version, so try to check that also..</p>
<p>Hope you get rid of this error without installing Ti again.<br>Good Luck!</p>

										<p><p>I actually did install everything completely from scratch, this is a brand new Windows 7 install on a new hard drive.  The only files that were copied were the files in the project folder itself.</p>

										<p><p>Since you actually copied project folder &amp; the real problem could be inside the project folder itself, due to some improper build file, just try to create another sample project &amp; then run it….</p>
<p>If the new project runs well then problem is surely in your project folder, otherwise you will have to trace things back</p>

										<p><p>I agree, the problem seems to be in the project itself.  What do you mean by &quot;trace things back&quot;? The project won&#39;t build at all, and just spits out this generic message.  Is there anywhere I can look for more information on what Titanium is choking on beyond this generic error message?</p>

										<p><p>@Rusty, by &#39;trace things back&#39;, i meant that try to create a sample project &amp; replace the assets,views,controllers,models &amp; modules files…..i mean do not put any file from previous project which is directly&#x2F;indirectly related to the build configurations.</p>
<p>I hope it helps you..<br>Good Luck!</p>
