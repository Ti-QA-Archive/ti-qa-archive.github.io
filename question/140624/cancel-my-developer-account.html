			<h1>Cancel my Developer Account</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I been trying to cancel my developer account without any luck. I don&#39;t develop any more thus I don&#39;t wish to continue this account. I have contacted customer services&#x2F;subscription folks but no joy. Can someone help here. </p>
<p>I remember reading in TOS they said there will be a link which will allow me to cancel my account on my own. Where is that link?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>I don&#39;t recall seeing a link to delete your account. Are you looking to consolidate your accounts or do you want to permanently destroy all your data?</p>

							<p>Thank you for your reply. I like to permanently delete my account as I don&#39;t currently develop app any more. I don&#39;t see any reason keeping this account open. Any help resolving this matter will be very much appreciated. </p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

										<p><p>It doesn&#39;t really hurt anything to just leave the account open.</p>
<p>What we can do is mark your account inactive. That will stop system emails and prevent you from logging in. It will also prevent you from signing up for a new account with the same email address.</p>
<p>We can&#39;t easily permanently delete your account since there is data associated with your account such as <em>this</em> Q&amp;A question.</p>
