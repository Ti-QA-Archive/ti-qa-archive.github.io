			<h1>Dynamically created Map Annotations not showing</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I am hopping someone can help me with this.  I am creating annotations dynamically from an xml feed.  The feed is working correctly and I am getting information, but the annotations that I am creating are not showing.</p>
<p>Any guidance will be helpful.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>&lt;script src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;749880.js&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;script&gt;</p>

							<div><p>Can you add any annotations to your map view at all, at any stage?  On initialization (in the annotations array), or after, outside the callback?  Also, you shouldn&#39;t have to specify an empty array of annotations on create.</p>

							<div><p>Kevin,</p>
<p>I did try to convert that earlier and got no where.  Plus, was that earlier comment a dig?</p>

							<div><p>it was not intended to be a dig - by &#39;we&#39; I meant Titanium, which should be smart enough to understand that a longitude arg should be converted to a number.  As the developer, you shouldn&#39;t have to do that - plus, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re very smart yourself ;)</p>
<p>If you can add an annotation successfully outside your onload callback, I would be interested to see your code for doing that.</p>

<p>I edited the gist now with the annotation that I added.</p>

							<div><p>add animate:true, and title:&quot;something&#39; - all the same args you used before.  Also, I would check if any of the fields from your XML response are null or an empty string.  That might cause Titanium to barf also.</p>

							<div><p>Fired up an old example app to check <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kwhinnery&#x2F;OilTracker&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;tracker.js#L98">adding annotations to a map view from a remote service</a>.  This seems to work with 1.5.1, so I&#39;m wondering what&#39;s going on with your data.  If you would like to mail the endpoint for your call to community@appcelerator.com I can test against your live data.</p>
