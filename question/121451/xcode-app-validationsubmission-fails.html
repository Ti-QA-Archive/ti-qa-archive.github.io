			<h1>Xcode: app validation(submission) fails</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi everybody,<br>I&#39;m trying to distribute an app for iPad (iOS SDK 1.4!?). I have created the profile in iTunes Connect and I did the packaging through Titanium. When it opens Xcode I opened organizer and I tried to validate my app. </p>
<p>After I entered my info (username and password for iTunes Connect) Xcode gave me the following error:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">No suitable <span class="hljs-type">application</span> records were found.

Please make sure <span class="hljs-keyword">that</span> you have <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span> up a <span class="hljs-type">record</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> this <span class="hljs-type">application</span> <span class="hljs-function_start"><span class="hljs-keyword">on</span></span> iTunes Connect.
</code></pre><p>Note: This is the only app I have so one provisioning profile (for distribution) one app id (at all).</p>
<p>Please help!<br>Thanks</p>

							<p>Hi Ani,</p>
<p>You need to sign into iTunes connect and create application and then ready it for binary submission.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Organzier will not find it when it goes to Validate.</p>

										<p><p>I&#39;m sorry but I wasn&#39;t clear. When I said I have created the profile I meant I created the app in iTunes Connect and both APPID and provisioning profile for distribution match the ones of the app.</p>
<p>Thanks for such a quick reply</p>

										<p><p>Make sure the status of your application in iTunes is &quot;Ready for Binary Submission&quot;.  In other words, manage your application and then click the Ready for Upload.  That should allow Organizer to find your app in iTunes Connect.</p>

										<p><p>Go to Manage Your Application and select the version that you want to upload.  View the Version Details and then click the Ready to Upload Binary.  Once you do that, your status should change to &quot;Waiting for Upload&quot;.  </p>
<p>It is only at this point that you can Validate and Submit your app  through Organizer.</p>
