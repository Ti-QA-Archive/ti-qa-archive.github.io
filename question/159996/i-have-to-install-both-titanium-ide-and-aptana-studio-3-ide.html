										<p><p>The download above is so you can develop using Titanium - once installed you can then develop for; Android, iOS, Tizen, Blackberry and Mobile Web - provided you have the minimum requirements for each platform.</p>
<p>Basically speaking - if you are running on OSX (Mac) then you can develop for all, otherwise you can develop for all but iOS in most cases.</p>

										<p><p>According to the minimum requirements you must be on Mountain Lion minimum on a Mac, this is partly because of xcode requirements and partly because of supporting software requirements.</p>

</ul>
<p>Additionally you will find;</p>
<ul>
<li>Deploying for iOS 7.0 requires Xcode 5.0, and Mac OS X 10.8.4 and later. </li>
</ul>
<p>You will need a newer version of OSX to develop properly.  Remember that 10.7 is two versions behind the current version available.</p>

										<p><p>If you wish to attempt coding for iOS6 and NOT iOS7 then;</p>
<ul>
<li>xcode 4.3</li>
<li>Titanium SDK 3.1.1 or 3.1.2 - you will NOT be able to go higher</li>
</ul>
<p>This may not work but try the only OSX Titanium download there is from the link already provided.  You will have problems though as your operating system is now deemed out of date for development needs and even if you do manage to get everything installed it is likely that in less than a year you will no longer be able to submit apps that do not support iOS7.</p>

										<p><p>The Titanium download includes a customised version of Aptana Studio (called Titaium Studio). It it optimised for mobile app development but contains a HTML editor also (for web development). The link Malcolm provided is all you need to get started</p>
