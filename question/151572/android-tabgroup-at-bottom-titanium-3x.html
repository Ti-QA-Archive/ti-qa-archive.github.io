							<p>Hi</p>
<p>Android tabs go on the bottom of iOS and on the top of Android - at least the do according to the respective style guides.</p>
<p>Android has not shown much love for tabs and has actually moved away from them towards the <strong>ActionBar</strong>.  This should be the native UI element of choice for Android apps (at least 3.0 or higher ones).</p>
<p>It is to be expected that different platforms have different approaches and even different versions of those platforms (think 2.x and 3.x and higher for Android).</p>
<p>Older apps on Android tried to mimic the iOS way of thinking, it is more common now to adhere and respect the platform the app is on.</p>

										<p><p>So, you saying that i cannot put TABS at the bottom in Titanium 3.x, this is a little awkward since i need to develop an app to have the same look and feel on both platforms. Is there a work around for this?</p>

										<p><p>Not saying you cannot, I do not know why you are unable to - you have not provided any code to check to be that specific and it &quot;may&quot; be something related to the new ActionBar support over-riding the tabBar choices, it &quot;may&quot; be something to do with your minimum SDK version settings for Android in the <strong>tiapp.xml</strong>.</p>
<p>What I am saying is that evolving to embrace what has happened in the industry is a good thing and can only help you develop the app going forwards.  Remember things change whether we want them too or not, sometimes we have to adapt.</p>

										<p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>if you do all custom views, you will be able to do the same UI in both platforms. But you won&#39;t have the functionality of a tabbar or similar, you will need to emulate it. </p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mauro</p>
