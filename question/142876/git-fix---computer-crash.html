			<p>Hi Guys</p>
<p>I was running the iPhone simulator for SDK 6.0 when the power went off.<br>Now my project does not have version control, seems that it needs some fix for this project.</p>
<p>I have checked other projects in the studio, and they all work.</p>
<p>Titanium Studio, build: 2.1.2.201208301612</p>
<p>Using git version control system on mac.</p>
<p>Mac OS X Version: 10.8.2</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>I just had a problem where git did not work form the Ti UI when it had been previously working. Suddenly (though no power problems here…), there were unstaged changes that did not show up in the Project Explorer or the Commit dialog. I went into Preferences &gt; Team &gt; Git and the executable path was missing. I found the git executable path, applied it, restarted Ti Studio, and it worked; commit-able changes showed up. Don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the same &quot;project does not have version control&quot; problem you describe. I recently updated my Mac to 10.8.2.</p>

										<p><p>I had same issue when I converted over to Mountain Lion.</p>
<p>The issue actually was that git crashed in a locked state, and it couldn&#39;t write to git anymore.</p>
<p>So I had to trash the project, and recreate the project, and copy the files back.</p>
<p>Then init git for the new project, and all was good.</p>
