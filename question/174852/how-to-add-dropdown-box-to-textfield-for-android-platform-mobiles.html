							<p>Hi</p>
<p>There are a few things here and I think I understand what you require;</p>
<ul>
<li>Android does not support left or right buttons as part of the TextField itself, iOS does.  Not a problem, place a button to the right of the text field - it does the same thing.</li>
<li>The concept of a drop down box from a TextField does NOT have a direct UI equivalent in mobile UI.  Web pages and desktop application do - mobile does not.  Depending on the size of the list you use one of two things<ul>
<li>Small lists; OptionDialog</li>
<li>Long Lists; modal window with a TableView containing options - choose one and close the modal window.  Although on Android is acceptable to use the OptionDialog for long lists as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can still type in the TextField, but a user pressing the button to the right of the TextField will be presented with the fixed choices.  </li>
<li>If you ONLY want a fixed choice, use a Label not a TextField - everything else stays the same as advice above.</li>
</ul>

										<p><p>You can use the picker - but you cannot edit the value, the same is true of a table list or an option dialog.  This is not the same as web pages or desktop applications.</p>
<p>You CAN make something yourself to give them impression of a textfield with a drop down option - but you have to do a reasonable amount of work to achieve it.</p>
<p>You could place a table below the textfield and reduce the rows displayed as you type in as the matching entries are reduced.  This would then give the impression of a true combo box.</p>
<p>The choices are yours.  I gave you the most common method as you asked for.</p>

										<p><p>Quick tip; next time - please do not create a new answer when your contribution is actually a comment - it confuses things in the future when trying to work out relevance, simply add a comment to the answer it is related to, or if the additional information is a follow up to the question or general information then add it as a comment to your own question at the top.  You are NOT being told off.</p>
