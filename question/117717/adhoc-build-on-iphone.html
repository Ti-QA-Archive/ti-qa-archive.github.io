			<h1>adhoc build on iphone</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>To do an adhoc build on iPhone to I need to be part of the developer program ($99)?  Also does anyone have an up to date set of instructions, I see lots of posts and things on it but many seem quite old and I&#39;m not sure what applies now.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

							<p>To be able to deploy on device you need to be part of this program.<br>There is a codesigning sequence when the app it&#39;s built that works only if you have a valid developer&#x2F;distribution certificate.</p>
<p>Sorry :) </p>

							<p>TestFlight won&#39;t keep from having to sign up for the $99 per year dev program, or going through the complications of getting an initial build ready.</p>
<p>What it does a great job with is helping you share your build with devices that you don&#39;t synch to the machine you&#39;re developing with, whether they be your own or your friends.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been using TestFlight for sharing an iPhone build with tester friends (who are non-technical) as well as for an iPad project at work that I&#39;m using my home iPad to test with (for now).</p>
<p>It&#39;s a really well designed service that I recommend highly for any iOS development.</p>
