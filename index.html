    <h2>What is the Purpose?</h2>
    <p>This site contains the original questions asked by the community in the hopes of getting help and support.  Each question also has the answers and comments provided by way of assistance.</p>
    
    <h2>Useful Information</h2>
    <p>Some of the content you will find is just as suitable today as it was when it was asked and answered.  Some content may be a little out of date but will start you on the right footing.</p>
    
    <h3>Less Useful Information</h3>
    <p>However some content is simply too old and no longer suitable, keep that in mind when reviewing.  We believe it important to give you the chance to review such a wealth of information and use your own judgement.  You may find some content that contains words and phrases that good community members should never have written.  Thankfully there is very little of that; but as we do not believe in burning of books we also have left everything as it was.</p>

    <h2>What is Next?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Search
            <p>We will be submitting the content to the search engines.  So using Google.com (as one example) would be the place to start.</p>
        </li>
        <li>New Content
            <p>There are no plans to allow new questions, answers or comments.  This is a read-ony source of information.</p>
        </li>
